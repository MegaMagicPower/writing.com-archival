Its one of the bug pokemon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh excitedly got out a pokeball and caught it as Misty continued to freak out over it.

And if I\u2019m so dumb why are you following me?!\u201d Ash said equally frustrated. Misty growled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis just happens to be the fastest way to Pewter City! I\u2019m not following you- and what good is it if I don\u2019t get my bike replaced soon?!\u201d Misty said angrily as Ash huffed and began walking away. Fuming, she grabbed her pokeball and threw at Ash\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAH-?!\u201d Ash stumbled at the hit and then was knocked to the ground as Goldeen came out of the ball and landed squarely on his head. Misty stomped over to him while he was stunned, Pikachu watching her curiously as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost yelled at him while he was lying down groaning- but a flash of white caught her eye. She smirked, before reaching down for the waistband poking out of the boy\u2019s jeans. As she grasped it, she noticed Ash didn\u2019t really notice with Goldeen flopping about on his head. Well she\u2019d change that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the- AAAAAGH!\u201d Ash suddenly was being pulled up by his waistband, the cotton being shoved viciously into his butt by Misty\u2019s anger-fueled wedgie, \u201cSt-stoppit!\u201d Misty laughed as she pulled the boy\u2019s butt up higher. She began bouncing him as he yelped, his briefs\u2019 legholes now visible as they flew deeper and deeper into his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty knew her strength wouldn\u2019t last much longer and that Ash probably would get the upper hand and take revenge. She quickly noticed a low hanging branch and began carrying a squealing Ash over to it, his briefs up to his upper back by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to leave him up there for a bit until he agreed to her demands- or maybe something else would be better...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he was learning at the moment, when the redhead wanted to follow through with something, she'd put her mind towards it and follow through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got to the branch above them, Ash felt the pain intensify as he felt himself being lifted higher into the air by his briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty had started out by using a stump to get a bit more leverage, then proceeded to hike Ash's undies further up his crack as she lifted him higher, and higher until his butt had come just above her chest.

He hadn\u2019t received many wedgies over the years- a few from Gary when they were younger was really the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never been this bad and he had certainly never been hung up like this.

She got around him again, picking up a nearby branch that was flattish, \u201cHere let me persuade you, Ash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAGH!\u201d Ash squealed loudly as the tree branch slammed into his denim-covered butt with all the strength Misty had left (which was still a lot to the boy who had only been spanked by his mother\u2019s hand, never by a branch). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sent him swinging, grinding his already awful wedgie deeper into his ass, the pain beginning fresh as the momentum put pressure onto his crotch before swinging him back to shove it back up his butt. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a \u2018Yes Ma\u2019am\u2019 yet Ash!\u201d Misty laughed before spanking him again with the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five strikes from the branch Ash was on the verge of tears but held strong. He wouldn\u2019t let her win! At least, that was what he thought as Misty circled around front. She looked him over before reaching up and undoing his jeans. He tried to hold them up but she smacked his red behind, causing Ash to yelp and let them drop to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty laughed at the site, the pitiful and foolhardy boy swinging from a branch, tighty whities shoved deep up his ass and exposing his now red butt to the world. Ash\u2019s cheeks burned in humiliation, desperately hoping he could escape. His spirit was at its breaking point. Maybe he could get his pokemon to save his sore butt!</span></div></div>",

Whereas with this girl, even though she was temperamental, something about her told him that she knew a lot more about being a trainer than he did.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!

You want some pointers?\" Misty asked while placing her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded, swallowing his pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked at Ash in thought. She was still angry at him for wrecking her bike, that much was certain. But, now that she had some time to calm down, she was able to think clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon she came to a decision, she got back onto the stump, and unhooked his briefs from the branch of the tree, causing him to fall back to the forest floor on his face. He shook himself out of his dizziness as he sat cross legged. Misty then knelt down in front of him, giving him a less angry and more firm look as he pulled his jeans back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, listen up.... The only reason I'm willing to agree to this deal is simple..\" Misty visibly relaxed as she looked at him, \"Even though you took my bike, and got it demolished.. You did it to save your Pikachu..\" She gave a slight smirk,  \"Don't get me wrong, you still owe me a bike, so my conditions on you submitting will still stand... But, I have to admit.. Any trainer that's willing to risk his neck out there for his Pokemon can't be all that bad. You do have <b>some</b> potential Ash, you just need some help unlocking it.. Which is why, I'm gonna make sure you work your butt off while you're learning from me.. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty put her fist against Ash's\u2019 chin, and pushed it a bit sideways in a playful, cuffing gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it..\" Ash held the urge to grin while finishing redoing his belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty got to her feet, helping the young trainer up. She then grasped Ash by the waistband once again, leading him by the underwear rather than wedgieing him (for now at least). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon rookie, we need to get to Pewter before nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He caught a pidgeotto that day as well, much to his joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had messed up a bit- sending his poor caterpie out to fight it when it was a flying type. Misty had let him know VERY quickly what she thought about that, his undies refinding their new secondary home up his butt. Ash quickly had Pikachu defeat it so he could capture it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBirds eat worms like yours Ash! Pokemon isn\u2019t just about throwing one creature at another- they are only effective if their trainer is thinking!\u201d She said, lecturing him, Ash sitting sheepishly on the ground cross legged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Misty, I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. I just thought that Caterpie needed his time to shine!\u201d He said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sighed, smiling a little, \u201cI know that\u2019s what you want, but something like pidgeotto isn\u2019t something you throw a Caterpie at. And you did all this after forgetting you needed to weaken pokemon to catch them first, one of the basic rules of catching pokemon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head in fond exasperation, \u201cYou\u2019re so hard headed sometimes. But you need to drill it into your head- many of a pokemon\u2019s weaknesses are self explanatory. Grass gets burned up by Fire which is weakened by Water which is soaked up by Grass again. But advantages like this can make the world of a difference!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded furiously, \u201cI understand!

They both stopped when they saw it was only Caterpie forming a cocoon around itself, \u201cOh its evolving!\u201d It turned into a Metapod, the cocoon stage of the bug\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other kid jumped up celebrating and hugging his Metapod, not really caring about the briefs still in his butt. Misty laughed before noticing the sun was almost set, \u201cLooks like we\u2019re not making it our today. Tomorrow then; best set up camp in that case.\u201d<br>\r\nThey did so, getting a fire going and eating before his mentor turned to him, \u201cAlright Ash, while I know you\u2019re still learning, I want to reinforce today\u2019s lesson for you. Since Caterpie, the one you put in danger, is in a cocoon you\u2019ll join him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at her blankly as she got his sleeping bag out, \u201cWha-Whadda ya mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him gently by the briefs, \u201cOh simple!\u201d she grabbed some rope and threaded one rope through one leghole, then another through the other leghole. She then pulled them up, wedgieing Ash\u2019s briefs up his butt and his tighty whities climbed up his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, the legholes were halfway up his body, held there on the sides by two ropes that looped over a shoulder and through the legholes. Ash squirmed in the permanent wedgie, which honestly only seemed to make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty explained, \u201cYou\u2019ll be staying like that for the night in your sleeping bag like Metapod. Hopefully after tonight I\u2019ll never have to do this again\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh furiously nodded, \u201cYes Misty, the lesson is being- ugh -learned!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! Then i\u2019ll be taking these as collateral,\u201d She said removing his pants and belt, \u201cYou can get them back in the morning. Take off the wedgie and you\u2019ll be walking around pantsless tomorrow.\u201d Ash blushed as she did take them off but nodded and got in his sleeping bag.

Of course, this would be highly uncomfortable for anyone to have to deal with, but that's beside the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the night, Ash was tempted to take the ropes off and undo his cheek splitting wedgie.

But it'll be worth it, if it means I become a great Pokemon trainer.. </i> Ash thought as he looked at his new coach/mentor as she snoozed in her sleeping bag. He looked up into the stars as he pondered something that he never thought of before. <i>I wonder if Dad ever went through something like this.. I mean.. Mom DID say that she gave him an atomic wedgie when they first met...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stifled a chuckle at the thought.. His own mother, the sweet and caring woman who raised him from birth on her own, giving someone a WEDGIE of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he let sleep overtake him, he drifted off into slumberland so he could dream of making it big as a trainer. <br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ash's eyes fluttered open, yawning as he stretched up, greeting Pikachu with a scratch behind the ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head, as he watched Misty wake up as well, stretching out her body as she felt her bones pop a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty crawled out of her sleeping bag and zipped Ash's own sleeping bag open a bit to check. She smiled as she saw that Ash had kept the wedgie in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you kept your promise!\" Misty handed her companion back his pants, \"You can undo the ropes now..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gladly did so, getting out of his sleeping bag and untying the ropes until his undergarments were free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter digging his briefs out of his crack and putting his pants back on, the two of them (along with their Pokemon) had a quick breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get going, I think you deserve a heads up. The Pewter City Gym specializes in rock type Pokemon.. And considering that some of the leader's Pokemon might be ground types as well, I think Pikachu needs to sit it out..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wanted to protest, but he knew she was more than likely right.. From what he'd heard in one of the trainer booklets, electric Pokemon like Pikachu  don't work too well against those type of Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... I could get a water type..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Misty smiled at Ash's words, gently knocking him on the head \"You see?

Because of how sudden it occurred, it stunned the crab quite a bit, to the point where it wasn't trying to snip its way out of the net with his claws while being dragged towards the shrubbery . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gapped in shock at what just happened, with his fears being unfortunately confirmed as he saw the net with Krabby inside of it being picked up by the domineering hand of the Team Rocket member, Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite da catch of da day, eh?\" Meowth quipped as the feline popped out of the shrubbery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\" James said as he too popped out, \"It-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stopped in mid-sentence, as all of three Team Rocket members looked at Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You again!\" Jessie growled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lost a haul of Pokemon because of you and that Pikachu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ash sweated a bit nervously as he reached behind himself to get out his Pidgeotto's pokeball, hoping to fight them off.. Only to realize..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not there! It... I must've left the pokeball behind back at camp!.. And Pikachu's not nearby.. Thiiiiis could get messy.. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wouldn't stop him from rescuing the little crab Pokemon from their clutches, no sir.. Instead, he quickly grabbed a small rock from the ground and threw it at Jessie's hand. This caused him to release the krabby from her clutch as she yelled out in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run little guy! Get outta here, go!\" Ash called out to the Krabby. The sound was enough to snap the little Pokemon out of his stupor as he snipped his way out of the net. He briefly gave Ash a look of what appeared to be surprise, but nonetheless scuttled off in a hurry in the opposite direction, even faster than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the three Pokemon thieves were angry, they stopped as Meowth looked closer at Ash as a realization popped into his head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hey fellas! Check it out.. Da twoip forgot ta bring his Pokemon with him.. \" Meowth said, a smug grin adorned on his feline face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Jessie asked, as a smiliar grin formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty big mistake for a trainer to make..\" James said, cracking his knuckles with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gulped a bit, slowly backing away from the three as a pit formed in his stomach.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Ash realize, however, that the little Krabby was scurrying off in search of Misty and Pikachu. </span></div></div>",

Ow!! OW!!!\" She proceeded her tugging, pulling her arm up while griping a fist full of his undies, causing him to hoisted into air much, like how Jessie did it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ash you got hurt and captured. You ended up like THIS because you let your emotions get the better of you. If I hadn't showed up in time, they would have done worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh tried to think of something to argue back but he couldn't. Misty was right. If he had Pikachu alone, he could have certainly fended them off if he wasn't reckless in forgetting them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*sigh* \"eh, you'er... right, I was reckless... I promise I'll change that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty slowly put him down. \"I know you will, which is why I'm taking you'er pants.

Ah, what are you doing?!\" His sudden flailing caused him to turn and left him dangling sideways as she carried him over to the grass before dropping him unceremoniously. \"Ow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what we're gonna do,\" she stated enthusiastically, \"I'm going to educate you on type weaknesses.

Why?\" This was definitely not what he had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I think you'll learn better if you can really FEEL the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the boy had limited himself down to just three wedgies after 9 questions. The first time he answered wrong, on the third question regarding the weaknesses of a poison type, he had earned himself a lifting wedgie, which lasted for about a minute thankfully. The second time, on the sixth question about which Pokemon type would be effective against a Normal type, she hoisted him off the ground swung him by the underpants for about two minutes. And unfortunately, the last question, relating to which type was best against a fairy type, had earned him a hanging wedgie from a rock formation by a tree. He pouted a bit, resting his chin under both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fair, I didn't even know that steel and fairy types were a thing. AH! Shouldn't metal just be another type of rock?\" He wriggled about, trying in vain to get free from his wedgie. He was definitely going to need to change into another pair of briefs when he was free from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what you get from not studying more before deciding you wanted to be a Pokemon Master.. Though to be fair, I guess you just had a slightly outdated book.. Now, for the final question, with a special penalty this time.\" Ash gulped nervously. \"Get this one wrong, and you won't be aloud to wear any pants whenever we're not in a town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedgied and pantsless boy's eyes widened in shock. \"Are you kidding me?!\" No more pants when they're outside of town, just his undies clad butt on display for this wicked girl to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" It was clear to Misty that this kid needed motivation to use his head. \"Who knows, it could make for quite the reputation if we run into enough people: The Pantsless Pokemon Master.\" Ash's face reddened, dread filling him at the thought of being known as the Pokemon trainer who was always wondering around in his underwear because he couldn't be bothered to study. Of course, he couldn't have known that Misty wasn't cruel enough to let that happen, she'd make sure he didn't get seen by many people. Somehow. But a little fear should help jump start his brain. And she could give him chances to earn his pants back outside of towns later. \"Okay, name one weakness that psychic types have.\"</span></div></div>",

You just needed to use your head is all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks..\" Ash said with a bit of bashfulness from her praise. \"Um, does that mean I'll get my pants back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, you will..\" Misty said, proceeding to slowly climb down the rock, pulling Ash along with her until they were back on the ground. \"But first, we need to get you a water type for the Pewter City gym..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's.. Fair.. Though how the heck are we gonna find one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired tomboy grinned; \"I'm sure we'll find one if we look around the forest.. In the meantime, how's about you took a break from walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.. Dont' you m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty suddenly got behind him, and took two handfuls of the briefs's fabric, proceeding to HOIST the boy off his feet once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I said.. Since I happen to be a Water Pokemon specialist, I'll be the one to lead the search. In the mean time..

Naturally he came up for air for a bit since his lung capacity wasn't exactly superhuman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the surface, he was flooking around at the floor of the pond, when he spotted a round wriggling object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he swam closer, he saw it was a Poliwag, wriggling about and trying to get free from something..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the poor little thing's tail was caught in something  while trying to get some Salveyo weed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he dived down, and swam towards the tadpole Pokemon, and began getting the little guy loose.

Really, how many times does that happen? \"Guuuyyys, help!\" Please!\" His struggling just seemed to be further irritating the fish Pokemon that he found himself at the mercy of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poliwaaaaaag!\" Fortunately, salvation was at ha-er fin. With a loud cry, the newly befriended Poliwag was returning the favor Ash had done her and blasting the Goldeen with a well aimed water gun.

She had the following in her repertoire; Water Gun, Hypnosis and  Double Slap; with Mud Shot as an egg move apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite her species not being as adept on land as they were in the water in this form, Poliwag did still nonetheless seem to be capable enough on land.This would be especially necessary since there was no pool of water for her to hide in at the Pewter Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh opted to go with Pidgeotto as his second Pokemon for the battle, since Pikacu's electric attacks wouldn't have much effect (far less to the point of useless if it turned out the gym leader's Pokemon were part ground type), and Metapod wouldn't be able to maneuver much until he evolved. Plus, while he was at a disadvantage against Rock type moves, being a flying type still more or less made him immune to ground type moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did help that along the way, Pidgeotto managed to get a warm up after warding off a swarm of beedrill alongside Pikachu,  Poliwag and Misty's Staryu. He even managed to naturally learn the move, Double Team, on his own, which would definitely come in handy for the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they arrived at Pewter City, where a mysterious rock seller with a beard briefly greeted them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon arriving at the Pokemon Center, everyone rested for the night.

Oh sure, most of his dignity was now gone, but he was certainly improving as a trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a part of him worried about how things were going. Misty definitely had a \"unique\" method of teaching him, and something told him she wasn't going to let up anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're just about there Ash.\" His thoughts were interrupted by her words as he looked ahead to see the city in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean I can... uh...\" A part of him was nervous to ask, afraid of punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, she just giggled and tossed him his pants. \"Better get those on before someone else sees you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat certainly got a reaction from him as he realized the odds of being seen had increased now that the city was so close. before even removing his atomic wedgie, the boy had already gotten his pants on. As he unhooked the underwear from his head and it started to snap back down, he was started as Misty grabbed it midway and pulled lightly. \"Hey, what's the deal?!\" He frantically tried to think of anything he might have done wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just something I want to try.\" Still keeping his briefs in a wedgied state, she stuffed them under his shirt now to hide them from anyone's view before putting his belt on him tightly. \"There, that should keep your wedgie in without exposing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh groaned in despair as he realized that his butt was still in trouble. \"Why meeeeee...?\"</span></div></div>",

Only to find that it wasn't exactly quite as great as being out of it. So naturally, Ash had to compromise. She'd be allowed to be out of her poke all most of the time like Pikachu, but if a situation calls for it, she will go into her ball without complaints. That was fine with the little water type, finding it a fair deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as soon as Ash was ready for bed, he looked at Misty with a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mist..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Ash?\" She asked the boy, a bit surprised that he called her by a nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta ask.. How come you specialize in Water type Pokemon?\" Ash asked with a raised eyebrow; \"The only other people that I've heard of specializing in it are the Sensational Sisters in Cerulean Gym..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty froze up just a tad, both because she was  not expecting such a question, and because he mentioned Cerulean. Thankfully she recovered a bit, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... That's my secret to have..\" Misty said casually, but than grew a playful smile; \"But I'm willing to give it out if you're willing to work for it..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then suddenly walked up to him, calmly taking his hat off his head. Before he could even ask what she was doing, she suddenly got him in a headlock with her right arm and began to give him a noogie with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Quit it!\" Ash said with a boyish grin as he felt the taller girl rub her knuckles atop his black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me!\" Misty laughed as she wrestled the boy to the floor, not letting up with the noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag and Pikachu simply looked with amusement, letting the two roughhouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rough housing continued on, with Ash eventually escaping the noogie and trying desperately to turn the tables on her, only for Misty to counter his every attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all culminated to where Misty had successfully gotten the shorter boy on his bed, sitting on his back and keeping his arms pinned down with her legs. Naturally? Misty reached down, and yanked on his undies. Not enough to give a NUCLEAR wedgie of course, though just enough to get the point across that he was losing..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag honestly didn't know why her new trainer's companion was so interested in tugging on his underpants.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu natrually filled her in on everything that had before they met up with each other.. Though of course, he added that he had next to no idea  why Misty would even choose <b>WEDGIES</b> of all things, but he supposed her tomboyish nature had something to do with it..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag naturally gave Misty a look of confusion, but naturally shrugged her... Body.....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, perhaps  she'd try to learn the appeal of wedgie giving when she evolved into a Poliwhirl.</span></div></div>",

As Pikachu's stomach growling indicated..<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stood at the door, breathing in and out to calm his nerves.. He knew if he wanted to do well in his first gym battle, he'd need to keep his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't stop him from having butterfrees form in his belly, but he was willing to press forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked hard, and had Misty as a great coach, regardless of her unusual \"methods\".. He could do this..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening the doors, the two humans and two Pokemon walked into the gym, where across from them, stood a teen boy, a couple years older than them and taller. With rather squinty eyes, tan skin (almost brown really), a green vest, an orange shirt, and brown pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Brock.. Have you come to challenge the Pewter City Gym?\" The teen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my name's Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town, and I'm here for my first gym battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straight to the point I see..\" Brock said with a small smile; \"Well, Ash, let's see how well you do.. Hope you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded, as he grabbed Pidgeotto's pokeball, and brought him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock raised an eyebrow at the odd choice.. Something told him the rookie had something up his sleeve, so he knew he'd best not get overconfident despite the type advantage Brock's Pokemon had, especially since ground type moves wouldn't work on Pidgeotto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geodude, your'e up!\" Brock threw the pokeball containing the small pebble like Pokemon with muscular arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked on at the two..

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash's plan for victory had been relatively simple. Figuring that the gym leaders wouldn't use his strongest Pokemon first, The idea was to at least soften said Pokemon up with Pidgeotto if his flying type wasn't strong enough to beat it. Then Poliwag would be able to clear a win easily enough and have a better chance against whatever Brock's second Pokemon would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's 'lessons' had definitely gotten him to start thinking more. <i>To think, I might have actually tried to win with Pikachu before.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, everything was quiet, until Brock made the first move: \"Geodude, use tackle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"geo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was on as Ash quickly had Pidgeotto dodge before returning fire with a gust attack to try and knock Geodude back. However <b>the rock was undeterred!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Geodude retaliated by throwing a stone at the bird, which he avoided, only to receive a Mega Punch to the face, sending the bird reeling until he regained his senses and up righted himself. Geodude naturally grabbed him with his burly hands and got ready for a Seismic Toss, only to be countered with a Peck Attack to the face. While the bird did manage to get away, the peck to Geodude's face only annoyed the rock type Pokemon rather than do much damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidgeotto avoided another tackle attack, and transitioned to using Double Team. As he flew at Geodude, his entire body had a white outline around it. And as a result, the bird created multiple copies of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeodude attempted a tackle, but phased through one of them, leading to him receiving a blow from above, courtesy of Pidgeotto using Quick attack, which allowed him to move at a speed that allowed him to be almost invisible, made more effective when Pidgeotto used the momentum while he focused the full force at his beak while lunging, with the smaller surface area allowing the impact to be more condensed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock type recovered after landing on the field, and went underground using dig. Geodude came out of the ground, finding that Pidgeotto had flown almost all the way to the ceiling, leaving him unable to get any higher. Thus he was ready to use a Mega Punch once again.. And if Pidgeotto tried going down, he'd only find himself getting intercepted by Geodude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what he did next made Ash grin with impressment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hovering back down a bit, Pidgeotto deftly moved to the side while using both talons to grab Geodude by each one of his muscular forearms, using both his side-flap AND Geodude's momentum to start dive bombing to gain even greater speed. Emphasis on speed, as this tactic required a great deal of it, otherwise Geodude would be able to recover and retaliate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a rocket of feathers and stone, the two sped downwards  until Pidgeotto gained sufficient velocity. After pulling up back into a sort of loop, Pidgeotto didn't let the momentum and speed go to waste as he promptly chucked the rock Pokemon into the side of one of the largest rock formations on the field, leaving a Geodude's sized hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle grew intense with both Pokemon starting to look tired, the unexpected happened. Pidgeotto had just dodged again and Ash had called out for a whirlwind attack to push Geodude further while using Geodude's momentum to get a better result, but got something unexpected instead... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pidgeoooo!\" As the bird flapped his wings,  the gusts of wind suddenly gathered around until it formed a sort of cyclone of sorts.. A <b>literal</b> whirlwind if you will, proceeding to let it engulf Geodude. The centrifugal forces being too much, as the tornado promptly slammed him into the field, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter obviously voiced his commentary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Twister. A dragon type move. This move allows the user to send a tornado at an opponent. </b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, I didn't know you had that attack!\" Said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock also looked surprised as he returned Geodude to his pokeball for a well earned rest. \"That's the thing about being a trainer I suppose. Pokemon are just full of surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right.\" Turning to his Pidegotto, who had collapsed to the ground in exhaustion, though he was still awake and covered in bruises underneath his feathers.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh opted to let him rest rather than send him into the next fight. \"Get some rest pal, you've earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidgeotto chirped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time for round two. Poliwag vs Onyx. As Brock watched Poliwag stepped up to fight, he suddenly felt himself start to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's so funny?!\" Ash demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why, but for just a second there, I had this weird feeling you were going to try an use Pikachu.\" That thought suddenly had both Ash and Misty laughing as well. After all, using a small electric mouse to fight a giant snake made out of stone? What sort of idiotic, completely insane fool would do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, before it began, Ash breathed in and out in order to calm himself. As he did, Poliwag looked at him. She nodded in reassurance that she'd give it all she had, giving the trainer her faith in his skills as a battler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right..\" Ash grinned; \"Let's get this thing started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag started off with a Water Gun, only for Onix to evade with surprising quickness for a Pokemon his size. Likely, this was because of his experiences in gym battles, allowing him to compensate for whatever disadvantage he'd find himself in, especially opponents that were water type Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retaliation, Onix attempted to slap Poliwag with his tail, only for the water type to hit the dirt. While the blow didn't connect in the slightest after she ducked, the strong breeze from how fast it was certainly blew the smaller Pokemon away about a couple meters back. Thankfully, she managed to land on her stubby little feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an attempt to swipe at her with his tail again, she hopped back to get some distance while also launching another water gun. Onix naturally avoided this yet again, and promptly began charging, or would that be slithering?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoliwag got out of there, knowing that meeting the attack head on was stupid. She could try to run away until he got tired and make himself easer for her to finish him off with a Water Gun or two. But she and her trainer knew that Onix probably wouldn't even tire out that easily.. So instead, this battle would have to be done similarly with Pidgeotto and Geodude's battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Poliwag had plenty of places to hide, due to her size, how big the field was, and the plentiful amount of rocks there were on the field!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Onix went past one of the biggest, he groaned a bit in pain as the side of his head felt a forceful shot of water pelt it. Turning his head to where it came from, he slowly moved towards what looked to be the same rock formation Geodude smashed into, only for the other side of his head to feel the same shot of water that hit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grimace, Onix turned his head and looked around. Brock knew that Onix's size was a bit of a double edged sword, since it made him a larger target, which is why he had Onix use Dig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Poliwag looked around for Onix, she felt a rumbling, about 4 meters to her right. She immediately started running again, only to feel the shockwave resulting from Onix suddenly popping out of the ground in front of her, knocking her back and hitting one of the boulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to her stubby feet the best that a Pokemon with no arms could, and used her tail to help shake off the dizziness. Only for Onix to come back up again, this time from behind. Poliwag was thrown like a ragdoll, though she landed on her feet this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't look good at all, since Onix was now playing the game of guerrilla warefare with Poliwag. Since Onix himself now had a place to hide, there was no telling when he'd pop up again, and he'd more than likely intercept Poliwag again if she tried to run. He wasn't sure if Poliwag could even TAKE much more from this..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute.. </i> Ash thought to himself as the gears in his head turned... Until he hit upon an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Poliwag was gathering her senses, she heard her trainer call out to her. Telling her to run and wait until he said otherwise. Knowing that her trainer had a trick up his sleeve, she began running as fast her little feet could carry her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt the rumbling in front of her, Ash told her to jump into the air as hard as she could and use Hypnosis. She did so, jumping into the air surprisingly high (likely due to her frog like physiology). As Onix's large head popped up again as if he were playing \"Whack-A-Mole\" , Poliwag's eyes were glowing blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the rock Pokemon made eye contact with Poliwag, his eyes became dull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Onix now in a trance, Poliwag took the initiative and began pelting him with Water Gun after Water Gun, until he was looking like he could collapse. With him just standing there, Poliwag knew this was her chance, hopping onto her opponent's tail and running up his body until she got to the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used it as a platform to hop away, opening her mouth while in mid-air and using Mud Shot, hurling multiple round globs of mud at high speed towards Onix... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mud made contact with Onix, Poliwag landed on a pillar of stone, panting a bit as she watched the toppled giant crash to the floor. She was surprised, but glad all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The little thing was so exhausted she was actually happy to get some rest inside her Pokeball..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that?... Ash had effectively won his very first gym battle. </span></div></div>",

Oh come o-AH-on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only have yourself to blame for waving off my warning.\" she said while tugging harder and pulling him up off of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww!, I'm so-ow-rry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little for that I'm afraid. Now: pants off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, he complied and struggled to remove his pants while she proceeded to destroy his butt with his underwear. First stretching the briefs up over his head and then grabbing the legholes to wedgie him further, completely exposing his butt-cheeks in the process. By the time she was finished, Ash just groaned in agony while squirming after she tossed him back onto the bed. \"owhowowowowhowow! Okay, lesson learned.\" He gasped as a quick slap was delivered to his backside, letting out a quieter \"ow.\" That one actually hadn't been every hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, that means I'm doing my job right.\" her eyes traveled over his stretched out tighty whities as a thought occurred to her. \"You know, you're definitely going to be needing some more undies soon. What do you say we go out and get you some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Having to go underwear shopping was something he realized that he would probably need to do if he was going to handle Misty's... 'unorthodox' teaching methods. But going underwear shopping WITH her. Correction, going underwear shopping with A GIRL! Not something that a ten year old boy, or any boy really, looked forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could just get you some myself, but then you'd have no say at all in what you get. Maybe I could find some underoos somewhere.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still in his atomic wedgie and without pants, Ash made his way over to the room's couch, grabbed the remote, and turned on the TV. \"Might as well do something while I wait.\" Indeed, aside from watching TV, there wasn't much he COULD do in his current situation. he began absentmindedly flipping through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika pi.\" Ash turned his head towards his little electric mouse as it called for his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Pikachu?\" The small Pokemon gestured to the book it had dragged over. \"You want me to read you a book?\" Pikachu shook his head and opened the book himself and acted like he was reading it. \"Huh, ummmm, I don't really get what youre...\" He paused as Pikachu began to mime out the act of writing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Ash began to realize that it was turning into a sort of Simon Says game. \"Okaaaay, let's see. You're reading, and also writing. Hmmm. Taking notes? he guessed. Pikachu and gestured for him to continue. \"Ummm, okay. taking notes. Uh, studying?\" Again, he received a nod. \"Alright, but why...?\" And then something clicked in Ash's head. \"Ugh, right, I needed to get a Pokemon book to study! Guess i should have gone with Misty when I had to chance.\" Cursing his misfortune, Ash looked back at the screen, hoping that his decision would not bring any more regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b><div align=\"center\">Half an Hour Later</div></b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash was watching TV, he suddenly heard the lock to the room's door being undone. Worried about the chance that it might end up being someone other than his redheaded companion, Ash began to rush toward the covers of his bed until he heard Misty's familiar voice. \"Oh Ash, I'm back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy breathed a sigh of relief. \"Hey Misty. Everything go okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she tossed a shopping bag over to him, which he caught. \"Yep. And now that I'm back, I can remove your wedgie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed as Misty removed his briefs from his head, although he did yelp when the waistband snapped back to his butt. \"Ahh, soooo much better.\" His relief would not last long though. Looking into the bag, Ash found his earlier fears were correct. \"Oh come on!\" He complained as he saw that the bag was filled with multiple different types of underoos. Misty giggle as she watch him examine the different types. The green ones with grass Pokemon designs, a pack that featured designs resembling some of the legendary Pokemon, some Pikachu themed ones, and... \"Are you kidding me?!!\" The pink pairs covered with images of Skitty. The poor boy's face was completely red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I warned that you might not like what I get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that, bu this last pack was ridiculous. \"Yeah, but these?!\" he held up the pack of underoos baring Skitty's image. \"These are clearly meant for girls! I can't wear these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Misty saw an opportunity to have some more fun with the boy. \"Hmmm, you may have a point.\" She saw a bit of hope start to form on Ash's face. \"I'll tell you what, let's make a little bet. If you win, I'll get rid of the Skitty-themed underoos. However, If I win, then not only do we get rid of what's left of your tighty whities and your swim suit so that you'll have to wear underoos, even when you're swimming, but you also have to get a spanking before bed every night for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gulped. On one hand, those terms meant risking a lot just to get rid of a few pairs of underoos. On the other hand, these were some pretty demeaning underoos. \"W-what's the actual challenge?\" he asked, and felt himself shiver at the grin that appeared on the girl's face.</span></div></div>",

Ash was currently trying to watch T.V just to pass the the time but two things just kept bugging him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat underwear Misty was going to buy? <br>\r\nand <br>\r\nThe pain he kept reviving from his wedgie ever time he tried making himself comfortable.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash thought he found the best position, he hear the door begin to unlock. Thinking it might be someone other then Misty he ran to his bed not caring that it just made his wedgie worse and hid himself under the covers. Lucky for him it was Misty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash, I'm back\" Misty said as she closed the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sigh in relief and got out the covers and off the bed \"Great you'er back, everything go OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and you kept your wedgie you can remove that now\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Ash said as he removed his briefs from his head. \"That feels better now\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then noticed that Misty put a bag down in front of the door. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"eh, Misty are those my bag of new.. *sigh* underoos\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No these are your new briefs.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's face lit up when he heard this. \"Really!\" Ash said as he ran to the bag. Ash looked in the bag a saw that they were really briefs. They were in mostly colors of pink, violet, yellow and just about four white ones but really he didn't care. He was just glad they weren't underoos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash notice those 4 hooks on the door?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked up and saw the hooks <br>\r\n\"Yeah, wha- (Ash felt 2 hands grasp his waistband) AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh squealed as Misty harshly tugged on his briefs, so hard that Ash was barely on his toes. Misty then let go of Ash's waistband but just a second later she began tugging his legholes, completely lifting him of the ground and proceeded to hook his legholes to, 2 of the 4 hooks.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty-EEEEK wh-ATss this fo-AHr!!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just teaching you a lesson\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Wh-AT!?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see\" Misty said with  as she hooked both his legholes on to both the outer hooks. Misty then stepped back put her hands on her hips and admired her work while Ash just moaned and groaned as he was hanging from just about an inch from the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu was just sitting on the bed watching them, for he found Ash's \"lessons\" entertaining  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, Misty ge-get me down wha-what did I do?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty gave a smirk and said \"You were irresponsible.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?, how? you left me in my underwear with an atomic wedgie and told me to-EK!\" His protest cut when Misty gave a small tug on the front of his briefs. \"Mi-Mist-EEEK\" Misty gave another tug this time harder. \"No listen.\" Misty said firmly. Ash remained silent and just gave a nod. Misty then let causing him is sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were irresponsible because you didn't even bother to ask me to buy you this\" Misty went to her bag and pulled out a book. a Pokemon textbook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't believe it, he forgot about getting that. \"But-But I was goin-EEEEK\" Misty cut again pulled on the front. \"No excuses. I thought you tried learning something from those wedgies you got from that quiz, clearly you didn't.\" Ash looked down with guilt, he know if he had gone with her he could have avoided being in an atomic for half an hour and know being hang by his tighty whities that he could feel ripping ever so slowly as gravity deepened his wedgie. (There is a reason why they say \"better to be safe then sorry\")  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty then looked in Ash's bag and then faced him with an evil smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ash here are your two choices:\" <br>\r\n\"Choice one: You are going to walk in an atomic wedgie till we arrive in the next city which is Cerulean City exactly like this morning with no pants and even if you accidentally undo your wedgie you'll get 5 spanks with your belt while hanging in your briefs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or choice two: You seem to currently have 5 white briefs in your bag and I bought 4 more of the same color and adding in the one you are currently being wedgied in you have 10. So this is your choice, you will be wedgied in each one of these until all of them rip and after that you'll only be walking around in you'er new pink brief which are a seize smaller and strecher by the way.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't believe his options both of them were horrible, either walk around in an atomic wedgie again and with the bonus of possibly being given a hanging wedgie and get spanked with his belt or receive wedgies until 10 of them his briefs rip and wear only one of the pink briefs that anyway give a natural wedgie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-but what if someone sees me in an atomic or in my pink briefs while we're traveling\" Ash asked hoping this would give something else but unfortunately no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you better hope there's a tree or a bush for you to hide behind\" Misty said coldly but that's not all she said \"oh yeah and either way you'er sleeping in just your briefs in an atomic.\"           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Perfect... either way my butt's in trouble</i>\" Ash muttered  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh though for a moment, either way was humiliating and (If even he had any left) pride destroying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it fast Ash or you'er sleeping like that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this Ash quickly made up his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take...<br>\r\n         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           <br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

Though, I suppose it could have been worse too. Right?\" SMACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Right ma'am.\" SMACK SMACK. \"OWWWWwww!\" At the moment, Misty was giving Ash a few spanks to <i>encourage</i> him to try and read more about Pokemon when they get the chance. SMACK. \"AH!\" <i>At least I'm on my feat for this instead of hanging from a tree or laying over her lap. Right?</i> Those thoughts made his face turn as red as his cheeks were starting to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you have figured out all of her attacks now. Even if I did have to hold your hand through most of it.\" It was true, and Poliwag did have a nice array of attacks. On tiop of water gun, she also had Double Slap, Hypnosis, and MUD SHOT of all things. Smack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, why did you think she'd be able to use bubble beam? She'd be right on the cusp of evolving if she could use that now.\" SMACK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Give me a break! We only figured out she had mudshot because she decided to show us.\" He immediately shut his mouth after that, realizing too late that it was easily considered back talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, however, Misty paused in delivering his spanking. \"Hmmm, yeah, you do have a point there.\" Even she had been surprised by that. \"Well, I guess this should do for a lesson. And we do need to get moving if we want to have plenty of time look around when we reach the city.\" Briefly, she considered putting him back into the atomic wedgie she had been prepared to leave him in until reaching the city earlier. However, she figured that she'd let it slide. Like she said earlier, he could have done worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering a quick \"thanks,\" Ash started walking forward while rubbing his sore bottom. <i>Great.</i> he thought. <i>Stripped down to my underwear and spanked. That's it, first chance I get, I'm grabbing a book on Pokemon and studying like I've never studied before.</i> A task that wouldn't be too large given the minimal amount of studying he'd done in the past. That being said, one would wonder if he could actually focus enough to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they journeyed forward, Misty felt better than ever. Her journey with this boy was only just get started, and she couldn't deny that she had been having A LOT of fun 'teaching' him. <i>Almost makes me glad he wrecked my bike. Almost.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they did start to see Pewter City in the distance.</span></div></div>",

As a result, the two trainers went looking for a place to spend the night as soon as they got Ash's Pokemon checked out at a Pokemon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done and the two had reached the room they would be staying in, Ash hurriedly shut the door behind him and started rubbing his sore bottom now that they were out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing this, Misty chuckled before asking, \"Still sore down there Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning in embarrassment, Ash just answered with a drawn out \"Yeeeesssss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling as she saw another opportunity, she asked, \"You know what might help with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you got back down to your undies for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

With worry, he noticed that it was a state of undress that was becoming more and more familiar to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly looking over his briefs-clad appearance, Misty giggle before commenting, \"Yep, I was right earlier. This look <b>is</b> better for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment had Ash blushing again.

Yo-you're joking? R-right? Right!\" Ash hadn't worn underoos since he was seven. The switch over to plain tighty whities was made after an incident when Gary had decided to pants him at the playground. An action that earned plenty of laughter from everyone around. When Ash had later gotten home, he had begged his mom to buy him boxers in the hopes that it could reduce future humiliations. Some infinitely cooler boxers had been a deal breaker though. The slight improvement that was plain white briefs was the best his mother would agree to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not Ash. This is for your own good.\" Well, his own good and {{i}u}her own{/u} entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantic, the poor boy demanded to know, \"How can this possibly be for my own good?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Misty explained, \"because Ash, you need more discipline. You couldn't even sleep in your wedgie when the point was to learn what your Caterpie felt like after you sent it to fight that Pidgeotto.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reminder of that mistake caused Ash to suddenly find an interest in looking down at his feet, an action that made him wince slightly as his head pulled his briefs just a bit tighter. \"I-I, know but, why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple: since the threat of losing your pants wasn't enough, I'm just going to have to up the consequences for bad behavior.\" Suppressing her delighted smirk, she added, \"In this case, upping your embarrassment. Now get your tighty whities off your head and start packing, we've got places to go and underoos to buy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as she said, and changing into a pair of less stretched briefs once she looked away, Ash began to think over his current options while packing. On one hand, he could suck it up, go back to wearing underoos, and pray that no one other than Misty ever saw him in them. Even limiting it just her though was mortifying. It would be embarrassing enough with another guy seeing him like that, but a GIRL! <i>Maybe I could talk her into a lighter punishment.</i> he thought. Of course, she may just see that as a sign that he's trying to run away from the consequences of his action. Even if he was starting to think she was a little crazy, he didn't want to risk making her too disappointed in him and think he wasn't worth teaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do?</span></div></div>",

Don't worry I promise Misty and I will help your babies get better.\" Ash said. The Rhydon's face beamed with a smile and proceed to give Ash a hug. \"Can't.... Breath...\" Ash said as it squeezed. The Rhydon let go of him realizing what it was doing to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash! Where are you!?\" Ash heard and then he walked out of the cave to find Misty and Pikachu. \"Ash! Are you alright? Where's the Rhydon?\" Misty asked concerned. \"I'm fine Misty, I just need a new pair of underwear. But you need to see this.\" Ash said as he took Misty's arm and guild her into the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh showed Misty the baby Rhyhorns and explained to her that the Rhydon didn't mean harm and wanted their help. Misty looked at the baby rhydons and from the looks of them they really needed help. While Misty looked at the Rhyhorns, Ash changed into a new pair of underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to help them Misty!\" Ash said clutching his fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ash we will. But first take out your pokedex and scan the Rhyhorns\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wasn't sure how that would help but did so. The Pokedex scanned the Rhyhorns and found out what was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! They've been poisoned!\" Ash said worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have been attacked by beedrill or something.\" Misty though. \"What do we do?\" Ash asked. \"They need antidotes. Antidotes are items that can be used to cure poisoned Pokemon. Luckily I have some with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Misty took out her antidotes and used them on the Rhyhorns. \"There that should help them\" Misty said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was right. Almost instantly the antidotes took affect and cured the Rhyhorns. They were however, still a bit weak and needed some rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rhydon jumped with joy, hugging and squeezing the two trainers. \"Your... Welcome...\" said Ash, \"Too.. Tight...\" Misty said. After the tight hug Misty, seeing as their work here was done, said it was time to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ash lets get moving\" Misty said as she walked forward. Ash on the other hand was a bit hesitate to leave. \"Hey Misty, Can we set camp here till tomorrow?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked at Ash surprised \"Why Ash?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to make sure the Rhyhorns are strong and healthy. So could we please set up camp here?\" Ash asked. Misty gave a smile and responded \"Sure Ash, lets camp here till tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------ <br>\r\nNightfall was about dawn on the group as Ash, Misty, Pikachu and the Rhydon had berries and fruits for dinner. \"Alright Ash, we better get some firewood if we want to stay warm for the night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Ash responded and both went into the woods to get firewood. As they looked and collected firewood they both began to chat to past the time. \"You really helped those Rhyrons Misty.\" Ash said. \"Oh, it was nothing, your pokedex did help us find what was wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but if it wasn't for your knowledge, they could've suffered worse. what I mean is your a great mentor, aside from the wedgies and all..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault you look better in an atomic wedgie.\" Misty replied jokingly. Ash rolled his eyes at the statement. \"It would honestly look better on you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty stopped and raised her eyebrow. \"Oh really Ash?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stopped and got nervous. \"a-I-a-I-I was-a- just joking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smirked and looked at Pikachu who was walking beside them. \"Pikachu you be the judge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rhydon waited for its friends to come back. It began to wage its tail as it saw them make their way back. Though it was then confused when it saw Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh held the firewood and walked wincing with every step he took as he walked in an atomic wedgie. With every step he took he could feel his undies slicing deeper into his butt. \"See even Pikachu thinks you look better in it.\" Misty said she gave slap to Ash's buttcheek causing him to yelp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it to the camp site where Misty showed Ash to Rhydon. \"Hey Rhydon, doesn't Ash look better like this.\" She said presenting Ash.\" Rhydon looked at Misty confused and used one of its fingers to undo Ash's wedgie. Which he sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty rolled her eyes and shrugged her shoulders. \"Guess you don't get the joke. Oh well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty then proceed to set the fire and hit the sleeping bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh put his sleeping bag so he could have a clear view of the rhyhorns. Misty watched Ash and smiled. \"<i>All things considered, I'm glad to be your mentor Ash. I will make a great trainer.</i>\" Misty though to herself as she dozed off.</span></div></div>",

Kinda of like how he would in 3... 2... 1... \"What was that?\" he asked as he turned toward the bush and Misty stopped climbing halfway down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ursa.\" came a voice with a high pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please no.\" said Misty. <i>Wait, the pitch in its voice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, it was not a dreaded Ursaring that came out, but rather an adorable little Teddiursa. One that didn't seem to be very bothered by the two trainers either. \"Whew.\" said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for a second or two I thought we were in danger. Now let's get you down and get moving before this little cutie's mother shows up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did just that, quickly getting themselves back on their path in the hops of avoiding any more fearsome Pokemon. By now, Ash had completely forgotten about trying to avoid getting underoos. Misty, however, had not forgotten about getting them when they reach town and began making plans for when they arrive. <i>So, first things first when we get to town, get Ash some underoos.</i> Thinking some more, she tacked on, <i>make sure the fit is at least a little tight on him.</i> After that, they could ask around for safe areas to look for a water type that Ash would be needing. Because there was no way she planned on accidentally wandering into more danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>1 Hour later</b></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts amazing how fast you can move when you're worried about danger. The two of them turned an hour and a half trip into just an hour. They had been in such a rush that Ash almost went towards the city without his pants. Thankfully, Misty was kind enough to stop that from happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing as he remembered his state of undress, he thanked her and hurriedly put his pants on while hoping no one would see. Before he could get his belt on, however, Misty grabbed the waistband of his briefs and started pulling on them. \"AH! Hey, what are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a minute.\" she said as she continued hiking his briefs up his back until they reached the halfway point. Then, after stuffing his stretched briefs under his shirt to hide, she wound his belt tightly around his waist to lock his wedgie into place. \"There. Just because you're getting your pants back, doesn't mean you're getting out of your punishments. Now come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right.\" said the young trainer as he struggled to walk with his wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've still gotta get you those underoos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh froze up as he finally remembered that and debated if he should risk making her mad by trying to talk her out of it.</span></div></div>",

Pikachu's small hands took a few minutes to get the briefs freed from the branch, but he managed, causing Ash to fall a short distance to the ground, landing on his butt. \"Ow! Okay, could have thought that through better. No problem though, now I just have to wait for Misty to get back and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly his mind froze as it dawned on him that, yes, Misty would be coming back, and she had his clothes. he couldn't go anywhere himself now, and he knew that she'd be mad when she saw him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like slapping himself as he realized how bad this would probably go over for him. \"Please be merciful, please be merciful...\" he began praying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>20 Minutes Later</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!

The lake's water smelled amazing, it was clean as can be, the color was almost like a sapphire that melted into a liquid form, and the best part of all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They had the area to themselves, considering that there were no other humans but Misty and Ash in the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Ash, now that we're here, let me show you what I got ya!\" Misty said as she held the paper bag up and opened it for Ash to see inside. And what Ash saw inside of there was something that made his jaw drop rather comically as he took the article of clothing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, 'swimwear' would be more appropriate, considering that what he held in his hand was in fact a speedo colored yellow like a bolt of lightning one would see in various artists' depictions, or on various electric type Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly thought of you and Pikachu when I saw this, believe it or not!\" Misty chuckled as she closed the bag; \"Anyway, I'll just let'cha change into those bad boys in private...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...\" Ash stammered as he looked around until he found the perfect spot to change in private.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty whistled to herself as she twirled her mallet around, obviously trying to pass the time while she waited for her younger companion/pupil. Pikachu looked at the weapon in question, rather curious as to how Misty could carry that thing around in her backpack without being affected by its weight (or fit it in there, but that's beside the point). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, considering that this was the same tomboy that heaved  Ash out of the lake during the Spearrow incident with a fishing rod the way one would with a fish, than it should come to no surprise that she'd be able to easily twirl her mallet around like a baton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Ash... He walked out from behind some shrubbery, clad in only his new speedo while carrying his clothes and hat back to the spot where they were and placed them near his backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they actually look sharp on you!\" Misty said as she put her mallet away and walked over to Ash to look over him. \"Definitely made the right call...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...\" Ash said with a bashful smile as he rubbed the back of his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you go on ahead and begin your search. In the meantime, I'll change into a swimsuit of my own and meet up with you, sound good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah, sure!\" Ash said, surprising the urge to turn pink from the thought of seeing Misty in a swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... Better get your butt moving rookie...\" Misty said as walked off to find some privacy, though not before giving him a friendly swat on the aforementioned butt to help Ash get started. It worked of course, with Ash hopping a bit while holding his yellow clad cheeks from the unexpected smack. Ash then proceeded with moving towards the bank, being careful as to not potentially scare some of the lake's residents.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, it did not take him long to remember that he had a search to begin. <i>Hmmm, where to start?</i> Unsure of where to begin looking, Ash swam farther into the water and began looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>2 minutes later...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh swam far enough back toward the back so that he could stand in the more shallow water, wondering how to continue.

Although the best place to see one in the wild would be a lake as perfect looking as this one.\" Misty answered, still sounding confused and uncertain as to why this one was following Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought for a moment before saying, \"Well, if they're usually urban, then do you think that means she wants to go into town or something?\" Thinking again, he looked at the Vaporeon and asked, \"Are you bored here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a nod and a quick \"vay\" in answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's smile widened, \"So do you wanna come with us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave another \"vay\" and what seemed to be a shrug in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty just stared in bewilderment. <i>A bored, wild Vapereon.

First of all, seeing as we're still at the lake, we won't be changing out of our swimsuits until I feel we're done.

She could hear him explaining to his new blue friend what they were going to be doing and waited for him to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, first I need to figure out what attacks you can do.\" Ash said, not noticing how Misty's evil little fingers were inching closer to his backside. maybe we could start with AH!\" he shouted as his speedo started getting yanked upward. \"Ah, what nOW!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty laughed as she tugged on his swimsuit.. \"I said, I was gonna test your focus,\" she said as she tugged up hard enough to briefly lift his feet off the ground before letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stumbled forward. \"O-okay.\" he muttered. \"Fine.\" He decided not to argue this time, instead he would try to get through this quickly. \"I'll just- gurk.\" He felt her pulling on his speedo again. Rather than he resist or argue, he tried to think of an attack to call out for Vaporeon, not noticing how the small Pokemon was staring at him and Misty with interest. Misty did though. <i>Come on, think of a move, any move.</i> \"Ugh, watergun!\" he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Vaporeon looked up and blasted a strong stream of water into the air, making it briefly rain as Misty stopped pulling, but still held on. \"Okay, that's one down. Let's see what else she's got.\" A mischievous idea came to her mind. \"And I think I can even help you with the next one.\" She yanked hard on Ash's speedo, lifting the now squeaking boy off the ground and turning him so that his butt now faced Vaporeon. \"Let's try for a tail whip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon shouted her name as she charged forward struck her tail against ash's backside just as Misty let go of his speedo, knocking him back onto to land. \"ahhhh owhowowow...\" he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ash, we've got plenty more work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd work they did. Fortunately, the worst of the training session was over for Ash. Misty had continued pulling on his briefs, but only enough to make him squirm while he practiced with Vaporeon. And she did have a fairly nice arsenal. Ash soon discovered, with some aid from his Pokedex, that Vaporeon could also use Helping hand, tackle, and quick attack. At one point, she had tried to demonstrate sand attack, at least it looked like she was trying sand attack, but didn't seem to have it down yet. No matter though, that could be the first thing they work on next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ash, I'd say this was a productive use of our time. Wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" he answered back. \"I'm just gonna go change back into my clothes.\" Just as he started to do so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 2: Nothing stops him.

Their brief introduction had been quite pleasant, and Brock was looking forward to seeing what his opponent had in store for him. He wasn't sure what, but something told him that there was something special about this kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first round saw Ash's Pidgeotto go up against Brock's Geodude. Pidgeotto, following Ash's commands, staid up high and moved quickly to avoid any attacks that Geodude sent up. Although sending out attacks that could do enough damage proved to be a bit more difficult, as Geodude seemed able to weather every Gust of wind sent at him, and moving in close for Peck quickly became too risky after the first two attempts. In a surprising turn of events though, Ash managed to wrap up the fight when Pidgeotto, rather than Gust, ended up sending out a Twister attack, knocking the rock type over and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second round proved to be a bit surprising against Onix's endurance when faced against Vaporeon. The stone snake held up against the first water gun sent at it and immediately put Vaporeon on the defensive as it was forced to dodge. Ash had Vaporeon dodging left and right, and even using quick attack to rush away from an Iron Tail. It took several more well timed water gun attacks amidst frantic dodges to finally bring the mighty beast down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Ash had earned his first gym badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Misty and Ash were preparing to leave the gym, Brock stopped to congratulate the younger trainer again. \"...and I've gotta say, your Vaporeon, moves surprisingly fast. How did you get her to be that quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rubbed the back of his neck and laughed awkwardly. \"Honestly, I think that's all her. I haven't really had the chance to train her for speed yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock nodded. \"Well, Pokemon can get a lot stronger on their own than we sometimes give them credit for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sometimes it's less about training Pokemon to be stronger and more about figuring out what they can already do and what the best way to do it is.\" Misty added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh took in this information, knowing that it would be useful later on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>What happens next?</b></u></span></div></div>",

And with both parents out of the picture, it was up to Brock, not only to keep the gym running, but to also act as the man of the house (at the age of 15); providing the best that he could for his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from this, Misty and Ash also made sure to tell him about the salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this guy know about me?\" Brock asked. \"This sounds pretty suspicious...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, we feel the same way.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll help you find the guy if you want!\" Misty said; \"Maybe after you two meet, we'll get the answer we need...\" <br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the duo, accompanied by Brock, searched for a while, they finally found the salesman, who was just getting back  from the woods.

Until the three gasped when the man removed his beard and hat, to reveal that he looked almost EXACTLY like Brock, save for being much older, and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I <b>KNEW</b> there was something familiar about him! </i> Misty thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?!\" Brock said; \"What?

If I couldn't be good enough to use something other rock type Pokemon.... Than what good could I be as the man you and your siblings look up to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock's fists clenched; \"So you left because you thought we'd all be better off without you?! Well guess what?... That's the biggest load of <u><b>bullshit</b></u> I've ever heard! If we really were better off, than we wouldn't be asking ourselves when you'd come home! It doesn't matter whether or not you'd be good enough as a trainer! What mattered to us has always been you being there for us! As a father should! This gym and everyone living in it needs you! I don't care how little you think of yourself, I won't let you walk away from your own family again! Not when they need you most!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty, Pikachu, and  Ash stood there, their mouths agape as they listened to Brock chewing out Flint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son...\" Flint struggled to find something to say, until tears rolled down his cheeks as he looked at his eldest son; \"I don't see how you could still need me, even after my failure. Even after I <b>hurt</b> you and the other kids.... I'm not just a failure as a trainer... I've failed you as a father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you haven't looked hard enough...\" Brock said, now with a more visibly relaxed posture. \"Maybe you failed as a trainer, but you still have a chance as a father. If you really want to make up for everything we went through. Just... Please come home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...All right...\" <br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reunion between Brock's siblings and their father was, suffice to say, emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint apologized to everyone for leaving, promising to never leave the way he did again, with conviction in every syllable of his words. And everything settled down, he talked to Brock again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, I want to thank you and those kids for helping me snap out of my foolishness... You're growing to be a good, strong man. Which is why, I want you to do what I never did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, are you saying--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Brock...\" Flint said sternly; \"I still recall that you have a dream as a Pokemon breeder.. And if you want to achieve it, than get out there and show what you're worth. You can't do that by staying here, because to deny you of your passion would be wrong. Besides... I think those kids could use your level-headedness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock looked at him with disbelief, but gave a small smile; \"I'll do it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint gave a smile of his own as he put a hand on his boy's shoulder; \"Good... I have a feeling, you're going be something great.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock met up with Ash and Misty, who were playing with Brock's younger siblings until they saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Brock told them about his talk with Flint, the two looked at each other with a surprised look on their face, than at the young gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, now that we've thought about it, I think we have room for our little group.\" Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika!\" Pikachu said as he leapt onto Ash's shoulders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it buddy!\" Ash said to his Pokemon, scratching him behind the ears.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the duo had become a trio, as Brock, Misty, and Ash made their way from Pewter city to the next one.</span></div></div>",

Maybe you should go check on her while I get the rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh considered that for a moment before turning to his Pikachu on his shoulder. \"Pikachu, do you think I should go talk to her.\" he got a frantic nod and a \"Pika Pi\" in response. \"Okay then, I'll go over and do that.\" His course of action set, he started following after her. \"I hope this goes well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>So how does it go?</b></u></span></div></div>",

I don't know how I could've gone so far without your guidance! Heck, I'm surprised you saw anything worthwhile in me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not that Ash would say it, but he actually was growing fond of Misty's tomboyish attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled as she walked over and got Ash's underwear off his head, proceeding to then pull him up into a hug; \"You have no idea how much I needed to hear that...\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Misty saw how he reacted, and realized that it was because of the two advantages she had over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, Misty was a much more skilled battler than Ash was, along with having more experience than he did. Heck, the only reason he did so well at Pewter gym was because Brock, despite being more experienced than he was, didn't expect Ash to be as skilled as he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, she was still his coach/mentor. Considering they'd been traveling for a while, she'd know how he thinks in a Pokemon battle, especially since she was the one helping him with his battling skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, there was a possibility that she'd crush him in an all out Pokemon battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...\" Misty said with reassurance in her voice; \"For this battle, it'll be different from a regular gym battle.. The point of our battle won't be for you to beat me. It'll be to test your skill, and how well you apply it. If I think you've proven your skill well enough, the match ends with you winning the badge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh relaxed a bit more, but was still nervous regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's sisters, and Brock, looked at her with astonishment, but ultimately didn't object.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone went to the pool, where everything was getting set up for the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ash went  to his side of the pool, Violet walked up to him a bit sneakily. Proceeding to give him a bit of a tug on his tighty whities up to his lower back before letting them snap back into his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ash stiffened up as he turned to face Violet;  \"What was that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax shortstuff. First, that was for luck... Second, I just wanted to see why Misty gives these so much. Gotta say, the reaction on your face was <b>priceless</b>!\" she cackled a bit as she skipped merrily away from the boy as Ash stuffed his briefs back into his jeans, grumbling to himself until he finished and went to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Misty stood across on the other side of the pool from Ash, who appeared to be doing his best to ignore the voice in his head as she instructed him back in Pewter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This match will allow only two Pokemon each! If the challenger shows enough skill that Misty deems satisfactory, then he will earn the Cerulean gym badge! Let the battle.... BEGIN!\" </span></div></div>",

While he wasn't exactly the practically guaranteed win that Misty's sisters had called him, Pikachu's electric power would give him a good leg up and head start in the fight. \"Alright, Pikachu, I choose you!\" he called out with his arm outstretched as Pikachu... wasn't there. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika.\" the electric mouse popped up from behind his left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled as he saw his small friend. \"Oh, there you are.\" Well, now let's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika Pi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, is something wrong?\" Ash was rather confused, and hoping that nothing bad had suddenly happened to Pikachu. Said Pokemon began explaining, by which I mean saying its name in different tones and gesturing about randomly, the issue. \"Soooo, you're saying you don't wanna fight Misty because she's our friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika.\" A nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty stared in bewilderment, wondering how this kid seemed to attract so many odd Pokemon. It was only a bit strange when Pikachu seemed to absolutely HATE the idea of going into a Pokeball, but now there's this. <i>Not to mention that whole thing with Vaporeon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead was about to say something, only to be cut off by Ash, \"So can you tell me why?\" he asked his Pikachu calmly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a few more gestures and and bit of Pokemon speech in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're worried about hurting her Pokemon?\" He got a nod in response and, much to Misty's surprise, smiled. \"You are really are nice little guy, aren't ya?\" Pikachu smiled a bit and nodded while awkwardly scratching its head with its tail. \"Still, you don't have to worry about that.\" he said while petting Pikachu a bit.\" Just think o f this as a spar, not a fight. Friends do that all the time.\" Pikachu seemed to be mulling that over for a moment before Ash said one more thing that he new would spur Pikachu on to fight. \"Besides, I'd be a little more worried about them hurting you, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock briefly took over Pikachu's face as he let out a confused \"Pika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I know you're an electric type and all, but Misty's water Pokemon are WAY more experienced.\" Misty smiled fro mwhere she was standing as she heard Ash say this. \"I'm just not so sure you'd be up to the challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika! Pikachu! Pika Pi. Pikachu!\" the small mouse said fiercely and with confidence while gesturing towards Misty, himself, and then Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" ash asked. Receiving a particularly loud \"PIKA\" in response. \"Alright then, let's see what you've got!\" Ash said as Pikachu moved forward, ready to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled, proud of how Ash handled the situation with his Pikachu. <i>You're definitely getting better Ash. Although, now I really wish I had gotten you those Pikachu underoos back in Pewter City. Oh well, I'll just be sure to pull your undies extra hard tonight.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"All right... NOW, we can begin!\" Daisy said, with annoyance from the interruption.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the announcement was made, Misty brought out a pokeball, pressing the button to enlarge it. She gave Ash a stern look that told him that he better be ready, making sure that he understood the importance of this gym battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty calls.... Seel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, a white light flashed out of the opened pokeball and onto a platform until it stopped, revealing the seal-like Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Ash immediately started off by attempting the first attack, ordering Pikachu to launch a thunderbolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Pikachu launched it, however, Seel already dived into the pool, avoiding the electric attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the trainer and his electric mouse gaped at the pinniped Pokemon's reflexes. But both snapped out of it, just in time for Pikachu to quickly duck under a headbutt from Seel, which had such speed and power that Pikachu's fur could feel a breeze blow against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Seel splashed back into the water, Pikachu scampered to the next platform on his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Seel to stealthily climb onto the platform Pikachu was on and toss him into the air with his head (thankfully not using his horn), and immediately slapped him away with his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu naturally launched a thunderbolt in mid-air as retaliation, which hit right on point. Pikachu then landed on a platform in a quadrupedal stance, as nimbly as a cat would.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty had Seel use aqua ring to recover from the electric attack to a degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Retaliating immediately, after getting hit. Even used Seel's slap to gain some distance... Not bad! </i>Misty thought to herself; <i>But now, it's time to stop prodding...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Seel dove into the water again and launched a water pulse at Pikachu, who leapt over it. Not wanting to give Pikachu time to retaliate again, Seel chased after him while lobbing water pulse after water pulse.Thankfully, Pikachu was ordered to use agility to better avoid the watery spheres. But even still, Seel was keeping Pikachu from using his electric attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was sweating bullets, as he could only watch as Pikachu was being chased around the pool, unable to send out a single thunderbolt as he scampered onto platform after platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen of course, Misty grew tired of this impromptu game of \"ring-around-the-rosie\"  and had Seel use blizzard on one of the platforms Pikachu was about to leap on. The sea lion Pokemon obeyed and leapt out of the water, blowing a gust of chilled air from his mouth onto the surface of the platform and creating a sheet of ice. Pikachu couldn't stop himself from landing on it in time, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Pikachu was struggling to get his footing back, Seel was given ample time to slam his larger body against Pikachu, sending him flying across the pool. Seel dove into the water and swam quickly, managing to leap into the air and intercepted Pikachu by spiking him into the water with his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never! if Ash didn't think of something now, Pikachu wouldn't be able to get even a single attack in before getting knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until a lightbulb flashed into his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu, wait for my signal!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi-i chuuu Pikapi, Pi pikaa Kaa...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Translation: All right Ash, I trust you...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Pikachu waited as Seel swam at him like a torpedo, getting closer and closer... Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, use thunderbolt while still in the pool!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty couldn't order Seel to get out of the pool in time, as he was still charging. Even though his headbutt connected solidly and sent Pikachu flying, Pikachu was still able to send out currents of electricity throughout the water at the moment of impact, giving Seel a good shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu landed on a platform, almost like a ragdoll in contrast to his agile movements from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeel, on the other hand (flipper?), just barely had enough strength to stay conscious and stay afloat, though the blubber coated on his his body did manage to slightly insulate him from the electricity, So regardless of his severely weakened state, he was still declared the winner, as Pikachu fainted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, who knew our little sister could kick so much butt in a Pokemon battle?\" Lily said, her eyes widening with astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She even got around the type advantage the squirt's Pikachu had!\" Violet exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock, of course, wasn't surprised in the slightest. Considering that Ash did the same thing during Pidgeotto's bout with Geodude, it was only natural that Misty could also do it; though to a greater degree, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh,  leapt onto the platforms until he got to Pikachu, lifting the little guy into his arms. Pikachu regained consciousness, giving him a little thumbs up to show that he wasn't discouraged from getting beaten by a water Pokemon. Ash smiled while  he carried him off of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were awesome out there, bud. Way I see it, you  deserve a good long rest...\" <br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pikachu was handed to Brock, Ash went back to the pool, and got out his pokeball. Thankfully, due getting severely shocked by pikachu's thunderbolt in the pool, Misty wasn't going to use Seel for the next round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, it all came down to one Pokemon each...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPidgeotto was somewhat out of the question, considering that despite having no weakness against water type moves, he still likely wouldn't fare well if his wings got too wet. Metapod's mobility was somewhat restricted, so he was a no go. This of course, left Ash with only one viable option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Vaporeon, let's show Misty what ya got!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vaporeon came out of her pokeball and was on a platform, she looked around until she saw Ash and gave him a questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ash explained what was going on, Vaporeon nodded in understanding and turned around, ready for her first gym bout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty opened a pokeball, calling out the occupant inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh swallowed a lump in his throat as he looked at Vaporeon's opponent, whom he had every right to be nervous of. Who was it you ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, a seaking, of course! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not having the gyrados' fearsome reputation; any wildlife expert, Pokemon researcher, fisherman , and those that survive an attack would tell you that these horned fish are <b>not</b> to be taken lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Seakings are powerful swimmers. They can not only swim against a river's  current, but they're even able to swim up a waterfall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) That single horn on a seaking's head isn't for show; it's a deadly weapon that trainers must hope to never be on the receiving end of, due to it being powerful enough to bore holes through boulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh did his best to calm his nerves as he got himself ready.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash knew that this battle was going to be difficult. Misty had the clear advantage. As such, he decided to be cautious, waiting for Misty to make the first. And move she did! \"Seaking, Horn attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dangerous fish rushed forward straight toward Vaporeon, who, at Ash's command, dodged and fired a water gun the was easily avoided by Seaking. \"Darn it.\" Ash muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do better than that Ash. Now, Poison Jab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Ash, Vaporeon was just as quick to dodge this time as last. Even better, an idea was forming in the boy's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water Gun.\" Misty called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge, and then circle around under Seaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Misty watched as Vaporeon dodged and swam under Seaking, coming out on the opposite of the fish. Deciding not to give Ash a moment to think, she called out, \"Horn attack!\" <i>Playing defense won't work for long Ash.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Ash had Vapoeon dodge oddly, this time having her dive down and actually jump over Seaking's attack before calling out \"Water Gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Seaking avoided the move, and Misty, getting a bit irritated by this battle turning into a game of Meowth and Ratata, yelled, \"Seaking keep chasing Vaporeon and don't use Megahorn attack until you get close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the opportunity he was waiting for yelled, \"Dive, get him following you, then swim straight up as fast as you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, still running Ash?\" she asked, honestly surprised. <i>What is he up to?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her answer soon enough as the inevitable result of their commands happened. Vaporeon leapt up from the water, actually managing to go up a good four feet with how fast it was moving, with Seaking following behind with his horn glowing and, thanks to his superior speed, closing the distance fast. \"Tail whip him straight upward!\" Ash yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Misty watched as Vaporeon did an odd turn in the air before striking Seaking with her tail and, combined with the momentum it already had, knocked him straight up to the ceiling for a hard collision as Vaporeon landed back in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep him up there with water gun!\" Vaporeon obeyed, knocking the fish back into the ceiling with the blast of water. Once Seaking started falling again, Ash called out for a tackle which Vaporeon managed to land on the now seriously dazed fish. It probably didn't help that Misty seemed just just as dazed with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Vaporeon was about to retreat away, Misty gave a few claps, causing her to pause and Ash and the the others to stare at her. \"Okay, i am officially impressed.\" Granted her Seaking definitely still looked battle ready, if a little beaten up. In fact, he looked like he wanted nothing more than to be given an attack command so that he could get some much deserved revenge for the embarrassment he just suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you are?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After a maneuver like that?\" she asked rhetorically. \"Yes, definitely yes.\" she said with pride. \"Although i have no idea what would inspire you to weaponize the gym's ceiling like that.\" She laughed a bit as she said that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh let out an elated cheer in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>What happens next?</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 1. After Ash gets the badge and Misty has a few words with her sisters, the group heads back to the inn, where Misty plans to have herself an all night wedgie session with Ash to celebrate. Oh boy.</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 2: Some other thing. I'm only putting this option here because i feel like I should give more than 1 option.</b></u></span></div></div>",

And what's more? There was a twinkle in his eye that practically glowed with exuberance from having not just earned his badge, but from actually impressing his coach/mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had a long way to go, but she had a feeling that the boy would be going places in the future. All he had to was to keep at it is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, sis? Could we talk to you in private?\" Violet asked as she tapped Misty's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Misty turned around and saw all three of her big sisters standing in front of her. \"Sure, what about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something important...\" Daisy said.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the four sisters walked out of the room with the pool, the talk began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, after we watched your match with your boyfriend, we just gotta say something...\" Lily, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Misty would've reminded her (or protest, whichever)  that Ash wasn't her boyfriend, but she let it slide since this talk was so important.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You showed some incredible skill at Pokemon battling out there Misty...\" Daisy said; \"I've never seen anyone take control of a battle the way you did. In the first round alone, you showed quick thinking, coordination with your Pokemon, and even got around an opponent's type advantage to a degree I hadn't seen before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's more? You showed a great judge in skill from seeing the way Ash battled. Heck, the kid's not too shabby of a battler himself, especially since he's learning under you. He's still a dork outside of that, but still!\" Lily said with a giggle at the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you never told us you were this good?\" Violet asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... Um...\" Misty hadn't predicted this at all. But thankfully, she regained her composure; \"See, there've been people that compared me with you, to the point where I just had enough of it! I  wasn't going to stop being a mallet wielding tomboy just to please them,  so I decided to hone my battling skills in private so I could become a water pokemon master... That way, I could become more than what THEY wanted... Yeah, sounds sappy and stupid, but that's how I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters looked at her, their faces softening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy suddenly gently pulled her youngest sister into a hug; \"I'm beyond sorry Misty... We never knew what you were going through!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't care if you're not into 'girly' stuff like us. Nor your mallet, strength, or thing with tugging underwear up someone's crack. We don't want anyone to try and dictate who you should be!\" Violet joined in. \"If anyone's got a problem, they can just get in line for a royal butt kicking from us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're our sister Mist...\" Lily said as she joined. \"We'll always love you for who YOU are, tomboy or otherwise! What matters most is that you stay true to your heart! And from the way I see it, Ash and Brock feel the way about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's eyes widened, as if time had stopped while her older sisters hugged her tenderly. Eventually, she gave a big smile and let tears of joy fall down as she hugged her sisters.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at the inn in the evening, Ash and Misty were in their room, where the boy was just finished getting changed into a new pair of red briefs with blue zigzag patterns on them. He then came out, now clad in only the undies and nothing else towards Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely made the right call with these...\" Misty smirked as she gently tugged on the waistband, letting them snap back after releasing them. \"What do you think, Ashy-boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They actually feel kinda nice, in all honesty...\" Ash said, smiling as his cheeks turned pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now, time to see if how long they last in my hands...\" Misty said, giving a cat-like grin as she cracked her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even needing to be ordered, Ash turned around and showed his butt to Misty. The tomboy than proceeded with ever so slowly grabbing the waistband with an underhand grip in preparation. Soon enough, Misty had hefted the young trainer off the floor in one clean jerk upwards towards the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh squeaked as Misty suspended him by his briefs, the material digging into him. Strangely enough, he wasn't resistant to it as usual... Could it be that he was growing accustomed to them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Mist?\" Ash winced; \"I still haven't thanked you... For making me a better trainer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give yourself some credit Ash...\" Misty giggled; \"You still put in 120% percent, that's bound to make help you in the long run!\" Misty gave the smaller boy a little bounce, as a means of sinking the briefs deeper.<br>\r\n\"Besides... By training you, I think I'm getting better myself...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Eep! So... We're basically helping each other?\" Ash bit his lower lip from the material digging into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty paused as she thought about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... I guess you could say that...\"</span></div></div>",

Oh god!\" he gasped out as Misty spun him around a couple of times by his undies. \"Probably less tha-EHHHNn you think!\" Suddenly Misty stopped mid spin and stepped back while giving a strong pull, letting the momentum further pull on the boy's underwear. \"YEOWWW!\" With her strength, she then tossed him face first onto his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good.\" she said walking up behind him and grabbing his waistband again. \"It wouldn't be quite as much fun otherwise.\" Pulling up, she briefly lifted the boy off the be before dropping him back down as he whimpered, shaking just a little bit. \"Ooh, shaking.

Th-thanks...\" he said, uncertain and blushing like crazy. <i>Oh man, how is this still so embarrassing?</i> His embarrassment and worry grew when he felt her slide her left arm through the leg-holes of his briefs. \"M-misty, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh quickly found himself lifted completely off the bed, squealing as Misty curled and uncurled her arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing some weight-lifting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The next day...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Brock was getting a new map, as Misty had thrown the previous one into the campfire on the journey to the city during one of her attempts to stall, Ash and Misty were outside the Cerulien gym saying goodbye to Lily, Daisy, and Violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really was great seeing you again sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and we hope you have a great journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And feel free to tell us about it the next time you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled. \"Thanks you guys. And I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Violet turned towards Ash. \"And Ash, we have a little goodbye present for you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes.\" she said. He did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the boy felt four, yes four, sets of hands all grab his briefs and yank upward. \"OWWWWWWHOWowow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined, and grabbing from all sides, Misty and her sisters managed to yank his briefs up to just below his chest in one go. And after some pulling, while he futilely struggled to get free, they managed to get his tighty whities up to the top of his chest. Thankfully, they did let go of him after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Violet began. \"His face was hilarious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind his face, his voice sounded... perfect.\" said Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the way he was thrashing around.\" added Lily. \"All helpless, it was as adorable as it was funny. I think I see why you do this so much Misty. even if it is weird. Well, at least with your boyfriend here anyways. I guess that's why you picked him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHehe, well...\" Misty smiled and rubbed the back of her head awkwardly. Then her mind finally processed the word \"boyfriend\" again and she seethed a bit internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, meanwhile, held his groin with only one thought in his mind. <i>a bunch of girls think I'd be good boyfriend material. And it has to be because of this!</i> Well, that and his currently immense discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>What will happen next?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 1: On their journey to the next town, while Brock puts some kind of meal together, Misty takes Ash away from the campsite to practice more with his Pokemon.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been at least a day or two since the trio started their trek from Cerulean, with Ash still feeling a bit of phantom pain from the super wedgie that Misty and her sisters had given him before they left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermillion was still a town over or so, but despite the long journey, Ash wasn't discouraged in the slightest. It kept his companions in good spirits, who gladly welcomed his infectious optimism. Misty especially, considering that outside of the wedgies she gave the young trainer, she had also grown rather fond of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock was especially important for the two, considering his talents as a cook and his perchance for being the \"big brother\" of the group. Save for his occasional \"girl-crazy mode\", he was usually the one acting as the voice of reason in moments where It was needed. It helped that he seems to have more experience with surviving out in the wilderness, likely a result of his father's teachings as well as having to take his siblings camping on occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which... Brock was already at work cooking dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked how long it'd take, he wagered it to be around at least three hour or so,  given the preparation required for the recipe he was using. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty opted to go out training with Ash to pass the time training, with Pikachu staying behind to help guard the camp. <br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Ash, I think for today, you should bring out Metapod\" Misty said. \"He could use the exercise... Though I don't know how he'd even be able to move around... Anyway, back on topic! Why don't you try and see if you can improve on the things he knows?...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded meekly, knowing there was no way for him to get out of it. He then proceeded with calling Metapod out of the pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug type jumped into the air a bit with joy, though how he could do this without legs is a mystery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, training began with Ash having Metapod improve the accuracy of his string shot by firing globs of the sticky stuff at some leaves on a branch. <br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a little while now, with Misty having not made a move on him yet. What's more? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime, after Ash and Metapod took a bit of a break. She seemed to have disappeared who knew how many minutes ago while Ash was doing target practice with his little green pal. Ash had no clue what was up, though he figured she went out to see if she could find a water Pokemon to catch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant that Ash and Metapod got back into training, this time with tackle attack, they didn't even notice that someone was watching them from the trees. Someone wearing a camouflaged jumpsuit, along with a full face mask that completely concealed the face and hair; as well as gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently but stealthily, the figure slowly crept up closer and closer, until they suddenly grabbed Ash from behind and yanked him backwards by his jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, what the heck?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetapod immediately rushed to his trainer's defense and tackled the person away, only to get pushed away as retaliation and landed on his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh immediately returned Metapod' to his pokeball. While Metapod didn't look like he was  hurt, he didn't want to risk his Pokemon getting injured for his sake needlessly. This turned out to be a big mistake, as the mysterious newcomer looked at him, and slowly walked towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping with fright, Ash slowly walked backwards. Further and further he kept his distance from the figure until he turned tail and ran, with his pursuer doing their best to make sure he didn't get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase lasted about two minutes, with Ash sweating nervously as he tried unsuccessfully to shake them off while running through various shrubbery. All this came to a close when he tried to dart to the side, only for him to be tackled to the ground by the taller figure, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief struggle, the figure grabbed him by the best on his jeans and brought him to his feet as they stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh suddenly found himself in an over the shoulder carry, much to his annoyance as he vocally protested his being taken against his will... Only for the figure to suddenly walk to a rock formation with a particularly curved shape stone on the side. They then reached a free hand into his jeans and fished around until they proceeded to hook Ash's blue briefs with green swirl design patterns not the stone, hefting him off their shoulder and letting him dangle from the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy yelped as gravity went to work on him, but then admits his struggling, he heard the figure give a familiar laughter. They then proceeded to pull their mask off to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh squirmed around as he hung by his undies; \"W-what the heck is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of the training... Basically, I pretend to be someone who wants to kidnap you and you attempt to escape. But you returned Metapod to his pokeball when he was still very well capable of defending you.\" <br>\r\nShe placed her hands on her hips and shook her head; \"Plus, you know very well he can use harden... So, mind telling me why you made such a bone headed move?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...... I didn't want to risk Metapod getting seriously hurt because of me... I... I don't think I can deal with something like that, not like when Pikachu risked himself to stop the spearrow from nearly killing me! I...... I don't want that to ever happen again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked up at him with sympathy, proceeding to get him down from the rock formation. While Ash was digging his underwear out of is bum, Misty put both hands gently on Ash's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash... I..... Look, I know how much you care about every single one of your Pokemon. But you gotta realize that, they care just as much about you as you do them; because you've shown them nothing but love, affection, and encouragement. That to them, is what makes YOU so valuable in the first place!\" Misty said; \"If they want to protect you, than they'll do it, regardless of the risks. It's not something that you can stop Ash... Any more than you can catch lightning in a bottle..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time that Ash was given to mull over these words, the two heard a rustling that came closer, louder, until a wild and rather grouchy pinsir came into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the bug type Pokemon wasn't a big fan of he idea of humans being in his territory. Just as Misty was about to send out a water Pokemon, however, Metapod popped out of his pokeball and attempted to the tackle, only to get smacked away for his troubles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetapod thankfully used harden to avoid the impact from slamming into a tree. But  the pinsir seemed intent on using his horns to do him in, so naturally, Ash attempted to distract him by throwing a stone.Just as the pinsir turned to face him, Metapod suddenly glowed, with his shell opening up to reveal-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterfree, the Butterfly Pok\u00e9mon. Butterfree is the evolved form of Metapod. Its wings, covered with poisonous powders, repel water. This allows it to fly in the rain\" Dexter's electronic voice resounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty couldn't believe what they saw before them, as Butterfree flew in front of Ash and Misty protectively. Just as the pinsir charged, however, Butterfree suddenly used string shot to immobilize him. <br>\r\nJust as the stag beetle Pokemon had gotten loose, Butterfree than flapped his wings and used sleep powder to naturally put him to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterfree floated over to Ash, nuzzling him affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled big time as he pat his Pokemon on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brock is not gonna believe this...\" Misty murmured to herself...</span></div></div>",

In fact, this bridge was probably weirder than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's odd, I don't see this anywhere on the map.\" Brock said, studying and turning around the map in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and why is it a rope bridge?\" Ash asked. That got him a couple of confused stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, what?\" Asked Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bridge over rushing rapids and big rocks.\" The boy explained, stating the obvious. \"You'd think whoever built it would make something sturdier and less likely to get taken down by a strong wind.\" Brock and Misty thought for a moment before nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that also prompted worry from Misty. \"Brock, do you see any other paths over this thing on the map?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even see this one on here.\" he answered. \"Huh, the bridge must be new or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the bridge, Ash briefly weighed their chances of getting across. <i>What's the worst that could happen?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>42 and a half seconds later...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay, irrr, and...

How 'bout giving me a hand?\" Ash asked, still hanging to the wrecked bridge and trying to pull himself the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Misty said, crouching down and reaching her right hand towards his left... and then past it towards his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come o-owhowhowhowoW!\" Ash shouted as Misty grabbed the exposed waistband of his briefs and hoisted him the rest of the way up by those. \"Ow! is this really the-Yeowch! Sorry, sorry!\" he backpedaled his complaining as she started bouncing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always a good time for a wedgie Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that settled, the two soon moved on to figuring out where the water had likely carried Brock to. unfortunately, they would be setting off a few traps along the way.

So far, they had been walking for at least half an hour, with next to no clues found at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, things had gotten just a tad too quiet around here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty.... Do you think whoever put up that bridge wanted to...? You know..\" Ash drew his index finger across his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably... Though not out of malice...\" Misty' foot unknowingly stepped on something hidden underneath a couple of leaves; \"Probably wanted to-OH CRAP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty immediately grabbed Ash and pulled him down with her to the grass, ducking just in time to avoid getting slammed into by a log on a rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes bugged out of surprise and fear, thanking their lucky stars and reflexes for avoiding such a collision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I think we better keep moving\" Misty asked herself as she and Ash got to their feet and made a run for it. <br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio dodged rocks thrown at them, narrowly avoided a pit, and other such obstacles... The next one was a tad more embarrassing, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ash had stepped on another hidden trigger, he narrowly avoided getting slammed by another log, though the seat of his pants, unfortunately, got caught on a branch as it flew by. The log naturally dragged the screaming boy along, who was now, unfortunately, hanging by his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Misty and Pikachu were about to run over and help the kid out, they fell to the ground, courtesy of bolas that were thrown and wrapped around their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about moving...\" Said a girl with dark blue hair in a braid and hair ribbon, wearing red overalls over a pink shirt. She stood over Misty, with a double barreled shotgun pointed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Misty may have been stronger than the girl, and perhaps she DID have a mallet... But with the shotgun pointed so up close to her face, she probably wouldn't be able to retaliate effectively without getting a face full of pellets. So of course, Misty complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you people get off... Thinking you can just come in here and steal innocent Pokemon from their homes whenever you want. The nerve!\" The girl said with a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think we are, Team Rocket?! I would never do what those poachers do!\" Misty said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl with the gun paused in thought as she studied Misty's reaction. Slowly putting the gun away, the girl moved cautiously and proceeded to undo the bolas that tied up Misty and Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that... I'm... Well... I'll explain later... First, we need to get your friend down from there...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed a thumb up towards poor Ash as he hung by the seat of his pants in what looked to be an uncomfortable wedgie, courtesy of the branch on the log. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Fortunately, she didn't have any trouble getting over to him. \"Hanging in there alright Ash?\" she asked, having even less trouble making a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha.\" he said sarcastically. \"Just get me off of this thing.\" Complying, she reached down and proceeded to grab his briefs. \"W-wait! \"Not li- Ah!\" And just like that, she wedgied him up and off of the branch. As the branch was clearly strong, she had no problem standing straight up so that he was now suspended by her hands on his blue with vertical while stripes undies. More unfortunately, with his pants still stuck on the log's branch, they were now pulled off and fell down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh he-\" The mysterious girl cover her mouth with one hand to stifle her laughter, not quite believing what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Ahhh!\" Ash''s hands moved to the front of his briefs, trying in vain to hide them from this new girl. \"Misty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, keep your pants on.

He then gave everyone but Melanie the \"I'm watching you gesture\" with one of his vines. He then walked up to Melanie, who picked him up and pet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that...

Her eyes locked on Ash though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ash...\" The boy looked down and saw that, without him having noticed, the wind from the vacuum had pulled his pants down while he helping Bulbasaur get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?!\" he exclaimed as he frantically pulled his pants back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile did that, Brock asked, \"Any chance you have something that can deal with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie shook her head. \"I never made preparations for having to fight off a giant vacuum. How do they even have that? WHY do they even have it? With however much that must cost, you could probably buy a hundred Pokeballs and do what actual trainers do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten his pants back on, Ash suddenly noticed that a certain someone was missing. \"Hey, where's Bulbasaur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>Outside</b></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say James, this is going even better than I thought it would.\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. With this thing on, those twerps can't even step outside. Let alone attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys.\" Meowth said while pointing to the top of the cabin. \"What's that little vegetable doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the top of the cabin, Bulbasaur remained attached to the roof in spite of the suction pulling him in as his vines shot out and swatted the vacuum away from the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of the momentary reprieve, Ash quickly ran out of the cabin and deployed Butterfree while calling out for a Gust attack. As Butterfree flapped his wings, the vacuum turned back to the cabin again. As Gust collided with the vacuum's suction, the whirling winds transformed into a truly epic tornado that slammed right into Team Rocket and their insane contraption, sending them off flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Later...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So run this by me again, you want me to take Bulbasaur because why?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As nice as it is to have him here, it just wouldn't be right to keep him here. The little village I've got here isn't exactly big enough for his bulb to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just stared at her, clearly not sure what to make of that. \"That's a thing? That makes no- YEOW!\" He was cut off as Misty gave his undies a sharp pull from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I swear, the next time we're in a proper town, I am getting you the latest book on Pokemon so that you will stop being surprised by things like this.\" With that done, she let go of his briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that,\" Melanie further explained, \"I'm worried he might be a little too good at his job. The Pokemon are getting more and more hesitant to move away from the village with him watching over them, and it's only a matter of time until I run out of room for them all. And i do think he's warming up to you. Especially with how you and Butterfree destroyed that machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought that over for a moment. He knew that he would still need some more Pokemon, and Bulbasaur would be a great choice. He already has a bug, water, flying, and electric type. Adding a grass type seemed like the next most logical choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright,\" he smiled, \"I can't really argue with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>So what comes next?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 1: Misty helps Ash practice with Bulbasaur. And while they're at it, she finds a good use for vine whip that she conspiratorially whispers to the grass type. Spanking Time!</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Option 2: While helping Ash practice with Bulbasaur, she sneakily convinces the little plant Pokemon the use Razor Leaf on Ash's pants, keeping him in his underwear for a while until she can fix them up. She will FIERCELY deny that this is sewing, it's MENDING. A skill that all people who plan to spend a lot of time in the woods should know.</b></u></span></div></div>",

She then looked down at Pikachu, a lightbulb going off in her head as she knelt  down to the Pokemon's level and whispered into his ear an interesting idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu tilted his head in confusion, but nontheless complied with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Pikachu...\" Misty flashed him a smile.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match between Butterfree and Bulbasaur soon commenced, with Bulbasaur's experience as the village's bodyguard giving him the edge as his vine whips made it difficult for Butterfree to use Tackle on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that Bulbasaur was surprisingly nimble for a squat little Pokemon, effectively dodging some string shots here and there before leaping at a tree and spring boarded towards Butterfree, who narrowly avoided getting slammed by the larger Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh knew he that if he was going this bout, Bulbasaur would need to be slowed down in some way. Than it hit him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterfree, blow him into the air with gust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterfree immediately flapped his wings as hard as he could and sent Bulbasaur flying, though he managed to stop himself by using vine whip to stop himself from being completely blown away by wrapping around a tree branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saaaaaur!\" Bulbasaur gritted as he tried to formulate a plan to launch a counter attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, send some stun spore into the air currents!\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButter free did just that, letting the gust carry the spore over to Bulbasaur, effectively paralyzing him long enough for Ash to send a pokeball out and officially catching him. <br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying their goodbyes (with Melanie telling Misty to be a bit more merciful on Ash's underpants), the group eventually found a place to stay for the night, where Misty was waiting for Ash to get back from practicing with Pidgeotto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ash walked into the room and closed the door behind him, Misty looked his way with an innocent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Ash, I was thinking a little bit about how Bulbasaur might feel as member of your team. So I had Pikachu talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh raised an eyebrow at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I was able to guess, based on Pikachu playing charades, Bulbasaur was fine with it. Though aside from the battle, he thinks he should also do a little 'initiation'...\"Misty's expression had a mischief filled glint. \"Just so you two could seal the deal..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulbaaa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh turned his head to the right and saw Bulbasaur come out from under a bed. Who gave him the same sort of expression as Misty as his vines came out of the sides of his bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\" Ash gulped as he slowly stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hat, the room was filled with the sound of swatting, and Ash's squealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was just something infinitely more embarrassing about having her remove his pants for him. Nonetheless, she still continued her actions and removed his pants. \"And the pants are off. Now one more touch.\" Grabbing the back of his briefs, she yanked upwards to expose more of his butt, making him wince. \"And now we can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeep!\" Ash squealed as Bulbasaur's free vine whipped his backside. \"OW!\" A vine-shaped red print could already be seen forming on his backside. The swats to his butt not only continued though, they started gradually picking up speed while the boy squealed and his redheaded mentor kept her eyes locked on his backside, enjoying the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>A few days later...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, any idea where we are right now?\" Misty asked. \"I feel like we've seen that same rock like five times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that one's bigger than the last one.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that still doesn't help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed. \"Brock, you've got the map. Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the map, Brock traced over the last spot he was sure they had been over to the the direction they've been going. \"It looks like we're in the middle of nowhere.\" That got him a couple of groans. \"The good news though is that if we keep going straight, we'll reach Route 24 soon. And that'll take us straight to Vermilion City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Ash said. \"Then let's- why is it suddenly darker out?\" The trio and Pikachu found a shadow going over them. looking to it's source, they found it was a Charmander. reading over its information on his Pokedex, Ash was excited at the chance to finally catch a fire type. \"Alright! Vapoer- Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even throw his Pokeball, Ash was stopped by Misty pulling on the back of his tighty whities. \"Ash, try and be a little quiet, you don't wanna spook it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might have another problem.\" Brock said. \"Take a look at it's flame. It looks pretty small for a Charmander. I think it might need some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh considered this for a moment. if the Charmander was weak, then he could catch it easily enough and then take it to a Pokemon center. And so he tried to do just that, only for the Charmander to resist. And resist the second time when Brock tried it. After some debate, they had Pikachu go up and talk to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning, Pikachu explained, as best he could, that the Charmander was a \"he,\" already had a trainer, and was waiting for him to return. \"Huh, well, I guess there's not much we can do then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock nodded. \"His trainer should be back sooner or later and we can't exactly just take him.\" With that decided, our group started to move onward. Not noticing the subtle signs in the clouds of a storm getting ready to roll in.</span></div></div>",

Brock thought to himself; <i>Wouldn't want to be him with thouse clouds growing darker</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan, laughter akin to a flock of pidgey filled his ear.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check'em out mates!\" A boy with blue hair, a pink shirt, and jeans said in a British accent as he showed them the amount of pokeballs he had. \"Caught'em all in just an hour!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Tauros Damien, that's gotta be a record!\" One boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally~\" Damien said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... I just remembered something. Don't you have a charmander?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAD one... Little pissant was so weak that I had to get rid of 'im.

That's the way nature works after all!\" Another boy said with a horrid grin.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, Brock had just about heard enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fists clenched, Brock promptly got up from his seat and immediately walked over to where Damien and his groupies were. Due to being bigger and stronger, Brock was able to quite easily drag Damien away. He then proceeded to SLAM him against a wall by slamming the trainer's back to the wall, proceeding to pin him there by pushing his forearm against Damien's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey!

The storm outside was picking up, and Charmander was still out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Later (because I really don't feel like just writing down entire segments of the episode)...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRescuing the Charmander had proved simple enough, even with the storm raging on outside and getting a large dose of electricity.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On a fine sunny day, Brock and Ash had released Bulbasaur and Charmander out of their pokeballs for exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ash, it was so that he could gain experience in working with his new Grass type. Whereas for Brock, he expressed a desire to help Charmander get a little more confident in being with him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it started off with the two starter Pokemon practicing their respective moves with their respective trainers, until Bulbasaur unexpectedly came over to Charmander after seeing him move around in a stiff,  one directional, and linear fashion, as opposed something more multidirectional. At least, more so than his species should be, considering the speed and agility of his evolution line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the fire type explained his previous experience under Damien (who apparently only really taught him to just attack and nothing else), Bulbasaur's usual dry wit was replaced with soft understanding as he placed a vine on Charmander's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, having honed his own fighting skills from warding off trainers attempting to steal the Pokemon Melanie was attending to, he obviously knew a thing or two when it came to a fight. So it was at that point, that Bulbasaur took it upon himself to help Charmander not only learn to take advantage of his own natural speed and agility, but to also improve his technique in personal paw-to-paw(?) combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally, he began using his vine whips to fix Charmander's posture, while also explaining to him the benefits of fluidity and agility in movement, along with dodging while in the midst of combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough their respective trainers didn't speak Pokemon, they were still impressed with this little interaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled as she watched them while she leaned against a tree with Pikachu next to her legs. Pikachu's ears twitched as the mouse heard something. He then ran off to investigate, only to find that, to his shock, that the humans' bags were missing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly alerted everyone to the situation, everyone to search for whoever had taken the bags.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Give those back!\" Ash exclaimed as he looked at the culprits after the group found them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the bags were taken by a gang of squirtles, all of them wearing sunglasses. Naturally, after being hearing this, the leader of them (who had a pair that were particularly pointy and v-shaped) just seemed to tell his group to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't belong to you!\" Brock said to them sternly, only for the bipedal turtles to actually mock the humans, with one of the gang members even giving them the middle finger during the taunting. And let's just say that if Ash could speak fluently in pokemon language, he'd be LIVID if he heard what one of the squirtles said about his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, seeing as they weren't liking this one bit, the humans were  about to go on towards the gang of Pokemon and give them a piece of their mind, only for them to each narrowly avoid a Water Gun to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulbasaur growled in anger at the thieving water pokemon's obnoxious behavior, using Take Down  to knock them off their feet. Not wanting the gang to potentially outflank Bulbasaur, Pikachu and Charmander opted to join the fray (with Charmander using the previous coaching from Bulbasaur to decent effect as he avoided a Water Gun).In spite of their efforts, however well they were doing in the brawl with the squirtles, the gang of squirtles still managed to get away with the food, though thankfully that was the only thing they took as they left the bags.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, did the squirtles happen to all wear sunglasses?\" Officer Jenny asked when the gang reported the theft at the nearby town's police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It was kinda odd, yet kinda cool at the same time... Though they were still being jerks...\" Ash said, still clearly irritated from the earlier incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it was them...\" Officer Jenny muttered, pinching the bridge of her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know those Pokemon?\" Misty asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, yes...\" Officer Jenny said, with an 'I'm so sick of this crap' expression on her face; \"People around here call them the  'Squirtle Squad'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Interesting use of alliteration</i>... Brock thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Officer Jenny explained to them, the Squirtle Squad ran wild as rogues in the area they were in, on account of having been abandoned by their trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirtles themselves weren't malicious by any means, but they were notorious for being a gang of delinquents. They mainly spent their time stealing food, writing graffiti (some of them were of a crude, vulgar, and R-rated nature), causing trouble for trainers that were traveling through the area, pulling pranks, and just being overall nuisances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, with all of this in mind, the gang let Officer Jenny know they'd be on alert, now that they knew what they were dealing with.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the group were at a cafe, Ash sat there, his mind filled with quite a few things... Only to see something out of the corner of his eye. He turned his head, and saw a couple of familiar looking squirtles with round framed sunglasses seemingly walking casually,  until they suddenly took a bunch of apples from a stand, making the shop keeper yell angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of failing to stop the squirtles from taking the food from his groups own bags, Ash decided to make up for it by running off after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the others (Pikachu included) followed, their paths were blocked by a couple of other members of the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's face became more frustrated as he ran after the little delinquents outside of the woods, surprised that such small Pokemon with stubby legs could move as quickly as they did. Still, he was determined to stop them from causing himself and the others any more grief, even if it meant catching one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't, unfortunately, expect to be dogpiled after an ambush was set up. And as he was struggling, he didn't notice some light blue fingers creeping into his pants and grab his waistband. After that, the Pokemon proceeded to yank the poor boy's black and white polka dotted briefs until they were realeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  turtle-like Pokemon laughed as they made their get away, leaving Ash to continue the chase, though he moved slower as he was trying to run while prying his briefs from his crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after he managed to finally corner them somewhat, he brought out Butterfree and Pidgeotto to help .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the ensuing scuffle between his Pokemon and the delinquents, however, Ash was accidentally sent flying into the nearby lake by a stray Water Gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh brought his head above the surface of the deeper end, spitting out water. He was about to yell at them, when he heard some of the Pok\u00e9mon on the shore (even the squirtles surprisingly enough) call out a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ash was wondering what exactly the big deal was all about, he got his answer in the form of a splash from behind him. Ash's face turned white when he saw a wild seaking, looking none too pleased at him for being in the fish's territory; which gave Ash the incentive necessary to try and swim to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh may have been in decent shape as much as a boy his age could be, but he was still only human. While the seaking, on the other hand, was naturally well suited as a powerful swimmer,  moving with great agility and speed in the water despite his size, shown by how easily he blocked his path; while also managing to keep Pidgeotto and Butterfree at bay with Water gun, and a well aimed slap of his mighty tail when some of the squirrels tried to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was barely managing  to avoid getting skewered, though he still received some considerable scratches from the fish's horn during some close calls. Unfortunately, because of the slight blood loss, as well as the aggressive Pok\u00e9mon's superior speed, he couldn't keep up for long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's friends arrived when they heard all the commotion, only for their blood to run cold as they saw the speaking's horn spear through the roughed up boy's pant leg, though the tip of it still managed to penetrate the skin severely, making Ash <b>scream</b> out in pain while he was being lifted out of the water by the fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ASH!\" Misty and Brock cried out in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon suddenly popped out of her pokeball, and into the water, possibly sensing Ash's distress. Seeing her trainer in peril, she immediately latched herself onto the fish's back. Vaporeon didn't exactly use Bite, but she still made the seaking grimace in pain from the way she had latched her jaws on the back of the Pok\u00e9mon's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the seaking was thrashing about, trying to get the biting and scratching water Pokemon off of him, he actually threw Ash off of his horn quite a few meters away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Vaporeon saw her trainer had gained distance from the wild Pok\u00e9mon, she leapt off of the wild Pok\u00e9mon, slapping him away with a smack from her tail as she swam to her trainer, using her teeth to grab her trainer by the jacket and pulled him to shore, making sure to keep his head above the water.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\nUnfortunately for everyone (Ash's Pokemon included), they learned that aside from the scratches the seaking left, the wild Pok\u00e9mon also inflicted a serious looking gash on the poor boy's thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Brock was doing the best he could to stop the bleeding, he needed better medical equipment to help with the wound, either some stitches or a super potion; something from the stores selling medical supplies back in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith determination in his eyes, the Squirtle Squad's leader tapped Misty on the shoulder, and basically let her know that he was willing to help Misty save the life of her boyfriend- I mean, friend. Because he and the squad knew the area better, it was best he led Misty to the route to town and back that was quickest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two raced while everyone else stayed to watch over Ash. </span></div></div>",

I ,eh I meant, eh, I was, eh, mm, eh\" He tried to say but was too scared to make any sense. Misty then put her finger on his mouth to quiet him. \"You helped me deal with my sisters so I'll give you a painless punishment, deal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed in relief and took the deal without a second though. Sure it was a punishment but a painless one meant no wedgies or spankings and right now Ash felt he could a break from both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right though, about losing underwear.

And what's more? There was a twinkle in his eye that practically glowed with exuberance from having not just earned his badge, but from actually impressing his coach/mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had a long way to go, but she had a feeling that the boy would be going places in the future. All he had to was to keep at it is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, sis? Could we talk to you in private?\" Violet asked as she tapped Misty's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Misty turned around and saw all three of her big sisters standing in front of her. \"Sure, what about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something important...\" Daisy said.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the four sisters walked out of the room with the pool, the talk began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, after we watched your match with your boyfriend, we just gotta say something...\" Lily,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Misty would've reminded her (or protest, whichever) that Ash wasn't her boyfriend, but she let it slide since this talk was so important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You showed some incredible skill at Pokemon battling out there Misty...\" Daisy said; \"I've never seen anyone take control of a battle the way you did. In the first round alone, you showed quick thinking, coordination with your Pokemon, and even got around an opponent's type advantage to a degree I hadn't seen before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's more? You showed a great judge in skill from seeing the way Ash battled. Heck, the kid's not too shabby of a battler himself, especially since he's learning under you. He's still a dork outside of that, but still!\" Lily said with a giggle at the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you never told us you were this good?\" Violet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... Um...\" Misty hadn't predicted this at all. But thankfully, she regained her composure; \"See, there've been people that compared me with you, to the point where I just had enough of it! I wasn't going to stop being a mallet wielding tomboy just to please them, so I decided to hone my battling skills in private so I could become a water Pokemon master... That way, I could become more than what THEY wanted... Yeah, sounds sappy and stupid, but that's how I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters looked at her, their faces softening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy suddenly gently pulled her youngest sister into a hug; \"I'm beyond sorry Misty... We never knew what you were going through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't care if you're not into 'girly' stuff like us. Nor your mallet, strength, or thing with tugging underwear up someone's crack. We don't want anyone to try and dictate who you should be!\" Violet joined in. \"If anyone's got a problem, they can just get in line for a royal butt kicking from us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're our sister Mist...\" Lily said as she joined. \"We'll always love you for who YOU are, tomboy or otherwise! What matters most is that you stay true to your heart! And from the way I see it, Ash and Brock feel the way about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty's eyes widened, as if time had stopped while her older sisters hugged her tenderly. Eventually, she gave a big smile and let tears of joy fall down as she hugged her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long moments, they ended the hug. \"This is great you guys.\" Misty said. \"Before Ash, Brock, and I leave, maybe the four of us should do something together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet's face lit up, already having an idea in mind. \"Ooh, I have an idea!\" The excitement in her voice was palpable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering something that Violet had mentioned to them during the second half of Ash and Misty's battle, Lily sighed. \"You aren't suggesting what I think you are, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMhm.\" was the bluette's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I don't know.\" Daisy said. \"It could be fun. If Misty's okay with it that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ug, girls. What are you all talking about?\" asked Misty. In response, Violet came up next to her and started whispering in her ear. Slowly, a sinister grin formed on the redhead's face. \"Oh yes, that sounds perfect.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Brock went back to the inn the group had stayed at the previous night. Misty and Ash, however, were getting to stay the night with the redhead's sisters. At present, the four girls were all gathered up on the sofa in their living room, waiting for Ash to finish changing in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out Ashy-boy.\" Misty sing-songed. \"We're waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom door opened slightly, and Ash stuck his head out. \"Do I have to?\" he asked nervously <i>It's humiliating enough when it's just Misty. Now her sisters too! I think I might actually die of embarrassment!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I don't know. Girl, what do you think?\" In response, Misty's sisters all gave a resounding 'Yes.' \"Welp, you heard 'em. Get your butt out here or I guarantee you won't be able to sit down for a week. And NO covering\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\" slowly, the door opened further, and out stepped Ash Ketchum, wearing nothing but a pair of baby blue briefs with dark dark blue hearts printed on them, his face s dark shade of red. his legs shaking a bit out of nervousness and embarrassment, he stepped into the center of the room while the girls surrounded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.\" Misty said while sticking finger into the back of his waistband and pulling on it. \"You were right Daisy, these look perfect on him.\" She released the band, letting it snap back to his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, and now i see why you wanted such a little guy Misty.\" said Violet. \"He looks absolutely adorable like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I hate to admit it, that rump of his does look pretty good.\" admitted Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, meanwhile, was blushing and squirming a bit under their gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls,\" exclaimed Misty, \"I say we kick this off by...\"</span></div></div>",

Come on Misty, can't you be a little gentler?\" Ash pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No back talk!\" SWAT! The boy 'eeked' as his mentor gave him a spank. \"That makes for a good starting point girls. Don't be afraid mix spanking in with wedging. It works very well. Now Ash, lean on the front of the chair and raise your butt for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy climbed, he face a nice shade of pink. \"I-is this alright?\" he asked. He knew the that all of their eyes were on his butt and undies right now. FOUR GIRLS were staring at his undies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Turning to her sisters, she said, \"Now to start, you want to get a good grip.\" She did so. \"And pull nice and quick.\" Ash squeaked as Misty did so. Immediately after that, she began twisting the briefs back and forth while turning them from side to side, further driving in the boy's wedgie. \"You'll also want to very your movements. And remember, fell free to add some spanks.\" SWAT! SWAT SWAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEOWWwww...!\" Ash squirmed about, unintentionally making his wedgie worse and creating a more enticing show for Misty's sisters. With his wedgie in place, the girls could easily see his bare butt-cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she the show continued, Misty demonstrated more techniques to get her sisters started. The best way to do frontals, how a squeaky clean worked, the best spanking technique, etc. Bouncing him by his undies, she even explained that how to worsen a hanging wedgie and how worsening an existing wedgie can be even better than going for a new one. She made sure to limit how hard she tugged though, not wanting to risk tearing Ash's briefs with her strength. She'd leave that pleasure for her sisters. Speaking of whom, they each had their own opinion on how they wanted to proceed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet was grinning, so glad that she had suggested this. Personally, she was looking forward to ripping those briefs off him. They did have a few more pairs for him in case something like that happened. Although she definitely wanted to see if she could stretch those over his head and down to his groin first. Maybe tying them like that? <i>Eh, I'll figure it out when I get to it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy meanwhile, was thinking about trying for a hanging and spanking combo. She could already imagine hanging him up and then getting out the spatula to beat his behind. <i>Like a pinata.</i> she thought. The questions were, what she would do then. She could make him say embarrassing things, literally pull him down and tear the undies, bounce him to her hearts content. So many choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily, meanwhile, knew exactly what she wanted to do. She planned on spanking that ass of his as much as possible and giving it a nice groping. With a few wedgies mixed in. <i>He does have a nicely shaped rear end. Misty got quite lucky finding him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh meanwhile, was currently laying on Misty's lap while she gave him an, admittedly lighter than usual, spanking. Likely because she knew how much punishment his butt was in for. This thought gave him no comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's about all that I really need to cover. Now as for who should go next, I would say that...\"</span></div></div>",

To his surprise though, she did release his undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just like that.\" she said. Turning to her sisters on the couch, \"Daisy, I believe I left my little toy to your left. Could you toss it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her left, the blonde found a ping-pong paddle by her side. Grinning mischievously, she answered back with a \"Sure thing sis.\" before tossing to the pinkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching hit paddle, Lily turned back to Ash and said, \"Hope you're ready little boy, because I want you to count these for me. We're going up to thirty.\" Pulling her arm back, she got ready to swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa-wait, whatAAAHHHHhT?!\" he shouted as he felt the first stinging blow, his butt having already been made nice and pink by Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thirty. No progress unless you count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSWAT! \"YEOWWWww! Come on, that's not f- AH!\" Learning his lesson, the boy quickly called out, \"One!\" And so they proceeded, the wooden paddle continuing to punish Ash and turning his bottom a nice shade of red by the time he got thirty. At which point, he was trembling and fighting back tears. At the very least though, he could take solace in the fact that Lily was not as strong as Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, back on the couch, Misty and her other two sisters looked rather impressed. While they had been expecting more wedging, this was certainly a welcome sight. And the girl didn't seem to be done either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww. Was I a little too rough with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-j-j-ju-just a b-bi- Ah!\" The boy was suddenly lifted off the ground by his briefs as Lily carried him over to the chair Misty had been sitting on at the end of her turn and set the boy down on her lap. \"No, nonononono, not another\" SWAT. \"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what my little sis said about back talk Ash. Now relax, this won't be another spanking.\" That confused the boy until he felt her pull his briefs up, sinking them into his cheeks and exposing his butt to her. Much to his surprise though, she then let go of his undies again, and started drumming her fingers on his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you do-eeehhh...?\" The boy's face did a weird flip out as she started actively caressing and rubbing his bottom. \"H-hey! Wh-what are doing?\" he squirmed a bit on her lap. The feeling her touch was causing was... not uncomfortable, but weird. On one hand, it made his butt feel a bit better. On the other hand, there was something about it that felt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying his squirming, the pinkette answered, \"Just enjoying this while I can. Hmmm, soft, but with just the right amount of firmness. yes, my sister is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Misty suddenly blurted out, catching everyone's attention and causing Lily to stop. \"I think it's something else turn now.\" She said through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiled, enjoying seeing the green eyed monster in Misty. Nonetheless, she decided not to push it. They were supposed to be growing closer over this after all. \"Right. I suppose the next person to go should be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much fun as it is to keep her waiting, she looks like she might start bouncing in her seat if she doesn't get her turn soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bluette jumped and gave a quick cheer of enthusiasm in response. \"Thanks Lily.\" she said while giving her sister a quick hug. \"The wait was starting to get to me.\" With that, Lily took her seat back on the couch while Violet looked at Ash, who was now seated on the floor. \"Now what should I do with our precious little boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile embarrassed at being talked down to, the boy at least had the sense to avoid trying to give anything resembling back talk. \"Please be gentle.\" he whispered,being just loud enough for them to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, nope. Lay down flat on the ground, I've got an idea.\" Ash complied and Violet took a seat on his back. Grabbing the already stretched briefs, she began yanking on them, causing Ash to grunt in pain. \"Now, let's see how far I can get these.\" After several seconds o pulling like that, she changed position to sit on his legs and keep him pinned while grabbing his briefs and beginning the difficult process of getting them up to his head. After about a minute of her struggling, and Ash's groaning, she managed to hook them onto his forehead. \"Annnd... there... we... go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his briefs now attached to his head, Ash let out a few more groans before asking, \"Are you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet. Now stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, and on shaky legs, he did so. His underwear digging further into his backside in the process. \"N-now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the waistband on his head, she answered with a \"This.\" Using both hands, she continued pulling on his waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEEEeeeee aahhhhhh! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing how far they'll stretch, duh.\" Continuing her efforts, the girl pulled the briefs down to his chin while Ash cried out. While she had been wanting to see if it would be possible t stretch the briefs all the way back down to his groin, it was only when they were reaching his neck that they started popping and the waistband began to tear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that happened, Ash collapsed down to his knees and let out a quiet, \"oooowwwww...\" sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her youngest sister, Violet asked, \"So how'd I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Ash over, Misty felt pleased with her sister's work. \"For a newbie, you did really well. And I think Ash would agree. \"Wouldn't you Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid boy weakly nodded his head in response. \"I'd hate to feel what she could do with more practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Misty said, \"Welp, time to change you out of those briefs Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh;s eyes widened in shock. \"Y-you mean... right here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Misty said, \"Don;t worry, you can turn away from us while you change.\" With that, she tossed him another pair of briefs. This time a red pair that had black smiley faces on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face a shade of red darker than his butt, Ash turned around and slowly got to his feet. Hesitantly, he reached his hands down and began pulling off his destroyed briefs, feeling the eyes of Misty and her sisters on his butt. Correction, on his bare butt. Four GIRLS were seeing him while he was NAKED! Yeah, they could only see him from the back, but that was still humiliating for him. he couldn't imagine what he'd do if they saw the other side. <i>Don't think about, don't think about it! Just get the new briefs on!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the new pair in hand and the old pair off, he was about to start putting them on when he heard misty say \"Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Ash froze. \"W-what is it?\" Fear welled up inside him. <i>What if she wants to see my... my...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't his butt look great girls?\" she asked her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamelessly, Lily answered, \"Oh yes, especially with that nice shade of red on it. I can't understand why you let him wear anything but his underwear sis. I think I'd want to keep him in even less than that.\" Ash's nerves only grew at her words. That was NOT a pleasant thought. \"If I were you, I'd have his naked little rump close by so I could spank and grab it whenever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet chimed in after that. \"It does look great. Yeah, he's a bit of a runt, but he's so much fun to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" said Daisy, \"I can't wait for my turn. You're a luck girl Misty, getting him all to yourself whenever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ash's embarrassment grew, Misty smiled. By no means was she going to admit to having any FEELINGS for Ash yet. That being said, she wouldn't deny some attraction. And talking to your sisters about boys was something she'd never gotten to do before. Why not start now. \"I know, i really hit the jackpot when I found this little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Misty, c-can I...\" Ash fumbled with his words, embarrassed to asking for permission to put his underwear on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, go ahead.\" she said, while she continued to talk to her sisters. \"Play your cards right girls, and we might get to share him like this again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on his new pair of briefs, Ash felt some small relief in knowing that he was once again somewhat covered. That feeling was counteracted by listening to Misty and her sisters though. Girls talking about him positively was supposed to be a good thing, but this was much different from what he had once imagined having girls like you would be like. <i>Great, girls like me, and it's because I have a cue butt to spank and wedgie.</i></span></div></div>",

It shows off that butt of his perfectly and he looked so nervous wearing it, it was adorable.\" Her sisters giggled at the mental image. \"Anyways, you're up Daisy. Be sure to have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde smiled as she stood up. \"Oh, you know I will, just let me grab a little something from the kitchen first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daisy walked over to get a special tool for her turn, Ash couldn't help but dread the thought of whatever she might come back with. Something he didn't have to do for long, as she quickly came back with a metal spatula in hand. \"Uh, wh-what's that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry,\" she began, \"we're not getting to this just yet. First I've gotta set you up.\" Putting down the spatula, she walked over to Ash and, grabbing him by the back of his briefs, began dragging him to the coat hooks they had on one of their walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to keep up with her, the briefs-clad trainer began to ask, \"What do meee-Ah!\" Sadly, he was cut off as Daisy gave a harsher tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more questions, just do as you're told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt a pit begin to form in his stomach as his eyes finally saw the hooks he'd been brought over to. \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Now then.\" Changing tactics, the young woman suddenly grabbed the boy's briefs at the front and gave them a hard pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" His distress continued as she, with some difficulty, managed to start lifting off his feet to begin attaching his briefs on the middle hook. \"Aahhh, OWHOW! UGH!, stostopstopstop, pleeeeeEEE!\" In spite of his pleas and squirming, Daisy still managed to get him set in a frontal hanging wedgie. \"Ughhh, please get me down.\" he squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet, I still have to put my spatula to use.\" Ash's heart sank at her words. Quickly, the girl reclaimed the utensil and got in position to start. \"Hope you're ready for another round of swats pal, because I plan on enjoying this.\" And with that, she began raining down a barrage of spanks on his red and still sore backside. The boy trashed and squirmed in his wedgie as his butt was further blistered by the metal utensil. After about 20 swats, at which point Ash had actually tears forming in his eyes, she asked, \"So, did I do a good job on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice quivering a bit, the boy answered with a quiet \"y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might wanna give him a bit of break right now though.\" Misty said with a bit of concern while coming up to them. \"Poor little guy looks like he might actually be about to cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at his face and then back to his glowing red backside, Daisy agreed, \"Yeah. Better give him a few minutes to rest. Think you can get him down from there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Misty answered. reaching up to the hook, she got his briefs free, but still kept her grip on them as she led Ash back to the couch with her sisters. \"Come on wedgie boy, we'll give you a few to get ready again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" Ash said, grateful for the reprieve. The boys quickly found himself laying over the laps of the four sisters on the couch. A welcome, if still degrading, position considering the last few he'd just been in. From left to right, going from the end of the couch that his legs were on to the other, Lily, Misty, Violet, and Daisy looked over him and, sharing a quick glance, they all knew what to do. Ash's rest was interrupted as the girls' hands began to travel over him. \"H-hey, what are you YEOW!\" his attempted question was silenced as Lily slapped his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, don't go giving us any lip, we're just getting a nice feel for out little sister's boyfriend is all.\" At this point, Misty was done thinking of correcting them on that. If they wanted to think she was dating the boy, then fine. In all honesty, it probably made her, ahem, activities with him seem less weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry,\" the youngest girl added, \"we'll be nice and gentle.\" With that said, her hands began lightly caressing his bottom. making him squirm. \"See? Nice and gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's hands were on his thighs now, squeezing them a bit. \"Hmmm, you've got some good muscle here little boy. I guess all that traveling by foot is a good way to stay in shape if nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he doesn't have much over here.\" Violet chimed in. One of her hands had worked under to feel his chest while the other lightly squeezed the arm closest to her. \"Not really feeling much upper boy strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that just makes him even cuter.\" Daisy said in his defense while giving hi ma pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got that right.\" Misty added, her hands still caressing his rear end. \"You enjoying yourself Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I, uh um, hnnnn...\" The boy had no idea how to describe how he felt right now. There hands definitely felt good, and he could feel a tingle going through his body, one that had him wriggling under their touches. Lily and Misty's were having the most notable, while Violet's effect on him grew as he felt her hands begin to give his back a light massage. Daisy's hand petting his head, while demeaning, left him a calming feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he is.\" Lily answered for him. \"What boy wouldn't enjoy this kind of attention from us?\" Rubbing his thighs some more, Lily couldn't help but think of how great a day this had been. They'd all made up with Misty, they now had something new to bond over with her, and they all had this little prize right here. <i>The next time Misty visits, I think we'll have to make it a longer stay.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

We really should be getting to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gave a sigh of relief when he heard that. <i>Thank Arceus.</i> Beginning to undo his wedgie, the boy was grateful that he abused butt would finally be getting a much needed rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, does the fun really have to end so soon?\" Lily complained, Violet nodding in agreement with the pinkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, as the oldest, I have to be responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing with Daisy, Misty said, \"She's right you guys. Besides, if we go to bed now, we can still get in some fun before Ash, Brock, and I leave tomorrow.\" That last bit had the younger two more willing to comply, but another thought also occurred to Misty. Hastily, she huddled her sisters together and began whispering to them conspiratorially so that Ash couldn't hear them. Lily grinned evilly at what Misty was suggesting, while the other two giggled a bit.\" So, what do you think?\" As her sisters gave thumbs ups of approval, she turned back to the boy who had just gotten free from his wedgie and said, \"Oh Ash, my sisters and I just decided on some new house rules. Care to hear them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, he didn't. That being said, he knew that any refusal he offered would be ignored. \"Uh, sure Misty. What are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule one, from now on, boys have to be in their underwear and nothing else when in the house area. So, until we head out tomorrow, you'll be staying in your undies.\" Ash blushed, but decided not to protest, knowing it would be futile. \"Rule two, unless told otherwise, any boy who stays the night here will have to either crawl or be carried in a wedgie to move around. And rule three, boys son't be allowed to stay the night unsupervised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused by that last part, he asked, \"Uh, what does that last part mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that you'll be sharing a bed with all of us for tonight so that we can keep an eye on you.\" Before he could protest that rule, and he really would have tried, Misty had once again grabbed his briefs and hauled him off the ground to begin carrying him to the queen sized bed in Violet's room for the five of them to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!, w-EAH-ait! I-isn't that going to be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awkward? Only if you make it awkward.\" A couple of minutes later, the four sisters and Ash were all on Violet's baby-blue bed, the bed being just big enough to comfortably hold the five of them with Ash in the middle. The boy gave a squeak as he felt Lily pinch his sore butt under the covers. \"Eee, come on! Isn't this enou- OW!\" The pinkette simply tugged on his undies in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Ash, you're a guest here. Show some gratitude for the hospitality\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right Ash.\" Misty said in agreement. \"We could be making this WAY worse on you. believe me.\" Strangely enough, he did. \"I would mind grabbing a nice handful myself.\" she added before groping his butt and causing him to whimper and wriggle closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, look at him snuggling up with Misty. It's adorable.\" Violet gushed while hugging herself closer to Misty's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy hummed in agreement while giving her blue haired sister a hug and resting her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily, putting an arm around both Ash and Misty, couldn't help but agree. \"Yes indeed. And you know, as lucky as you are to have him Misty, I think he got pretty lucky getting picked up by a girl as nice as you. I know for sure that if I had him I'd have him stripped down completely so that thus undies of his don't ruin the view. Then I could have a nice look at his bare bottom unobstructed 24/7.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's embarrassment grew, suddenly very glad that it was Misty who had taken to wedgieing him and not someone less merciful. That being said, he was still squirming while she continued groping his butt. \"Uh, M-misty? Cou-NNg- you let u-UHhh-up a bit?!\" Her hand on his butt felt... well, good if he were completely honest, even if he was still sore back there. Even still, her touch was also causing a heat to rise up in him and he felt tingly again. This time in a certain area down south. He quickly found himself hugging Misty, and then biting his lip to stifle his whine when she did let go. A small bit of sound still escaping him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Lily muttered, pausing to yawn, \"he is definitely lucky to haaaave, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the five residents of the bed began falling asleep. Although one of them, a certain boy in his undies, felt an oddly frustrating feeling of unsatisfaction in him as he struggled to sleep, hugging his redheaded mentor tighter.</span></div></div>",

You'd crush them easily. Besides, I'll think of a way for you to earn it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded and took the badge from Misty's sister. After that, not much was said.

Brock decided to sleep as Ash was about to do the same Misty opened the door. Pikachu was happy to see again and so was Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Misty, where have you been?\" Ash asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me to the woods Ash,\" Misty replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Pikachu and Ash looked at each other confused but did as she said and followed her. <br>\r\n--------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked Misty spoke.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you think of my sisters?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh replied. \"Yeah, they're..... eh, they don't seem to be interested in gym battles... for a bunch of gym leaders.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're more interested in looking beautiful and performing. They do love Pokemon, in fact they take really good care of them. They just have all most no interset when it comes to Pokemon battles. Probably because they don't how to battle.\" Misty said signing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought for a moment and spoke. \"Why don't you show them then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looked at Ash with an eyebrow raised. \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean why don't we battle tomorrow in front of your sisters? Should them what you're made of. Should them how much fun Pokemon battles are when you know what you're doing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was surprised \"I don't know, Are you sure Ash? I mean- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What afraid you'll lose?\" Ash said cutting Misty off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh cut her off again \"I already took the badge from them, so maybe the only reason don't wanna battle me is because you'll lose.\" he said pretending to be cocky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can beat you easily!\" Misty said annoyed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then let's bet on it...\"  Ash took a deep breath before speaking. \"If I win I get to give you a wedgie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty raised her eyebrow as she heard this. \"And if I win what happens?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grew nervous, \"I-if yo-you win, eh, you'll get to.., to... to... eh, buy me underoos...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty eyes lit up and smirked. \"Oh it a deal!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way to the woods, as soon as Misty stopped by a tree she turned to Ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, do you remember the hanging atomic wedgie I gave you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shivered at thought of that wedgie \" How could I? It was the worst one you gave me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I gave you one version of it, I'm going to give you the other version.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's heart sank. \"What?! W-Why?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see this tree? Your badge is at the very top of this tree in a small case. Now when I give you an atomic wedgie and then hang you by your legholes on the lowest branch, I will quiz you, for every right answer you give I will carry you to a branch higher, you will also get spanked with my paddle 5 times. If answer wrong you will remain on the branch but still receive your spanking. This will continue until you can reach the case and grab it or throw in the towel, it's your choice. This will be painful so I even brought this lotion for your rear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gulp nervously. The wedgie alone sounded painful and far worse than the other hanging atomic, he looked up at the tree it was really tall. He knew this was going to long, painful and ever so humiliating... But still, he wanted to be the greatest pokemon master and becoming that meant more to him than anything. Ash looked Misty in the eyes and said... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it... whatever it takes... I'll do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled at his determination. \"We'll see, Now then strip down till your underwear.\"    <br>\r\n            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

After getting Ash to tell her what size briefs he wore, and choosing to look for underoos one size smaller, she had begun her search with clear enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was showing him a package that contained blue briefs with pokeball prints. \"Uh, they're fine...

I guess we'll just get these, and these two.\" Presently she held three packs that each were labeled as having six pairs.

Then his face reddened as he noticed what his Pokemon was holding. \"Are those...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, these will make a great addition Pikachu.\" Misty said as she took the package of Pikachu themed underoos from the small Pokemon. \"You're certainly more helpful than your trainer, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh just stared in disbelief. <i>Oh come on!

Of course, his embarrassment increased ten-fold as he noticed the cashier was girl in her who looked to be in her late teens. A cute girl in her late teen.

And it looks like I wasn't able to keep your clothes from getting wet either, hehe.\" Proving her point, Misty held up the boy's pants, shirt, and the rest of the clothes that he'd handed over to her on the way over. \"On the bright side though, your underoos should still be dry in their packages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bright side...\" said Ash, not sounding thrilled. At that moment though, he felt the Lapras' gaze on him and turned toward her to see the young Pokemon swimming towards the edge of the water near them. her eyes not leaving Ash. \"Huh, she sure is staring a lot. Think she wants to be friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty just shrugged, completely unsure of what to do. \"Maybe? She might might be feeling a little lonely out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Ash walked toward the Lapras. Once he was right in front of her, the two locked eyes for a moment. The Lapras tilted her head, prompting Ash to do the same. Carefully, he reached out and patted her on the head, causing her to nuzzle into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty cooed at the sight. \"Awwww, she's pretty nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh turned towards her to reply, and it was then that Lapras made her move. As soon as the boy's eyes were on the redhead, Lapras used her teeth to grab the waistband of Ash's briefs; pulling him up and tossing him into the water behind her. \"AHHHH-!\" SPLASH. The Lapras laughed as Ash's head popped back up, spitting out the water in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright Ash?!\" called Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i'm Fi-ii-aaaahhhh-IIIINNNNE!\" Ash began struggling and shouting as the Lapras grabbed his briefs again and began dragging him around the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty couldn't help but laugh at the sight. <i>I hope she'll agree to come along with us. She could help me out with Ash whenever we're around enough water. And it would be a shame to leave her here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ash's desperation to escape from being dragged around by his briefs, briefs that had already been stretched out throughout the day, drove him to a new tactic: Begging! \"OW! Ah! Please please sto-AHHHhhhp! Ahhhhh, UHHhh, ow, PLEASE, my briefs are killing meeEEE!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she'd had enough fun, the Lapras rushed back over to the edge of the water and tossed the boy back onto dry... with the unfortunate side effect of also pulling off his briefs. She did toss them back at him though, the briefs landing right on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on his stomach and realizing what was on his head after a moment, Ash frantically shoved his briefs down in front of his groin while getting into a curled up sitting position. <i>Crap, if I try putting these back on, Misty might see something.</i> True, he was only just barely keeping certain areas out of her view now. Seeing her giggling, Ash asked, \"Uhhhh, Misty... do you think you could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say anything else, the girl calmed herself and said, \"Hang on a sec nude lad.\" He blushed a deeper red than he ever had before. She didn't pay that much attention though as she turned towards the Lapras. \"Hey, how would you like to come along with us? Your new friend there is kind of in need of a water Pokemon to help him out and I'm sure you'd like to spend more time with him.\" Hearing the offer, the Lapras nodded eagerly. \"You catch that Ash, looks like we've got a new friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, great...\" said the embarrassed and nude boy. <i>Just what I need, someone else to pull on my underwear and strip me.</i> \"So can look away now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing him a package of his new underoos, the blue ones with pokeballs, she turned away and said, \"Sure, but since you won't need to do anymore swimming you're putting these on now.\" Groaning with more embarrassment, Ash did as she asked. In his opinion, having just these underoos on was just a small step better than complete nudity. Once he got his new underwear on, Misty gave him a once over and her opinion. \"I new i had good taste, these look juuuussst right on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face still red, Ash asked, \"Can I get the rest of my clothes back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet.

Which means-\" she let go of the underoos, causing the elastic to snap back to Ash's butt, feeling like a spank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOWCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's that.\" Giggling, she grabbed his underoos again, yanking him off his feet and starting to spin around with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh yelled as his underwear tore into his backside. \"Pleeeheeease staaahhhhp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful what you wish for.\" Ash grunted in pain as she pulled straight up to help stop the spinning before dropping him on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the snap back isn't the only plus.\" Sitting down on his back and using her legs to keep his arms from resisting, she took his underoos in hand once more and began pulling much harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH! Ah, owowowhowowOWOWOWOW!\" Ash squirmed beneath her, trying and failing to get free or at least make her let up. \"Please! My butt AH feels like it's burning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring that, that stopped pulling towards her and instead pulled his briefs straight up, exposing his bare bottom. \"Oh, cute butt.\" she mumbled. Ash's blush deepened. \"Anyways, as I was saying, the other benefit of their stretchiness is that they can a lot more punishment and they'll still just...\" she released her hold ob his briefs, causing them to rocket down to his backside with a loud SNAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooowwwwwww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...snap right back, good as new.\" she finished with a smile. \"Great right? Now we can throw away your old tighty whities as soon as we get back to the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, still squirming beneath her and with his butt in agony, groaned at that thought. <i>Perfect, looks like I really will be stuck with underoos now. I really can't catch a-</i> \"GAHHhhhhh!\" His thoughts were cut off as she resumed pulling on his undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurred to Misty. \"And while we're at it, we'll get rid of those swim trunks I saw in your bag too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Wh-what?! WHY?!\" he asked, dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I think you'll look much better swimming in your underoos from now on, and what I say goes.\" Standing up, she pulled her student off of the ground by his underoos and straightened out his posture. She could just imagine what was going on in his head with her latest news delivered. \"Now, since you did so well befriending Lapras, I've decided that...\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, Misty had also decided to decided to once again lock him in a wedgie, pulling up his underoos to the middle of his back and tying on his belt to keep the wedgie in and using his shirt to hide the stretched out blue material covered in pokeball prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere first stop after that had been to visit a Pokemon Center to make sure that Lapras was in good health. While Nurse Joy hadn't the slightest clue what a sea fairing Pokemon was doing in a lake, she was able to report that the young Lapras was in good health. After that, the pair of trainers just had one more thing to do before they could find a place to stay the night at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to do this?\" Ash asked as he stood in front of the dumpster, holding a bag that contained all of his tighty whities and his swim trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty just sighed in annoyance. \"For the 3rd time, yes. Like a I told you earlier Ash, you're wearing underoos from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill trying to put off the inevitable, he tried arguing, \"But isn't it a waste to just throw them out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting annoyed, Misty's answer made the boy's choices clear. \"If you want, we can put your tighty whities and your trunks to good use tonight, and I guarantee you won't be able to wear them again afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect that had on Ash was obvious as he tossed the bag into the dumpster frantically. \"No!\" And with that, he was stuck wearing underoos for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a place to spend the night was pretty easy after that.

A task that would have been eager if he had also removed his pants, but he was far from eager to remove his clothes again. Unfortunately, just as he started fixing them, Misty grabbed the still exposed waistband of his undies and yanked them up. \"Ah! Wh-AH-t the heck Misty?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're out of sight, we can pick up where we left off earlier.\" She suddenly yanked him up off the ground by his underoos and tossed him onto his mattress. \"First things first, you're a bit over dressed for the occasion.\" In about thirty seconds she had reduced her companion to the state he was in at the lake, removing his shoes, socks, shirt, and pants. \"Perfect! Now the fun can begin. Let's start by giving you a new hat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh soon found himself relieving the wedgie he'd been given just that morning as Misty started hiking his underoos up to his head. \"OWWWOWOOOOWw! AHHhh, PLEASE, mercy!\" he begged as his undies began reaching his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh quit whining. These are even stretchier than your old ones so I can do a lot worse.\" Her eyes drifted towards one of the rungs on the bed post and a wicked idea entered her mind. \"In faaaaact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding him face down on the bed, she increased the strength of her pulling. \"W-wai-OW-wait! What owwww!\" Tugging harder still, the girl yanked his underoos higher above his head until they could reach the rung and started tying the undies around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnnnd therrrre weeee, GO!\" she finished, looking proudly at her work before flipping Ash over onto his back to take in his pained expression while also twisting his wedgie in tighter. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH! Owhowow! \" his hands reached up toward the knot, but hers quickly grabbed his and stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up up up, no ruining my hard work.\" She made sure to maintain her position on top of him to keep him from moving back and lessening the wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAh, ugh, come on Misty.

Oh this was too rich for her to just ignore and pretend that she didn't see. At this point, she figured it'd be nice to shake things up a little, maybe have some fun with her dork of a friend. Plus, maybe it would teach him to pull his pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, May crept over, and reached her hands ever so slowly to where the waistband was.</span></div></div>",

Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis female friend smiled at him from behind. \"One you shouldn't let your pants sag.\" She gave his briefs a sharp, painful yank, making him whimper. \"And two, Pokeball briefs? Seriously?! I think Max has a pair these at home. Maybe. He actually moved on to more big boy undies. Can't believe you wear these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh squirmed, both from physical discomfort and in embarrassment as his blush deepened. \"Th-they're comfortable.\" he weakly argued.

Not that he ever intended for anyone to find out about them though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeaaAH!\" Ash practically screamed as May pulled hard enough to lift the boy off the ground and then spun to the left.

SO much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe May was this strong. At least with Misty it made sense, due to both being a swimmer, AND because  she carried that big mallet of hers around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not so comfortable now are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. May, please let me down!

Naturally, she strolled over there with Ashy-boy in toll, ignoring his protests all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waistband was hooked over one of the formations, leaving Ash to dangle four feet off the ground, his upperbody dropped downwards and his butt sticking up in the air while he hung by the briefs. In the time it took for Ashy-boy to squeal and struggle in discomfort from the effect of \"undies plus gravity\", May had climbed down from the rocks and slyly pantsed him without him noticing until he stopped squealing and struggling long enough to notice what she held in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, May? Can I please have my pants back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you asked nicely, buuuuut you're still losing your pants privilege until I say so...\" May said as she stood there with a cheeky expression. \"Maybe this'll teach you to appreciate the value of belt~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or at least give me back my pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay giggled as she gave him a small push, making him to sway in his wedgie and causing him to whimper as the fabric of his briefs began to grind even further into his backside and groin. \"Aw, but where's the fun in that.

What he'd done had been fairly simple, he'd tried raiding his sister's panty drawer. His curious young mind had been eager to nab a pair, he could still remember his hands shaking as he'd opened her panty drawer. Something he remembered more clearly was the pain his backside had felt after May had walked in caught. She'd given his briefs a nice stretching, hung him up by them, and had threatened to get him his own panties if she ever caught him doing that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping as he remembered it all, he finally gave his sister an answer. \"Okay, I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten the answer, the girl let go of her brother briefs, letting him land on his butt with a wince. \"See, not so hard to agree is it?\" she said while watching him adjust his undies. \"Now give me your pants and shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax froze at her words. \"Whuh-why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be my insurance t make sure that you take care of Ash before Brock orI wake up tomorrow. Or, you know, you could spend the night like Ash is and I'll let you both out of your wedgies tomorrow.\" Her brother hastily shook his head as he stripped down to his tighty whities. \"Aw, you still look adorable like that. A shame you never tried going for another panty raid. I could have have put you in the cutest pairs of little girl panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's face had turned deep red.

Also, she wanted me to do this.\" Much as he didn't want to, he grabbed the older boy's waistband and started giving his underwear a pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh bit his lip to suppress his squeals as his already damaged crack was further shredded. <i>At least Max isn't pulling too hard.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Meanwhile, with May</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her tent, May was sleeping peacefully, having evil little dreams.<br>\r\n   <u>           </u>    <br>\r\n<i><b>Dream</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her dream, May was currently relaxing in a soft chair in her new home, earned by her success as a coordinator. Here, she could do whatever she wanted and there was just one rule: Boys were not allowed to wear anything but their underwear. As an example, just look at Ash. He was currently sitting on May's lap in a pair of blue briefs that had the words 'Good Boy' printed on the back. He hugged her tightly and squirmed as she groped his butt with one hand and tugged on his undies lightly with the other. \"Enjoying yourself Ash?\" she asked with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, he squeaked out a nervous \"yes\" in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay heard a door open before the voice of her younger brother sounded out. \"Um... big sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my little pantyboy?\" That was name she had given him after she had replaced his briefs with panties like the pink Skitty ones he worse now. Replaced, because she had destroyed all his briefs with monster wedgies. A few of his pairs were mounted on her Trophy Wall, where she would place the shredded remains of underwear she had wedgied off of boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I was just wuh-wonder if I could be allowed to wear briefs again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretending to think on it, she tapped her chin in thought. \"Hmmmmmm...

Meanwhile, May was trying to work out where the group was currently at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, that's what Brock thought she was doing. She had already figured it out and the act she were putting up was just a part of the plan she had explained to Max and Ash. This had the side effect of letting her think about other things. Namely, how to have more fun with Max and Ash. Fortunately, she had the perfect plan for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing some of the few beauty products she had in her tent, the girl whipped up an odd looking red power. There was nothing special about it, but she didn't need there to be. As they were getting ready to eat, May discreetly sprinkled some of it on the back of Ash's shirt and pants. Just before they sat down to eat, the girl whisper a plan to Max while sprinkling some on his clothes as well. The boy's cheeks gained a light pink tinge as he heard her words, but nodded along with her all the same, afraid to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the quartet ate, May explained her plan to them, mainly Brock, for getting to the next town. He agreed and they started to get ready to do that once they finished eating when Brock noticed the powder on Ash's clothes. \"Hey Ash, what's that on your clothes? It looks like some sort of red powder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Confused, the boy in question tried turning his head to see, able to notice some of it. \"Where'd this come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" Max said in false worry. \"I think I've read about this stuff before. can't remember the name of it, but I know that it can cause rashes if you're exposed to it for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ash shouted, completely out of the loop of May's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay looked to her brother's Back and said, \"Oh no, Max, you've got it on you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed after this was the two boy's going into their tents, stripping down to their underwear, and tossing their pants and tops out to the other. After some brief discussion, Brock agreed to go and wash off the two boys' clothes at the nearby stream while May kept an eye on the camp. After all, Max and Ash were too busy hiding in their tents to preserve their modesty to watch after everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was sure Brock had walked far enough away, May called out, \"He's gone now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Max stepped out of his tent in his tighty whities, his face red with embarrassment. \"Ugh, I hate this plan.\" he complained..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, oblivious, poked his head out of his tent and asked, \"Wait, what's going on?\" Looking at his two friends, his head slowly connected the dots. \"Oh nooooo...\" he whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ash.\" said the younger boy, who watched as Ash stepped out of his tent in a pair of Zigzagoon themed briefs. \"Hehe, oh wow. You know, I may be in tighty whities, but at least my underwear isn't as bad as yours.\" Ash blushed and awkwardly tried to cover his underoos with his hands. \"Hehe-GAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's laughter as cut off as his sister pulled on his undies. \"Be nice Max, or I might just have to replace your undies when we get to town. Got it...\" leaning in close to his ear, she whispered just loud enough for him to hear, \"...pantyboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother immediately got a petrified look on his face and started sweating. \"R-right. S-sorry Ash. Won't...\" Gulp. \"...won't happen again.\" May smiled, letting go of the boy's undies and giving him a swat on his butt, making him squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, how to start?\" May considered her option carefully. On one hand, the obvious person to start with was Ash. She could take a stab at reenacting that little scene from her dream with him or just keep pulling until she ripped off his briefs. <i>That could be the start of my 'trophy wall.'</i> She chuckled at that last thought. Max could also use a bit of discipline though, especially after his making fun of Ash.</span></div></div>",

With it on you too, it made it more believable that you weren't pulling some kind of prank. Especially since you couldn't even give the stuff a name.\" Seeing her brother begin grumbling about it, she made up her mind. \"Well, since you're going to be such a baby about it, here's how we're gonna start.\" She noticed the fearful look on her brother's face. Turning to to Ash, she said, \"Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy immediately looked towards his female friend, clenching his butt cheeks unconsciously in preparation for whatever suffering he may endure. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since my brother's being such a baby, I've decided that you can have some revenge for earlier. Yank his undies until they get torn straight off.\" Their responses were immediate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The younger boy's face did a complete flip out as he processed what he'd just hurt. \"W-wait, May. That's not necessary. In fact, I-I don't mind being in my underwear at all. Really!\" he lied through his teeth. <i>ASH is supposed to be the one getting the wedgies, not ME!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late, Max.\" Sitting down to enjoy the show, she said, \"Be said sure enjoy yourself Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will.\" The boy looked surprisingly confident in spite of his current attire. <i>Things are looking up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but why do they have to be ripped off?\" he asked, desperately hoping she'd lighten his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when you tried to steal some of my panties.\" she said, and enjoyed seeing him pale and Ash look at her in confusion. \"Well, I'm gonna be starting a collection of ripped undies. And I'll be starting with yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth  to speak, only to let out a squeal instead as Ash grabbed the sides of his brief and lifted the boy straight off the ground. \"How's that feel, Max?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh...! Nnngh. Pleasssse... mercy...\" he begged while groaning in his wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Max, you heard your sister.\" Without warning, he dropped Max onto his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy groaned, groans which increased when Ash crouched down and grabbed the front of his briefs and pulling on them while keeping him pinned down. \"NAHHT A FRONTTtttt-EEeeee...!\" Max squealed as Ash continued wedgieing him, stretching the tighty whities up to the younger boy's chest before flipping him onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay looked on, noticing how tightly her brother's butt cheeks were clenched as Ash started pulling on the back of his undies. Eventually, the he grabbed the legholes of her brother's undies and started pulling on those as well. After a few short minutes more of pulling and max squealing, they started to hear the tell tale <i><b>poppoppop</b></i> sounds of the underwear breaking until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRIIIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's briefs were torn off, a large chunk of them in Ash's hand, the rest being clutched by Max in front of his groin as hunched over both in pain and an attempt to cover himself. \"Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Ash.\" May said as she walked over to him and collected the briefs from his hand. \"An excellent first piece for the collection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, May?\" groaned out Max. \"Cou-could I get some new underwear from my tent now?\" <i>Can't believe I just asked that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as soon as I get the other half of you undies.\" May said and, for emphasis, she bent over and gave him a swat on his now bare butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeep!

After getting a meek affirmative from him, she then turned to the other boy. \"Now for you Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older boy's face fell as his earlier confidence left him. \"Uh um, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his surprise, the girl sat down and, to his embarrassment, patted her lap (her own cheeks turning a very light pink as well). \"Have a seat.\" Mortified, Ash did, with May making him sit so that he was basically straddling her. The girl grew nervous over what she was going to do next. Planning and imagining it had been one thing, but this was so much... more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands on his thighs, she trailed them up until they reached his underoos clad butt. Ash squeaked and unconsciously squirmed closer to May's torso as she gave his cheeks a firm squeeze. \"Uh, M-may...\" Gulp. \"What... what ar-Eeep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl began outright kneading his buttocks now. \"Now give me a hug.\" she commanded, growing more confident in her actions. Ash complied and May moved her left hand towards the boy's waistband. His butt cheeks clenched again as he felt her grab, but then she let go and lightly swatted his butt. \"Up up up, no clenching Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face completely red at this point, Ash took in a deep breath and slowly clenched. \"S-sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" she said while continuing to grope his butt and grabbing his waistband again, \"I forgive you.\" She gave the underoos a sharp yank to start with, making the boy holding onto her groan, before switching to lighter pulls. Between those and the groping, she had the groping whimpering and holding onto her nice and tight. \"You enjoying yourself Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Arceus!\" They heard from Max, who had gotten on another pair of tighty whities. \"Wh-what in the... huh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two older kids looked at the shocked boy, Ash's face glowing with humiliation and May giving and awkward laugh. \"Hehe. There you are Max.\" Ceasing her groping for a moment, she patted the ground next to her and said, \"Come on over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax slowly, just as slowly as he had deliberately been to get changed, and awkwardly walked toward the pair as May resumed her groping and tugging. Once he was seated, he nervously tried to ask, \"\"So, um, what uh...? I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just giving Ash a reward for doing such a good job earlier.\" Giving the underoos in her hand a much harder pull, she added, \"Right Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaahhh... Right M-may...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching back to the lighter tugging, she asked, \"And you like your reward, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what she wanted to hear, he lied, \"Y-yes.\" Well, mostly lied. The wedgie he was hating, but her groping gave him an odd, tingling sensation all over his body. He wasn't sure how to describe the confusingly good feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame we have to cut it short.\" she said. Giving the boy a kiss on the cheek, she used her grip on his underoos to pull him off of her and leave him on the ground. \"Whew, now that was awesome!\" she exclaimed while getting onto her feet. After looking over Ash, she turned to Max and said. \"You know, those underoos are so cute on him, maybe we should get you a matching set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Max shouted. \"Nonononono! Please, please you can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'd rather I get you some panties?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I like my current underwear just fine!\" Well, that was partly true. He had asked their mother to start buying him boxers instead of underoos, but she couldn't be swayed. 'You look so cute or your little underoos.' she'd said. Eventually, after a lot of begging and pleading, she ended up getting him tighty whities instead. A slight improvement. And so, in the face of being sent back to the childish undergarments, he repeated the tactics he'd used on his mom. grabbing, he sister's leg and forming sad eyes, he plead, \"Please sis, please! Don't make me go back to wearing baby underwear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at her brother's antics, she relented. \"Okay okay, you can keep your tighty whities. The boy collapsed and sighed in relief. \"Anyways, I think...\"</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, he had managed to get all of the red powder out of the boys' clothes. Unfortunately, the clothes were now soaking wet. Meaning that Max and Ash would be spending the night in their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the 'helpful' girl that she is, May volunteered to hold onto the clothes for the night while they dried to make sure that they didn't get any more powder on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of that was set, May and Brock returned to their tents for the night, and May considered how best to continue her fun. Surely there was no shortage of ideas for <i>how</i> she could keep playing with Ash and her brother, but what would provide her with the most entertainment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about it for a while, she decided that it might just be best to get a second opinion. But who could she ask? Well, there was one potential person. Misty! Ash had told her about the redhead, and while Ash had never mentioned her doing anything like what May was, there was something that just made her feel like this would be the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But how to contact her?' you ask. Let's throw in some reality for a moment. You really think that when 10-year old kids are allowed to run around all over the world, they won't be given something as simple as a way to <i>call</i> people. In this case, video call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving previously gotten the contact information from Ash, she called up Misty using her device and eagerly stared at the screen. After a few moments of waiting, a certain redhead's face popped up on the screen. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" May answered back, having a look at Ash's previous traveling buddy. \"So, uh, you're Misty right, one of Ash's friends?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wh- wait a minute.\" she said while taking a closer look at the girl. \"I think Ash sent me a message about you last week. You're that new girl he's been traveling with, right? May, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming, the younger girl said, \"Yep, that's me. Soooo, there's something about I Ash I wanted to talk to you about.\" she began nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty studied the look on May's face for a moment before her own face broke out into an evil grin. \"You've been wedgieing him, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, any sense of nervousness left the brunette girl. \"Wait, did you do that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only all the time!\" Misty exclaimed. \"How could I not with how adorable he is? Especially in his underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right? And I've got my little brother here to play with two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are a lucky girl May. So, what did you wanna talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the younger girl began, \"I was just wondering if you maybe had any advice for a beginner like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have any...\" Misty shook her head with a smile. \"Get yourself comfortable sweetie, because I've got plenty to share. Any questions you wanna ask first though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I do have one.\" she said, getting a small blush on her face thinking about it. \"When you massage his butt, does always get all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...jelly legged and needy. Yes, yes he does. It has got to be the most adorable thing I've ever seen next to Togepi. Now, if you really wanna have some fun, listen to this story.\"</span></div></div>",

Sadly for them, the clothes were still soaking wet and would need to dry over night, leaving the boys stuck in just their undies for the night. May had 'helpfully' agreed to keep the clothes in her tent so that they wouldn't get lost or have any more powder get on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone got ready to sleep in their tents, May decided that she would hold off on her fun tomorrow until her and Ash were alone.

With that taken care of, she turned back to Ash, grabbing him by the front of his briefs and eliciting a cute little whimper from him as she lifting him out of the chair. \"Now, where were we?\" she asked rhetorically before moving her hand to the back of his briefs and resume tugging on them while her other hand went back to groping his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hugged himself to her, struggling to remain standing on his shaky legs. \"W-we were d-doing this.

Is this just your way of meeting girls or something?\" Misty demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOT! I SWEAR!

M-my bu-butt-t-t can't t-take anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the girls changed their tunes. \"Awwww, poor baby.\" May said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we are being a bit hard on the little guy.\" Misty gently set her hand on the boy's abused bottom, only to jerk her hand bacon in surprise as the boy let out an awful whimper. \"Oh dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need to take care of this, don't you?\" May asked, getting a nod fro Misty. The girls dropped their crops and May picked up a bottle of healing lotion designed to treat burns. \"Let's get started. And don't argue Ash, or we'll go back to whipping..\" Ash refrained from arguing as the girls pulled down his underwear, only whimper as the bottom dragged over his red butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls spread the lotion over their hands and may said, \"Now just try and relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh whimpered, but less painfully or and in a more pleasured tone as the girls carefully set their lotioned up hands on his butt and began to gently work the stuff in. Slowly, it began to feel good. \"Oh, oh Arceus thah- ohhhHHH yeahhhhh...\" Ash's began panting as the girls continued to soothe his burning bottom.<br>\r\n<u><b>Dream End</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Max was having a dream of his own as he tossed and turned in his tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Max's Dream</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his dream, Max's mind traveled back to the time when he'd tried to steal some of his sister's panties. Again, he'd failed and been hung up on a coat hook by his tighty whities. But this time, his punishment did not end their. After leaving him hung up for a while, she decided to get him down the painful way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please Maaayyyy! OwwwWW, AHHHhh! I-I sorryyyyeeeeee!\" The boy squealed as she pulled on his legs. Fortunately, it took a minute for his underwear to give away the tell tale poppoppop sounds before tearing. The bad news was that it was because of how hard she pulled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRIIIP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeow!\" he whined as his underwear finally tore and he fell to the ground. \"Ohhh, my buuutt... Hurts. So bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let this be a lesson to you Max. Now go put some new underwear on. I laid out a pair on your bed.\" Max would have made a comment about how she had gone through his underwear, but thought better of it and headed for his room. Once inside, he closed the door and headed over to his room. Once inside, he closed the door behind him and grabbed his underwear off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it wasn't his underwear. It looked like a pair of may's old panties. A pink pair with flower prints. \"Haha, very funny sis.\" he mumbled as he walked over to his underwear drawer. <i>Well, at least i got a pair of her panties out of this.</i> Unfortunately, looking in his underwear drawer, he saw that it was empty. \"Huh.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised?\" he heard May ask from his now open door. \"You wanted panties, you're getting panties. And I swear, if you give me  even one complaint about it today, I am gonna power wedgie you from a tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax stared at her, dumbfounded, afraid, and embarrassed. <i>This can't be happening.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's happening. Now put those on and get ready for your new life Max, cause from now on, you're gonna be my little pantyboy.\"<br>\r\n<u><b>Dream End</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>What now?</b></u></span></div></div>",

With a fright, Max woke up from his nightmare shouting, \"No!\" As the boy looked around nervously, he slowly realized where he was. \"Oh thank Arceus, it was just a dream.\" Still feeling nervous, the boy hesitantly looked down and sighed in relief as he realized that his panty nightmare had been just that, a nightmare. \"Never thought I'd be glad to see myself in tighty whities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with that small relief, the boy still felt tense. This was twice now in today's that he'd spent the night in nothing but his briefs, and now it would be two mornings that he had to go to may and ask for his clothes back. It seemed that her warning about how he shouldn't get too comfortable in clothes had been very much correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Ash's Tent</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash slept, he squirmed about, mumbling incoherently while moaning and groaning. \"Mmmm... soooohhhh goooood. \"Ohhhhh.... my butt, my butt...moooorrre.\" His hips wiggled about as his dream continued, \"Oh pleashhhh... pleeeeassse... Ohhhh yeahhhh... thank yoooooou...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his squirming slowed as he began waking up. he groaned a bit as his eyes drifted around his tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it was just a dream.\" His voice contained both relief and just a bit of disappointment. As he sat up, Ash noticed an odd feeling in his under. The boy's face turned red as embarrassment surged through him. say what you will about the confusingly tortuous and pleasurable dream he'd just had, but you definitely couldn't call it dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>May's Tent</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay slowly awoke as she felt someone, her younger brother she realized, shaking her arm. After sitting up and rubbing the sleep from her eyes, the girl looked over the two boys who had awoken her and smiled at their state of dress. Max was still in his tighty whities and Ash was wearing blue briefs that had water symbols on them. \"Let me guess, you boys want your clothes back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" They both mumbled, looking embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned at their responses. \"Well, maybe you can have them back if you ask a little more nicely. Max let's start with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to finally cover his undies, the boy got on his knees and begged. \"Can please have my clothes back oh sweet big sister?! Please please please please plea-Yeah!\" The boy's begging was cut off as his sister grabbed the front of his briefs and pulled him towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping one arm around him, she held him close in a half hug while giving him a noogie with her free hand. \"I swear, you are just too cute sometimes.\" she gushed. \"Especially in your undies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax squirmed in her hold, feeling both small and humiliated. \"C-can I please have my clothes back sis?\" Sounding desperate, he added, \"I'm feeling kind of cold right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, poor little guy. Here you go.\" Her brother let out a string of 'thank yous' to her as he clutched his clothes to his chest. \"Alright Ash, you turn now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, Ash began with his hands on the ground in a begging position, \"Um, c-can I please have my clothes back May. Pretty please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay smiled. \"Well, if you sit on my lap again, I guess you can have them.\" She noticed Max look uncomfortable at the suggestion but ignored. Instead she enjoyed the embarrassed and nervous look on Ash's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, he seated himself on her lap, basically straddling her. Just like before, she gave his butt a nice grope and tugged on his undies a bit, enjoying the way he quickly slouched against her and hugged her. \"Um, i-is th-this- Eep- good?\" he asked, begin to squirm on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, alright, you can have your clothes back now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a bit as she watched her boys hastily dressing themselves enjoying the embarrassed looks on their faces and how relieved they look to get their clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember not to get too attached to those clothes, because I can take them away whenever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right.\" Ash said while Max nervously nodded.</span></div></div>",

Brock and Max headed off South while May and Ash went North. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as soon as they were a couple of minutes past each other, May started her fun by shoving her hand down the front of Ash's pants and then yanking up his underoos. \"Owhowow... Mayyyyyy...\" he whined. rather than respond to him, she just kept walking forward, dragging him behind her by his undies as if they were a leash. \"Ah, come o-HA Ow- on! Yeow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry it up Ash. The sooner we find town, the sooner we can have some play time.\" she explained cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Ash grimaced but complied, mainly to lessen the pain of his wedgie. After a painful, for Ash, 20 minute walk, the two of them were able to see town a little bit off in the distance. \"Well, what do ya know, that didn't take as long to find as i thought it would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed in relief that the painful walk was over. \"Oh thank- Yeeee!\" His statement was turned into a squeak as The back of his undies were now pulled up. \"Oh come onnnn! Have mercy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ash. But if you get on your hands and knees, I can make this part go a bit quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing anyway out of this, he complied. \"O-okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was in position the girl resumed pulling, moving the underoos side to side while Ash groaned and winced. \"Now let me explain my plan for when we get into town. First, when we get to town, we'll visit the stores to get some supplies. I'll use that as an opportunity to get some more underoos for you and and tighty whities for Max.\" Changing her grip, she began pulling upwards now, slowly stretching her crush's underoos. \"With me so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grunted out a \"Yes.\" in reply before biting his lip to suppress a whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now after that,\" she continued, \"we'll get some food and find a place to stay for the night. pay attention now, because this part is important. Now obviously, Max and I will share a room while you and Brock get your own rooms. Once it's dark enough and Brock is likely to be asleep, you'll leave your room and join me and Max for some fun. And make sure to bring extra underwear. Did you get all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh whimpered, but nodded his head in an affirmative gesture. May, limiting her tugging, had gotten his underwear half way up Ash's back now and he was afraid she'd send them up all the way or just rip them off. Much to his relief though, she suddenly let go and Ash dropped completely to the ground in relief. \"Ugh, my butt is getting way to much attention lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling mischievously, May said, \"Awww, don't be upset. Since you were such a great listener, you get a...\" leaning next to his ear, she whispered, \"...reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt his heart skip a beat. \"A-a reward?\" he asked, sounding both afraid and hopeful at the same time. <i>D-does she mean...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhmm. Start stripping Ash, I wanna get another look at you undies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith trembling hands, the boy did as she asked and stripped down to his underoos. They were a bit stretched now, but they still fit him well enough. \"W-what now?\" he asked, both anticipating and dreading her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you can guess.\" she answered while sitting down and patting her leg. Shaking a bit, the boy once again straddled her, this time already started to hug her before her hands got started. \"Oh, nervous <i>and</i> eager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face as red as a tomato, he objected, \"I'm not eager I- Urrrgghhhh!\" he was cut off as may gave his underoos a hard pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax Ash, and enjoy.\" She lightened her pull to a more playful tug while her free hand cupped his butt and started kneading it. In seconds she had the boy whimpering and clutching her tightly. \"You are enjoying yourself, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... Mmmmm Nnnnnggh... \" Ash panted a bit as he struggled to think of an answer or even form words. On one hand, the wedgie was uncomfortable, but the hand on his butt felt great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" she said, \"you're definitely enjoying yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Later</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the groups had met up, they headed for the town that may and Ash had found without any problems. Granted, there was a bit of concern from Brock when he saw that Ash was walking a bit wobbly, but May and Ash brushed it off by saying he had tripped and was a bit dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got to town, it was time to go shopping.</span></div></div>",

While Ash and Brock were over in the food section, Max had followed may while she went to the clothes section. Specifically, the underwear section. The young boy looked away in embarrassment while his sister picked out tighty whities and underoos in his and Ash's respective sizes. However, he was forced to look when May said, \"Hey Max, check this out. They're perfect for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, the boy turned around to see what his sister was talking about. What he saw made his blood run cold. In may's hands was a pack of grass type themed kids' panties. And they were in his size. \"whuh... What? Wh...\" the boy lost the mental capacity for actual words as he stared forward in shock and fear. <i>This can't be happening! I must be having another nigthmare. Wake up, Max. Wake UP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down next to him, she went on. \"These would look soooo adorable on you.

You feel that nice wedgie I just gave you?\" she asked, getting a frantic nod in return. \"Well, if you don't remove it until I tell you to, you can keep wearing tighty whities. But I will be buying these panties. And if you lose that wedgie, you're going to be a pantyboy from now. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax looked at his sister's smiling face. He was sweating and wanted to run, but knew he couldn't. As such, he sttled for whispering out a scared \"yes\" in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good boy.

Something that Max was grateful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the good little boy he was, he'd made sure that his underwear had stayed wedged up his butt throughout all their sightseeing. He'd kept his butt clenched to keep it in and had even pulled up on his briefs a bit out of fear that his wedgie might be lessening. As such, his underwear had been grinding into him throughout their little tour around town, but it was still better than the alternative. <i>There is no way in hell I'm gonna let her put me in panties.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking in had gone exactly as May had planned. Ash and Brock each got their own room, while Max and May were to share one. Max didn't miss the way his sister had winked at Ash, reminding the older boy of her plans for tonight.

I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up the back of his shirt, she saw that his wedgie was indeed still there. \"Well what do ya know, you did keep it. Such a good little boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms tightened around him and Max briefly thought that he might be safe from her shenanigans. <i>This is actually kind of nice.</i> he thought, returning the hug. Sadly, that didn't last long, as his sister was soon grabbing his stretched briefs and pulling them straight up during their hug. \"Gaahhhh!\" he squirmed in her arms, struggling to get free. \"W-what did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellll, let's see.\" she began while tugging his tighty whities up higher. \"We've got this nice room all to ourselves, and you're not in your underwear yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax opened his mouth to say something, but ended up just squealing as May stood and lifted him straight off the ground by his briefs, giving him a spin and tossing him onto one of the beds. \"Uhhhhggghhhh....\" he groaned, his hands starting to dig out the intense wedgie. \"...I'm sorryyyyyy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, you're still not in your underwear.\" She sounded irritable, and that was all the motivation max needed to start stripping. May took in the sight of her adorable little brother in his stretched undies. \"You know, I'm surprised you kept that wedgie I gave you earlier. I thought you wanted to wear panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" he shouted back, his face turning red from both indignation at her claim and from his state of undress. \"Why would you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, she asked, \"Where what else were you going to do with the spoils from that failed panty raid of yours other than wear them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax opened his mouth to reply, but then paused. What had he been going to do with her panties. He'd definitely been thrilled to see them, but, being the young boy that he was, he hadn't really worked out what to do with his sister's underwear once he had it. \"I-I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at his his answer. \"Well, I totally think you would have worn them. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll get to be a pantyboy soon enough.\" His face paled. \"But for now,\" she cracked her knuckles, \"we've got other things to do.\"</span></div></div>",

After several seconds, the door opened to reveal May. \"I was wondering when you'd show up Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth to speak, but was stopped from doing so.by may immediately reaching her hand to the front of his pants where his underoos waistband was sticking out, still the same blue pair with water symbols from earlier, and violently pulled him into the room by his underoos. \"Gah!\" Now inside, he looked around and quickly noticed something, or rather someone, missing. \"Um, where's Max?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ov-owie... over here.\" called a voice from one of the beds. And out from behind it crawled, yes crawled, Max in nothing but his tighty whities with the white briefs pulled up in an atomic wedgie and his waistband snapped over his eyes. Looking closely, you could also see that his butt had been left a nice shade of red. \"Oh thank Arceus Ash! Maybe I can take a break now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, May slapped her hand on Ash's backside and gave it a nice squeeze, making him jump and shiver. \"Of course you can take a break Max, just be sure to keep that wedgie as it is.\" hearing him sigh in relief, she asked, \"Now what do we say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you big sister.\" he answered before haphazardly crawling onto one of the beds to relax as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay, meanwhile, once again took hold of Ash's underoos and led him over to the free bed. \"Now let's do something about how overdressed you are.\" His hands moved towards his clothes, but she slapped them away. \"Oh no, I'll take care of those for you.\" Ash's face turned a very vibrant shade of red as may began undressing him, Starting with his shoes and shirt, then moving down and getting rid of his pants (he'd gotten especially squirmy when she was undoing his fly), and then finally peeling off his socks.\"\"Oh you look delicious like that.\" she said before grabbing the front of his underoos and yanking up nice and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh opened his mouth to scream, but then May made a bold and almost unthinkable move as she smothered it with a kiss. \"MMMMMMmmmm...\" After a few brief seconds of this, they both pulled away feeling out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoy that Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was hesitant in his answer. The kiss was... nice, he guessed (although he really wasn't sure how to feel about it), but the wedgie definitely sucked. \"...I... liked the kiss.\" he answered mostly honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now if you behave yourself, we can have some more fun later. But right now, I'm gonna...\"</span></div></div>",

Owowowow!\" His underoos were continuously tugged up in the front, destroying his groin until May got them just under his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready Ash, cause I'm moving onto the back now. Flip.\" He complied, turning himself around and even raising his backside for her. \"That's a good boy.\" she said while grabbing the back of his undies and pulling again. After another half a minute of her pulling and Ash grunting in pain, she managed to cleanly tear the briefs right off of him.\" Huha!\" she sheered, \"Another trophy for May. Well, most of one.\" Rectifying that, she reached down and snatched the rest of Ash's ruined underoos off his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" he shouted, frantically covering himself with his hands. \"Y-you can't j-just-!\" SWAT! \"Yeow!\" the stinging  sensation on his butt cheeks ended his protest quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh calm down, didn't see anything.\" she said before tossing him a blue pair of Piplup underoos. A rare find at stores in this region since the Pokemon they depicted were usually much farther off. While he changed, she stashed the torn briefs in a bag with Max's. Once all that was done, she turned back to Ash and took in the sight of him in his new underoos. \"So, I see you brought one of the pairs I picked out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy curled in on himself a bit, feeling a sudden need to cover his underwear. \"Uh, yeah. I... I've never seen a Pokemon like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a Piplip.\" she said with a giggle. \"Max and my parents showed me pictures of them once back when I still needed to get over my fear of Pokemon. They live farther north in regions like Sinnoh.\" Shaking her head, she changed the topic and said, \"But enough about that. Now let's both have some fun.\" Sitting down next to Ash on the bed, she patted her lap and Ash obediently began to straddle and hug her. \"Hope your ready for this one Ash.\" she said as she began to grope his butt with one hand while playfully tugging on his underoos with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had him squirming in seconds as the boy's arms <i><b>and legs</b></i> wrapped around her tightly. \"M-May... nnnggghhh....\" he bit his lip to suppress his moans, his face red and sweat appearing on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ash?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-\" A sudden and much harder pull on his underoos. \"AHH- MMMmmm!\" For a second time, his scream was silenced by a kiss and her pulls lessened. With her groping still going on, she soon had to boy mewling into the kiss. Still having human respiratory systems, the pair soon pulled apart, panting. Ash rested his head on May's soft chest, enjoying how her hands felt on his butt. Yes, hand<b>s</b>, plural. The wedgie had stopped and she was now just focused on squeezing his butt. \"M-may, i-it's-s-s-s sooooh goooood.\" he half stammered half moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, I'm the one doing it.\" she said with some, at this point, well earned arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Later</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an exciting day, our trio was fast asleep. may was snuggled up in her own bed while the boys shared the other one (she'd wanted to drag Ash into her bed, but thought it might be a bit awkward to make him literally sleep with her). The boys were still in their underwear, but were thankfully freed fro many wedgies for the rest of night.</span></div></div>",

While Ash was busy adjusting his undies, May looked through the photos him took. Some of them were too blurry to make heads or tails of, but a fair few turned out rather well. There was one that showed the grey garment stretching out of his pants and up his back, another that was a close up on the undies themselves and clearly displayed the pokeball print that adorned them, and even one that managed to show Ash's shocked face and his wedgied undies in the same frame! All in all, May had more than enough evidence to show to anyone she wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround this time Ash had finished fixing his underwear and was making his way over to where May was standing. \"Alright how about I see just what pair of underwear you're wearing,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could make a move May held up the Pokedex to him, the screen showing the picture of his face looking back and his embarrassing underwear coming out of his pants. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you. I took quite a few embarrassing photos of you, and if you don't do what I say then I might just have to show these photos to Brock and Max.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stopped in his tracks and let out a bit of a gasp. It was bad enough having May knew about his juvenile choice in underwear, there was no way he could let Brock or Max find out! Brock would probably shrug it off and hopefully not mention it, but Max would never let him live it down. \"A-Alright fine, I'll do whatever you want. Just don't tell anyone about this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Ash say those words, May had a smile on her face that would make the Cheshire Cat jealous. But now that she had Ash under her thumb, what was she going to have him do? The others would still be gone for another hour or so...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only to find that this seemed to just set her off even further as her angry expression intensified..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big mistake, bub...\" Dawn whispered with a tranquil fury evident in her voice, as she sent the boxers upwards, deepening it further between his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Paul to, understandably, give out a yell of pain, as the force of the wedgie lifted him up to his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn, of course, smirked a bit to herself as she thought of some ideas, until she came upon three ways to torture Paul with his own boxers. </span></div></div>",
