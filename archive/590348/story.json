Paul, as usual, was hunched in front of the computer monitor, tapping away at the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her bandana from around her neck and ran cool tap water over it, wiping a layer of dust from her face, rinsing it and replacing it around her neck. She went into the small bathroom, bumping her knees on the wall as she sat down. Finished, she looked into the hazy mirror, trying to comb her fingers through her naturally curly, dirty blonde hair and decided it was hopeless. The mexican sun and wind had defeated every effort to remain intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came out, Paul was still typing away relentlessly at the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\", she said, throwing her arms around him and kissing the back of his neck, \"Are you coming out to help me dig today, or am I going to discover the next dinosaur all by myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina, you won't believe this e-mail someone sent me\", he said, not even turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of nut sent you an e-mail this time?

He says he was touched by one that was still alive and has a mark on his wrist, that never has healed. Also found were some scrolls, in the wreckage, all damaged by fire, except one.

This is where it gets really farfetched, but in actuality, it makes sense. The scroll decribes the lost city of Alantis and that the aliens are claiming that they built it and lived there a long time ago. Not the same ones that actually built the city, because they did eventually leave and go back to their own planet to die, but some from the same planet, fleeing the friction of an opposing planet. Somehow the elders, the first Alantis inhabitants, had somehow known of the eventual takeover of their planet and wanted to provide a safe haven for what was left of their race. But the opposing planet learned of their plot to escape, pursued them, and shot them down in the desert at Roswell.\" He stopped to catch his breath and looked at Gina for her reaction.</span></div></div>",

It hadn't taken much prompting from his old friends to get him to join the adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother lucky sign, was that Mack, his wife and shipmate, Celia, were on a wild goose chase in Tanzania, Africa and agreed to meet them at Farfangana, a small port outside of Madagascar.

She had met him on a dig in Spain, she, a bored girl from Texas, who had barely been out of the state, decided to broaden her horizons and volunteer to work a dig in a country where she couldn't even speak the language. Paul, on the otherhand, was fluent in Spanish, French, German and had been to college forever and had majored in archeology and minored in marine biology and forensic sciences and was very serious when he worked. She could speak pig latin, if that counted and could always break his serious spell and make him laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had fallen in love among the dust and ruins of the dig and he'd gotten down on one knee, in front of all the professors and volunteers, and proposed. They were married at the very same dig site.

Before her, he had been just another boring professor, consumed by his work. Gina had reminded him to stop and smell the flowers and that the dinosaurs had died a long time ago and were not going anywhere. She was so gosh darned,bloody, logical and he adored her for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMack and Celia had been their friends for five years.

That's all it took for the two to agree on a couple of excursions and of course Gina and Celia were dragged along and had hit it off too.

Celia, however, was not ready to let her hair go gray and still colored it with Gentle Care, Mink Tresses, #127, which most matched her faux fur coats. Dressed in matching, knee length shorts and top, with slip resistant deck shoes, she was a better sailor than Mack was, so most of the navigating was left up to her.

They saw schools of barracuda and silversides, that gleamed in the sunlight, filtering through the water above them. A lone trumpet fish awam along, paying no attention to the divers.

The cool water was greeted with pleasure by the three companions but it was hard to enjoy when deep with in them lurked a hope for something amazing.  A hope they were bitterly afraid would be dashed the moment they reached the bottem and realized that all their theories had been wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul reached the bottom first, it took hardly any time at all.  This can't be the real bottom, he thought and began to feel his way along the rocky floor.  Gina joined him, followed by Mack.  They searched for quite a while without result.  It was Gina who finally signalled them both to her.  She had appeared from behind a particulary dangerous spot where the seaweed and underwater plants were thick and threatened to tangle them in there watery vines.  Mack and Paul followed her as she swam deeper into the under water jungle and presently they came to a rock face, but in it was a crack . . . just large enough for them to slip through.  Paul's heart caught in his throat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three passed through the opening into complete darkness, no light penetrated into these dark recesses.  Mack switched on his under water light and shined it down into the depths of the cavern.  They could not see the bottom.  Paul motioned them to follow deeper in.  The bottom couldn't be that far, they were only about a half hour short of being where the real bottom should lay.  But after swimming for a half hour they had still not reached the bottem and Mack's high beam light showed no sign of them being even close.  How was this possible?  They should have reached the ocean floor by now.  He looked to his two companions.  He could tell they were both freezing.  He too was cold, the water down here was like ice.  Gina looked at him and without need for spoken words they began to head back to shore.  They had a lot to talk about and deep in Paul's heart he hoped that this discovery, this bottomless cavern meant that there was truth behind the story of Atlantis.</span></div></div>",

Celia had her share of deep-sea experience. Her father used to take her diving as a young child. He was a deep-sea diver for the U.S.navy, and he took his diving very seriously. Celia took it seriously too, and followed in her father's footsteps. Her father was in the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, and he handled live explosives on a regular basis. <br>\r\nOne day, when Celia was finishing her training in the Amphibious Recon unit, she got the news. Her father, a Master Diver, had died in an explosion. Celia never dove again since that fateful day. When it came to deep-sea diving nobody argued with Celia. <br>\r\n\u201cYour body would fill up with nitrogen so fast, that you\u2019d puke out your lungs,\u201d she began, \u201cthe only way to avoid the Bends would be to inhale Keller gas and more importantly, by wearing an armored suit.\u201d<br>\r\nKeller gas is a blend of nine gases developed by a Swiss mathermatician named Hannes Keller. This blend facilitates breathing at intense atmospheric pressures and is more commonly used by deep miners hundreds of feet under ground. <br>\r\nPaul broke the silence that followed, \u201cWe\u2019d never fit through that crack in armored suits.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe could use explosi...\u201d Gina cut herself off abruptly, realizing the touchiness of this topic.

They both agreed not to go with that choice, but now, it seemed like the only one. <br>\r\n\u201cDo what you\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Gina quaintly, and proceeded to walk up to deck. <br>\r\nPaul was going to contact Heath Browning, also known as \u201cThe Lizard.\u201d He was the son of a multimillionaire, and he had nothing better to do than to spend his money on expensive thrills. He was cocky, he was rude and he treated women like his playthings. Gina hated him the first time she met him, so when Paul mentioned him a few weeks before their voyage, she promptly said, \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\nOne example of Heath Browning throwing money in the wind for a thrill was the time he bought a brand new Ferrari Testarossa. He wanted to see how fast it really was; he wanted to see how aerodynamic it was. It cost him half a million dollars to buy the car. It was beautiful; dark red, shiny chrome tires. He even had a ten thousand dollar sound system installed in it. Then he let it fly. He rented a cargo plane, brought it to thirty thousand feet and drove the luxury sports car out into the clouds. <br>\r\nApparently, the people at Ferrari hadn\u2019t built it for that kind of aerodynamics because once he reached about a hundred miles an hour, parts started flying off. First, he lost the rearview mirrors, then the hood. His trunk opened up, sending the spare tire flying into the blue, taking the tailgate with it. Heath, who was behind the wheel, head banging to some generic heavy metal band blasting on the hi-fi, considered telling the Ferrari people that their cars didn\u2019t fare well in the skies. Instead, he opened the door and jettisoned himself through space. <br>\r\nThis was Heath Browning. Born in Brighton, England, raised in London and schooled in the best institutions money can buy. This was whom Paul nervously typed to. He knew Heath wouldn\u2019t turn down his offer. This was just his cup of tea. Paul hit the \u2018send\u2019 button and took a deep breath. He watched the blue on blue of the Indian Ocean horizon and leaned back. A beep startled him.<br>\r\n\u201cNew Message,\u201d read the laptop. It was Heath, always quick on the uptake. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d was his reply, \u201cSee you on the beach.\u201d<br>\r\nPaul prayed that he made the right decision. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They took it pretty well, he thought, with a half smile on his face. <br>\r\nHeath Browning wrote him a detailed email with the coordinates for a meeting place. They were to meet on the aptly named Reunion Island, although this wasn\u2019t necessarily going to be a happy reunion. Reunion is a French island just east of Madagascar, and west of Mauritius. Their meeting point was a small port twenty miles south of Saint Denis, northeast of Le Port.  <br>\r\nThey arrived to Reunion at sunset and set up camp on the beach. Mack made a fire, while Paul began preparing for dinner. The two women were searching for firewood in the dense jungle a few feet from shore. Heath was to meet them in the morning. <br>\r\nSuddenly, a scream came from the thick foliage. Paul turned around startled. <br>\r\n\u201cCelia,\u201d said Mack, grabbing a paring knife and running into the jungle.<br>\r\nPaul ran after him with a flaming torch in his hand. Branches and vines whipped his face as he kept up behind Mack. The darkness had already begun to seep into the forest, and visibility was getting scarcer by the minute. Suddenly, Paul saw a figure run straight into Mack. Mack was knocked down by the impact. As he drew nearer, Paul realized that it was Celia. A few steps behind, was Gina. <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s somebody following us,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d answered Mack, still hugging Celia on the jungle floor, \u201cLet\u2019s head back to camp. There\u2019s more light there.\u201d<br>\r\nThe small crew headed back to the beach hurriedly. The fire had started to burn more vigorously.<br>\r\nThe jungle that enshrouded the beach was silent except for the occasional chirp of a whimbrel in the distance. They barely touched their food that night, granted, it was beans from a can that Paul made \u2013 it couldn\u2019t have been very appetizing. Celia and Gina felt safer sleeping on the boat, so they took the rubber raft out to their trusty vessel. <br>\r\nMack and Paul stayed on shore in their sleeping bags. Paul, accustomed to long hours digging in the desert, preferred sleeping on land. He cherished the moment, in fact, since he knew not when he\u2019d sleep on land again. The fire began dying out, and the two men\u2019s snoring grew louder. A figure lurked on the outskirts of the jungle. <br>\r\nThe intruder headed towards their camp silently and bent on one knee in front of Paul. Mack, who always slept with one eye open, was quick. In a second, he grabbed the intruder by the calf and pulled him down. The dark man landed on his rear end, and Mack wrapped his thick arms around him and got his in a chokehold. Paul jumped to his feet and switched on his flashlight. <br>\r\nIn Mack\u2019s arms sat a black man with long natty hair and a beard. He stared into the flashlight wide-eyed and panicked. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d asked Paul. The man didn\u2019t answer. <br>\r\n\u201cQu'est-que vouz voulez?\u201d asked Mack in broken French.<br>\r\n\u201cManger,\u201d answered the native, and in broken English, said, \u201cFood.\u201d<br>\r\nHe was clearly not a threat to them. He was thin and lanky, and he looked weak. Mack let him go. Paul gave him the rest of the beans, which the man gobbled down instantly. <br>\r\n\u201cJe m\u2019appelle Jobey,\u201d said the man. <br>\r\nPaul and Mack introduced themselves. Jobey expressed his pleasure to meet them and his gratitude. He then proceeded to walk to a nearby palm tree and lie down. In minutes, he was asleep. Paul decided to sleep as well, but Mack, always vigilant, decided it would be best for him to keep an eye on their new visitor. <br>\r\nThe next morning, Gina woke the two men up. Celia was busy cutting some mangos. Jobey was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d asked Paul.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s who?\u201d asked Gina. <br>\r\nSuddenly, they could hear the loud thumping of bass. It was drawing nearer, louder. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d mumbled Mack. <br>\r\nA forty-meter yacht was approaching the shore. On the prow, stood Heath Browning, his long hair flowing, and his eyes behind sunglasses. On his enormous speakers he blasted Guns N\u2019 Roses, sending sound waves rippling through the water. <br>\r\nCelia looked up from her mangos.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the jungle,\u201d she muttered in disgust. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every Hyophorbe Indica and Princess Palm on the island had at least two geckoes on it competing for the cornucopia of insects that invfested the island. The smart ones, Paul mused, were the ones who perched next to a spider web, stealing the prey from the startled arachnids.  A striated heron perching on an Acanthophoenix palm was eyeing a vividly colorful gecko with interest. In these two animals, Paul could see millions of years of evolution. Dinosaurs aren\u2019t extinct, he thought, they\u2019re just smaller, more adapted to this world. <br>\r\n\u201cPaul!\u201d someone barked.<br>\r\nHe turned around, awakened from his nature-induced trance, and eyed Heath, who had swum to shore. His muscles were bulging under his tanned skin, and his left arm was covered by a huge green tribal tattoo of a lizard that went from wrist to collar. His dirty blond hair dripped salty water onto his bronze shoulders. <br>\r\n\u201cCheers mate, how are you?\u201d he asked Paul, removing his sunglasses.<br>\r\nPaul sucked in his stomach, \u201cGreat man! I\u2019m happy you could join us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be happier when you see what I brought,\u201d said Heath with great satisfaction. <br>\r\nHe turned and saw Mack standing behind him with his big arms crossed. <br>\r\n\u201cWell look who it is,\u201d muttered Heath, \u201cGood old Mackey. The old Big Mack. \u201d<br>\r\nHe walked over and put out his hand. Mack didn\u2019t take it. Instead, he turned his back to Heath and said, \u201cWe set sail in an hour.\u201d<br>\r\nHeath smiled cockily, obviously used to this kind of treatment. He shifted his focus on the women who were sitting on the sand eyeing him in disgust. They were eating Mangoes. <br>\r\n\u201cHello ladies,\u201d he said smoothly, \u201cCelia, Julia.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Gina,\u201d said Gina getting up and walking towards Paul. <br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d blurted Heath, \u201cwhat\u2019s with everyone? Has somebody died?\u201d<br>\r\nMack turned to face Heath and walked up to him. He stuck his face less than an inch away from Heath\u2019s face. Heath could feel the warm, dank breath of a man who hadn\u2019t washed in days. <br>\r\n\u201cListen pretty boy,\u201d said Mack, his nose touching Heath\u2019s, \u201cYou follow OUR rules out here. If I get ANY problems from you, you\u2019re swimming back to England.\u201d<br>\r\nThey stared intently into each other\u2019s eyes for an eternity, and finally, breaking the silence, Heath let out an explosion of laughter. <br>\r\n\u201cMan,\u201d he giggled, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone so wound up since the time I put glue in the headmaster\u2019s shampoo! You should have seen HIS face!\u201d<br>\r\nMack shook his head in disgust, and Paul took over. <br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d he began, \u201cLet\u2019s all relax. We\u2019re going to have to get along and most importantly; we\u2019re going to have to depend on each other. This mission is very dangerous and the last thing we can afford to lose is our cool,\u201d he looked at the two men and added, \u201cNow grow up! The two of you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAt least on my boat,\u201d said Heath, \u201cWe\u2019ll have enough room to stay out of each other\u2019s way.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou boat?\u201d asked Mack angrily, \u201cWe\u2019re taking OUR boat. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy boat has all the equipment in it,\u201d answered Heath coolly.<br>\r\nMack stared at him, unmoving.

He looked at Paul and then at Celia, \u201cAre you coming?\u201d<br>\r\nThey all got in the raft, leaving Heath on the shore by himself. As Mack rowed towards their smaller boat, they heard Heath shout, \u201cNigel, get the boat alongside theirs!\u201d<br>\r\nMack was fuming, \u201cWho the hell is Nigel?\u201d<br>\r\nThe engine on Heath\u2019s boat roared as the large vessel began coasting up to Celia\u2019s sailboat. A plank began to lower itself onto the deck of the smaller boat.  On the starboard gunwale of Heath\u2019s boat, was the name, \u201cSaurus,\u201d meaning \u201clizard\u201d in Latin. A small man with a moustache stepped onto the plank and onto the deck of Celia\u2019s boat. <br>\r\n\u201cThat must be Nigel,\u201d muttered Paul sensing the heavy tension of Mack. <br>\r\nThey reached their boat and brought up the raft. Gina went into the cabin to get their belongings, while Paul began packing his charts and nautical equipment on the bridge. Celia went to the galley to get the perishable food they had on board. Mack angrily threw some T-shirts into a bag and headed for the deck. He found his favorite harpoon and checked to make sure the springs were tight. <br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t need that Mr. Mack,\u201d said the little mustached man, \u201cWe have something a lot more effective.\u201d<br>\r\nMack smiled with half his mouth and replied; \u201cI never leave home without this.\u201d He petted the harpoon like it was a cat. <br>\r\nSuddenly, a scream came from the galley. <br>\r\n\u201cCelia,\u201d whispered Mack running downstairs. <br>\r\nPaul looked up from his charts and followed the scream. When he reached the galley, he almost laughed at what he found. Mack held Jobey up by the armpits, crumbs and fruit covered his beard and his thin, holey shirt was soaked in milk. Celia was sitting on the floor screeching, and Paul had to take her away and assure her that everything was OK. <br>\r\n\u201cA stowaway,\u201d said Mack looking at the frightened Jobey\u2019s eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cJ\u2019ai faim,\u201d he mumbled, a piece of canned corn falling from his lips, \u201cI am hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like he\u2019s always hungry,\u201d joked Paul. <br>\r\nHeath emerged into the galley, dripping wet from the swim. He looked concerned and disgusted by the sight of Jobey. He noticed the harpoon on the table and pointed it at the lanky native.<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s this joker?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\nMack looked at Heath intently, and then shifted his gaze to Paul. Paul shrugged and looked blankly at his friend. He could have sworn he saw a smile hiding under Mack\u2019s stoic expression. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He seems to have grown up on a boat, because he was always barefoot, and his feet were flat as boards. His curly brown hair looked as if it had always been subjected to salty winds. His jolly face was covered with skin the texture of burlap.<br>\r\nNigel wasn\u2019t the only mate on the yacht. There was Weil, the quiet mechanic and Georgie, a self-proclaimed \u201cprofessional\u201d thrill seeker who followed Heath like the plague. <br>\r\nAs Paul\u2019s team boarded the Saurus, Paul could hear Heath complaining to himself about the stench coming from Jobey. <br>\r\n\u201cWelcome aboard,\u201d greeted Nigel. <br>\r\nThank God, thought Paul, at least somebody on this expedition is sane. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have the feeling this expedition is getting bigger?\u201d asked Mack eyeing Weil and Georgie. <br>\r\n\u201cWe need all the help we can get,\u201d answered Heath dryly. <br>\r\n\u201cWhere is our cabin?\u201d asked Gina. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease follow me,\u201d answered Nigel leading them below deck. <br>\r\nThe interior was amazing, Paul felt like he was in a shrunken renaissance mansion. The wood that lined the walls was dark brown and lacquered, complementing the navy blue carpeting beautifully. This was a little over the top, he admitted, but it sure would be nice to ride in style. Nigel showed Gina and Paul their room. They entered and began unpacking. <br>\r\nPaul had never even seen such an expensive looking room in a hotel. The gold-rimmed king-size bed was adorned with silk sheets and caressed by silk curtains blowing over a porthole. They even had their own bathroom. <br>\r\nGina put her arms around Paul\u2019s neck and began kissing him. <br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the Love Boat,\u201d she said with a smile. <br>\r\nPaul returned the kiss, and began undressing his wife. The moment was too perfect \u2013 this was better than a honeymoon. They collapsed onto the bed, intertwined. He took his pants off and she grabbed his buttocks. He let out a sigh and began fiddling with her bra-strap, trying to get it undone. <br>\r\nSuddenly, the door flew open and Mack barged in yelling, \u201cHoly shit guys! You should see this place.\u201d<br>\r\nRealizing he was interrupting an intimate moment, he mumbled a lame apology and quickly closed the door. Paul looked into Gina\u2019s eyes and they both began laughing. After the laughing subsided, they made love and waited for the next person to barge in.<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take too long before Heath knocked on their door. Paul quickly got dressed and walked into the corridor. Everyone was waiting for them, including Jobey, who had no idea what was going on. By the looks on their faces, they all knew what Paul and Gina had been doing in there.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Paul sheepishly, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He whistled and bounced jauntily as he walked up to the deck and towards the back of the giant yacht.<br>\r\nPaul was directly behind him, trying to peek over Heath\u2019s bouncing shoulder, and devoured by anticipation. Directly behind Paul, Mack was grunting impatiently.  <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna love this,\u201d said Georgie in an Australian drawl. <br>\r\nThe small crew reached the stern, and Heath let out a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\nPaul finally realized why Heath was acting like a child. The sub was unlike anything he had ever imagined. It was roughly thirty feet in length and it was the shape of a fat cigar. The hull was painted white, and scattered with portholes. On its prow was a large domelike bubble, large enough to fit three heads comfortably. On the fore of the sub, were two mechanical arms equipped with titanium hands and retractable utensils. <br>\r\n\u201cHere she is,\u201d said Heath, \u201cThe Megalodon.\u201d<br>\r\nPaul looked inside. There was enough room for six. In the back was a special decompression chamber that could fit a person in a deep-sea diving suit. It was even equipped with a refrigerator. <br>\r\n\u201cMegalodon?\u201d asked Jobey<br>\r\n\u201cMegalodon,\u201d answered Paul, looking up from the sub, \u201cThe fiercest shark to ever roam the seas.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh-oh,\u201d said Gina rolling her eyes, \u201cHere we go.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMegalodon,\u201d continued Paul, \u201cWhich means \u2018great tooth\u2019 had teeth 6 inches long, and a jaw aperture of six feet. It was said to weigh more than a sperm whale, and could grow up to eighty feet in length! Some people claim to have seen Megalodon to this day, although it was probably a whale shark, or a great white.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI did my research too,\u201d added Heath, \u201cThose enormous sharks were deep sea divers. They could crush the shell of the thickest turtles. Hence, the sub\u2019s name.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d asked Mack incredulously. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d replied Heath.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re not sure?\u201d asked Mack. <br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d replied Heath, \u201cIt\u2019s classified,\u201d he shot a glance to Nigel and cocked his eyebrows, \u201cI guess you could say I got her at an army surplus store.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJesus,\u201d answered Celia, \u201cWho\u2019s arm did you twist to get it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDarling,\u201d began Heath, moving into Celia\u2019s personal space, \u201cSometimes all it takes is a little persuasion.\u201d <br>\r\nCelia took a step back and mumbled, \u201cPig.\u201d<br>\r\nHe looked around with a smile and said, \u201cShall we take her for a dive?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally it was Paul who was forced to make the decision before anyone else objected. \"Alright, lets saddle up.

Besides why would we all be here if it weren't for a little adventure? Don't kill the fun now.\" grinning he entered the rear of the Megalodon ushering the others to follow. Something about his personality seemed to defy theologic of human nature. Paul stood back as the others entered, attempting to gauge Heath's handle on the situation. As usual, he seemed cocky as ever, but never really put any good amount of thought into anything he did. Risks were simply something that he never trulyconsidered a possibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Celia, take my hand. I'm sure you'll enjoy your space in the Megalodon.

I know that you're husbands is quite the man.\" He couldn't help but keep the lighthearted sarcasm out of his voice. He was lucky thatPaul was in a generous mood today because from his point of view, Heath was out looking fora broken nose. \"Alright, come on Pops, try and bring your old frame in here. I know the arthritis doesn't help much, so that's why I'm here to give you a hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god Heath, you have no idea when to quit being such a smartass. I should have cracked you right in the face for talking to my wife like one of your little golddigger playboy models.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy Paul, you know I'm the designated jester on this trip, and if I'm correct I thought I heard a little jealousy in your voice?\" he was smiling that wry, punchable smile again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get me up there you massive goof off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, now were on the same level. I was hoping you could manage a little kidding around, even with all of the 'serious' stuff you're doing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind doing us all a favor Heath, and stop to take a breath every once in a while. We would appreciate the silence for a short amount of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got to go through these couple of instructions and then I'll get out of your hair and let you sleep, Gramps.\" This time it was Mack who said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, get on with it pretty boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, first of all these switches up here belong to me and me only. That means all of you silly kids are going to have to keep your hands to yourself for the time being. Secondly, please don't  bitch at me to stop and look at fish.

Lastly, stay out of my hair unless you want your balls busted real good, or unless of course you're Gina or Celia in which case I will gladly keep you company. Comprende?\" He couldn't keep that stupid looking smile off his face if he tried. It was easily learned by everyone there that the best way to deal with Heath was to simply not talk at all.

The Megalodon was only wide enough to fit the passengers in a single file line with it's small berth. It seemed insidious how Heath had arranged the order from front to back: him, Gina, Celia, Paul, and then Mack all the way in the rear. Everyone had noticed, but only now once they were already settled in. Gina could see even from behind how the corners off his mouth had pulled themselves into another smug grin. Was it possible that even his frat-boy attitude hid some kind of deep genius or feeling? As soon as the thought passed her head it almost seemed laughable. The man, if he could even be called that, was a womanizer in every sense of the word. Sure, he was wealthy, ambitious, and...well, damn good-looking, but he was no reliable or noble character. Surely his egoism about women was flawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preparing to dive, the chasm has been located. I would strongly advise hanging on, this baby's got some kick to it.\"<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but notice how strong, yet sensual his voice was. Wait, what? She was married and this kid was already getting to her. It was unbelievable she could actually think anything sexual like that. Maybe he needed a little taste of his own medicine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship nosedived hard and jumbled the crew around quite a bit. Gina used the opportunity to make it look as if she had been thrown up against the back of Heath's chair. Much to her surprise it seemed as though Celia had quite a similar idea. Unfortunately for her, her entrance was not nearly as smooth and she cracked the front of her nose directly on the back of his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeath immediately spun away from Gina, as if he almost never acknowledged her presence, to tend to the wounded Celia lying on the floor of the Megalodon. Mack must have realized that Celia was ejected from her seat because his voice called out from the far reaches of the sub. \"Celia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeath was quick and deft in his actions, which reminded Gina of one of those Japanese chefs that cooks on the open grills for entertainment. Almost inhumanly, he found the padding and the gauze, lifting her up by the small of her back to apply pressure to her bleeding nose. It looked almost romantic in a sense the way he was holding her, that is, if bloody noses and scrapes could ever be considered romantic. Still, Gina felt sharp pangs of annoyance with Celia for being so clumsy that she stole everyone's attention. Her nose had almost stopped bleeding and Heath was busy addressing a scrape which had brought his lips dangerously close to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep this bandage on for as long as you can, but before we dive we'll have to seal it up completely. I have some liquid skin in the kit. For now, keep pressure on your nose. The bandage on your arm is disinfected as well, so you won't have to worry about that.\" Gina noticed how his breath had flowed over the side of her neck, but then she reminded herself that this wasn't sensual at all. Nope. Meanwhile, Mack was throwing a temper tantrum in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that dirty rat touching you!? I swear I'm gonna...\" Celia cut him off before he could list the horrendous things which he would make Heath endure. She looked into the rich playboy's eyes and swore she saw tenderness there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine up here Mack, Heath is just helping me out since I was clumsy. Thank you, Heath. I never thought I would say that.\" this made him smile. Not the same egocentric sarcastic smile, but a genuine smile that was warm enough to melt any girl's heart. There were no girl's here, however, only women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all I could do to help, I hope it's enough.\" Again, those eyes drew her in, but she refused to be swept off her feet so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, thanks.\" Gina felt the twinges of jealousy coming on, but dismissed them as best as she could because they were so unfounded. She couldn't help but feel relieved when Celia returned to her seat. Heath had sat back down at the controls and looked too busy to talk. This frustrated Gina slightly, though she channelled her emotions quite easily and decided it was time for this hotshot Brit to come face to face with what he really was. A scumbag. Nonetheless she would more than enjoy toying with him first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Captain Cool, how are we looking?\" She managed to push herself up against the seat in such a way that her breast was firmly pressed against his shoulder blade. The move was extremely uncomfortable, yet was seamless and looked totally natural and accidental. Bingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina.\" The response was so informal and unperturbed that it almost seemed rude. Adding to this, he hadn't even looked up from his station! Not giving in just yet, she ventured an arm around his back, resting her hand upon his shoulder near the base of his neck. She was laying the traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we stop to look at fish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeath spun around to find that Gina's face was a lot closer than it should have been. She had made an effort to brighten her eyes and leave her mouth slightly open in order to lure him in with the full shape of her soft lips. It shocked her to see how stony his expression was. Completely indifferent. Was something wrong with her approach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" He said flatly, unconcerned with her emotionally charged pickup lines. One last try and then she could go back to treating him like the butt-end he was. Her hand was still perched on his shoulder. She began messaging him slowly, her fingers pushing against his strong neck and back muscles. When he had turned back around to face the control panel, Gina had surreptitiously moved her mouth close to his ear. This was the man-killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the softest, sultriest voice she could muster she said, \"Wow, Heath, you're really tense! I think the Captain needs to relax a bit...\" He yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a very pretty girl Gina...\" It was working! Time to go in for the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But do you really think you can seduce me?\" Oh crap, now what. The statement struck her like a brick wall. There was no getting around it. She was backed into a corner and now she had to fight her way out. His eyes were a deep blue like the ocean surrounding us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I'm too good for a rich man-slut like yourself.\" She turned to leave, angry at herself for being stupid enough to put herself in such a situation where some twenty-something douchebag had free reign to trod over her emotions. But how could he have known? He WAS still gorgeous...however awful he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina, come here...\" His voice was pure hypnotism! She turned around boiling up inside, but not willing to share anymore of herself with his kind. Like a depressed child she dulled towards this man. He was smiling that lover's smile again and she felt her stride falter for a second. Get yourself together, woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was careful to keep her distance this time, and averted her eyes from his gaze. They sat quiet for what seemed like an eternity until Heath finally spoke. No longer was he a man of jokes and witticism. Now he was thoughtful and reticent, quite odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have all tried...repeatedly...the models I mean...\" he was lost in thought and for the first time Gina could have sworn she saw a fraction of a deeply emotional side of this man. Perhaps he was just lost. \"They all try to Snag a piece of the fortune. I've lost myself in many women only to find that they are truly heartless. The best ones, the ones who I trusted, they had this way of stealing you away. Let me show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe planted a finger on Gina's chin and forced her to look up at him. The embarrassment was beginning to fade, but she still didn't know what to make of the situation. His eyes were bright in his modelesque face. \"They say the eyes are gateways to the soul. Whenever you lie, whenever you smile, it's the eyes that convey the true meaning. To have believable eyes, you have to make believe yourself. You must see the love in them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gina stared into Heath's bright blue eyes and knew unmistakably what can only be described as love. The emotion which it carried seemed to overwhelm her. It enveloped her totally, and like a puppet on a string, when Heath reached out to touch the back of her neck, she brought her head forward instinctively, drawn in by his eyes. It was only when their lips touched that their passions were merged for an instant or an eternity. Tongues clashed and hair was combed. Each had a desire to be closer than the other. It was only when Heath stopped; abruptly it might have seemed, that Gina realized what had just taken place. His eyes were of the frat-boy again, laughing and egocentric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, my dear friend Gina, is how to seduce properly. I can have it all on paper if you want a copy. Mind you, it might get a little pricey. The secrets of love and sex aren't easy to come by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you, Heath!! I hope you rot in a hellhole!!\" She promptly slapped him upside the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Hey, looks like we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sub had slowed down significantly so the passengers on Heath's vessel moved toward the front to get a better view. Celia was right over his shoulder again, followed by the ever adventurous Paul on the other side, staring out into the deepest blue with intense intrigue. Behind Celia, Mack was eyeing up Heath angrily, he wasn't sure what kind of mind games this character was capable of so he kept his fist clench should the need arise to sock him a good one right in his mouth. Off in the corner barely paying attention was Gina. She was still fuming over the make-out incident. Now she didn't want to be even within a couple hundred feet of the trashbag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul must have noticed this peculiar acting. Being the supreme adventurer of the group he broke his gaze towards from the inside of the cavernous pit to attend to Gina strange behavior. \"Gina, look! We've made it farther down int the chasm than we had diving! It looks almost endless!\" His eyes were big and excited like that of an extremely manly child. Gina could only content herself with Mr Manventure for so long at a time. Paul quickly noted the coldness of her attitude. \"Gina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really tired Paul, this trip is taking it out of me. I just need some peace and quiet for a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of Paul's focus to draw his attention away from the adventure at hand to soothe his wife's needs, but he did it anyway. \"Gina, I understand. Whatever you need just tell me. You know we can talk about anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina gained a little bit of her happy elf back then, and it became clear like it always had after a hard day why she had married this rugged man with a gentle heart. Still she hated Heath's guts and wasn't sure if she could deal with the fact that he was friends with her husband. She would save these issues for later once the mission was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Radar is picking up some things ahead. It looks as if were about to enter a very narrow portion of the chasm. It might be a tight fit.\" Heath's voice came from the pile of people in the front of the boat. Mack was quick to retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sailor boy, let's see if you can keep us alive through this, because I swear to God if you put my wife's life in danger, you're going to be the first one to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeath had no issue replying smartly to this obvious attack, even when Mack was pounding his fists together quite scarily. \"Hey Big boy, you know I would never harm such a beautiful creature such as your wife. Besides if you want to get through this alive you're going to have to trust my driving\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMack growled lowly. Paul put a hand on his longtime companion, he was going to need to relax if they all wanted to get through this as a team. That being said, if they lost Heath, they wouldn't have the equipment to continue. \"Just try to deal with him for now, we'll be back on land soon enough and then you can do whatever it is you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMack grinned a sinister grin, revealing a predatory smile. \"Oh I'll be more than happy when that hour comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright we're nearing the narrow part, I've put the sub in reverse so that gravity will or should carry us through very slowly. This isn't easy stuff so I suggest giving me a little room to breathe here for a little while. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew of the Megalodon moved towards the rear of the ship, congregating near the seat of Mack's chair. Celia was the first to say something against the quiet of the subs backward humming. \"Well, he seems nice enough...\" Mack's eyes were fire. He couldn't believe his own wife could deal with such a jerk off like Heath. Paul once again was forced to play the mediator. It was a job he was good at, but was becoming harder now that everyone seemed to be turning on Heath. To be honest he wasn't a big fan of the guy himself, but he owed him for providing the necessary assistance without so much as the slightest quarrel. \"Yeah, well, he's all we have right now. Unless one of you has an additional 5 million to throw at buying a sub for ourselves, I think he's our best bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean have to like him, or even enjoy looking at his obnoxious face.\" Mack was still giving his wife the stink-eye for saying something about Heath. Celia was one of the few people who could argue a point with Mack and not pay with bruises or broken bones, perhaps this was why he chose her as his spouse. They were heavyweights in terms of arguing. Mack wasn't used to losing, but Celia made it a point to always win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Mack, you sound like a little kid. Grow a pair and get over yourself. Heath is here right now so we have no choice but to deal with him. This trip would go a lot smoother if we were all friends.\" Paul saw the conflict escalating, but was at a loss for anything to break the tension. Gina and Paul observed helplessly as Gina's gaze burned holes into Mack's head like a stare of pure death. Mack's eyes were unfaltering, a deep brown that refused to be penetrated. It looked like two boxers squaring off to go at it . Now it was just a matter of who would throw the first punch. And then something strange happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, you sexy psychopath!\" Mack's deep voice came from the depths of his chest, ridden with lust. This surprised the other couple in the vicinity. Gina more than Paul. It could be expected what happened next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelia dove into Mack's lap, plopping her more voluptuous frame on top of Mack's large body. Like animals, they initiated the beginning rituals of courtship kissing and falling all over each other. Had Mack and Celia not been considered the alphas of their given genders it would have been slightly disturbing. Oddly enough, it seemed that a man with as much testosterone as Mack, and a woman as fierce as Celia could only love in a harsh, defiantly sexual way as they did. Still, Gina spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, you guys?\" She looked at Paul for help. He simply shrugged and laughed wholeheartedly. It is what it is. Heath's voice vibrated through the hollow of the sub. Mack growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've made it through...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gina stirred up an octopus and leary of her, decided to attack and attach itself to her mask. She gently removed him and he quickly swam away, in case she wanted to make a meal of him. The sponges and sea anemones were such brillant colors. A moray eel surprised her, as he poked his head out between two large rocks. He looked as if he were knashing his teeth at her, but she knew he was just breathing and would retreat back into the crevice he had been hiding in. Good thing she wasn't a lobster, octopi, or small fish, or she would be a tasty meal for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed several nursesharks on the sandy bottom, the only species of sharks that actually rest on the bottom of the ocean floor.

She sensed there was no immediate danger, he merely wanted to get her attention. The shadow above her turned out to be a large school of tuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed him through a large crack in a rock wall, where Mack was waiting for them. Mack led the way as they followed closely behind him. Something was about to happen, she could feel the hairs on the back of her neck rise, call it woman's intuition or whatever, they were close to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMack and Paul stopped abruptly and she bumped into the back of Paul and saw what they were looking at. It was a big stone building with a dome rising out of the middle, several tunnels leading out from it and small domes on the end of the tunnels. It was all lit up! How could that be? There was no electricity under the ocean.They had to dive even deeper, coming up under the largest dome floor. Ther was a large hole in the bottom and they swam towards the light and yes, as they took off their masks, there was air. They lifted themselves out onto the stone floor and stood up. They were very surprised to see a brass diving bell, suspended from the ceiling by chains and against a couple of walls, stood old timey diving suits with heavy brass helmets.</span></div></div>",

They took the one nearest them and discovered that the room at the end was divided into sections. The first room was where food must have been stored. The storage room was filled with the remains of fish and another room showed signs that plant life had been grown. There was another room with several crude looking tables and chairs, at least thats what they thought they should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second tunnel had a glass roof over it and they watched as fish and dolphins swam by. The room at the end was used as a records room, and they found, not alien writings, but human. Paul picked up the journal. It began:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not know how we come to be here, we were on a deep sea mission when we lost control of our diving bell and ended up here. It was if the bell was sucked into this place all on it's own. We tryed several attempts to get our diving bell back to the top, but the quake sealed off our escape. Even with our diving suits, we could not get through, they were too big and heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many things are strange to us here. There are symbols throughout the place that we've never seen. The huge magnifying glass outside the window is where the daytime light hits it and we think is how we have lights and heat, but that is pure speculation on our part. There is a big metal machine in one of the rooms, we do not know what it is. We used things from the sea that were useful to us, such as, clam shells to eat off of and cleaned our teeth made from seaweed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They made toothpaste, with the binding agent alginate, which is derived from seaweed.

There were symbols lining the walls along the tunnel.  These symbols were also above each door she came to.  She decided the symbols must be indications of what each room contained.  She looked in all these rooms lining the tunnel.  Most of them looked like personal quarters, and smelled like sweaty socks.  As Gina looked down the tunnel she saw what seemed to be a large room with a bluish glow and symbols larger than any of the others.<br>\r\n\tWhen Gina made it to the open door of the room she looked inside.  She couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.  Before her stood a huge metal machine that took up at least half of the room.  There were many small colored lights that marked buttons and levers along the front of the machine and a large globe that hovered at the top of the machine.  The globe had a blue glow that gave the room a ghostly feeling.<br>\r\n\tAs Gina stepped closer to the machine a projection shot out from the blue globe and immediately standing before her was a tall slender life form.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cI am Information Processor One.  Ipo for short.\u201d said the projection.  \u201cWhat information may I help you with?\u201d the projection asked. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
