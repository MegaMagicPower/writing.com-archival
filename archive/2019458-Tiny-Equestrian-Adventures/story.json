Where ever you are, you are definitely not in your bed, or even in your house, anymore. A fuzzy woven material lies beneath you, with a texture almost like hair. If you didn't know any better, you would say that you're on some kind of rug or carpet.<br>\r\nThe place in which you find yourself is dim, severely limiting your visibility save for a few dark blobs covered in shadow off in the distance. Your only source of light trickles in from a moonlit window. You jump to your feet in a wild panic, murmuring things like \"Where am I?\" and  \"Did someone kidnap me?\" and \"Why is everything so damn big?\", all questions you were unlikely to answer on your own. So the only course is to blindly navigate the room and find some answers. You slowly, carefully, creep across the room towards the dark shapes you spotted earlier, taking care not to run into anything or create too much noise. Luckily, your path is relatively clear, with few obstacles to block your path. Whoever owned this room must be a responsible custodian to have such a clean room. As you approach, the fuzzy shapes start to become more distinct: it looks like a large pallet or bed, with a large shape underneath a pile of blankets gently breathing. Off to the side is a large sleeping bag, its contents also containing living, sleeping cargo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can try climbing up the bed, examine the sleeping bag, or try to find an exit point</span></div></div>",

Immediately you make contact with an immense furry body, expanding and contracting with every breath it takes and putting off an immense amount of heat. You already feel yourself sweating just being close to the thing. The fur itself is luxurious and silky, smelling sweet like vanilla. If you had to take a guess you were somewhere in the middle of the creature's back, though it's quite possible you could be wrong.

You can feel the breaths pushing up against you as it rises and falls. You skitter all around feeling and exploring your surroundings until you run into a firm bump bigger than your head, contrasting with the area around it.

Running your hands along the fabric you struggle to find an entry point. There is no zipper visible unless it's in a spot you can't reach like underneath.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMaybe it's got a drawstring somewhere? Frustrated by your fruitless search, you change tactics. There HAS to be some way into this thing. Maybe you could try crawling underneath to search for the entry hole? That's risky, the giant whatever-it-is could easily roll over and crush you. Granted, you would have a fabric barrier between you, but you'll still be pinned. And which end to start from? You can't exactly tell the two sides apart. Through an impeccable leap of logic, you elect to go with the side facing nearest the bed first. Scurrying over you crawl underneath and carefully wriggle your way in there... and... success! You found the entry hole for the head! It's drawn tight though, there might barely be just enough room for you to squeeze in there.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou only hesitate a moment for a moment before shrugging. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.<br>\r\nYou grab the elastic and push with all your strength. With this the hole widens JUST enough you can fit your legs in. You wriggle, shimmy and shake until the rest of your body follows suit. Immediately once you're inside you feel a wave of moisture and heat from the giant creature slumbering inside. It's pitch black inside so you can't actually see the creature, but you can definitely hear it, taking slow measured breaths as it slumbers.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe space in here is rather tight. Walking might alert the creature so you get down on your knees and crawl to where you figure the creatures head must be, compressing the soft fabric beneath you as you go along. It's curled up into the fetal position near the center of the bag, laying on its side. Inching the way along your journey you accidentally run into what you think must be hair. It feels soft and silky making you think the owner might be female. Upon touching it the hair immediately curls around you, as if trying to ensnare you.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWell, it looks like you're in a pickle now. What are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

It's almost as if the hairs themselves are alive. Down below the breathing catches, and then lets out a quiet moan. That... is definitely female.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe more you struggle the more the filaments cocoon you. You finally stop when it's clear you aren't going to accomplish anything. Exhausted, you accept your fate and soon drift off into sleep<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA small amount of light trickles into a gap in your small covered space, tickling your eyes and rousing you from your long sleep. You flutter and blink allowing yourself to wake up and let your eyes to adjust to the incoming sunlight, A light test wiggle confirms that while the filaments have loosened a bit to allow for more free movement, they still held you quite firm.  The whole room rocks gently from side to side, cluing you in that your monstrous captor is likely on the move to someplace, completely unaware of her tiny passenger.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMuffled voices (captoress included) talk and laugh outside. The sound of her voice sends minuscule tremors throughout your body shaking you slightly. You strain your ears to hear but can find no meaning in their words. They might as well be speaking in another language. As a precaution, you grab more hair to anchor yourself in case movement shakes you loose.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt might be safer to climb upwards to the top of the head, you reason. That way you can get a high vantage point and finally get a good look at the world around you. First, you grab a clump above you and pull yourself up to jimmy your legs free. Then like some kind of star athlete, you steadily haul yourself upwards, taking occasional breaks to rest your weary arms. You are not a star athlete. Surprisingly you find little resistance from the hairs themselves. Maybe that was a one time only thing or a fluke? Maybe you're just an insane suicidal idiot who can't leave well enough alone?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFinally, you find a place where you can climb no more, and poke your head up into the bright daylight and take a look around. A field of silverish white hair contrasts heavily with the azure blue sky. Two great monoliths rise up to either side of you. occasionally turning and twitching in the cool breeze. They are clearly covered in light grey fur, Are you on some type of animal?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSlowly you sink down, contemplating what you just saw. Those were ears. EARS. Covered in FUR. You must be losing your mind, This... this has to be some kind of dream. You hitched a ride on an animal that just so happens to live in houses and sleep in tight snuggly beds and, if you weren't mistaken, those were horse ears. So THAT's why you couldn't understand what they were saying.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSteeling yourself, you resolve to make for one of the ears. You've come this far, it would do no good to chicken out now. If this is a dream, the worst thing that can happen to you is die and then wake up. Maybe you could even have a little fun in the process.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe... left ear looks like a safe bet, given that's the one closest to you. Walking across the fluffy mane is an interesting experience. Soft and bouncy yet not quite solid. Every once in a while a sudden quick movement makes you lurch, as the girl-creatur-- er, the horse turns her head to look at something. Thankfully you don't think she can feel you, otherwise, she would've already attempted to swat you off her mane. The sun is a full quarter ahead in the sky when you finally reach your destination, meaning an hour had passed. From your lofty perch, you can see everything.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou are definitely in a town, giant horses of a shocking array of colors weave in and out of buildings, run vendor stalls, or otherwise mill in the street, speaking in their incomprehensible language. The buildings themselves look rustic, like an old German village or something right out of The Wizard of Oz. Beside you is a dizzying drop to the flagstone ground below. You'd rather not fall so you cling closely to the furry ear.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou would be remiss to not mention the giant white glasses looming ahead of you and partially obstructing your view. Whoever wore these glasses must be intelligent, or have very poor eyesight. Either way, you're fairly certain they won't try to eat you if you have your biology right. Maybe you should try to make contact? It couldn't hurt, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like the rest of the horse's body, the ear is lined with fur and pink skin, although it's it's much finer here. If you want to get her attention now would be the place to do it. You inhale and exhale deeply to inflate your lungs and clear your throat. The little breath you take causes her ear to twitch slightly. You feel almost sorry for what you're about to do. Inhaling a final time, you hold it before you shout \"HEY!\" into the exposed pinna. The response is immediate. A loud gasp is heard outside, making the head turn sharply. You quickly lose your balance and fall flailing into the ear canal.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe interior is hot and slightly waxy. You hear a loud pulse roaring and shaking your own eardrums, threatening to deafen you. Your world is turmoil as the filly desperately bats at her ear with a hind leg to try to dislodge the loud irritant.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter a short drop you land on the soft flesh, a little shaken but unharmed, however, you are now so far in that there's no way you can exit without assistance. You are once again in the dark, surrounded by soft inner tissue. If you had to take a guess you're somewhere near the eardrum<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"...Hello?

Hmm, yes I see.\" Twilight Sparkle says, pulling an otoscope from an agitated filly's ear. \"Well, Silver Spoon, I didn't see any signs of ear mites when I looked in there. Are you certain a bug crawled down into there?\"<br>\r\nThe two of them were in Twilight's castle study after Silver came running up to her complaining of an earache. Frankly, she didn't think she'd be the first pony to run to when there was a minor medical problem but she was flattered nonetheless.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilver hoofs at her ear a bit as if trying to get water out.<br>\r\n\"I definitely felt something go in there. Can you look again?\"<br>\r\nTwilight smiles brightly. \"Of course! I'll just need to find a way to be able to really get in there without risking damaging your hearing.\"<br>\r\nShe walks over and disappears behind a bookshelf, and soon returns dragging a huge bean bag chair in her teeth.<br>\r\n\"Lie on this a while and get comfortable. I'm going to go find some books dealing with ear ailments and remedies. We'll get you fixed up in no time!\".<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Silly filly, we're going to spending quite a bit of time together today.\"<br>\r\nTwilight taps her chin pensively. \"You know what? I think I just might have a good idea of where that book is. You just sit tight and don't worry about getting up to read a book while you're waiting.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back,\" she says walking out the study door, leaving Silver alone.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSometime later:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilver Spoon constantly fidgeted in the bean bag as she waited for Twilight to come back. Every toss and roll upon her beany seat was punctuated by an irritated, impatient sigh, with the occasional cuff to her ear to attempt to dislodge the tiny creature. Where is Twilight? She said she'd only be gone for a little while. Doesn't she know that a \"little while\" means an eternity to a filly? Looking for ANY source of entertainment to alleviate her boredom Silver's eyes roved across the room, but could find none but a few dusty old bookcases.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGetting fed up, Silver jumps to her hooves and trots over to get a closer look. Scanning the shelf she finds nothing but a series of science encyclopedias and law books, which she wouldn't be caught dead reading in public lest she be swiftly labeled an egghead. Wedged in a little nook on the shelf is a box. Pulling the box out reveals several coloring books for foals and a fancy cardboard box with the words Dragon Pit printed on it.<br>\r\n You turn the box over in your hooves, reading the blurb printed on the back.<br>\r\nIt reads \"Dragon Pit! Fun for all ages! Make your way across the board to escape the volcanic island. Make sure to watch out for the boulders coming from the volcano or you may find yourself falling to you doom1\" There are no instructions so you guess there might be some inside.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe's so engrossed in examining the old board game that you do not hear Twilight's approach.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Silver jumps, nearly dropping the game to the floor. \"Oh, whoops! I'm sorry, I should've said something upon entering. That's that game that Starlight, Sunburst, and I played recently. Dragon Pit, I think it was called? Starlight doesn't play it much I don't think she'd mind terribly if I lent it out to library goers. Did you want to take this home with you?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilver nods her assent. \"Yes, please.\"<br>\r\n\"Perfect!,\" she exclaims, \"I'll just carry it out with you when you go.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSetting the board game on a table she then says, \"Now, on to business. I've adapted a spell that allows me to both extract with surgical precision what's in your ear that's bothering you and, also let me see it firsthoof, kind of like sticking a tiny camera in your ear that can also grasp things. Now, this may feel a little funny, but trust me when I say as long as you stay perfectly still, it won't hurt you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSilver Spoon idly bats at her ear, briefly considering before replying, \"Okay, but this is so embarrassing. Promise you won't tell anyone about this?\"<br>\r\nTwilight smiles warmly. \"I promise. Now hold still...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwilight closes her eyes and concentrates. A soft hum begins to emanate from her horn, slowly building in volume until it reaches a crescendo. When next she opens her eyes they glow a clear white, a sign that she's putting a lot of effort into maintaining the spell. A single white tendril worms its way out of the tip of her horn, twisting this way and that as if observing the state of the room. It seemed to notice Silver Spoon, who had her own eyes screwed up tight in anticipation of an inevitable invasion. Sensing the tension in Silver's body, the magical tentacle reassuringly caresses the nervous filly's cheek. If it could speak it might say something like \"there is no need to fear, I will not hurt you.\" This puts Silver's mind more at ease and she visibly relaxes. Satisfied, the tendril turns its attention to the affected ear. Silver Spoon couldn't help but giggle as the magical tentacle tickles the entrance of the pinna. Wasting no more time it pours into Silver's ear canal, providing a soft and soothing sensation as it digs ever farther down to find the offensive bug trapped down inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleeping has somewhat restored your energy, allowing you to concentrate on tackling the main issue that has lately befallen you. Literally. You fell inside a giant horse's ear and now can't get out. Yeah...<br>\r\nAll of your attempts to scrabble your way up the waxy tunnel have failed, as have attempts to reason and communicate with the beast that has entrapped you. You sit down on your tush, considering your options. You could always just wait until the great beast goes to sleep, possibly providing an exit if she lays down just the right way. There's no guarantee that will happen though, making waiting a risky move.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHaving already slept you feel no particular need to rest right now. Rubbing your temples, you close your eyes and concentrate on the ambient noise, trying hard to clear your head. It's not until you open your eyes again that you realize that you are not alone. A wispy... thing pokes out across from you, illuminating the small you space you are both in. You stare at in shock, hardly daring to breathe. Similarly, it's \"looking\" at you intently, seemingly waiting for you to make a move.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou back away from the wisp into the wall behind you, cautiously keeping an eye on it, which wasn't hard, since both you and it filled the cramped space. You don't know why, but you have a feeling that the wisp is benevolent<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe shock soon wears off and is replaced by a hefty curiosity. Was this some kind of natural biological phenomenon like what happened with the hair? Were the creatures trying to communicate with you in some way? You wave your hand up and down, then from side to side. The wisp seems to follow your every movement, stretching and undulating to keep up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHello!\", you say, waving with a big smile on your face. \"can you maybe help me get out of here?\" You point up out of the ear canal. The wisp follows the movement of your finger and then returns back to you. It begins undulating wildly, making you think you got through to it. \"Yes! Yes! That's it! Take me out of here!\" Still wiggling about, the tentacle of light swiftly retreats back the way it came. \"Hey! No! Wait!\". you cry. \"Come back!\" There was no reply.<br>\r\nAfter kicking the wall in frustration, not caring for the suffering of the creature you were in, you kneel down to the ground, hands over your eyes. Your moment of emotion is short lived however as you feel a mysterious strong force grip your entire body, restricting your movement. The force rapidly lifts you up out of the shaft and into blinding light.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou shut your eyes tight and fight back with all your strength, which doesn't accomplish much except exhaust you and leaves your body in a fine sheen of sweat, You can hear two voices, both female, speaking rapidly in an unknown language. Actually, it's just one dominating the conversation while the other occasionally interjects. Soon, the vice-like grip on you dissipates and you feel yourself being gently set down a cool, smooth surface.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou slowly open your eyes, acclimating yourself to the outside world from your dark, oppressive former prison. As your blurry vision comes into focus you realize that you're in a glass jar, with a screw top lid with breathing holes poked in adorning the roof. Through the transparent glass walls, you can see a full 360 view of the world around you. The voices seem to have gone but will likely return, giving a small chance to survey the room you're in. The glass jar sits close to the center of a wooden table, with small reliefs and symbols carved into it. Against the walls are several large bookcases stretching all the way across the room in a semi-circular pattern, with a rolling ladder resting against one of them. You must be in a library or a fancy study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're really going to have to think outside of the box if you're going to get out of this one. You rub your chin pensively as you take stock of your current situation. Since you're at the center of the table charging the glass would probably do no good. It might be possible to spin the glass if the jar is uneven at the center, but that might take even more energy than charging the thing since you'd have to be in motion a lot. It might even fog up the glass a bit. Wait... That's it! Fog! You'll write something in the fog!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith that you start jogging around the perimeter of the glass, exhaling heavy in an attempt to build up moisture. You also shed your shirt so that your sweat won't wick into your clothing and instead go into the air. The jar also rotates slightly on every pass, moving you bit by bit closer to the edge of the table. After a couple minutes of strenuous exercise, you can see your work beginning to pay off. A Steam is starting to condense on the glass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are now Silver Spoon, and you are not quite sure what's going on. You had expected Princess Twilight to send you on your way after pulling the bug out of your ear and then dispose of it, let it loose outside or whatever it is she wanted to do with it. You didn't really care one way or the other. Instead, she was bouncing around the room like an overgrown filly, squealing \"Ohmygoshohmygoshmygosh\" dragging the poor little speck behind her.  Wanting to break the awkward display, you loudly clear your throat.<br>\r\nIt's only then that Princess Twilight remembers that you're in the room with her. and comes to a skidding halt. Blushing, she awkwardly scratches behind her mane. \"Ehehehe. Whoops! Sorry about that, got a little carried away.\"  <br>\r\nStill gripping the tiny thing in her magic, she trots over to you and waves it in front of your face. \"Silver, do you what this is?\" Squinting hard, you struggle to discern the shape of the tiny animal, which seemed to have curled up into a little ball in self-defense. After a little while, you finally give up.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Twilight. What is it?\" She beams at you. \"It's a brand new species! Unknown, undocumented, and now we get to contribute to science by naming it and studying its habits.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wow, Twilight that sounds really interesting\", you say, completely disinterested. \"So I get to name it? Ugh, as weird as it is it was found on me after all.\"<br>\r\nTwilight purses her lips. \"Weeell, at least the scientific name will be named after you. If you don't to that's ok as well. No pressure.\" Lighting her horn, out of a flash of light a jar appears. I'll just put this little guy up for safekeeping so I can study him in my lab later.\" Unscrewing the lid, she drops the creature inside and then closes the lid back up, placing the jar on the table. \"I'll escort you out of here so you don't get lost. Nearly all of the hallways look the same so it's easy to lose track.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStretching your entire body, you get up out of the bean bag chair and trot your way to the door, You expect Twilight to be following you but when you turn you spot her, face up against the glass making silly noises and a kissy face. You loudly clear your throat again, making her bolt up in surprise. \"Huh, what? Oh, right. Um, Silver Spoon, I'll lead you out of here.\" Before they exit Twilight turns back to the room and calls out, \"Mama will be back soon, so you be a good little unidentified species while I'm gone.\" Rolling your eyes, you continue down the crystalline passage with Twilight Sparkle in tow. Occasionally she would call out instructions like \"Go ahead and make a left here\" and \"Go straight, you're doing just fine.\" This place looked a lot smaller from the outside. Finally after a lot of walking you reach the main hall and the exit, Opening up the double doors you walk out into the sunshine and breathe the fresh, Equestrian air.<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief, you begin to trot back into town, but you don't get very far before you hear a voice behind you shout \"Wait!\" Out of the blue sky, Twilight swoops down beside you, \"Silver Spoon you forgot your board game!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Um, that's ok, princess. I can come back for it another time. You should probably be watching your new creature to make sure he doesn't crawl into any more filly's ears.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't need to worry about that. It won't take but a minute since I know exactly where it is. You just wait here for a minute then I promise I'll get out of your hair for the rest of the day.\" With that, she vanishes in a flash of violet light as she teleports, and you're alone again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe minutes tick by slowly. You distract yourself by lying on your back and counting the clouds in the sky and blowing on dandelions, one of the other. Just when you were beginning to worry you hear a loud pop, signaling Twilight had returned. When you look up at her you realize her expression had completely changed. The happy, dorky mare now wore a grim countenance, like something had gone terribly wrong. In her magic floated a small saddle bag, a pencil and notebook, and for some reason, the glass jar that had the creature in it.<br>\r\nYou are about to say something but you are cut off by Twilight speaking, \"Silver Spoon\", her voice is commanding, \"I want you to take this with you and carefully observe it. Write down everything you see. Everything. Be concise with your notes. I'm expecting a report on what you've learned so far in about a week.\" She floats the saddlebags onto your back and secures it around your barrel. \"And one other thing, you have to Pinkie promise me you won't tell anypony about what you saw until I give the go-ahead, ok?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"But why?\" you blurt out. \"I don't want to be near that thing! It crawled in my ear, and-- and--\" Twilight leans down and ruffles your mane reassuringly, \"You're just going to have to trust me. I'm not the right mare for the job, and you are. A scientist needs an objective point of view. It won't be that hard, it can't even get out of its glass bottle. All I need you to do is take a few notes every day. Now, about that Pinkie Promise...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGulping, you quickly go through all the motions, which satisfies Twilight. After that exchange, she brightens up considerably. \"Well, now that that's settled, do you want me to give you a lift home? Your hooves must be pretty tired.\"<br>\r\n\"Um, that's all right princess. I can walk home by myself,\" you respond, eager to get away from this embarrassment. \"Well alright then, I'll leave you to it.\" Her voice drops to a lower key, \"And remember... Concise, Notes.\" Nodding, you stow the jar and the notebook and start off on the path to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nou slowly trudge your way down the path, eyes downcast, never making direct eye contact with anypony.<br>\r\nDespite the lightness of the items that fill your bags, you still feel a heavy burden bear down on your shoulders. Why had Twilight given you this responsibility, instead of taking it upon herself? Was there some sort of lesson to be learned here that she didn't want to tell you about? And what was that about keeping it a secret? Trying to turn it over in your mind and make sense of it all made your head hurt.  You turn your head and gaze back at the saddlebag fitted over your back. Whatever was in there had to be important. Princesses don't just give you things and then tell you to keep it a secret for no reason. Twilight took to the role so readily that sometimes it's easy to forget she wasn't always the leader of Ponyville.  You get so lost in your introspection that you don't notice the outstretched hoof until you crash into it.<br>\r\n\"Silver Spoon, are you listening? I've been trying to get your attention for the last ten minutes!\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, whuh?\" You reach up and rub your nose, adjusting your glasses in the process. In front of you stands Diamond Tiara, your best friend, and quite honestly the last pony you wanted to see right now. The look she's giving you is smoldering, you can almost feel the heat burning into your face.<br>\r\n\"Silver Spoon, what's with you? Here I am trying to tell you about my day and you're just walking there moping.\", she angrily relays.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"O--oh. I'm sorry Diamond Tiara, I was out of it for a second there. I... I need to get home.\" You try to step around her but she blocks you. \"Hey!\", she pokes you in the chest, \"what's so important you can't stop to chat with your best friend? Did somepony die or something? Is that why you're trotting around with your head between your legs? Answer me!\" You are seriously tempted to tell her, but the promise you made to a Princess looms in your mind. On the other hoof, lying to your friend feels wrong, and Di's not the type to go around telling secrets.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I've got an assignment to do from Twilight and it's really time sensitive, so...\" You try to get around her, but once again she blocks your path. Diamond Tiara's face morphs into one of wonderment. \"Really? A homework from Princess Twilight? That's so cool! Can I help?\", she exclaims in a way that suggests she's not going to take no for an answer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou sweat nervously, eyes shifting from side to side as you try to scope out the pink menace. You spot her at a cafe, smiling and laughing with her friends while stuffing her face with a cupcake, That smile never fades as she slowly, deliberately turns to look at you. You shudder before turning back to Diamond. \"...Ok, I can't TELL you what it is but I can show you... just not here.\" You hope your loophole abuse won't bring the pink devil down on your head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ok. We'll go to your house then. Lead the way,\" Diamond says.<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara joined your party!<br>\r\nMoving down the busy street, the both of you keep walking until you come to a large ornate house, one of the oldest in Ponyville, and the place you call home: Golden Arrow Manor. You tell Diamond Tiara to go ahead and meet you up in your room, you have to tell your mother that you're going to have a guest over.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stalk throughout the rooms of the house, searching for any sign of your mother. You get it when you humming and clinking coming from the kitchen, signaling that she was probably in there preparing the evening meal. When you poke your head in you can see her, loading a pile of vegetables onto a pan, that she planned to roast in the oven no doubt. You hesitate a moment before calling out, \"Hey, mom.\" Hearing your voice she turns to face you. \"Oh, hi sweetie! I didn't expect you to be home so early. Dinner's not quite cooked yet as you can see, but you're welcome to help me set the table.\" You hesitate again. Lying to your best friend is pretty bad, but lying to your mother is awful. \"I, um. Di's going to be over a while to help me with a ...project\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, well isn't that dandy!\" your mother exclaims. \"I'll just throw a few more carrots on the pile for her. Don't let me keep you then, I'll call you when dinner's ready.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, mom.\"<br>\r\n\"No, problem sweetheart.\"<br>\r\nWith that, you slink out of the kitchen and up to your room, a feeling of dread making your skin crawl. Waiting in your bed is Diamond Tiara, back arched in anticipation of what you're about to show her. \"Are you ready for this, Di?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was born ready, Spoony. Lay it on me.\"<br>\r\nYou unhook the flap of the saddle bag and reach your hoof inside. \"You can't tell anypony of what you're about to see.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, cross my heart, hope to fly and all that jazz, just show me the darn thing!\" she exclaims impatiently. Gripping the little glass jar, you slowly draw it out for Diamond to see. The little creature, sensing natural sunlight for the first time in awhile, starts to come alive. Diamond Tiara stares at it, unblinkingly, for a long moment. The creature stares right back. She tries to hold her stone cold expressionless face, but it isn't long before her facade begins to crack. \"Don't laugh,\" you warn.<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna laugh,\" she says, though her expression says otherwise.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou angrily stomp your hoof. \"I mean it Diamond, if you laugh I'm going to--\" You are cut off when Tiara lets out a loud SNRK, tears streaming down her face as she tries to hold it in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That's it? That's what got you so riled up? It's so tiny and cute. I think I'll name you Little Diamond.\"<br>\r\n\"I'M the one who's supposed to name it, not you. You wanted to see it so now I'm showing it to you,\" you hotly argue, retaliatorily giving the glass bottle a few shakes to emphasize your point.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, chill out Silver, I didn't mean anything by it. I just thought it was silly is all, getting so worked up over a little thing.\" Tiara taps on the glass with her hoof. \"So, what is that thing supposed to be, anyway? Some kind of insect?\"<br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" you huff. \"All I know is that I'm supposed to study its habits and then record it in a notebook.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, what's it doing now?\" You and Diamond both turn to look at the jar.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou are still in a jar, and you still have no fucking clue what's going on. After your little escapade to try and get the Higher Up's attention, a giant purple horse pulled you out, performed some hocus pocus on you, then unceremoniously dropped you back into the jar, dropped the jar into a dark place that you had to sit for hours, twiddling your thumbs until some greater power decided to pull you from your blackish hell, which turned out to be two horse children who proceeded to argue about something, loudly, while shaking your glass prison.<br>\r\nNow they're staring at you like they expect to fucking do something. Hey ladies, you want to see a card trick? Oh, sorry, they're in my other pants that just so happen to be in an alternate dimension. Too bad, so sad.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou press yourself up against the wall, loudly banging it on it and screaming. The two horses flinch. &lt;Ooooh, now look what you did Silver. I think you made him angry.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;I did NOT, and how do you know it's a he anyway? For all you know it could be a female.&gt;<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHearing that gives you pause. Did they just... no way. You have to try this out. Experimentally, you point up to the pink one and then straight up to the lid.<br>\r\n&lt;Hey... I think he's trying to tell us something.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;No way, Di, that's completely ridiculous. You're seeing things.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Really Silver, I'm not joking.&gt;<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSmiling, you jump up and down and then point back up to the lid. When you get out of here's you're going to have to thank the pink one, somehow...<br>\r\nWhile the grey one is distracted, the pink horse picks up the jar and...<br>\r\nSnap. With a soft pop, the lid comes unscrewed. The glass gradually tilts as she flips it over, making you slide all the way down onto the soft bedding.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGrateful to the pink horse child, you begin walking around a big loop, creasing a heart shape into the bedding.<br>\r\n&lt;Um, Silver? You may want to look at this.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Can't you see I'm busy here? Princess Twilight told me my notes had to be precise.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Un, well okay then.&gt;<br>\r\nThe pink horsie moves her head and drops her snozz down on the bedding, warily watching your every movement.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSprinting up to her nose, you playfully boop her on the snout, then quickly jump away. Like an old-fashioned cash register, her eyes go crossed and her tongue sticks out with a blep.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSeeing the giant moist tongue reminds you of how thirsty you are after exerting so much energy earlier. Maybe she wouldn't mind... if you had a little taste? Cautiously walking back up to the pony's tongue, watching for any sudden movements, you kneel and give the organ an experimental lick. Startled by this, the pink horse gives out a loud Hmmmmm but otherwise does not withdraw her tongue<br>\r\nIt doesn't taste too bad, in fact, it tastes a little bit sweet.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDeciding that the pony probably wasn't going to harm you, you prop your self up against her tongue, pointing at your mouth to indicate that you're thirsty.<br>\r\nSeeing this, Pinky starts to speak again.<br>\r\n&lt;Thour pwetthy thirthy arenth you litthle guy?&gt;<br>\r\nGently she flicks you off her tongue, making you fall to the fabric below, and pulls it back into her mouth.<br>\r\nRising up, she sits on her haunches, taps her friend on the shoulder to get her attention.<br>\r\n&lt;What is it, Diamond? I'm busy.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Silver, you've got to see this. I pulled this little guy out of the jar and--&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;You WHAT?&gt;<br>\r\nThe silver one sharply turns to look at her.<br>\r\n&lt;Sil, listen, I think--&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;WHY DID YOU DO THAT? Oh dear Celestia, if I lose Twilight's test subject she'll be so disappointed in me.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;I think you're overreactin--&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;I'll have to leave town, change the color of my fur, hide my cutie mark, all because of one.. little....&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;SILVER SPOON&gt;<br>\r\nThe grey filly flinches at the sudden outburst, her ranting reduced to a quiet whimper.<br>\r\nPinky turns to nod at you, then points to you with an outstretched hoof.<br>\r\n&lt;He says he's thirsty&gt;<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou lie as still as you can, for fear that they might try to trap you again. Upon seeing you, the grey filly quiets down a bit, but still looks ready to jump into action should you try to escape.<br>\r\n&lt;Wha... what do you mean he SAYS he's thirsty. Can you understand what he's saying?&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Not in so many words, no. It's just a gut feeling I have that he's a lot smarter than he looks.&gt;<br>\r\nOn cue, you rise into a sitting position, wrapping your arms around your throat and coughing dramatically to prove her point.<br>\r\n&lt;See what I mean? He's a pretty smart little guy, aren't you fella?&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;So that must be why Princess Twilight made me promise not to tell any pony... Um, if he's thirsty, I can go get him a glass of water.&gt;<br>\r\nPinky shook her head.<br>\r\n&lt;No need. Watch what he does here.&gt;<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth, tongue lolling out, and slowly drops it down to your level.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Honestly, that's not an unfair assessment, since they caught you and there's no real chance of escape. At least they're gentle, considerate captors: neither of them has shown any inclinations towards malice, yet. The drooly tongue looms ahead of you, slightly disgusting and yet strangely inviting. After a moment's hesitation, you shrug your shoulder as if to say \"The hell with it\", and jump onto the bumpy organ. With gusto you attack, slurping up liquid as quickly as you can. Vibrations shake you as the filly giggles low in her throat, almost unseating you and making you fall back onto the bed. The grey filly looks interested.<br>\r\n&lt;Hey, let me try.&gt;<br>\r\nThe grey one drops her head down and opens her mouth as well. You are partially walled in by the two organs, The air is starting to dry out the juices of the pink filly until she draws it back into her mouth again. Maybe you could try drinking from the other one now?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAcross from you, a similar path opens up, slick with saliva, although perhaps less moist than the one you're the current one. The tongue is starting to become sticky, so you roll downwards to the bed-sheet before you are pulled into the pink filly's mouth. You walk up the grey filly's open mouth and give it a poke. The spongy tissue gives a tiny amount before gently bouncing back. A tentative lick reveals that while the saliva of the grey filly tastes similar to the pink one, it has more of a tang to it, like citrus. Like before, you climb up and begin rapidly drinking the fluids, until you feel sated.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCompletely satisfied, you roll over onto your back and rest a moment, until the tongue becomes dry and sticky. The grey filly allows you to roll back onto the bed before closing her mouth.<br>\r\n&lt;That's pretty weird.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;It's neat, though, isn't it?&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Yeah it is. Um... we could probably leave that part out of the notes though.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Why would you want to do that? For all, you know filly saliva could be their primary source of nutrition.&gt;<br>\r\nThe grey filly makes a face.<br>\r\n&lt;I'll just keep it in mind in case she asks. I don't want to be the one to tell her we let her science project out and then slobbered all over it.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;What, do you expect me to tell her?&gt;<br>\r\nThe grey filly glares at Pinky.<br>\r\n&lt;You'd better. You're the one who caused this whole mess.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Me?! If we had gone with your way we would never have learned so much about him. You should be thanking me.&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Ooooh, you little...&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fillies glare daggers at each other, filling the air with electricity. Between them is little old you, who stands to have a bad time if the two giants decide to come to blows. So, wisely, you make the choice to get out of the way in case a fight breaks out.<br>\r\nGrey comes dangerously close to Pinky's muzzle.<br>\r\n&lt;So, its come to this.&gt;<br>\r\nPinky strikes back, smooshing her snout into Grey's<br>\r\n&lt;Yeah, I guess it has.&gt;<br>\r\nGrey pulls away and adjusts her glasses.<br>\r\n&lt;Well, if that's the way you feel then--&gt;<br>\r\nPinky suddenly tackles Grey, who whinnies in surprise. The glasses go flying off her head, narrowly missing you before skidding off the side of the bed. Following the break in her foe's defenses, Pinky harshly bites her on the shoulder, aggressively dominating her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou are stunned and transfixed, unable to look away from the strange sight in front of you. Is this how all the horses solve all their friendship problems or is it just limited to these two? They roll all over the bed wrestling with each other, neither one of them gaining an advantage, Occasionally you had to dodge away from their rolling bodies, but for the most part, they stayed away from you. Eventually, they just roll onto the floor, leaving the notepad lying forgotten.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShaking your head a few times, you stand up and walk over to the unguarded notepad. Luckily, the pencil was still in its place after the jostling that shook the bed, allowing you to break a small piece of pencil lead to help you write on the pad.<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment, considering what to doodle. An obvious question springs to mind, but you decide that can wait until later. Instead, you draw a big stick doodle of yourself, the jar you were contained in, and two rough sketches of the ponies currently in the room. Hmm, what else? Oh yeah! You sign your name and print your current age below the picture.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWalking over to the edge of the bed, you peer down to see how the two combatants are doing. Covered in frothy sweat, panting from lack of air and matted, disheveled manes. Pinky is on top so you guess she's the one who won the fight. Neat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPinky holds out a hoof to help Grey off the ground, which is pretty cute, and then they hug, which is adorable, and then.. they enter some kind of self-grooming ritual, which is weird, and then they groom EACH OTHER, which is even weirder, and then something happens which is difficult to process. All the mess they made to their manes and tails... vanish, as if by magic. You can literally see the hair moving and snapping back into place right before your very eyes. It's surreal and you don't like it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFeeling like this might be a good time to act, you try to shout and wave your arms to get their attention, but they seem not to notice you in their bliss. They crawl onto the bed, one after the other, and collapse into a writhing mess of nuzzles and cuddles. You half expect something lewd to occur, but the pure act quickly dispels those thoughts and leaves a warm, fuzzy feeling in your heart.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNot wanting to disturb their cuddle session, you make for Pinky's tail. You aren't exactly sure what you expect to find there but you persist anyway. As you draw close you blush as you notice her... lady bits and anus. Living in a nudist society must be an interesting experience, to them, being nude is so common and boring nobody bothers to talk about it. Alongside are the grey filly's private parts. They're so close together that they're practically touching... but, ruining a perfect moment by molesting the poor unsuspecting fillies might be a bad idea. Alternatively, you could leave them be and go exploring.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bedspread drapes not quite halfway down to the floor, attempting to climb down it will still provide a fall once you reach the bottom, though it's probably more survivable. You could also try lugging something soft to throw over the side to break your fall, though that would take a lot of effort and leave you tired.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSearching all across the bed you look for any spare mane or tail hair that came loose in the tussle. Surprisingly, it's quite difficult to find. You find a few stray strands here and there but none are quite long enough to rappel you down to the floor. There's also the problem of securing any hair you do find so you don't immediately fall upon climbing down the rope.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou gather up all the hairs you found and start tying them end to end, occasionally testing the knows to make sure they still hold. Then, you tie the makeshift rope to the end of a tail and make sure it's secure. Satisfied, you toss the rope over the side and peer over just to see how far it reached. That's a lot closer, but still not where you want it to be.<br>\r\nWelp, no one ever accomplished anything without taking risks. You give your pair of hosts a friendly salute, then start climbing down the rope.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSlowly you descend the rope, trying to keep swinging to a minimum and being careful to untie any knots. It isn't long, however, that you come to the end of your rope, and have to make a leap of faith. The view below you isn't quite as dizzying as when you started, but you still wager there's still a long drop between you and the hard floor. You hold your breath, and upon releasing it you let go, watching the ground rush up to meet you. You bounce once, twice, and then fall flat on the ground. Adrenaline pumps through your system as you sit up, gasping for air. That... actually didn't hurt all that much. In fact, it didn't hurt at all. No broken bones, no bruises. You're just as fresh as you were when you started.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGrinning, you get up off the floor and dust yourself off. No more will Anon be confined to any one place. Now he makes his OWN path. You stride through the wide open door, leading into a dimly lit hallway. Along the hall are multiple sets of doors, leading to a dead end, and at the other begins a flight of stairs.<br>\r\n Explore down the hall or go downstairs?</span></div></div>",

There look to be about 5 stairs per flight, That's not too bad, and they don't look too high either, probably best suited for equine usage. You hop down, one by one, to the first flight. No problems here. Down you go to the second flight. So far, so good. You go down and down until you reach the very bottom of the stairs, leading into a downstairs hallway.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA distant humming can be heard from deep within the house, along with a faint sizzling noise. There must be another horse somewhere in the house, possibly in a kitchen. You meander through the hallway, trying to track the voice by listening for the humming to get louder. The sizzling gets louder when you get close to the end of the hallway, and you can actually hear a melody now. You can't tell what song it is, obviously, but it sounds really catchy. A powerful smell of spices and sweet-smelling food wafts into your nose, making your mouth water.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFollowing your nose, you walk through a door into a spacious room. A large grill sits on the wall opposite you, upon which cooks six corn cobs, explaining the sweet smell you got earlier. Next to the grill is what looks like a modern stove, from the ground you can't exactly see the top but you guess it's topped with the standard electric heating elements. Over near a window sits a table, covered in cloth. Upon entering you find the source of the melody, a gargantuan fully grown mare reaching up for something in a cabinet. Her coat is a sort of yellowish-orange color, and her mane and tail are burnished copper. The aforementioned mane and tail are also done up into long braids, and she's wearing a blue string of pearls around her neck, making you think that this must be the silver filly's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can:</span></div></div>",

As she walks over to the grill to turn over cobs to make sure they cook evenly, zip under her tail, eyes drawn inexorably upwards. The braided tail hides nothing from your view, you can easily see her sex from where you stand, a bit puffy and engorged. You feel pretty dirty for string but you honestly can't look away.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou aren't exactly sure why, but you feel like you HAVE to get in there somehow. Looking for any way to climb the gigantic mare, you grab onto her tail, which drags along the floor a bit as she's working. The braided hairs give you plenty of handholds to climb, as you perilously ascend the yellow mare's tail. You laugh at yourself inwardly when you realize you are literally climbing a colossus.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou climb your way up to the apex of her tail until you reach her dock, then jump onto the short hairs covering her plot, slowly shimmying your way under the tail, Looking down you can see your goal below, the puffy pussy sticks out underneath the tail hole. There isn't a whole lot of hair to stick to down here so you'll probably have to carefully slide down the ponut to get to the warm, meaty center.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou slowly climb down the soft spongy ponut, using the center as a hand-hold, you give it a little kiss. You're pretty sure she felt that, but at this point, you just don't care. If you die now, at least you'll die doing something you love. With the ponut now behind you arrive at your prize. The smell is overpowering, and you are the hardest you've ever been.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGently kissing and licking the flesh all around you, you ease yourself down, sliding down the middle of the pussylips until you're in just the right spot, then push yourself inside, spreading her lips apart.<br>\r\nThe taste is incredible, indescribable, and the scent reeks strongly of hay and something else you can't identify.<br>\r\nYou crawl along the fleshy tunnel, being gently squeezed all over, kissing the path in front of you the entire way. The warm juices she excretes soaks into your body, getting slightly wetter as you go along. Your incredibly hard penis strains against the confines of your pants, desperate to be free.<br>\r\nIt's difficult to move in the tightly confined space you're in, so you stop and twist your body so you're in a sitting position, and yank off your pants, leaving you bottomless. Your cock presses into the moist ceiling, finally free to be in the place it was always meant to be, although in the wrong circumstances. You quickly rub your hands all around the vaginal walls, rapidly increasing the wetness. If you could hear anything but the sound of heartbeats and dripping juices you might have heard a moan at that point. You lie back and flip over, resuming your crawl Your journey isn't over yet.<br>\r\nDeeper and deeper you go. It's now so wet that you're worried that you're going to lose all traction before you reach your destination. You are now being actively squeezed and massaged by vaginal walls, pulling you ever deeper to the holy gates. You're almost there, you can feel it. Your cock threatens to burst, but you ignore it. There's only one place this is going...<br>\r\nYou take a long lick along the vagina, filling your mouth with succulent juice. Your trip takes you forward so rapidly it isn't long until you reach her deepest barrier: the cervix. The undulating walls push you up against the fleshy door, which was soft while the mare was in estrus, to allow a stallion to shoot his seed directly inside, to make for absolute certain that his sperm knocks up the mare in heat. There is no stallion here today. Only you.<br>\r\nYou embrace the cervix as a lover, softly caressing and massaging around the fleshy door of life whispering sweet nothings and tenderly kissing it. You weakly grind yourself into it, not knowing for sure how much longer you can last. All you know is you need to make the moment special, something to be remembered fondly.<br>\r\nYou fuck your hips harder and harder, your cock taking control of your entire body. It knows what it wants, to fill the womb of this heat driven mare with a filly or colt, and honestly, you're starting to appreciate its point of view. The time was not yet right though, you needed one more thing to finish, one more confirmation that what you were doing is right.<br>\r\nYou deeply rub against the inner walls of the mare, massaging her muscles deeply, still pondering the ultimate question. As the door of the innermost sanctum slowly opens, you finally get your answer. Impatient to get to the source, you cram your entire body into the cervix, rapidly jerking yourself to the sound of her heartbeat. You can't see what's ahead, but you can feel it, pulsing ahead of you. Your vision gradually goes white until finally... you release, directly into the source, your purpose done.<br>\r\n Lying on your back, breathing heavily, hips still jerking, trying to expel more baby batter, you realize something important. Your cock hurts. Like really hurts. You then realize something else, possibly even more important than the first. You weren't done. You have to go in there. To finish the job.<br>\r\n You pick yourself up and slowly crawl through the mouth of your lover, your wife, your life, saying goodbye to the outside world, you tumble forward down into the wet darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't until a while later that you awaken, lying on a soft spongy bed of uterine tissue. Your hand gingerly rubs your poor cockhead and sore balls. That was fucking amazing. You'd never cum so hard or so much in your entire short existence. You unsteadily get to your feet and discard your shirt. You probably won't be needing now that you've already shed your pants. It wouldn't do to just walk around half dressed would it?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n You blindly walk with hands outstretched, until you run into a uterine wall, then, holding yourself steady with one hand, you slowly walk along the wall, trying to measure how big the space is you are in. On the way, you notice a few landmarks, such as two passages that lead to the uterine horns or ovaries, each containing vaults full of genetic information, and the slope leading up to the cervix, where you entered from.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n You climb up the gentle slope, widening your stance to balance yourself, then walk right up to the cervix, testing it to see if it could still open. You found it tightly closed, meaning that for the moment, you couldn't leave here even if you wanted to. The good news is that must mean that the womb has accepted your offering and some of your sperm have united with an egg. Sighing, you slide down the little hill and rest for a moment,<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Lying back you rub the back of your head and sigh, contemplating everything that's happened so far. You're a little overwhelmed that you're going to be stuck here for a while and the fact that you're going to become a father, even though that's precisely the reason you came in here in the first place. If this really is a dream it's a strange one, though not necessarily one you want to wake up from. After this introspection, you curl up and go to sleep on the soft floor.</span></div></div>",

You start off in the water, floating on your back and idly gazing at the clouds up in the sky.<br>\r\n You lazily backstroke through the water, sometimes pointing and giggling at the funny shape of the clouds. That one looks like a pony, that one looks like a notebook, and that one looks like a corn on the cob. After a while, you gently drift onto the sand, with the water covering your bottom like a blanket. Soon you pull your self out of the water and wade along the tide, the waves swiftly erasing any footsteps left behind you.<br>\r\n You trudge along the coastline, completely relaxed and smelling the sweet and salty scent of the ocean. The sun gently touches down on your skin, filling you with a warm feeling. After an indeterminate amount of walking you feel like you find a good spot for stopping, and plop your butt down on the warm sand, taking in the vista.<br>\r\n You scan the beach for any others that might be near you. You spot a large red and white beach umbrella a ways up the beach, shadowing a huge area when you can see a couple figures jumping and playing, and another figure lying in the shade, reclining upon a beach chair.<br>\r\n It takes exactly as long as you think it should to reach the shady nook. As you approach you can spot Grey and Pinky, except at a more reasonable size, building a sandcastle. Two beach chairs sit side by side, one occupied by Big Orange, wearing a nice sun hat and white shades. She turns and smiles, patting the chair next to her. She's offering you a seat.<br>\r\n She withdraws her hoof as you sit down, then twists and interlocks it with your forearm, mimicking holding your hand. The moment is sweet and blissful, making you so relaxed you almost feel like you're going to fall asleep again<br>\r\n She pulls your hand over and lays it to rest on her swell, then releases you. You rub her tummy in slow circles trying to find the life that awaited within. You lean over and kiss her deeply, sucking on her tongue. Her eyes are closed, humming in pleasure as you ravage her mouth.<br>\r\n The fillies are oblivious to what you're doing,, perhaps because this is your dream and you don't want them to. You could probably banish them if you wanted to, but decide to keep them around. They deserve their own day of fun. Now you are practically on her, letting your hands rove wherever they will, over baby bump and milky teats You can feel how aroused she is. You're probably ready too.<br>\r\n You break your kiss and brush your lips down her abdomen, finally stopping at her teats You tease her pussylips and clit with your fingers while sucking noisily on a nipple, making her moan throatily. Using your thumbs, you get her ready for what happens next.<br>\r\n Moving your mouth down to her nether lips, you drag your tongue up one side and down the other, lingering on her clit for a moment, then moving on. prying her apart, you flick your tongue in and out of the hole, never going too far in. You want to make this last as long as possible The world get imperceptibly bigger as you do this.<br>\r\n You playfully lap at her ponut, making her gasp This act of pure degeneracy love causes you to shrink a lot more, making you have to stand up straight to reach her pussy. Lapping at the clit causes a lot of juice to flow out, which you drink eagerly. You climb up between her legs, look her straight in the eyes and tell her you love her, then press the tip of your manhood against her entrance. Even now your height is on a downward spiral.<br>\r\n You grasp her flanks tightly, to keep yourself steady as you thrust into her. Likewise, she reaches up and grabs your shoulders, knowing what is about to come. You immediately lose an inch upon first penetration, but this doesn't affect your fit, yet. Every consecutive push makes you grow smaller and smaller, forcing you to adjust your grip every so often.<br>\r\n You're fairly small now. You've lost a little more than two feet in height, and yet still you relentlessly slam into her. Orange helpfully scooted herself forward so you won't be hanging off the ground. She could probably pick you up like a small child if she tried. With one of your small hands, you grab hold of her tail, tugging on it while you spank her flank with the other.<br>\r\n You now can't hold on to the flanks for leverage so you ask Orange to hold you until you finish. She happily complies, holding you up to her cunt like a lewd plus size action figure. You hope that she's getting some enjoyment out of this as well. Soon you'll be so small you'll have to stuff yourself inside her to pleasure her, not that that's a bad thing. You already did it once before and you can do it again.<br>\r\n Taking the clit in your mouth proves to be a challenge as it is so big you can barely fit it in your mouth. With the hooves holding you in place, your body slips ever downward into her love tunnel. Tilting forward you prepare yourself for the final descent, licking and stroking her feminine lips as much as you can. Her femcum gushes out like a fountain, giving you no shortage of something to drink.<br>\r\n Using the juices as lubricant, you slip inside the hole, stretching the walls around you somewhat, You drink as much delicious nectar as you can swallow, then swallow some more. Unlike before it's a tight fit, forcing you to stoop a little lower than usual.<br>\r\n You happily inch along the tube motivated by the desire to see your child, pressing your body out, especially your shoulders, to give yourself a greater girth, Your cock sinks even closer to the pillowy flesh than before, given your new size..<br>\r\n Delving deeper you eventually slow down your pace. There's no rush, your child isn't going anywhere. You briefly ponder how this could feel so real if it's all in a dream. You doubt your brain could fabricate so detailed a fantasy. Perhaps there is more going on here than you realize.<br>\r\n You push on, shaking the odd feeling from your mind. Probably best not to worry about it right now, since no harm has come to you so far.<br>\r\n Rubbing and kissing along the floor, it isn't long until you reach the cervix, and the final doorway to your foal. You find yourself giddy with excitement. You've waited so long to meet it, you don't even know what's on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time you push your head, and then your entire body through the tight cervix and tumble into the womb, ready for anything.<br>\r\nAs you roll into the womb you crash into something soft, becoming slightly wedged under it. Reaching up and stroking it you feel baby soft fur, and you can hear a strong heartbeat coming from the small warm, body. You pull yourself free and run your hands all over the soft mass. revealing a tiny, almost fully formed pony and an umbilical cord attached to the uterine wall. Lifting up the tail, you feel around to check the sex of the foal.<br>\r\nYou feel an itty bitty shaft, revealing that this foal is, in fact, a colt. Tears come to your eyes unbidden. A son... You have a son...<br>\r\nJust then you hear movement behind you, making you spin around in alarm. Hands outstretched you walk towards the noise, finally bumping into another soft warm body. A hasty sex check reveals this one to be a filly.<br>\r\nElated, you hug the filly out of pure joy, gentle petting the filly's head and ears. She seems to respond well to this. Not wanting to leave your son out, you rush over and hug him, placing a kiss tenderly on his forehead.<br>\r\nYou split your time even between petting your son and daughter, grinning broadly. After a little while, your smile fades a bit to gentle smile as you pat the foal's heads. They wiggle happily, making little noises in response. After getting up and pushing your son slightly closer you lie down and snuggle in between your two children.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou grow tired even in the dream as you lie in between the twins. You yawn and then settle down as your mind drifts. The dreamscape shakes slightly, drawing you even further into its soft clutches. Slowly, you close your eyes and let darkness overtake you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wriggle deeper into their embrace to escape the chilly air. They seem to be completely unaffected. You wedge underneath your daughter to provide partial shelter and get closer to a heat source.<br>\r\nThe air gradually starts to get colder, making you shiver violently. Isn't this just a dream? How are you feeling all this? You cling desperately close to her, trying to retain as much heat as you can in the biting cold. Then as suddenly as it began, the cold stops, replaced by a rising warmth that almost feels like a tropical island or a sauna.<br>\r\nThe heat and humidity continue to rise. making it somewhat hard to breathe.

As you open them you can see a thick steam surrounding you, making it difficult to see anything. You look up and that you're in a pure white room, with a roof without bound. A long, low wooden bench supports you. In the distance, you hear a familiar humming and the characteristic clop of hooves on wood. Then, out of the mist, she appears, a white towel adorning her head. She looks surprised to see you at first, then smiles and walks over to take a seat in the spot next to you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOrange lay her head across your lap, lightly breathing, the towel she was wearing now lying on the bench, neatly folded. You tenderly stroke her hair, whispering sweet nothings into her ear. You tell her how you saw your children, a healthy boy, and a girl inside her, both beautiful as their mother. She says nothing, but lets out a happy sigh, and nuzzles into your thigh.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well if you're happy I guess that's good, even if we don't understand each other.\"<br>\r\nYou pause.<br>\r\n\"Um, you wouldn't happen to know where we are, do you?\" Orange looks up at you with questioning eyes. then drops her head back down. She scoots her whole body onto your lap, nuzzling your side. \"Well, it looks like someone wants some pets.\" She drapes her tail over the bench, giving you easy access to her backside and looks up at you with longing in her eyes. You sigh. \"You're insatiable, you know that?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou move a hand along her back rubbing lightly at her fur with your fingers, while your other hand scratches under her neck.As you do this she throws her head back, closes her eyes and coos. \"I wonder how many times we can keep doing this.\" You grasp her flank. then continue downwards fingers just grazing her clit. You tease her by tracing a path around her marehood She's wet and you can already smell her arousal. \"Are we just going to continue like this forever, living in a dream within a dream but never truly meeting? I don't even know what's real anymore.\" You unhook the pearls from her neck and feed it, bead by bead, into her tail hole. This makes her start panting and writhing, as she gasps in pleasure.<br>\r\nOnce you get most of the pearls in you start pulling them out again, then pushing them in. Every POP makes her entire body shudder, leaking more juice from her thick folds. \"I guess I'm going to have to wake up at some point. I just don't know if I'll be able to tell I'm woken up.\" Using your free hand you insert your thumb into her pussy and rapidly play with her lips, creating a wonderful friction.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou flip her on her back and begin attacking her belly with your mouth, licking and nibbling along her neck towards her face. Her abdomen is definitely bigger now, with her teats especially engorged. Along with your thumb, you insert and finger, and then pumping them out the orange mare The world begins to grow fuzzier, like all the steam in the room was being gathered into your eyes at once. Everything fades to black, and when your eyes open you can't see anything. You're resting on something wet and soft.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou get up and stumble around for a minute futilely searching for a light switch. , trying to remember where you are. You rub your tired eyes. Did you finally wake up?<br>\r\nIf you're awake, that must mean that you're back inside the womb. You rub your eyes again. Just how long were you asleep? You wander around unsteadily, checking to see if anything's changed while you were out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Be Gilded Lily<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou were not good with ponies. Specifically, you weren't good with ponies of the male sex. It wasn't the fact the fact that stallions didn't notice you. Quite the opposite.in fact. Every year you are swamped with invitations to go to fancy parties by your friends seeking to set you up with eligible bachelors and every year you turn them down. You mailbox used to get stuffed to bursting love letters and written propositions until you were forced to have your mail delivered by hoof. It wasn't like you hated them, and goodness knows you've considered a few potential candidates in the past, but none of them could live up to the high standards set by your late husband, High Tea. He was a stallion who knew how to treat a lady. He never asked about your money and loved you for you, and that's pretty much all you ask for. He was pretty good in bed as well and was always considerate of your needs. When he passed a hole in your heart that no ordinary stallion could fill. So, year after year you silently suffered through your heat cycle in silence, gritting your teeth and bearing it like a good mare should. Until last week that is...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou are Gilded Lily<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou are in your kitchen cooking roast veggies with corn on the cob, one of Silver Spoon's favorite dishes. You had already put the well-seasoned vegetables into a pan in the oven and are now preparing to shuck some fresh sweet corn you just bought from the market and throw them on the grill. You feel a deep burning in your loins, a sign that you are currently on your heat cycle. It hasn't bothered you much yet, but you have a notepad ready to ensure your daughter knows you won't be able to join them for dinner, just in case.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou pull the grill out of your wall and twist a dial. The enchantment in the heating element does its job and gradually heats the metal plate. You lubricate it with a liberal amount of oil then leave it be, moving over to the sink. A small pile of corn sits in your sink, ready to be peeled and buttered. You carefully peel back each of the corn husks, removing the stringy silk, and then spread them with butter and tie them back up with twine. You try not to think about how phallic the corn looks and shoving one inside you with the butter as lubricant. Moving the cobs onto a platter, you walk over and place them one by one onto the grill.<br>\r\nYou add the rest, seriously tempted to use one as a makeshift dildo, but resisting. So far so good. Now that that's done, you need to set the table. You walk over to a wall mounted cabinet and pull out three ceramic plates and precariously carry them over to the table. You set them down in their appointed places, then sit down to rest a moment.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou take measured breaths, trying to calm yourself. You're not going to give in. You're not. You're going to finish cooking this meal and then enjoy a lovely evening with your daughter and her friend. Filled with new resolve, you get up and retrieve a pair of tongs to turn the corn over with, feeling a tiny itch in your flank near the dock. You dare not reach back there or you might try to scratch another itch,<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFlipping the corn over to cook evenly, you then walk over to the oven and check the vegetables. Satisfied that they're fully cooked. You pull them out and lay them on top of the stove to cool. Oddly, the itch has moved, to right beneath your.... You really don't want to say it.. And then, your heat decides to flare up. You bite your lip as the burning feeling strongly increases. Leaning up against the stove-top you pant. You might have to skip out on dinner to take care of your needs again.<br>\r\nThrough some herculean feat of willpower, you manage to get the plates fixed and call the girls down, and hastily scribble a note down in your notebook, then run to your room, locking the door behind you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou rummage through a set of drawers, looking for the one thing that can help sate the feeling that's overcome you. After a few moments of fruitless searching, you find what you were looking for, a medium sized dildo and a bottle of personal lubricant. You slather the fake cock with it and then carry the dildo over to the bed. A quick burst of pleasure comes to your mind as you sink down onto it.<br>\r\nYou slowly glide the toy the toy in and out, only partway into your pussy. You want to prolong the pleasure by not immediately shoving the entire thing in at once. As you pleasure yourself your mind turns to cocks, and when your mind is on cocks you think about breeding. You fantasize yourself as a broodmare, turned into a mindless foal factory only good for rutting and being filled with cum, over and over until you exhaust your egg supply. That's always been your secret fetish, one that you couldn't even tell your former husband about. You feel a tingle in your loins, as your ministrations start to build up to a climax.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPumping yourself with greater frequency, your eyes flutter underneath their lids. So many times you've denied yourself your right, and so many times you've suffered for it. If there was anypony out there who could fill your desires, make you feel wanted and loved, fill you with his seed on request, and even sometimes without a request, why, you'd get down on your knees and propose to him on the spot. You are so lost in your haze that you almost don't notice a tiny speck, a lump traveling up your love canal.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe bulge seems to move with purpose, twisting and turning inside you to generate more pleasure. Normally you would've begun to question this but right now you are just too turned on to care. You inch the dildo inside further with every new thrust, working yourself towards a big finish. The lump has now reached your deepest core, unable to go any further. You edge yourself further, only to be caught off guard as you feel immense pleasure emanating from your core. You let out a strained screech, and the dildo is blasted from your cunt by a torrent of juices. Stars sparkle in your eyes and your hearing temporarily becomes muffled. You curl your hooves in pleasure as you from down from your high, panting heavily.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFighting back sleep you crawl out of bed, your vision still fuzzy from that mind shattering orgasm. Might as well check up on the fillies and make sure they had enough to eat. Staggering out the door you walk through the house until you find the kitchen and peer inside. Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara are gone, already done eating and with plates already clean and put away. Silver Spoon had dutifully taken your still full plate and covered it with a cloche. She's such a good filly, even if you were a terrible mother.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUncovering your plate you eat the now cool food. You quickly eat the corn to banish any thought of using it as a sex toy. Not tonight. Creeping up the stairs you look in to see both fillies asleep piled to one side of the bed. You quietly close the door, before you realize you don't want to be alone tonight. Opening the door back up you creep into the room, crawl up onto the bed and wrap both fillies in a tight embrace, before you, too, drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You dream of a beach, You know exactly which beach it is because you've vacationed there with your daughter a few times. You, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon arrive in a fancy carriage, driven by no pony. You tip your hat to thank the non-existent pony driver, and with a whinny, he takes off and vanishes into the distance. DT and Spoony excitedly rush around the sandy beach playing tag, excited to be here. You don't know how long you can stat but thankfully you remembered to pack enough supplies to make all of you comfortable. You first pull out the parasol and stick it into the dry sand. opening it to provide some much-needed shade. Then you pull out a beach ball, a picnic basket full of goodies, several sand shovels, and pails, and two folding chairs, Setting up the chairs is a snap, you just shake them forward with your hooves and they automatically unfold. You sit in the chair gazing at the fillies gathering sand and sea water, reaching into the basket for a cold drink.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou relax and listen to sounds of the ocean waves, a tranquil stillness filling the air. The scene could've easily painted on a postcard, a moment frozen in time that could be enjoyed for eternity. You feel a tiny twinge of sadness that you couldn't enjoy the moment with some \"adult\" company. Just as that thought came to your mind a stranger appears on the horizon. He is oddly shaped, yet somehow familiar. Upon his approach, he smiles, then gestures to you to ask if the seat was taken. You shake your head no and he sits down next to you. You offer him a drink but he declines, then leans back and looks out intently at the fillies.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I don't think I know you, stranger, though I feel like I should know you. Have we met before?\"<br>\r\nThe figure simply shakes his head and smiles. Despite this, a feeling of familiarity, and longing bubbles to the surface.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well it's nice to meet you then.\" You reach over a hoof to shake his appendage, but upon touching him you find that you don't want to let go. You also can't help but notice his ...nakedness. He decided to just come to the beach completely in the nude. You frown. Why does that bother you? Ponies don't wear any clothes most of the time and nopony bat an eye. Further up the beach, the fillies are making good progress on their sand castle. They already formed the foundations and are now preparing to put on the parapets.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile holding his hand you get an idea. Maybe it would be better if he sat on your lap. Your body is far more soft and comfortable than some hard folding chair. It's the polite, neighborly thing to do. You tug on his arm, pulling his body towards you. Using your strength you easily lift him up out of the chair and fit him in your lap, facing inwards. You tightly embrace him, letting him straddle you. His eyes betray his curiosity. What, exactly, were you going to do with him?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe answer? Anything. You. Want. You pull him in closer to your body, poking and nuzzling his chest with your snout, occasionally taking a quick whiff of his body. He smelled clean, with a faint undertone of cinnamon and something else you couldn't identify. His muscles feel hard, powerful, but they belie a gentle, innocent soul, that wouldn't even so much as smack a fly in anger. You feel almost bad for corrupting such a pure creature. Almost.<br>\r\nWith your hooves you tenderly stroke him, looking him in the eyes as you do so. He was already semi-hard, a natural reaction to a mare such as yourself, but for what you needed him to do he was far too soft. In the meantime you pull him in for a kiss, slipping your tongue into his chaste mouth and tasting him. His resistance is weak as you dominate him, practically raping his mouth with your tongue. You hear a low groan come from him, likely the result of your masterful technique.<br>\r\nFeeling powerful, you release him and point down to your nethers. \"Since I'm being so generous I think it's time you return the favor, sweetie.\" Recognition flashing in his eyes, he brings his hands down and starts stroking your cunt with his thumbs. You slowly get each other off, stroking and schlicking until finally-- \"Hey, mom what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou freeze. Standing off to the side is Silver Spoon, looking at you curiously. This is not where you wanted to be right now. You force a smile on your face and weakly wave a hoof. \"H-hey baby, how are you enjoying the beach? What I am doing is... it's an adult game. You're too young to understand, but if you must know I am winning.\"<br>\r\n\"A game? That's really cool! Can I play?\" Damn, she's persistent. She must get that from you. Were it not for your current situation you would feel a swell of pride. Well, she's going to have to learn eventually, and getting a hooves on lesson from your parents is better than any school education. You sigh. \"Alright, but you need to listen closely to what I say. The rules for this 'game' is kind of complicated and I don't want you getting lost.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe eagerly nods, and you pick her up and lay her on your belly, legs splayed out a bit with her filly pussy showing. You gently tug and pull at her tiny lips making squeakily moan. Likewise, the stranger resumes work on your own lips. \"The first rule to that in order to win I, or you, have to cum as many times as possible. His job is to make us cum as many times as possible. It starts out simple, but it starts to get more complex later on.\"<br>\r\n\"A-ah, ok mom. What does cumming mean?\" You are getting really turned on. \"It's when a stallion makes you feel really super good inside like fireworks are going off in your head.\" The young filly gasps in pleasure. \"Y-yeah that makes sense, I guess.<br>\r\nYou pause a moment before remembering to say, \"Also, this game is best played between a male and a female, so don't go trying this with any other fillies.\" You don't really think that's going to work but any chance of grandfoals in the future is worth the extra time it takes. \"And this,\" you continue pointing at the large penis, \"has many names. All you need to know is that it belongs inside a mare, and should never leave.\" Picking up your daughter, you position her so she's hovering over the cockhead, then lightly press her down, moving her in tiny circles. \"When a stallion puts himself inside you, there's a good chance he'll spray a whitish liquid. That's good! When that happens, if a mare is in the right mood, she'll make a baby inside her. Isn't that neat?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe huge dick is obviously too big for Silver Spoon, so, not wanting to hurt her you lift her and set her down on the sand while winking. \"I'll just have to give you a practical demonstration.\" You rise from the chair, pushing the stranger in a backward motion until he falls back upon the beach, while simultaneously pushing your own onto him, not quite penetrating yet. You direct Silver Spoon's eyes with your hoof, not wanting her to be left out of the fun. \"Why don't you try sitting on his face, sweetie and we can get started?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou sink down onto him after all this time finally uniting penis and pussy. Your eyes roll back in their skull as he fills up your unused canal. Silver Spoon initially opts to just sit by his head, staring at your union intently. You, however, were having none of it. There was no point in warming her up if we're to stop now. You have a hoof impatiently. \"Don't be shy, now. I promise this will make you feel really good.\" With some reluctance, she complies, resting her rump on his closed mouth. You lightly bat him on the stomach, and gently command \"Start licking.\" With that, the muscular organ begins worming its way out of his mouth and into the snatch of the grey filly. You feel oddly proud in this moment, working together with your daughter as a team to achieve as many orgasms as possible. You reach down and kiss her on the head, then ruffle her mane as she squirms under the assault of his wriggling tongue.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSpoony now actively grinds into his face, trying to reach a higher state of pleasure. Likewise, you pick up the pace, pumping your self faster and deeper up and down his shaft. You are already well on your way to your goal, and she looks like she won't last much longer. \"A-ah, mom I think I'm going to--\" \"Just hold on sweetie. If you hold on we can finish together.\" Her cheeks blow out as she concentrates, trying to hold back the oncoming tide of pleasure. In response you go faster, milking the cock with vaginal muscles to quickly reach the edge of the precipice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYour breaths sync in tandem as you both approach your climax. Holding her hoof you throw your head back and mildly screech as you orgasm. \"I love you honeeeeeey!\" Her voice hitches up an octave as Silver shouts, \"I love you too mom!\" You plunge deep as the cock spasms, filling you up with hot liquid. You rest there, panting, not moving to keep the cum inside. Silver is slumped forward, heavily breathing but otherwise fine. Her eyes are glazed over with lust, looking straight up at you. You pick her up and hold her like a baby, tears streaming from your eyes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll just leave this up and let you make the choice, and whatever happens, happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou not only got to not only witness your filly's first orgasm but experience it with her. You are overcome with emotion. Sniffing, you pat her back and say, \"That was pretty great, right?\" Her head nuzzles into your neck, she replies, \"Yeah, mom that was amazing. I'm glad I got to experience it with you. Maybe we could it again sometime.\" You sniff again and nod. \"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\nA white mist gathers in your eyes and the last thing you see is your daughter's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken to a smiling Silver Spoon, now closely hugging your body. Your nethers tingle and you realize that the comforter was absolutely covered in femcum, and that her little flower was still glistening. You slowly sit up, pondering what this could mean. Did you have some kind of shared dream with your daughter? A violent mix of emotions swirls through you. You consider waking her up to question exactly what it is she saw but decide against it. She just looks too cute sleeping, even on the cum covered bedspread. Speaking of which... You roll Silver to one side, then pull the comforter out from under her. Not like you wanted to hide the evidence, but a good mother cleans up after her children's unintentional messes. While walking out of the room you step over Diamond Tiara, who had at some point rolled off the bed at some point during the night. Well, that explains a couple of things. Instead of going to the laundry like you should you instead store the covered comforter neatly folded in your closet. You've found that you really like the combined smell of you and Spoony.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGroggily walking out of your room you decide that you're hungry, so you swing by the pantry to get a little snack to eat to eat before you start cooking breakfast, maybe some grapes. You always liked those. You briskly walk past the kitchen only to park it and put it in reverse, walking backward. You stand in the doorway, openly gawking. Spoiled Rich was sitting in your kitchen, drinking your coffee and reading a newspaper.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou walk further into the room, mouth stuff open. It takes Spoiled a moment to notice you, when she does she drops her newspaper, saying \"Hey\" before taking a gulp of coffee. Words somehow find the way to your mouth. \"Spoiled?! What are you-- How did you-- Why?\" Spoiled puts the mug down and looks you straight in the eye. \"I found the key in the usual spot you hide it. Don't know why you never change it, by the way. And to answer your last question, I came to pick up my daughter, who decided to have an impromptu sleepover without telling me.\"<br>\r\nYou facehoof. \"You could've at least knocked.\" She looks at you critically. \"I DID knock. Twice, I don't know what it is but I swear you ponies sleep like the dead around here.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, Diamond is upstairs with Silver. They were both sleeping last I checked. Did you want me to go wake her up? Spoiled seems to consider this for a moment, then finally replies,\"Hmmm, nah. Let her sleep. I really only wanted to know where she is. If she's here with you, that's ok.\" Wow Spoiled, that's unusually... kind... of you. She pulls out a chair and nods at you, \"Pop a squat, and we'll have some girl talk and some coffee.\" You grab a mug and fill it with coffee, sitting in the chair she pulled for you. It's Mustangian Dark Roast, a rather expensive blend that you love and really don't want Spoiled drinking all your supply of. When you are seated Spoiled sighs. \"Let me get right into it. Llly, you and I have been friends for years, and you know that even though I put up a hard exterior that I care about you. I know you've turned down many of my party invitations and blind dates in the past, but please, just hear me out. You cannot go on living like this. You NEED somepony in your life, it doesn't even have to be a stallion. I've heard of plenty of mares who stay together to beat the heat, no marriage or commitment, just sex for a few weeks and then life goes back to normal.\" You raise your eyebrows Was Spoiled expecting you to dyke it out with other mares because you have no one to quell your estrus?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I've been fine, I can deal with my heat by myself. who would you even expect me to do something like that with?\" Out of nowhere, she draws out a business card. \"I've recently joined an organization dedicated to helping single lonely mares struggling through their heat find partners from all over Equestria. We offer matching services, and also host \"heat parties\" where you get to mix with a wide variety of mares.\" You look closely at the card. It looks very fancy and very official.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"...When did you join in on this? As a matter of fact, when did this even get started?\"<br>\r\nShe smiles .\"It's rather... new. it's also very discreet. The mares are kept anonymous except for a short description and their tribe. You won't know exactly what you're going to get until you meet them. As for how I joined them, through my connections I managed to meet the founder personally, who gave me a role in the organization.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So, what are you some kind of recruiter or something?\"<br>\r\n\"You could say that. So, are you interested?\"<br>\r\nYou tuck a foreleg under your chin, carefully considering. \"I.. uh. I'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"...If I do decide to join, how would I go about doing so?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll have a brochure and a fill-out form sent to you by mail. If you're accepted they'll send you a few cards with descriptions on them. All you have to do is mark the one you're most interested, send it back, and we'll arrange a date. Easy Peasy Do you have any other questions?.\"<br>\r\n\"Just one, all of these candidates are mares, right? I wouldn't get paired up with a sexually frustrated dragon, would I?<br>\r\n\"Dohoho, are you making a special request?\" She waggles her eyebrows at you, \"Because I can pull a few strings to make that happen for you.\" You blanche, not being able to tell if she was joking or not. \"I... um, never mind. Forget I said anything.\"<br>\r\nShe gets up to leave.<br>\r\n \"Well alright then, if you change your mind you know where to find me. I'll just go up and take DT with me and then I'll be out of your mane.\"<br>\r\n    \"All right, see you around.\" You turn and take a long swig of coffee. It's going to be one of THOSE days, isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No movement gently shook your comfy little water bed, no ambient noises reached your ears, except for the beat of the mare's heart and faint gurgling noises coming from somewhere in her body. You lie awake, having awoken sometime in the night, or what you guess is night, given the inactivity of your host. You contemplate how you got here, and what fate might have in store for you next. You found two eggs yesterday planted into the uterus, small, almost imperceptible, but there nonetheless. It had once again filled you with emotion, seeing the very start of your progeny at their conception. You had dared not touch them, for fear you would disturb their development. So you left them alone, instead napping towards the entrance, occasionally fondling yourself. You idly wonder if the gateway out of here is even open. There was nothing more you could do here, leaving would probably be the best option, but if the the door remained shut, there was no chance of escape. You unsteadily get up yo your feet, and wander up the slope to the cervix. You give it a cursory poke, then a soft rub, to determine if the hole was soft enough to crawl through. Apparently, the period of tightness had ceased, permitting you to make an uneasy, and cramped exit.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    It's a close fit, but you manage to squeeze your way through. It's moist inside the vagina, but nowhere near as it was. You slowly crawl through the tight corridor, treading lightly to avoid triggering arousal.<br>\r\nOn the way you feel around for your lost pants, but do not find them. They must've slid out when you made her orgasm earlier. Looks like you're going to have to go au natural for a while. Midway through your crawl you feel the tunnel sway a bit. Look's like the sleepy head finally awoke from her slumber. You're going to have to be even more cautious now that she's fully conscious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCrouching low you hold perfectly still, holding your breath counting to ten. A small glimmer lies at the end of the path. too small to illuminate but bright enough you can still see it. That little glimmer is your goal, and your way out of.here. Starting from your crouched position you proceed even slower than before, stopping at every major sign of movement. You laugh at the irony that in order to get in here you had to make her cum, and to get out you have to avoid sexual arousal altogether. Tamping down your giggling you press onward. Eventually the glimmer grows much larger, until it's a full blown circular hole of light. Finally, you reach the entrance to the vagina, pushing aside the gigantic flaps and peering outside.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrom your limited point of view you see a familiar braided tail wag in the distance, shaking to and fro while the mare walks. The ground far below is covered in flagstones, and you can hear faint voices drifting in, letting you know that you're outside back in that town again, and that the mare must be out running errands.<br>\r\nFalling onto the hard stones while climbing seems... less than ideal. You bide your time until the mare moves onto softer terrain.<br>\r\nIt's going to difficult to reach back up to the dock with the sparsely furred backside providing few hand holds. The tail is also out of reach save for a mighty jump. You could attempt to make your way into the flank, climbing up onto the back, navigate down and try to cross her underbelly fur, or wait until she sits down to make the journey safer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou didn't get where you are now by being scared. By being a crazy thrill-seeker, yes, but not scared. You decide to ascend by climbing the flank, grasping one of the labia and hauling yourself up onto it. Grunting, you swing your body, hurling yourself into a thick patch of fur. Grinning, you begin climbing at an angle to save energy and shave off a bit of time. The way things are going, you're probably going to need it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nContinuing to climb, taking small breaks to conserve energy. you come across several patches of off-color fur, not really close close in hue to the area surrounding it/ Curious, you reach out and touch it. A sudden torrent of images and vague feelings flood your mind, leaving you unprepared and temporarily making your vision go blank. When next your eyes open shadowy shapes dance in your vision, along with dozens of faint whispery voices that all seem to say the same thing: \"My name is Gilded Lily. and painting is the core of who I am.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou hastily release your hold and grasp a normal patch of fur. The voices cease. What the fuck was that? Did you achieve some kind of telepathic link with the mare? Shaking your head you press on. There would be time to worry about this when you were in a safer position. Things just keep getting weirder and weirder.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter that short trip you are finally on the rump. The route to the head is a long one, all the way across the back and up the neck, and the back might as well be a desert, providing little shelter, and being buffeted by winds that, to her, probably feel like a gentle breeze, but to you, feel like 15-20 MPH winds. If you're going to do this, you're going to have to mentally prepare for the journey ahead.<br>\r\nYou elect to backtrack to the tail, to hide in the long hairs and bide your time until she either goes indoors or stops.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours resting in the tail, you notice a subtle change in the air. It's not quite as bright as it was, and it's somewhat cooler. You pop your head up out of the bunched hair, and swig your gaze in a wide arc. You are definitely indoors, the light of the sun has been replaced by soft, artificial light, and you can see a ceiling high above. Groaning, you extricate yourself and crawl partway up the tail to get a better look. Ponies of all colors are wandering around, lying on tables while another pony beats on them with their hooves, or lounging in pools of water with steam rising from them, chatting with each other. If you had to guess, you're in some kind of massage parlor or spa. If the mare came here to get a back massage, that might spell trouble for you if you get caught in the middle of it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou rush up the curve of the back in to reach the neck as soon as possible, before anything unfortunate befalls your tiny body. You make it to the very edge of her mane and frantically climb before she steps into one of the scalding pools, submerging her body all the way up to the withers.<br>\r\nIf you had stayed put, you would've been swept away and boiled in your skin by the steaming water.<br>\r\nYou're not home free yet, you can still feel the hot moisture rising and coating your body. You cling desperately to the increasingly slick mane, climbing like your life depended on it, which in all honesty, it probably does. Pushing into the deep interior of her hair, you finally reach a point you can rest, unceremoniously flopping down on the ground and gasping for air. You fervently hope she doesn't decide to dunk her head or you're done for.<br>\r\nAfter resting a moment and catching your breath, you get up, and continue navigating the dense jungle of hair. It;s unpleasantly hot and humid, and you occasionally slip on the wet underfur. After a short perilous journey you, walk out into the open air. standing at the peak where the hair parts the middle of her mane.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUp and over the forehead you walk, trying to keep your footing. You can see the snout below jutting out like a furry cliff. The mare's eyes are closed, she must be totally relaxed. That's good, maybe she won't freak out thinking she has a bug on her nose and send you flying. The slope leading down to the nose is far more gentle than the climb up the back of her head. You tumble down,coming to a rest right on the nose bridge between her eyes.Peering over the edge you can see that you're a bit too far to reach the edge of the pool. The mare floats in the middle of the jacuzzi like an island in a lake of boiling lava. Your best bet would be to get her attention somehow, but how to do it? You doubt you could disturb her much at your current size.</span></div></div>",

A gentle gust of warm air brushes your body as you look inside. A deep yawning cavern stands in front of you.

You aren't sure what will happen if you walk completely inside.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStepping into the nose, you get an immediate reaction to your intrusion. The rhythm of air flow changes and you feel the floor getting more slippery as her body produces more mucus to repel the foreign debris. This was a bad idea, you think. If she sneezes, you're going to either get sucked into her lungs when she inhales or blown out by hurricane force winds when she exhales.

You know what's coming though, you get up and scramble like mad towards the entrance, where you barely make it out before she--<br>\r\nCHOO!<br>\r\nYou narrowly avoid a powerful blast of air, which would've sent you rocketing away. Edging your way out and back up the snout, you can see that the mare is now awake, eyes unfocused and bleary, but awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to wait until she's fully conscious before you fully begin engaging with her.<br>\r\nThe ground rolls a bit as she gives a cute little yawn, and smacks her lips. She blinks, trying to clear the mistiness out of her eyes. She doesn't initially see you, looking out into the room at distant ponies. You pull yourself to your feet, walk forward a few steps and shout \"HELLO\" while giving a big wave. This seems to get the mare's attention, her eyes slide down to your body and linger there. She stares at you, trying to process exactly what she's seeing. Her expression slowly shifts from calm, to curious, to unbelieving. Her pupils shrink and her eyes widen. She isn't panicking, yet, but is clearly freaked out by what she's seeing.<br>\r\nNot making any sudden moves to avoid spooking her, you kneel down and pet her snout, crooning soft word and softly caressing her. Amazingly, this seems to work. Her breath slows considerably, and her pupils steadily widen while she keeps her gaze on you. You guess some things are a universal constant.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStanding once again, you become acutely aware of her focusing on a certain hardening appendage sticking out like a sore thumb. You shamefully hide your boner, face flushing in embarrassment. Noticing this, she gives her head a little shake, causing you to fall flat on your back. The ground rumbles as a short, nervous giggle escapes her throat. Getting back up and standing fully erect (in more than one sense.) You point over to a point by the edge of the jacuzzi, she seems to understand, and begins walking to the position you pointed,<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTo tame your boner, you try to think of literally anything else but the gigantic, all-encompassing mare that can do anything she wants to you, but you fail miserably. Climbing up out of the tub, she picks up a towel to dry off, only lightly dabbing her face to make sure you don't get caught in the fabric. She's approached by a blue and pink pony, who starts speaking to her. You can't understand what's being said, but when the blue mare starts moving towards a private room, Orange starts following her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    Not wanting to be caught in whatever is going on, you scurry along the side of the head and jump back into the mane, peering out cautiously. Once inside the room the blue mare directs Orange to climb onto a table, one that just like those you might see on tv, with the circular padded hole to rest your head. She must be here to get a deep tissue massage. The world tilts and rights itself as Orange mounts the table and lies down.<br>\r\nYou get the sudden idea to help massage her somehow but aren't sure how to do it. You settle for giving long soft loving pets, moving to several spots on her scalp and even on one of her ears. Meanwhile, the blue one had finished delivering a pummeling to the orange mare's back, and was now on top, firmly kneading at the withers with her hooves.<br>\r\nYou watch the blue mare masterfully work buffing out the kinks in the orange mare's muscles. At times she would get almost close enough to smell her perfume, a light scent jasmine. You, of course, weren't letting up either. You tackle the tall task of pleasing your host with gusto, kissing and rubbing everywhere you can, to achieve the singular goal of making her feel loved and pampered.<br>\r\nTo make sure she can really feel your efforts, you double down and head behind one her ears. You scratch and rub at the ligament connecting the ear to the body, and are rewarded by a pleased moan by your host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue hoof edges ever closer to your current position. If she gets close enough you can jump on...</span></div></div>",

She obviously can't understand you, but you hope that scratching her ear and hearing your voice would give her a favorable view of you. You want to be around when your children are born, after all. After a short while the blue mare returns, bringing with her a glass bottle filled with a wonderfully sweet smelling fragrant oil. She puts a few drops in Orange's mane and tail and gently massages her scalp to work it in. After that, she says something, and it seems like the session has concluded, as your host gets up off the table and back onto her hooves. She is led back out by the masseuse, who gives a friendly smile and continues on her way up to the front desk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe stops for a minute to chat with a pink pony with blue hair manning (Mareing, Ponying?) the front desk. The similar colors to the blue pony make you think this might be her twin. After a bit of chatter, Orange bids the pink pony farewell and briskly walks out the door. The mare picks up the pace as she walks, possibly in a hurry to get somewhere. You emerge from your hiding spot and sit close to her forehead, taking in the view. It really was a nice town, like something you'd see on a trip to Europe. The mare had the presence of mind not to shake too much as she walks, making your ride smooth and pleasant. After a while she comes upon a large ornate house, which she pushes inside. You instantly recognize this as the house you were in earlier, making this large manor her home. Making her way to the kitchen (you're a tad disappointed it wasn't the bedroom.) she moves into a chair and puts a hoof up to her forehead, expecting you to climb onto it. You do so, and she sets you down on the table, free to roam around.<br>\r\nYou stay back a bit from the mare, in case she wanted to trap you in a glass or something, although... if she wanted to hurt you, she could've easily done so already. The table is bare except for the cloth anyhow, offering you no tools to hide or fight back. She sits with her head in her head in her hooves resting on the table, eyes following your every move, possibly contemplating what to do with you next.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou sit down and mirror her pose, bringing your knees up to your chin and resting your head in your hands, looking up at her. You do this for a while before she sits up, a sudden thought coming to her mind. She leaves the room, apparently trusting you enough to not simply leave while she's gone. It's not like you could get down anyway. She soon returns, carrying a notepad on her back and a writing utensil. With the pencil, she begins drawing a detailed sketch with her mouth. You marvel at her fine control and attention to detail. She must be some kind artist or engineer. When she finishes you can see it's a sketch of you, maybe a little too muscular for your liking but you, nonetheless. She lays the pencil down near you and looks at you expectantly. What does she expect you to with this?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou again break off a small piece of graphite and write your name, connecting it to the sketch of you via a curved arrow. You try your best to emulate her fine detail work by drawing her in return, but sadly your artistry is lacking. You stop and look at your finished work. That... doesn't look too bad. Even Orange is impressed. She picks up the pencil and writes a series of symbols underneath her portrait that you assume is her own name. They look like stickers a 2nd-grade teacher would give you for doing well in a phonics test: sunshine and rainbows and daisies, and at the very end, a simple drawing of a brush, artist's pallet, and a lily.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWait... those items look pretty familiar. Feeling cheeky, you doodle a rough approximation of a pony butt and draw a line to the paintbrush and pallet, drawing a circle around it. You can't see it underneath her furred cheek but she might be blushing. She gets up from the chair spinning around until her flank is visible. A paintbrush dipped in gold paint and a pallet is indeed tattooed on her flank. Now that you think about it, you've seen symbols on other ponies as well, no two being the same. Did marking their flanks with symbols serve as some kind of unique identifier of status, like personal heraldry? Being this small and not able to understand is frustrating! She takes a seat again and begins drawing more symbols: a stylized sun, a black cloud with a crescent moon inside it, and underneath, a heart and a six-pointed star. None of these hold any meaning for you, so you draw a circle and cross a line through it. Her mouth drops open as she looks at you, shocked. Did you mess up? Were those supposed to be important? You have no idea.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAttempting to convey that you are not from around here, with your fantastic artistic skills you render several members of your species and some damn fine examples of human architecture, and draw a giant equine dwarfing them to show the comparison. To get your point across you draw a circle looping several times around the humans but leave the pony out Orange looks perplexed by this. She tries to draw a pony inside your circle but you immediately cross it out. You point back at the giant pony, trying to teach her that humanity is an exclusive club of sapient and that there are no ponies where you come from.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou draw a second circle around the big pony, then mimic falling forwards into the other circle. You roll into a crouch, then walk around the perimeter of the circle, pantomiming being trapped, being careful not to step out of bounds so as to not confuse the message. A look of slow realization dawns on her face. You were from a world of tiny creatures like yourself, which built cities like ponies do, and are now trapped far from your home in an unfamiliar land. A single tear drops from her eye, and she sniffs and nods. She got it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou realize that all this shattering of worldviews and answering the alien question has made you quite hungry. In fact, you haven't eaten anything solid since you arrived here, and are ravenous. Using your broken off graphite you doodle a few select fruits and vegetables, and some bread. You doubt that the giant equines would have any meat to eat so you don't bother drawing it. She instantly understands what you mean and quickly gets up and leaves the room. When she returns she has a small brown bag with her and sets it on the table. Opening it reveals that a few fruits and berries in it along with cubes of cheese. She pulls out a strawberry and sets it down if front of you, while she pops a grape into her mouth. The smell of the berry makes your mouth water, so you eager dig into the sweet succulent flesh, taking breaks to actually stop and breath every once in a while. You hear the tinkle of a laugh come from the orange mare, a mirthful look on her face. You give her a look of mock indignation, and kick the strawberry to make your point. Unfortunately, in the soft flesh your foot gets stuck, and attempting to pull it out with force causes you to fall on your butt. This prompts a round of uproarious laughter from the mare, and after a moment, you join in too.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou and Orange were still sitting at the table, a notebook filled with all sorts of sketches, drawings, and doodles filling every page. You learned a great deal from each other, despite the language barrier. You learned that there are actually three separate races of pony: Unicorns, pegasi, and just your regular ol' garden variety pony. The pony princesses she drew earlier are their rulers, who are a hybrid of the three types of pony. The pegasi can apparently walk on clouds and control the weather, and the unicorns are magical and can use spells to achieve various effects. That took you while for you to understand until she began drawing literal magic circles with mystical runes and pentagrams and stuff. So, not only have you dropped into an alien world but you've fallen down the drain of the fantasy kitchen sink. Magic probably brought you here, though for what purpose you can't say. Magic can probably send you home, but that would require an intensive study on your part to learn the language and convince the locals that you weren't some kind of weird looking bug. Then there was the little, insignificant fact that you were going to be the father of this mare's children, a fact that you aren't quite sure how to relay without incurring her wrath; It'll have to come up eventually, in a few months time the evidence would be impossible to hide. Orange also gave you some important insights into her life. She's a painter, and a pretty great one in fact. She works from home, painting pastoral scenes of the countryside and portraits of other ponies. She was apparently hired to do some work on the princesses' new throne room, a fact that makes her puff out her chest in pride.<br>\r\nShe has one daughter, the grey filly who had you trapped earlier, which you had already guessed to be true, given their similar appearances. What you didn't know is that she has some skill in cooking, having won several awards.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe hour grows late, and you begin to feel tired from your constant running across the page. You sit down a moment to rest your weary body. Orange notices this, and picks up the notebook and gently brushes you off into the safety of her mane. It isn't long until your eyes grow heavy, and Orange's underfur a loving rub, and drift off to sleep, smiling happily.</span></div></div>",

You draw large jagged rocks lining the surface of a rocky beach, the remains of lava that met the ocean and cooled after magma spewed from the earth in an ancient eruption.

Occasionally you would meet a simple slope you would have to crest and slide down the other side. Crickets added their music to the night air, breaking the otherwise still atmosphere. The trees created a beautiful and surreal backdrop, like you were walking in an enchanted forest populated by fairy creatures, or man eating wolves... Okay, why did your mind immediately go there? You were having such a good time and now you made yourself on edge. You tried to calm yourself while remaining vigilant but the thought managed to stick in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered as a gust of wind blew over your tiny from.

You breathed a bug sigh of relief when you spotted the tree house perched on a lone tree sitting out in the clearing. Just as you were about to begin the final steps toward your destination, a loud *crunch* alerted you to a presence behind you. Instead of doing the smart thing by hauling ass towards the structure without looking back you instead whirled on the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour black pillars rose from the darkness, extending upwards like an elongated shadow to to meet a greater mass. Attached to mass was the most terrifying thing you had ever seen, a horrifying visage made up of razor sharp teeth and bio-luminescent green eyes emerged from the darkness, and it was looking right at you!<br>\r\nYour legs refused to work, so enthralled were you by the black horror that you were paralyzed with fear.<br>\r\nThe fanged mouth slowly cracked open, a droplet of thick spittle drooping out as she licked her lips in anticipation, a predatory look in her eyes. Just as you were about ready to be devoured however, the creature closed it's mouth and turned away.<br>\r\n&lt;Too small&gt; it muttered, and then began walking off in a different direction. You released the breath you'd been holding. What was that all about? Was it not hungry? You'd like to think of yourself as someone pretty tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at the treehouse. You have a strong feeling that you should follow the creature, but that may have just been a fluke and you won't be so lucky next time.</span></div></div>",

The two were avoiding large crowds of ponies, probably in an attempt to avoid spooking you again. The path they took takes them out of town. You can see the buildings begin to thin out considerably. Soon the cobblestone road merges into a dirt path that leads out into the wilderness. A lone cottage sits out near the edge of a forest, next to a chicken coop and several small cages.

A strange mirror contraption sits on a low coffee table in front of the couch, of which purpose you can only guess.

Twilight didn't feel like a cage would appropriate for a creature so small, and she was fresh out of pickle jars to put him in, unfortunately.<br>\r\nTwilight was beginning to second guess if this was a good idea.<br>\r\nHer mother has a strong and aggressive but kind and good-natured personality, and is a bold risk-taker and while her father is a lot more levelheaded and gentle, he had an uncontrollable tendency to dote on and flat out baby any small creature or foal within close range.

You know how they are.\"  Twilight admitted.<br>\r\nSpike laid a reassuring claw on her wing. \"Don't be. You worry way too much, Twilight. Everything will be just fine. Our parents are more than capable of handling one little tiny fragile living creature. I mean, how hard could it be?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right, maybe I need to stop stressing over this one little thing.\"<br>\r\nSpike patted her on the shoulder and gave her a wide grin.<br>\r\n\"I AM right. Seriously, I've been your guiding voice for a good few years now. You could try giving me a little more credit, Twi.<br>\r\nAbsolutely everything is going to be fine.\"<br>\r\nTwilight grabbed the young drake and ruffled his dorsal spines.<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad to have a little brother like you, Spike. You're always there when I need you most.\"<br>\r\nSpike pushed her away with a bashful smile. \"Aw, stop it, you're going to make me blush? So are we going to send this letter or what?\"<br>\r\nTwilight nodded in the affirmative and took the still frozen tiny creature and dropped it into the envelope along with the letter, then sealed it with a lick.<br>\r\nShe held it aloft in her magic, Spike breathed a puff of green fire, and the letter disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting over Canterlot, and things at the Sparkle residence were beginning to wind down.<br>\r\nNight Light had just come in tired from a full day of work running the shop and stocking shelves and was looking forward to a relaxing evening with his wife.<br>\r\nSaid wife was lying down in her comfy chair, reading the lastest installment of her favorite book series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking up from her book she said, \"Busy day today, honey?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep, I'm wiped out. We just got a fresh shipment of books today and I had to organize and shelve every one of them my horn's feeling a bit sore.\"<br>\r\nThis broke Velvet gaze away from her book and she tsked at him. \"You know you could've asked me for help at any time, dear, in fact I think you should've. I know how you like to do things yourself, but I don't want you to strain yourself.\"<br>\r\nNight Light shrugged, then gave Velvet a tired grin. \"Yeah, you got me there. You just looked so focused on your writing that I didn't want to bother you. I know how you don't like to be disturbed when you're in your creative zone.\"<br>\r\nVelvet huffed in displeasure, got up from the couch and planted a kiss right in the center of her husbamd's snout.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't bother me one bit honey. I'm always happy to lend a hoof. Besides...\"<br>\r\nShe kissed him a bit higher this time.<br>\r\n\"I almost never a chance to show off how. much. I. really. love. you.\"<br>\r\nEach word was emphasized by a kiss leading further up the forehead until she was right on the horn.<br>\r\n\"Does my poor hubby wubby have a boo boo on his hown? Why don't you let Mama kiss it all better, hmm?\"<br>\r\nNight Light shuddered as Twilight Velvet took the very tip inside her lips and loudly sucked at it, the lewd sensation bringing him to full hardness within seconds.<br>\r\nVelvet could smell the musk he was putting off and felt herself getting excited too, and it wouldn't be long until she would lead her handsome stud into another full night of passionate lovemaking.<br>\r\nVelvet released the appendage from her grasp, then kissed Night Light full on the lips, slipping her tongue inside without any resistance.<br>\r\nNight closed his eyes and and placed his hooves on her shoulders to steady himself, letting her explore in his mouth wherever she pleased.<br>\r\nJust when Velevet was about ready to pick him up in her magic and physically drag him to the bedroom they were interrupted by a bright green flash of light and a solitary letter fluttering to the floor.<br>\r\n\"Hmph, hmmm?\" Velvet tried to say something, then realized that her tongue was too entangled with Night's to speak and so had to withdraw it.<br>\r\nNight Light coughed and panted, trying to catch his breath as his wife unlatched herself from him with a wet smack and a long line of sticky drool.<br>\r\n\"A letter? Did Twily send us a letter?\"<br>\r\nShe walked over to where the envelope fell, picked it up and eagerly tore it open.<br>\r\nHere eyes moved rapidly from side to side as she read what Twilight had wrote.<br>\r\n\"It says here that she found a small creature of unknown species and origin and that she wants us to look after it for her.\"<br>\r\nMight Light had finally caught his breath as he heard the news and was now busily wiping her spittle from his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Well, she sure picked a good time to do it,\" he snarked with a wry grin.<br>\r\nVelvet dismissively waved a hoof. \"Oh, there's now ay she could've known what we were doing, dear. I just wonder where the little dear has gone to. She didn't send any kind of cage with the letter.\"<br>\r\nShe examined the envelope more closely and tipped it over, and with a soft scraping something indeed fell out into her hoof.<br>\r\nTwilight Velvet and Night Light stared curiously at the little creature, which seemed to just now be coming awake.<br>\r\nIt uncurled itself, stood up and stretched. It curiously turned to look around at the surrounding area, then up at the astonished speechless ponies.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess I'll just go...\" Just as Sunset turned to leave, Twilight cried 'Wait, I've got an idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset looked back at her confused while Twilight took the jar. \"Let me just do this and....\" A violet purple flash illuminated the container before fading. \"Perfect, now he'll be sure to keep his shape upon stepping through the portal. Wouldn't want to risk him turning into a tiny pony while he's over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I didn't know you could do that,\" Sunset murmured before resuming her walk towards the swirling gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be sure to write me if anything comes up,\" Twilight called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset smiled at her before stepping through the portal and into a new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least he wouldn't be wandering the street, exposed to the elements and at risk of predation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a[[roach to the music room door she heard animated conversation coming from inside, which was probably being led by Pinkie Pie.

You guys are no fun.\" she said before peeling away to go play on her drums, revealing their other friends,<br>\r\nRainbow Dash, Rarity, Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy sitting at a table, resting after a long play session. Applejack was absent due to unavoidable prior engagement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity waved a hand.<br>\r\n \"Oh, Sunset, you've returned. How was your trip to Equestria?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Short. She only asked me to hold on to something for her and then I left. No stories of high adventure from the magical land of ponies today, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've not been too serious if the other me didn't want to keep you for longer.\" Twilight commented. \"It's not another magical artifact, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly... In fact you might call it something that doesn't really belong.\" Sunset replied sheepishly, scratching the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that it's good you don't go back very often. I would miss you too much if you decided you want to move back to Equestria.\" Fluttershy quietly chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset felt her heart warm upon hearing that, She had really come a long way from being a social pariah to everyone practically begging her to stay.<br>\r\n\"Aw, Fluttershy that's sweet, but you don't have to worry. I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. My home is here with you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset reached into her jacket pocket and closed her had around the passenger inside. pulling him out and balling ingot a fist. \"Anyway, as for what it is she gave me, I'd like to show you this,\" she said, the opened her fist.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the ponies and even the queen eat, as she swallows her food you could have sworn that you heard the gurgling sound from within her neck and chest... and perhaps your own stomach too, you just remembered that you didn't eat anything when you appeared in ponyland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you saw something floating to you, it was a piece of the scrambled egg of the Queen! You looked up to see her give you a small smile before going quickly and continue eating her food. It was small, but given your size, it was the perfect size for your consumption, you began to eat the first food you had since your arrival.</span></div></div>",

She had a bed and new clothes commissioned for him under the guise of an official alias she would use if she wanted to buy things without drawing attention.<br>\r\nCelestia even gave the human a name: \"Anon\", named after an old Ponish word meaning mysterious, or unknown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would tuck him into her peytral and go about her day, doing paperwork, holding court and listening to ponies grievances, making public appearances as required, and at the end of the day lowering the sun so her sister can raise the moon. Likewise Anon fell into a routine of pleasing his new mistress every night before bed. She had to constantly remind herself that Anon was a thinking, breathing sapient being and not just an insect to be toyed with. He embraced his new role wholeheartedly, or so it seemed, but it didn't stop her from worrying about him just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe positive effects on her mood could not be denied, however. She felt a greater spring in her step than before now that she had something to look forward at the end of the day, a fact that didn't go unnoticed by ponies around her. Her cheery disposition offered a more relaxing air around the court and even some of the ruder nobles treated the others with greater respect and dignity than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to be going fine and nothing could go wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia rushed into the bathroom and craned her neck over the toilet, voiding the contents of her stomach into the porcelain bowl.<br>\r\n\"URK, GKKK.\"<br>\r\n She felt sick, sicker than she ever could've believed she could get sick. She shivered as a cold chill ran up her spine, counterbalanced by the feverish heat emanating from her forehead. Tears streamed from her eyes in a reaction to the putrid stench. She pulled the lever to flush the toilet and collapsed on the floor trying to think on what just happened.<br>\r\nShe had been fulfilling her duty as usual when she felt it, a sudden wave of nausea came over her like a black mist and bile forced its way up her throat.  She had to book it out of there else she accidentally vomit over the balcony and onto some poor pony's head.<br>\r\nShe didn't believe that she'd been poisoned, a quick magical self scan had revealed no foreign toxin in her body. Could she have come down with a common illness that only required bed rest?<br>\r\nNo... alicorns do not get sick like that. Their immune systems are simply too strong, unless something has weakened her without her knowing it.<br>\r\n...She might have to consult a doctor to run some tests. In the meantime she couldn't run the kingdom like this so she would hand the reigns over to Luna for a little while so she could figure this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia rose from the floor and staggered out the door and towards her bed. She smiled as she saw Anon sleeping in that little bed she ordered. Truthfully she needed his touch right now but didn't want anything to pass to him if she was sick, so she left him alone and instead made an exit.<br>\r\nLooks like she might have to consult a doctor after all...</span></div></div>",

Luna rolled her eyes and hissed, \"I'm going to let your mouth go, and you will speak no more of my true identity, understand?\" Pinkie fervently nodded, and Luna released her hold on her.  Luna nodded at the door she entered from and said \"We will speak outside in private,\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okie dokie lokie pony-I've-never-met-before, I'll just need to inform Mrs. Cake I'll be stepping out for a minute,\" turning to walk into a door in the rear wall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna smiled and nodded, gracious of Pinkie's respect and understanding. \"Take your time, my little pony.

She and Pinkie had shown up out of the blue and began hammering on her door, of course she would be more than a little displeased. Instead, she put on her most dazzling smile and spoke in a fake valley girl accent. \"Hi! My name is Azure Moonlight and I;m from the Circle of Earth Agricultural Society, based in Manehatten, Do you mind if I take up just a bit of your time? It's really important, I promise.\"<br>\r\nNot entirely a lie. The Circle of Earth is a real organization that seeks out the best and brightest potential candidates for their agricultural schools. Luna herself is on the governing board of directors and oversees the testing of student knowledge and abilities. There is, of course, no record of any \"Azure Moonlight\" on their books, a fact that Luna might have to use her royal powers to retroactively correct.<br>\r\nSpoiled's dour expression turned to one of puzzlement. \"I wasn't aware that an Earth pony organization would recruit a unicorn among their ranks.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm earth pony on my mother's side,\" Luna smoothly answered. Unicorn and Pegasus too, but she didn't need to know that.<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Spoiled drawled with a look of mild contempt, then pointed over to Pinkie, who was currently spekaing to (flirting with?) a lawn statue.. \"What's she doing here then? I already know who she is. She organized my daughter's cutece\u00f1eara, didn't she?\"<br>\r\n\"Miss Pie has been an invaluable resource in guiding me through the sprawling streets of Ponyville. Believe me when I say you aren't an easy mare to find.\" <br>\r\n\"Could've just looked for the biggest mansion in town and saved yourself a lot of trouble...\" Spoiled muttered, before she winced and folded a hoof over her chest for a moment.<br>\r\nLuna tried to surreptitiously do a scan on her body to locate the lost human but before she could, the mare came back to focus.<br>\r\n\"Are you quite alright?\" Luna asked with concern.<br>\r\n\"I'm *urp* fine.  So now that you're here, waddaya want? I'm a busy mare and I can't be seen prattling *urp* on with a couple of common townsfolk on my front doorstep.\"<br>\r\nLuna snorted.. She was anything but common, and this impudent mare would do well to remember that. Nevertheless, she kept her composure and her smile didn't waver. She got her curious at least, which was going to make this go so much smoother.<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, you see, it's actually about your daughter, Diamond Tiara.. The Circle of Earth Society has selected your daughter to be a possible candidate for their junior summer training program, in which she would receive an all expenses paid trip to\u2014\"<br>\r\n\"I'm NOT sending DT to school to be an Aggie, if that's what you're asking.\" Spoiled interrupted forcefully. \"She's going to stay here and learn the family business, and eventually, take over.\"<br>\r\n\"I still want to test her fertility magic, for the record so I don;t go back empty hooved...\"<br>\r\nIf nothing else this was something she could bring this information back with her and try again another time.<br>\r\nSpoiled slapped a hoof against her face, then surprisingly, acquiesced to Luna's request. . \"Ugh, FINE. Ok, you win. Just make this quick,\" <br>\r\nSpoiled turned and trotted into the house, yelling at her daughter to come down because she had visitor.<br>\r\nLuna grinned and turned to shout back at Pinkie. \"Pinkie, with me!\"<br>\r\nThe perky pink pony immediately bounced after Luna, entering into the fancy mansion house.</span></div></div>",

Aside from having multiple portraits of her or her family all around, the floor was totally covered with expensive red carpet there few small statues of ponies or just head of ponies more likely her family members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mansion looked even bigger on the inside, with large stairs that go to the second floor, there were portraits of her and her family as well ponies she hadn't seen before but looked old, both the pony in question and the quality of the portrait which confirm that her fortune might be inherited, this level of smugness and superiority come from a family that it old and powerful to hold a firm grasp of the town's economy and know how to exercise it and increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile no a noble this was really comparable to one in term of power and capital holding but Noble had a bit more due to their family and ancestry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch elitist ambient would make a pony see their fellow as a failure and low life, inferior in their eyes, flaunting their own successes and only seeing ponies similar to them as equal, it encourages any foal coming from similar family to follow this mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly that comes down the stairs was the heir of the fortune this mare would leave to her, Diamond Tiara, Luna knows her, couldn't help but smile since she seems to not share her mother's... elitist mentality, they frowned on looking each other but then beamed on seeing Pinkie Pie but confused to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever happened to break that mentality of her doesn't matter but she was glad for it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, little one.\" She says \"My name is Azure Moonlight and I come from-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on with it!\" Spoiled ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, We don't intend to stay here for long.\" Luna sighed and began to cast the fertility test; it was a simple spell that shows the strength of an Earth Pony's inner magic, An Earth Pony inner magic is shown in their ability to grow anything in the soil, this is the reason why poverty in Equestria is unheard of,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also plays a key role in their biology, Earth Ponies has higher fertility rates than any other tribe, a blessing from the stars above so they will never go extinct, Pegasus and Unicorns has increased their numbers by interbreeding with Earth Ponies for centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do miss?\" Diamond Tiara asked as Luna charged her spell, She also charged a scan and teleportation spell, mostly for the tiny. doing three spells is a bit tricky for an Alicorn like her, She wasn't masterful on magic like her Sister and Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething she sourly admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just something quick, It just a small scan spell. Tell me if you feel something wrong during the whole process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara nodded and remained still, Luna then quickly fired up the spell to scan her body all while scanning Spoiled Rich as well. The feedback coming from the spell coming to her mind, She found the tiny in her stomach as expected but also saw something else, her eyes widened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had a lot of magic in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong.\" Diamond Tiara asked \"I feel a bit funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is nothing young one, I need to make a deeper scan.\" Luna said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be a problem, She never expected them to have so much energy in their bodies, Teleporting the human out of Spoiled can prove to be a problem with so much magic interfering with the spell. In theory, it could teleport him into somepony else now that she has to divide her focus for three additional spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was an alicorn, This shouldn't be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight..?</span></div></div>",

This draws the attention of the larger mare, who speaks to her in a calm voice. You don't know what is said, but it seems to surprise the filly, making her eyes go wide. The mare pats a spot close to her on the bed, and the filly slowly and reluctantly joins her. The filly doesn't know what to think as what you assume must be her mother pats her on the head, and then offers her a sip of her wine. Possibly sensing a trick she initially doesn't want to comply, but finally relents after a look from her mother. Upon drinking it the filly makes a face and almost spits it out. She manages to swallow it down though, which satisfies the elder mare who doesn't press any further. A long time spent is just softly caressing the filly's mane before she tugs her close and begins nuzzling her.<br>\r\nYou <i>could</i> try to escape right now, but there's still the risk of being seen, and honestly you want to see where this goes.</span></div></div>",

The mother is now jack-hammering her daughter's cunt, possibly looking for a release of her own. She desperately shoves her tongue down the filly's throat in an attempt to connect to her more closely, which works as the daughter's eyes open in surmise. Fluids from both their pussies spray out and coat the bed in their combined love juices. The pair fall back onto the bed, completely exhausted but smiling nonetheless.

Out of the few occasions she wasn't feeling ravenously hungry she was about ready to puke her guts out. This had been going on for <i>weeks</i> and none of the doctors could adequately explain what was going on, nor could they offer any kind of meaningful remedy other than \"get lots of bed-rest and drink plenty of fluids.\" That last piece of advice felt fairly appropriate. She felt like she constantly losing water by virtue of needing to go, and was almost afraid that all the water was going to drain out of her body, leaving her a dry desiccated husk. At least she wasn't alone in her misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother had seemingly contracted the same illness, and her symptoms appeared to be far worse. Her appetite seemed endless, like she was trying to feed a hundred mares trapped inside her, and was prone to mood swings from being pleasant to downright nasty. Diamond tended to avoid her during these latter spells, or at least tied to. If she was in the house, more often than not her mother would find her, screaming and berating her and then breaking down into tears, apologizing for being a bad mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father couldn't even stay to allay all these problems, for he was in the griffon kingdom to negotiate for a chain of stores to be built there, and the griffons were awfully stingy negotiators  His sympathetic letters offered little comfort in these trying times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral months of this wore heavily on the filly's mind, which caused her to rejoice when they finally received a letter from the clinic explaining that the test results came in and that they should immediately come in and consult with their doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage bounced and rolled over the uneven cobblestone street, before slowing down and stopping in front of the Ponyville Hospital. An affluent mother and her young child stepped out of the carriage and approached the clinic, tossing a shiny bit to the driver as they went. The driver tipped his hat, and with a whinny sped away, leaving behind a cloud of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair stepped inside into the lobby and spoke to the receptionist, who informed them that the doctor was already waiting and pointed them to the room the doctor will be seeing them in, They thanked the nurse and went on their merry way, weaving through the maze of hallways to reach their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could not have possibly been prepared for the shocking news they would receive there.</span></div></div>",

Unlike your Daughter who appears to have one foal under way, yours is a bit more extreme..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\" Spoiled asks with concern creep in her voice. concerned about her health and, apparently, her new foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have an unspecified number of foals, far greater of what we had previously seen. We worryingly cannot pinpoint the exact numbers of foals you'll be having and that's why your symptoms were more severed than Diamond's.

Her mind tried to wrap around the fact that she now had a life growing inside her, and at such a young age. She was a smart filly, she knew what this meant. It meant that she would have to trade the simple pleasures of childhood for the responsibility of motherhood. She didn't exactly know how she felt about that. Scared? Angry? Confused? Maybe even a small sense of pride that she had managed to become pregnant before her peers or even before her teacher. Silver was going to be so jealous when she heard the news. The doctor said that her mother was pregnant at the same time, except that hers was far more severe.<br>\r\nDiamond peeked at her mother from the corner of her eye, who was sitting motionless with her eyes closed. She wondered what it is she could be thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiled Rich could scarcely comprehend what was happening to her. First she been feeling ill for the last few weeks and so had come to doctor's office for a checkup, only to learn that she was pregnant , and not only that, but with an unknown number of foals. She had thought she had her life all worked out. She thought that she would only have a single child who would be an heir to the business, but it seemed life wanted to give her a right hook into the jaw. The foals were almost certainly not Filthy's, which would make it a bit hard to explain whenever he returned home. Angry things would be said. He would probably file for a divorce, taking away Diamond Tiara and leaving her with the burden of motherhood. She had more than enough shares in the company to support herself, she was worth millions of bits in her own right so it's not like she would be reduced to living in a hovel. She just didn't want to lose her only daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiled almost didn't notice a small form leaning up against her for comfort, softly nuzzling her chest.

Spoiled had requested that Diamond move in and sleep in her room for the time being, a request which the filly happily complied. The pair went on spa dates, ate ice cream, played games and even went fishing, an activity Diamond had always wanted to try. Every night they would cuddle together for warmth, with Spoiled protectively surrounding the filly with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Spoiled did was go to the local seamstress and commission a pair of maternity, dresses, enchanted to increase to stretch to any size regardless of girth. Rarity's eyebrows slowly threatened to leave her face as Spoiled explained the situation but she took the order nonetheless. Spoiled felt like telling one of the biggest gossip mills in town her secret was probably a foolish mistake, but the truth was going to come out eventually and she was not one to run away from her problems but face them head on, for Diamond's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and daughter's began to noticeably fill out around the barrel as time went on, partially because of the amount of food they ate. Spoiled felt closer to her daughter than ever. Before, they were drifting apart because their drifting viewpoints, and ironically it took a bad situation to push them together and make them talk to each other. Spoiled felt almost grateful to the mysterious donor and wished that she could at least meet him once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMysteriously, the steady stream of letters sent from Filthy every week slowed down to a trickle, and then eventually stopped.

She let her friends and other fillies and colts to caress and feel the foal move in her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver Spoon was indeed jealous despite saying otherwise but so were fillies like the Cutie Marks Crusaders and even Dinky Hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiled Rich was completely different yet similar, unlike Diamond Tiara, her belly grew in more accelerated pace growing twice its size the next week, it was becoming difficult to walk, her squirming belly almost reaching the floor but yet, just like Diamond, her belly had begun to give her fame, she was the main topic now as the Mare with the most, if not the biggest amount of foals gestating within her womb, an icon of fertility through Ponyville, if not, all Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispers were that she was blessed by the stars or by the Princesses themselves, one that Twilight confirmed to be not true at all and the princesses have no involvement whatsoever but it was a topic that even reached the ears of Canterlot which only gave her more fame. She noticed an air of envy from some other mares in the town especially from the Baker Cup Cake from Sugarcube Corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teats had grown considerably, giving milk almost constantly that she needed help on milking her, that went on using a milking device borrowed from the Apple Family but most of the time, Diamond Tiara came and helped her by suckling on her teats, sometimes, accompanied with one or more of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flanks also grew, her hips and body preparing for the upcoming labor. but also was working as Stallion magnet that stopped by and checks her out, attention is good but none approached her and revealed to be the one that sired<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the scary part is that they still don't know the exact number of foals growing inside of her, thanks the heaven for the elasticity Ponykind had, otherwise, she would've been in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe.\" Diamond Tiara Giggled rubbing her belly \"He is happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He?\" Rich mused \"How do you know its a He?\" She asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't but I got the feeling that my foal is a lively colt.\" Diamond Tiara answered. \"The Doctor says that is going to be a unicorn\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Unicorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-hu!\" She said, \"Though they aren't sure as they saw wings forming instead previously.\" she says while making herself comfy on her mother's growing belly, loving the way her siblings were squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled \"Maybe its a little Alicorn.\" She says as a joke. the probability of that was completely null but it does paint a very amusing thought, her grandfoal being alicorn. Still, it doesn't say much on who could be the father, the doctors weren't pretty helpful at all on her end, they were still unable to identify the numbers of the babies she was having. Just when they thought they had the number, the next exam and scan shows completely different numbers and maybe the only way to know for certain it was the day of the labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Rich\" One the servants approached her a young pegasus mare \"You have a letter, its... from the Griffin Kingdom.\" She says in a very stiff tone. \"Its directly addressed to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetter from the Griffin Kingdom, its Filthy Rich after a month of silence. She thanked the maid as she moved away quickly as she could Allowing her to open the letter and read it on peace, a concept that was shattered upon reading its content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reread it again and again and she couldn't still believe what<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a letter from the Griffin Kingdom's Government informing her that her husband has been arrested after making illegal dealing to a criminal organization and corrupt elements within the kingdom and profiting from their unlawful operations using a false alias, bank account of ghost companies among many others things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen things seemed to sort itself up, once again, Life seems to punch her in the face, again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a second letter and it was from Filthy Rich, informing that he didn't know how shady were those investors and was caught up in a nasty confrontation that ended being unjustly arrested and correctly being deported to Equestria for pending trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to believe him, she really does, but when the last letter was several weeks old that said that he was dealing with possible corrupt investors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is from Dad?\" Diamond asked, snapping from her thoughts. This caused her an idea, divorce seems almost inevitable now but she could turn this on her side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and he is returning.\" She says, internally grinning as she forms a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Tiara asked surprised, almost eager but said emotions were squashed on what she told next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, Tiara, he has done very bad things that he is being put on trial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How bad?\" She say, her tone dropping. it almost broke her heart now on seeing her like that she pulled her into a hug, rubbing her mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very... but I'm sure we'll get through this..\"</span></div></div>",

On that you have nopony to blame but yourself. I you had only shown a little more prudence in your business dealings you wouldn't be in this mess. The safety of your daughter should also be taken into account as well. Do you really want our daughter to become the target of some thug with a grudge against you? You need to get your head on straight and really think about what's really important n life. That's why I regret to inform you that I'm officially cutting ties and filing for divorce. I'm having the papers drawn up as I'm writing this letter, and they will be delivered to you within a few days. I'm sorry I had to do this, but I assure you I have only our daughter's best interest in mind.

Her delivery was to be observed by none other than the Princess of Friendship herself, who would be taking notes and recording the phenomenon for future study. Diamond Tiara had her own place nearby her mother, and would serve as moral support and comfort Spoiled during the arduous labor. Diamond Tiara had her own doctor to look after her own needs and deliver her child when the time came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA team of massage therapists on loan from the Ponyville Spa made sure that the mother and child duo were comfortable in spite of their limited mobility and regularly massaged their aching backs and somachs, while also placing candles burning with essential oils to create a relaxing atmosphere. Spoiled and Diamond were pretty much the center of attention and gossip around the small town and everypony was waiting with bated breath for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surprisingly Diamond's water that broke first, necessitating a hasty call to the doctors to come into the room and check on her condition. Twilight Sparkle entered as well, holding a notebook and pen in her magic, ready to jot down any notes that she needed to. The contractions were coming on strong, making the young filly wince every time her cervix flexed. She hadn't expected the birth to proceed so quickly or that there would be this much <i>pain.</i> The doctor assured her that it was completely normal to feel discomfort during the delivery and that it would all be over soon as long as she pushed. Spoiled held the hoof of her daughter and spoke comforting words to her, softly tussling her ears After about 30 minutes of intense pushing the one of the attending nurses noted \"I can see the head. Looks like a unicorn.\" making the purple alicorn quickly lower her head and scribble like crazy on her little notepad. <br>\r\n\"Wait..\" Twilight paused her writing to listen to the nurse speak. \"Wait, that isn't... Holy Celestia, are those <i>wings</i>?!\"<br>\r\nEverypony was in shock at the nurse's words. Could it be true? Spoiled Rich's mouth dropped open. The only one who didn't react was Diamond Tiara herself, who was a little too out of it due to the pain.<br>\r\nTwilight dropped her notebook and teleported over near the filly's gaping flower \"What?! Where, where? Show me!\" she demanded.<br>\r\nThe nurse pointed her hoof at the half emerged colt, pointing at the still slimy wet matted fur near the back of the neck. The mass located there looked far too thick to be fur, meaning there would be two tiny appendages marking the wings of a pegasus. The wings of a pegasus on a unicorn coming from an earth pony could mean only one thing. \"It's an alicorn. A male alicorn. It's has to be.\" the princess quietly murmured.<br>\r\nMoving the doctors out of the way, she gripped the colt's body gently in her magic and tugged. His body moved a little bit, but not enough to free him from the filly's body. She tugged again, this time casting a numbing spell while tugging with ever greater strength. With a POP, the colt came free from the fleshy vice, trailing a little umbilical cord and part of the placenta behind him. The colt chose that moment to come alive and began screeching its lungs out, causing everypony to cover their ears, and the room began to visibly shake from the noise he was making. Twilight cut the cord with her magic and sheepishly handed him off to a nearby nurse, who looked traumitized from the whole affair. She took him into the next room to be cleaned up and weighed so the doctors can focus on the elder mare.</span></div></div>",

The process continues for next hours as more and more fillies and some occasional colts being born mostly Earth Ponies, some pegasis and unicorns while being a momentary nurse by cutting the cords and handle them to the real nurses to clean them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiled for her part got used to the pain but felt another thing she actually didn't it was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt pleasure as well pain when birthing her foals. She knew that the line between pain and pleasure was a blur one but this was simply a unique experience, it might have to do when birthing more than just one foal and the one that she was literally popping them out of constantly like a machine or foal factory may have to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she got used to it that the most she was doing now were panting and grunting while pushing her foals out of her womb after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe were the sedatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took almost 24 hours straight until there were only 3 more foals left in her womb. however they were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Celestia what is that?\" One of the Nurses says as the thing came out of Spoiled's Vulva, it was the first time they see something like it, but Twilight gasped upon noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a Human baby and its a girl!\" Now they look on it was a cute looking specimen. Just like before Twilight cut the cord while handling the baby to the nurse all while having a widening smile in her face \"I think we now know the species of the father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is not the only one..\" Coming out was another human baby, this time a boy. \"Twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you both shut up, this is the last one!\" Spoiled grunted feeling the last foal, her body largely returned back to its original size, well almost. She was tired, panting heavily and about to pass out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it, ma'am, just this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined, she took a deep breath and began to push, this last foal from her overworked womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see a horn, come on. Push!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it, mom!\" It was Diamond Tiara's turn to hold her mother's hooves. as she continues to push soon the head and then the body came out of her fleshy gateway, another gasp, another nurse muttered 'No way...' as finally Twilight herself looked on the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another... Alicorn..\" She breathes out softly. This time a little filly with a tiny horn and wings, unlike Tiara's, this was simply yawned. She repeated the process handle the foal to the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... how many foals were delivered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help with that, it was a total of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"428.\" Twilight said with a smile \"A Small Army of adorable little foals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's including the two monkey things-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans.\" She corrected<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.. and the Alicorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I think we this I have all the notes I need, I can't wait to tell the Princesses. We still have to find the father thought but this narrows things down considerably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the Doctor and Twilight talked, Spoiled looked on her Daughter and she looked back they smiled each other as now that the worse was over but the Elder mare felt a small pit forming in her stomach, how is she going to explain that she is going to give most of those foals to adoption?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow both are they going to handle it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them knew or noticed that a tiny figure came out of the filly's vagina and onto the floor, drenched in filly juice wile hiding from the view.</span></div></div>",

Spoiled sold the extravagant mansion she used to live in and purchased a more moderately sized home to provide a homely environment for her foals, leaving a generous severance paycheck for their longtime servants.<br>\r\nMost of them were sad to see her go, and one after another came up and hugged her with tearful goodbyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a month all the colts and fillies were already running around the house, getting into things and generally causing trouble. All except for the twin humans, which had barely even started to crawl and even then still needed constant supervision. Spoiled was worried that something was wrong with them. She consulted with Princess Twilight, who seemed to know the most about the odd creatures and was quickly assured that it was completely normal and that they would be up and running in a year's time. This eased Spoiled's mind somewhat but caused her to be quite a bit more overprotective of these two.<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara was a doting mother to her own child, fussing over his appearance and regularly combing his hair and his tiny wings, just like a real prince. Spoiled wondered if this made them royalty, as every alicorn born or created recent memory had been named a princess and given their own fiefdom to rule over. Other than the requisite congratulations and pat on the back she received no official word yet from the other princesses on the future of her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite a widespread search the father was still not found, meaning that Spoiled was still in the dark as to the origins of her and Diamond's children. She lay awake at night thinking on the whereabouts of the mysterious :human\" that eluded all means of detection and capture, slowly rubbing her belly. He had changed her life in the best way possible and yet she didn't even know what he looked like. She had no trouble raising her foals herself but she would at least like for them to know their own father. If he's out there, she wondered what he's doing now, and if he's thinking of her.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't tell if it was an itch or if something was moving around in her fur. She didn't want to get up just yet so she laid in her bed with eyes half open, staring at the ceiling. She yawned, lazily snaking a hoof underneath he bed sheet to scratch the itch. Somehow, the itch sensed her intentions and moved backwards towards her crotch, settling in between her still swollen teats. Spoiled tried again but itch once again managed to evade her hoof, making her groan in frustration. \"Argh, you little--\" she growled, and then partially threw off the cover, jerking into an upright position and scanned her belly for any bugs crawling on her. What she saw there immediately stopped her cold. There was someone or something sitting in between her teats, looking directly at her. It didn't seem to be afraid at all, indeed, it had crawled into her like it wanted to get her attention. She tentatively reached out a hoof to poke near its position, and it finally moved, jumping on and clinging to the short fur. Spoiled brought the hoof up to her face to get a better look. He was very small, she could barely make out his small features. He was a bipedal being with cute little hands and feet and a body devoid of any fur. She could see a tiny little penis telling her that he's a male, and a small patch of hair covered the top of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiled Rich had trouble believing what she was seeing. Here, resting on her body was a perfect match for the description of a human. Possibly the same human that knocked both her and her daughter up, and he was so tiny a hundred of him could fit in the space of her frog. How long had he been there? Had he been there all this time, watching his own children grow in secret? Why had he waited to reveal himself before now? Spoiled felt her eyes sting as hot tears began to flow from her tear-ducts unbidden. All this time, he was right under her nose and she never even knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what to do. It was too dangerous for a creature of his size to be wandering around unprotected. She would have to take care of him as much as she did her... <i>their</i> children. She owed that much to him, for the positive change he made in her life. Spoiled wondered how Diamond would react... <i>Diamond.</i> Her eyes flew open in shock. She would have to show this to Diamond Tiara. Carefully handling the human in one hoof, she quickly rolled out of bed and made her way to her daughter's bedroom...</span></div></div>",

Her eyes went wide upon finishing reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was wrong?\" Spoiled then grabs the letter and read, surprised on what she saw. It was from Twilight, the correct princess of Ponyville that She, Celestia and Luna will be discussing the future of her Alicorn child and her daughter's as it was a pretty important matter to be discussed and it can't be delayed any longer and that they were coming now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princesses were coming and in a few hours, they would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply, life was full of surprise.</span></div></div>",

Not knowing what to do with the human, she temporarily put him in a small cup with a small amount of water to drink, Spoiled felt a little embarrassed at treating the father of her children in that way but she didn't have time to worry about it right now. Thankfully her children didn't make too big of a fuss as she dressed them in their best clothing, and helping her daughter get her grandson's clothes on was fairly easy as well. She wondered if she should even bother for her two human children, who couldn't even walk yet,  Ultimately she placed them in a bassinet with a soft blanket covering their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in the finishing stages of preparations when they heard a knock. Spoiled told Diamond to gather the foals while she answered the door, and then she walked up to the entrance, a hard lump forming in her throat. Spoiled reached for the knob, then hesitated, her brow breaking into a cold sweat. She wasn't about to make the princess knock twice, so she forced herself through her apprehension and twisted the knob. What awaited beyond the portal was the stern looking face of a royal guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, could you move please? I'd like to see\" A soft voice came from behind him. The guard bowed his head and moved out of the way, revealing a majestic white alicorn behind him. Princess Celestia herself was standing on her doorstep. Spoiled craned her neck to see if any tohers had come, and was not disappointed. To the back of her Spoiled could see Princess Luna, who was wearing a nice sunhat with a bored expression on her face, and Twilight Sparkle chatting with, surprisingly enough, Princess Cadance, who's own daughter was riding high on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you going to let me in?\" The princess' voice snapped Spoiled out of her reverie, and she hastily replied \"Yes, princess, of course, princess.\" while stepping out of the way to let the monarch pass. She respectfully bowed, not moving until the last princess had entered her home. Twilight hung around for a minute and placed a hoof on her shoulder. \"There's no need to be scared. This is a truly special occasion and they all just wanted to be here to see it for themselves. So, no pressure.\"<br>\r\nSpoiled honestly didn't know if that helped or not. She wondered how they would react to tiny discovery she made that morning.<br>\r\nLooking up at Twilight, she nodded. Twilight smiled brightly. \"All right then! Let's go join the others, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they walked into the living room the princess' had already taken their seats. Cadance had already set down Flurry to play with the other foals who was under the supervision of Diamond Tiara, and she along with Celestia were looking and making faces and silly noises at the human babies.<br>\r\nLuna held a pegasus pony in her lap, and was currently playing peekaboo with her wings over her eyes.<br>\r\nThe scene was so cute that Twilight almost didn't want to ruin the moment, but there was limited time and they had a lot to discuss. She coughed loudly, announcing her presence and making the rest of the princess' look up. \"Now that we're all here, I think it might be time to discuss what we talked about on the way here.\"<br>\r\nLuna reluctantly put the foal down while Celestia and Cadance twisted in their seats to face the younger pony.<br>\r\n\"Now...\"</span></div></div>",

I believe its time for the reason we are here.\" Says Twilight. \"Let me talk first, A lot has happened ever since you both gave birth, rumors started to come about fairly quickly about a pregnancy illness to you rising your own little army for overthrowing the Princesses... in the end, Rumors were more outlandish than the last but there were ones that have some degree true and were about questioning your ancestry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our ancestry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we investigated deeply on your bloodline and ancestry, to see if there is any relation with either us.\" Luna pointed on herself and Celestia \"Or any other Alicorn in recorded history but we were unable to find somepony that match with your family, What we found were majority Earth Ponies.\" Luna ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As result, we can't theorize that your foals were formed because of your ties of blood with the Alicorn tribe.\" Cadence finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which led to another theory, Spoiled Milk.\" Twilight spoke \"It was possible that your Alicorn may be the product of multiple foals fusing into one during the early development in the womb, the count of foals within may have been as high of 608 but the womb couldn't logically take that number so instead of terminating the excess of fetuses, your body fused them together, being the majority Earth Ponies, the difference wasn't high or significant but those that were Pegasi, Unicorn mixed in the process, it lead to.. eh..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crown Royale.\" Spoiled Milk answered, giving the name of her Alicorn Filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Crown Royale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... what about me?\" Diamond Tiara chimed in. \"I was only pregnant with one and was an Alicorn too..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, Little One.\" It was Celestia Turn to talk \"And so that Theory was also discarded which brought us back to not your bloodline but to the donor that made say miracle possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, the Human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Diamond Tiara.\" Celestia answered, \"It is possible and perhaps even certain that the human had something to do with, it could be his genes triggered something during the pregnancy that gave even the smallest possible to conceive an Alicorn foal and you both were the luckiest mare in all Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes a priority to reach him at once.\" Luna retakes the conversation \"Even if the chances are small or uncertain, it still there and he could be the target of less pleasant individuals and be used as breeding livestock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, it is important we reach the foals' father for his safety,\" Celestia says, finishing Luna's comment in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara and Spoiled Milk looked each other, they thought it would be the right time to talk about the Tiny man they found but before they could comment about him, Cadence says something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... for the Alicorn foals' validation for the Princehood title, it's been hotly discussed topic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, My Niece. We talked about it a lot but in the end, we reached the conclusion that the foals were to be given the title of prince and princess upon reaching a certain age.\" Celestia says \"Originally, we were meant to give them Dukedom but this move was probably for the best and set those rumors and speculation to rest once and for all, especially since the first Alicorn born among you is a colt and that shouldn't be ignored\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that say and done, it was discussed a lot about the foals future and the age where they will be notified about their coronation and the ceremony. When an Agreement was met, the Princesses turned to leave until Diamond Tiara says something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, there is something we need to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princesses looked back on confusion until Spoiled Milk dropped the news<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the Foals' father... we found him.\"</span></div></div>",

She could've easily said nothing, letting the tiny human's whereabouts remain a mystery. It would've made her life far less complicated. However, upon thinking about it more she realized that her secret just wouldn't be able to hold up against public scrutiny without doing some. ..distasteful things to him. Better to get it out in the open now rather than later.<br>\r\nSpoiled nodded at her daughter, who took the hint and got up and walked out of the room.<br>\r\nWhile they waited Spoiled said, \"I'm just going to warn you now, what you're about to see may come as a bit of  a shock.\"<br>\r\nCelestia tilted her head, looking at her in confusion. \"And just what is so shocking about it\"<br>\r\nSpoiled scratched behind her head and chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n\"Well you see, it's a funny story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Diamond walked into the room holding a porcelain mug. Now all the princesses looked puzzled. Diamond hoofed over the mug and stepped back, taking a seat on the floor. \"<i>This</i> is what you're looking for\" Spoiled said, and titled the mug, pouring its only occupant onto her hoof. The little man came alive, surprised by the sudden change in light and began wandering around on her frog. The princesses crowded around close to see to see the strange sight. They all seemed speechless, staring at her hoof with mouths wide open.<br>\r\nCadance was the first to speak.\"<i>That's</i> a human? He's so <i>cute</i>!\"<br>\r\n\"He's also very small. Smaller than even a breezie. It's a good thing we have laws protecting tiny sapient creatures from abuse\" Luna added, then looked at Twilight. \"Twilight Sparkle, did you know about this?\"<br>\r\nTwilight threw up her hooves in defense. \"He's definitely not supposed to be that small! All of my research indicated that while they were alive they towered over a pony, even reaching the height of a minotaur and above. The males were larger than the females, and they lived in close-knit family groups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia scratched her chin in thought. \"You said \"were\", which would seem to imply that they lived once in the past but are now no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" the young alicorn beamed at her teacher. \"We aren't sure what happened, but sometime in the distant past their numbers began to dwindle until there were only a few of them left. Some scholars attributed their disappearance to ponies migrating in and changing their environment. I identified the two babies through the descriptions and detailed drawings I saw in books\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if what all you said is true, then why is he so minuscule?\" Cadance asked, wanting to get into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Twilight admitted. \"Somepony might have put a hex on him causing him to shrink, or he could've wandered into Poison Joke like what happened with my friend Applejack, or any other number of things. I'm going to have to run some tests to figure out what went wrong and maybe try to fix it. Maybe if I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That brings me to my next question,\" the solar monarch interrupted, seeing that her student was about to go off into a long rambling tangent. \"How, exactly did he manage to impregnate these two ponies at his size anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can answer that, your majesty.\" the dark pink earth pony finally spoke up, breaking her silence. \"Diamond and I were, um, \"indulging\" in each other's company while we were both in heat. My best guess is that the human was present at that time and crawled in each of us to fertilize our eggs, and I guess the rest is history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ponies and humans can interbreed that might mean we can resurrect their species, along with possibly the alicorn tribe.\" Cadance exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nodded in agreement. \"Yes, this is truly a wonderful discovery, and one that needs to be further investigated. I know that you only just found him, but with your permission, I'd like to take him to the Royal Scientific Academy to be studied. I promise you that he would be treated with the utmost respect and care befitting a specimen of his importance.

How could you say that?\" Cadence said, gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think about it, Niece.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Winter Star and Holly, two unicorn scientists under Princess Twilight tasked with studying the mysterious new species, or rather <i>old</i> species that was thought to be extinct, were up late one night in a small library in the Research Wing of the RSA, talking about the discovery one of them had made just a few hours prior. Two hot mugs of coffee sat between them, an offering to the Caffeine Goddess to grant them a boon and sustain them through the long night of work. <br>\r\nWinter Star, the senior scientist, was showing her findings to her junior understudy, who was reading through the notes while taking small sips of her coffee.<br>\r\nWinter Star had an intent look on her face, like she expected her colleague to jump out of her seat at the sheer magnitude of her work. Holly, for her part, stayed cool but the implications were starting to excite her nonetheless.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Yes. Verrrry interesting.\" she drawled, drawing the older scientist's ire and making her impatient.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think?\" Winter demanded. \"Did you like it? The implications for this <i>must</i> be huge, right? We're on the cusp of something big, I can just feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly dropped the notes on the table, a frown forming on her face. \"I <i>think</i> that you really need to work on your hornwriting. It's so atrocious that I could barely make out what you were trying to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter Star made a dismissive gesture with her hoof. \"That's just the sign of a true genius at work. Starswirl the Bearded had terrible hornwriting and he was one of the greatest sorcerers of all time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is. <i>Is</i> the greatest sorcerer,\" Holly corrected. \"You know he returned from Limbo recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Winter huffed, stamping her hoof, \"I knew that. I was just testing you. Anyway, even <i>he</i> would be impressed. We're about to rewrite our understanding of the universe, and I, Winter Star, will be right at the forefront.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly couldn't help but roll her eyes at the boisterous display. She was reminded of a certain blue unicorn that she went to school with that talked a big game about how smart and powerful she was but ended up dropping out of magic school. One day her colleague and close friend's ego was going to get her into trouble. She tried to change the subject. \"What about the sperm samples? she asked, trying to keep the irritation of her voice in check. \"What did you learn from those?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh you know same old, same old. Super potent and compatible with any type of species, blah blah blah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly's mouth dropped open. The other thing sounded important, sure but this one held more immediate applications. \"<i>Any</i> type? Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm sure. Tried it on every type of ovum given to us: Hippogriffs, Seaponies, Changelings, Dragons, Yaks... I think we even had a Kirin in there somehow, You name it, we tried it, and it allll works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's... very interesting. This could have some ramifications for the relationships between ponies and other species for certain. Then another thought came to Holly's mind.<br>\r\n\"So have we had any luck figuring out the language of the tiny human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter gave off a frustrated grunt. \"If we knew <i>that</i> then we wouldn't have to run so many sun damned tests. I swear shrinking down to attempt to talk to the little ape-man is an exercise in futility. He doesn't recognize <i>any</i> Ponish, written or spoken, and trying to teach him is like trying to fill a sieve. It's so infuriating! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that creating a hypothesis and then testing it is one of core principles of science.\" Holly gently reminded trying to soothe her friend's anger. \"You've been working hard at this and I know that Princess Sparkle would be proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope so,\" Winter replied, having cooled off a little bit. \"I'll be going with her tomorrow to the palace to present our findings so far. I'm so nervous! I don't want to disappoint Princess Celestia in front of the whole court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't,\" Holly promised, giving her friend a warm smile. \"You'll do fine. Just don't do anything rash or stupid or I'll find you and smack you upside the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks,\" the elder unicorn grumbled, but a small smile touched her face.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we better turn in, then. Wouldn't want you to miss your big date.\"<br>\r\nWinter agreed, and standing up from her chair, turned off the enchanted lantern lighting the room and walked out with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Star and Holly, I trust you both got the results from the investigation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Princess we got the results and they're mixed at best..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mixed?\" Twilight inquired both ponies brought papers that report the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We notified and cataloged his species and compared with numerous fossilized bones and tissues we had on ancient humanity, previously thought to be an extinct ape species and we got 96% of accuracy. We're treating with the same species, albeit with a small variation. In short, We have the only pure-blooded human in all Equestria in our hooves, almost literally.\" Winter Star informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not all, despite the previous attempt we weren't able to translate his language, we only managed to communicate with him using Symbols, Signs, and drawings. Numbers and maths seem to be the only thing we got in common. We gave some him some simple mathematical problems and managed to answer it almost all correctly, then we switched to more advanced where he was more slow to solve but managed to get results, some erroneous but the formulas used were correct. He is intelligent, perhaps average.\" Holly informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also got information coming from him based on the signs and drawings, it pictures a different world devoid of magic and only them as the dominant intelligent species using only very advanced technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" Twilight stopped them. \"Are you telling me that Humans are not from this world?\" She says skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, several theories had sprung in the light of this information. One that has more sense is humans never went extinct at all and at some point, left through a gateway into another world. Perhaps a different plane of existence or dimension once Ponykind began to settle Equestria Millenia ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say that said theory is true, How he got here or why?\" Celestia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For his Illustration, we managed to piece things together, He doesn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... Doesn't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Princess, at least that's what he picturing us, He was sleeping then upon waking up, he was within the Rich's Mansion within the room of Diamond Tiara. From there we could believe that he went to search more of his peers but bigger but instead, a strong wind push him to the vulva of an early morning Spoiled Rich who was in her heat. Said heat overwhelmed the human's senses and enthralled him to spread his genes and breed by getting into her womb but that's not all, we theorized that he actually fertilized her entire ovary given Spoiled's unnatural pregnancy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impregnate her... entire ovary?\" Both Princesses were shocked to know the answer, Celestia however, was the first to snap up \"...Please, Continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, after seeding her uterus, he hastily left only to be caught in between on her and her daughter's... \"relief\" section to pass their heat and fell onto Diamond's fillyhood and the same happened within her except with one of her ova and... that's all.\" Winter ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all? Surely must something else.\" Twilight asked a bit skeptical but intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Princess Sparkle but the Human doesn't want to reveal more. Unfortunately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Celestia mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ther are more?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, his... sperm samples.\" Holly began unsure how to tell this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, He is indeed super potent, his swimmers were able to fertilize all form of eggs and ovas donated for this testing.. which was of every species recorded.. even dragons and kirins. In other words, he is able to impregnate any female alive..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any.. female alive? you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can crossbreed with anything alive here.\" Winter continues \"Despite the sizes and what we were able to gather, all points to that conclusion, not only that, his sperm contain different proteins different that to stallions which makes this possible. Those proteins and genes while recessive compared to the mothers' could affect certain facet during fertilization and development of the child, on ponies and if we are generous about it, the foals would receive most of the mother's traits including species but they have more chance to develop into other tribes.. including alicorn or switch entirely into the father's species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Celestia had a different reaction, for Twilight she was giddy, this was an exciting discovery a miracle and a breakthrough in the scientific scene, quantum sciences, archeological research and genetic studies but for Celestia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princesses?\" Winter Star asked seeing their silence. Celestia for her part asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes but we can't give more until further studies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, You had done a great job in reporting those discoveries to us. Please, continue until you had further information available to us, You may go now\" The monarch of the Sun as both doctors bowed and left.</span></div></div>",

You saw how ready they were to make war when they thought their children had gone missing. How do you think they're going to react when they find out we've been keeping a secret of this magnitude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not well,\" Celestia admitted, feeling a little apprehensive about it herself. \"Even so, that doesn't mean we should abandon our morals even if it's the smart thing to do. We can't communicate with him and he can't with us, meaning it's impossible to gain his fully educated, informed consent on such an endeavor. Going ahead otherwise with what you're suggesting would be tantamount to rape, not to mention a flagrant disregard for his rights. We would be depriving Spoiled' Milk's children of a father as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rolled her eyes. \"You and your \"rights\". Ponies used to do whatever we told them to, and they liked it. He is truly the last of his kind. He <i>needs</i> to breed otherwise his species will die out. We need to find as many breeding partners as we can, which would be best achieved by creating a breeding program and letting him have a go at any creature that wants a try, and when their numbers manage to reach higher than the single digits <i>then</i> we can worry about human rights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's another way.\" Twilight suddenly interrupted, causing the arguing sisters to stop and stare at her.<br>\r\nTwilight felt the withering gaze of the two elder princesses and shrank back slightly in her seat, but continued nonetheless.<br>\r\n\"Dr. Star mentioned that the human claims to have come from another world where, presumably, there are many more of his kind. If we were to find a way back to where we came from we wouldn't have to solely rely on one human to do the job, and we could possibly create new allies in them as well .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't even know where to begin to do that.\" Celestia said. \"It's definitely an possibility but I feel like that option won't become available anytime soon. I still say that we should focus on trying to communicate with the human and make him aware of the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, you're the tiebreaker here. Who do you agree more with, me or Celestia.\" Luna asked urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked between the faces of the other two princesses and sighed. They weren't going to make this wasy, were they? Finally, after a few minutes of thinking and mental turmoil Twilight came to a decision.<br>\r\n\"I... agree with...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that Winter Star was nervous would be a grave understatement. She already felt that she completely flopped on giving her report and now the princess was summoning her for a private meeting. Like many ponies, she abhorred the idea of disappointing the princess, who was like a mother to her nation and all the little ponies surrounding her. She'd heard tales of ponies going to extreme measures to avoid doing so, even engaging in self harm. She wasn't <i>that</i> crazy but she felt a knot her throat forming as she approached the door to the private study that refused to go away. After a moment of trepidation she knocked three times on the stained wood, prompting a swift \"enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any time Winter opened the door and stepped inside.<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia was at her desk looking at her paperwork, then smiled as she looked up and noticed Winter.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Dr. Star. I'm so glad you could come. Please, take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter pulled out a chair and hopped up into it, trying her best not to fidget too much as the princess talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'll not waste your time and get right to the point. Time is of the essence. First of all, I'd like to congratulate you on your work and tell you you're doing a great service to Equestria by spending time on this project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter smiled and bowed her head. \"Of course, thank you your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However... there i still much to learn and I fear that you'll have to suspend your other projects to work on this full-time. We don't know how or why this human came here and where he came from, why he's so small, why his sperm is so potent, and we can not gain his informed consent to conduct any more invasive experiments because of a language barrier, a barrier that we are incapable of overcoming with magic. My sister wishes to enroll him in a breeding program to repopulate the human race, which I can not in good conscience allow without his consent. That's why I called you here today, to figure out a way around this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter gained a thoughtful look, rubbing her chin. \"What do you expect me to do, your highness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia crossed her forehooves on the table and leaned closer. \"You've spent a lot of time with the human, meaning that above all other ponies at the Academy you are the one he's most familiar with. He is our guest, which means that his safety and comfort are our top priority. I feel that that you might have better luck if he were to remain in Ponyville with his family while we run further tests. While he's there you will accompany him and continue your work, coordinating with Twilight if necessary. Remember that we want to avoid any undue stress so I'd say an hour a day would be appropriate. Take as much time as you need, and send me a report on your progress every week. Write me <i>immediately</i> if he makes any mention of other worlds. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your highness,\" Winter said, breathing an internal sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's about all, I think  You are dismissed.\" Celestia said, before breaking eye contact and returning to her papers.<br>\r\nWinter bowed her head and got up to leave, feeling both excited and nervous at what the future may hold.<br>\r\nCelestia watched her leave, gently tapping a forehoof against her desk</span></div></div>",

There's no point in working yourself into a froth over all this. Give it time, and I'm sure you'll make a breakthrough.\" Her couchmate was  Spoiled Milk herself, who currently had her legs splayed wide open feeding Chocolate, the human colt she had birthed, while Strawberry, her human filly, sat nestled close by in the gap between her thigh and the hoofrest.. The other foals were already close to being weaned off of mother's milk and were gnawing on everything they could; Winter Star had made herself useful by  shaping and freezing ice for them to chew on, for which Spoiled was immensely grateful.<br>\r\nIn fact, Winter had been an invaluable asset in looking after the children and so she and Spoiled had grown into friends.<br>\r\n\"You're pushing yourself too hard. Ypu've been at this for several weeks now, and I can tell that you're about to blow your top. Don't you think you should take a break for a little while?\"<br>\r\nWinter sighed, then dispelled the illusion and picked up the human, handing him off to Spoiled.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right. It's just that... I feel like I'm <i>so close</i> to unlocking his secrets and if I were to quit now I wouldn't be able to go on.\"<br>\r\n\"You know  that I'd love to be able to understand him too.

You need to give it a rest so you don't end up overworking yourself,\" Spoiled sagely advised.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, maybe you're right. I'll have to take that into consideration.\" Winter admitted, then decided to change the subject. \"So, are you planning on making it official anytime soon? I hear that Rarity's running a special on suits for itty bitty alien grooms.\" she asked jokingly.<br>\r\n\"Actually that was something I wanted to talk to you about, and now that you've brought it up...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A long silence followed as Spoiled digested all this information and carefully considered the Princess' proposal.<br>\r\nNot so long ago if asked she wouldn't have cared one way or the other what happened to the little human and would've gladly hoofed him over and pocketed the money without a second thought..<br>\r\nNow, however...?<br>\r\nSpoiled's life had entered an entirely new vector upon becoming pregnant with his foals. She felt much younger now, was much kinder and generous, and she had even reconciled with her daughter thanks to him.<br>\r\nShe didn't want to let that go, even if it meant turning down the princesses. Still, there was that side of her that didn't want to disappoint them by having them come all this way and leaving empty hooved...<br>\r\nCelestia noticed the storm brewing in Spoiled's eyes and immediately offered up one of her patented reassuring and motherly smiles. \"Is something the matter, my little pony? I completely understand if you're feeling anxious about parting with him but I assure you he would be in the best of care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... want him to remain here... with his family,\" Spoiled confessed, \"That is, if you don't mind .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia respectfully dipped her head. \"Of course. I wouldn't want to separate anyone from their families should they not wish it so. By the way, I've heard about what happened to Filthy Rich and wanted to let you know that should you need anything, anything at all, just ask Twilight for help. Also, I've decided to grant him full citizenship status to ease his integration into pony society. I just hope that we can learn his language soon so he can appreciate it fully! Ah, just what is it that you've decided to call him anyhow?\"<br>\r\nSpoiled was slightly taken aback by this. She hadn't really thought about putting a name to the father of her foals, mostly because she thought he'd eventually show up and simply <i>tell</i> her his name, not play a game of 20 questions.<br>\r\nShe looked over at Diamond, who merely shrugged. A name, a name, what would be a good name...<br>\r\nSpoiled spent a full minute thinking it over before coming to a decision.<br>\r\n\"I think we can call him... Anon.\"<br>\r\nCelestia cocked an eyebrow. \"Anon?\"<br>\r\n\"Short for Anonymous, since we don't know who he is or where he came from,\" Spoiled answered truthfully.<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. Then Anon it shall be! At least until we break the language barrier, something that I'm sure that Twilight is trying to work out right now with the little gears whirring in her head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Twilight decided to chip in, \"I'll get on that right away. We're still going to need to study him, it's just might take a bit longer is all. Actually, passively observing his family life might give us more insights into his species than being poked and prodded in some lab, anyhow.\"<br>\r\nAt this Cadance began to giggle from behind her hoof, earning her a cross look from the lavender alicorn.<br>\r\n\"And just what is it that's so funny?\" she huffed indignantly.<br>\r\n\"I never thought I'd see the day I'd hear you say that, Twily, not in a hundred years. You really have grown up a lot since earning your wings, haven't you,\" Cadance teased.<br>\r\nTwilight cheeks tinted a rosy red color, before hiding her face behind her wings and mumbling,\"I just really like science, okay?\" which caused the other Princesses in attendance to join Cadance's gigglefits, with Twilight soon joining in.<br>\r\nThis drained most of the tension out of the room and Spoiled found herself actually smiling despite herself.<br>\r\nCelestia clapped her hooves together, silencing the giggling, then stood up.<br>\r\n\"Well then, now that <i>that's</i> all settled and we accomplished what we came for I'd say it's time we take our leave.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww, but I wanted to play with the foals a bit more...\" Cadance complained with a slight pout.<br>\r\n\"As do I, but I'm sure that they would rather be left alone for now, don't you think so?\"<br>\r\n\"We can always come back later. I'm sure that I'll need to check up on them again soon enough in the future,\" Twilight suggested.<br>\r\nCadance thought about this for a split second before an idea popped into her head.<br>\r\nShe jumped up and began to push her fellow princesses out the door, much to their displeasure.<br>\r\n\"Ow, hey, quit shoving!\"<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\nCadance readily ignored these cries, eager to leave so she can begin working on her new project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia and Luna first left the house after giving the host their well wishes, after which followed Twilight, and finally, Cadance, who who was eagerly bouncing along the way and giggling like a mad schoolfilly.<br>\r\nTwilight took notice of her behavior and deadpanned, \"I know that look. What are you planning?\"<br>\r\nCadance put on a daring grin, \"Oh that would be telling, Twilight. Suffice it to say that our two new lovebirds will be receiving a gift from me very soon.\"<br>\r\nCelestia heard this and snorted, then rolled her eyes. \"Oh you and your relationship work. I swear girl, you need a hobby, spend more time with your daughter and husband, <i>something</i> that doesn't involve you poring over those charts.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't deny who I am, any more then you can. Helping ponies find that special someone out there is my LIFE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversations faded as the quintet reached their carriage and climbed inside, and Spoiled let out a breath that she wasn't even aware she was holding in. She reached over and tousled her daughter's mane, looking down at her with a fond smile.<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Diamond looked up at her mother with questioning eyes.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sweetie?\"<br>\r\n\"Does this make us a herd now?\"<br>\r\nSpoiled Rich had thought a great deal about just that and she was never able to come to a clear answer to the question. <br>\r\nShe'd heard of multi-generational herds before but none of them ever had an underaged filly among their number.<br>\r\nTechnically since all the members of the herd are bound together in matrimony that would make her daughter <i>also</i> her spouse with all the perks that entails, and the all the children produced by the herd would be held in common, so that would make Diamond's baby colt Diamond Necklace her primary responsibility as well.<br>\r\nSpoiled would still have seniority over her though as the Headmare and her mother so it's not like she could challenge her authority, nor would she want to.<br>\r\nNormally all the intricacies of herd life and the rearing of the children along with most of the household affairs (with some help from his herdmares of course) would be handled by the herd stallion, who had the final say in what goes on inside the home while his mares pampered him.<br>\r\nSince that would clearly be impossible at present with his current state that job would fall to her.<br>\r\nFor now, all she could manage was a nod and a simple \"Yes.\"<br>\r\nDiamond ruminated on this for a minute, before remarking, \"I guess that makes him my new daddy, too.\"<br>\r\nAs much as she loved Filthy Rich she found that she didn't really mind the idea.<br>\r\nNeither did Spoiled Milk, to be quite honest.<br>\r\n<i>Father, husband, lover, confidant. He's the full package. Now if only we could understand him...</i>, Spoiled thought to herself.<br>\r\nOutwardly she allowed, \"Yes, it would seem that way, Diamond Tiara.\"<br>\r\nThe pair walked back into the living room, where the tiny \"Anon\" still stood on the coffee table, wandering around and exploring while the mares left the room. When he saw the pair reenter he gleefully raced to the edge and started waving his arms to signal to pick him up.<br>\r\nSpoiled did just that and held him in the soft embrace of her frog while Diamond looked on nearby in wonder.<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cheerilee herself was not yet present, so the room was filled with cacophonous noise as the classmates  eagerly conversed with their neighbors closest to them. The noise quieted down as the teacher stepped into the room and began to write something with her mouth on the chalkboard. The foals politely waited until the teacher had finished her writing, and then turned around and said, \"Well, hello there students!\"<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ms. Cheerilee\", the students dutifully replied, bringing a bright smile to her face.<br>\r\n\"Alright, my little ponies, as you know, because of estrus starting this week, we had .to remove some of our male students to form a separate study group with a male chaperone, and won't be returning until the heat has passed. Until then, I'll have to rely on you to pass on their assignments so they can keep up with the rest of the class. Do I have any volunteers?\"<br>\r\nShe scanned the classroom, looking for any takers. A few fillies coughed, but none raised their hooves. Even Scootaloo, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle were trying to make out like they're part of the scenery.\"Anypony? There's no need to be shy, these ponies to keep up with their schoolwork as well.\"<br>\r\nStill no dice. Cheerilee was about to volunteer one of the fillies herself when she spotted a familiar pink hoof waving in the air. \"Diamond Tiara? Yes,what is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I can do it. I can take them their homework\", the filly proudly proclaimed.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, are you sure?\" Diamond Tiara wasn't her first choice, but she might be her only one. Then she remembered something. \"Diamond Tiara, I thought you were taking time off for your own heat. Shouldn't you be at home?\"<br>\r\nShe shook her head, and replied, \"Nope, just as soon as it flared up it was gone, just like that. You can ask my mother, she'll tell you.\"<br>\r\nCheerilee carefully considered this. Even if Diamond <i>said</i> her heat was quenched, that didn't necessarily mean it was gone, unless she went and got herself a stud somehow, and she didn't want to liable for sending a heated filly to harass a group of poor colts. On the other hoof, she had limited options outside of giving them herself. Her own heat was coming up and she just couldn't waste time trying to keep <i>herself</i> from raping the colts. The entire class was staring at her deliberating, waiting for her to make a decision. After a short moment of reflection Cheerilee finally spoke up. \"Alright... but you better be responsible for your own actions. I don't want to be held liable if something goes wrong.\"<br>\r\nThe purple filly smiled, \"Of course, Ms. Cheerilee. I won't let you down!\"<br>\r\n\"See that you don't.\" the teacher pony grumbled, then turned to the class with a fresh smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"Alright class, since it <i>is</i> estrus season and I'm not sure how much you know about this magical time in your lives, I've decided to dedicate the lesson today to learning about estrus and pony reproduction.

Estrus is the time of the year where we mares are on our most fertile day, the warmth and itchiness we feel in ourselves and in our loins is why we call it \"heat\". It is the time of the year where our body is telling us to breed with a stud to make a foal. For this to work, we release pheromones subconsciously to incite nearby stallion and made them aware of our heat... This is where our hormones are on its highest too and can be very unstable when not treated correctly.\" She says very seriously \"When it's not treated, the heat becomes almost unbearable to the point that certain \"tools\" won't be enough to sate our needs until we find the nearest stud that meet our needs, this is why ignoring the heat isn't healthy.\" She says \"A Willing Partner can help more, it will help to mitigate the feeling until the heat week passes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do stallion and colts also had heat?\" A pegasus filly in the back row asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. They don't have heat as we do but they do play a large part in it, which I will explain shortly. Now class get out your biology books and turn to page... 69\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee blushes saying the page's number, most fillies caught the reference immediately and snickered, while some didn't and were the first ones that searched the page dutifully. When all the children had their books open and on the right page the cerise pony smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to start off, let's talk about the Reproductive System and how that plays into our discussion..\"</span></div></div>",

When she finished she stepped out of the so that the class can get a better look. It was a cross-section of a vagina and uterus and a drawing of a pair of labia, clitoris and the anus. \"First let's talk about the female reproductive system, the thing that's been giving you so much trouble lately. The entire system consists of three parts, the vagina, the uterus and the ovaries, with the uterus and vagina being connected by a small opening called the cervix.\" Cheerilee drew a small rough facsimile of the round opening next to the larger diagram. \"The vagina is supposed to take a penis inside during sexual intercourse, although you can fit many other things in there and it will still feel quite pleasurable.\"<br>\r\nShe moved her yardstick a bit further up and pointed at the uterus. \"The uterus is where your foal will grow if or when a stud fertilizes an egg inside the womb. Once the egg is fertilized it will implant into the uterine wall and begin to subdivide, eventually forming into a fetus that will connect to the mother via an umbilical cord and receive nutrients from the mother. We will discuss pony gestation in full at a later date.\"<br>\r\nOnce again, Cheerilee moves the yardstick, this time resting on one of the ovaries. \"At a certain time of year, a mare's body will begin producing hormones that cause an egg to move from the ovaries, where they are grown, to the uterus in preparation to be fertilized. One side affect of the hormones is that it will make your loins burn, both literally and figuratively, until you find a suitable mate to fill you with semen. A stallion's sperm has a chemical inside it that turns off the hormones when it wriggles into an egg. This is the <i>only</i> way to stop the heat other than waiting it out. You either have to get pregnant or continue to suffer. That's just the way it is.\"<br>\r\nCheerilee pauses for a moment to let her words sink in, and then spots a filly's raised hoof.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ruby Pinch?\"<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is that until a stallion impregnates you, you have to live with the hot itchy plot until it goes away? Wouldn't it be easier just to get it over with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good question, Ruby. There are many reasons why mares wait instead of \"indulging herself\", so to speak. She may not be at the right time in her life to raise a child, or is waiting for her special somepony to come along, or having financial issues.  All of these could be contributing factors as to why she would want to wait. Are there any more questions, or can we move onto the second part of the lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no filly answered Cheerilee began to write something else on the board.<br>\r\n\"Now that all that boring stuff's out of the way, let's get to the good part: Toys, Sexual Positions and Safe Sex Practices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite being ancient, It is still used on this very day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those forms are often not even being on four but also enjoyed on bed one which is the form 69. This form where a pony...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cheerilee explained certain form, many fillies began to think on what Cheerilee said early and some were very interested, no many were really into waiting the entire week with their plot hot and itchy but also not really into the prospect of having a child... do they? There weren't really many colts on their class, so not really many have a special pony unless they were swinging that way but heats affect every mare. Money was always a problem so it would always be a factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other fillies were really into the class, Cheerilee was explaining on the Cowgirl style, basically a mare taking it while the stallion lay down on the bottom. Some were bitting their lips possibly imagining on doing those things, heat starting affect their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cheerlilee continues with now the missionary. Some ponies, like the Cutie Mark Crusaders, were on their little world while taking notes attentively, so were many fillies but they had a unique way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom had Applejack but also Big Macintosh, her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle Had Rarity who, being a unicorn, know few ways to quench the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo knew more that those Cheerilee explained thanks to Rainbow Dash and her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now class, time for the last part.

You can roll a special sleeve of latex over a stallion's penis to catch any semen that comes out before it makes its way into the womb. Many ponies use this as a contraceptive measure to prevent pregnancies when they don't necessarily want children. In rare cases the condom may rip whenever a stallion's flare swells so that's something to take into account. Next, you can forgo the stallion altogether and engage in sexual relations with another mare or filly. I know that sounds kind of gross on the surface but trust me when I say there's absolutely nothing wrong with exploring your body with another female. Heck, my sister used to help me get over my heats all the time back when we were young. We'll be discussing how to find pleasure with another female at a later date. The last thing I want to cover today is anal, or penetration of the anus with a stallion's penis. Not really much to say about this, but you might find a hard time convincing a stallion or colt to engage in this activity because they might consider it \"dirty.\" You're on your own if you want to try it out, otherwise you might have to make duw with a dildo or buttplug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee looked at the clock, and realized that she'd been talking too long and the school day was already almost over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops, where did the time go? Looks like our time together is almost over. There will be no homework for today but I want you to look over your notes and try to remember what I told you. Class dismissed.\" she said with finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students moved to pit away her books and shuffle out of the class Cheerilee felt an odd feeling in the air she couldn't quite place. After a few minutes of standing, she shrugged her shoulders and went to work cleaning the chalkboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You lick and suckle like a baby, drinking down as much delicious milk as you can, then sit down on the teat, satisfied. You look back up to see how the mare is doing. Having two powerful orgasms in such a short time has worn her out.

You were back in the carpeted hall you were before except this time you were normal sized, and there was sunlight streaming in through the windows. You could hear a soft humming coming from somewhere else in the house. Other than that the halls were strangely silent. No birds chirping or people moving around despite it being in the middle of the day. Curious as to what the noise was and where it was coming from you wandered around the house, following your ears which led you down twisting pathways and past many closed doors. You finally found a room with an open door, which had an enthralling tune flowing out of it that made your feet twitch. You entered the room in a half daze, unsure of what to expect but excited at the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large bedroom with a large lavish bed filling the space, covered in what looked like soft comfortable blankets and throw pillows. On the bed was a creature unlike anything you'd ever seen. She looked almost like a small equine with a soft pink body and purple mane. She faced away from you, still singing her little tune and moving her hooves in a pattern you couldn't see. She seemed not to notice your presence in the room, so preoccupied was she with... whatever she was doing. You almost wanted to leave her in peace but was compelled to stay, at least to sate your curiosity.<br>\r\nAfter a while the horse... pony... thing finally stopped what she was doing and put down whatever she was working on. She sighed, then turned over on the bed, noticing you for the first time. You could now see that her face was definitely equine, with a cute little muzzle and large, expressive eyes, which were now looking at you in shock and confusion. You stared back, mesmerized by the huge irises that seemed to gaze into your very soul. The pony seemed to regard you for a moment, before turning her head to the side and picking something up in her mouth. She got off the bed and trotted over to where you were standing and offered something to you, bobbing her head to look up at you. You cautiously took what she brought you, and held it up to your face to examine it. It was a onesie, crocheted from pink and blue threads. It looked like a half finished piece, with a few threads hanging out here and there. You handed it back to her, and then she climbed up on the bed, dropping the onesie beside her and looking directly at you. She patted a spot beside her, signalling that she wanted you to come sit beside her for a spell.<br>\r\nYou hesitate for a moment, before relenting and parking your butt right next her head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt like she could easily rip your arm off if she so wished. It's a good thing she was seemingly a nice pony or you might be in trouble. The shortened fur felt nice on your skin as she held you close to her abdomen, waiting for some unseen event to occur. Then you felt it. A tiny appendage poked out and connected with your palm, before quickly retreating. You must've felt a kick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare looked you in the eyes with unrestrained glee, releasing you from her grip. She sighed happily and rubbed against you in an affectionate manner, before moving her head into your lap. So that's what she wanted to show you. That still doesn't explain who she is or what you're doing here, however. You decide to indulge her by scratching and patting her head, getting little noises of happiness in response. She scoots her body into your lap like a cat, so you can get better access to her back fur. She was surprisingly light for someone so strong, you barely felt any pressure as you steadily stroked her. Soon she rolled over on her belly so you could pet her swollen belly yet again, poking her cute little hooves straight up in the air. You traced a path along her belly, along her thighs and around her prominent teats. You were careful to avoid touching anywhere near her rear end, or under her tail, which seemed to make the small horse wiggle restlessly. Suddenly she turned and leapt onto the floor.<br>\r\nShe glared at you, as if you'd done something wrong. You couldn't help but chuckle at the cute angry face she was making, completely unaware of just what you'd gotten yourself into. She rushed up and jumped on your lap, knocking the breath out of you as she pushed you back onto the bed until her eyes were directly above yours. The mare pinned your arms to the bed, not so much to hurt you, but to prevent your movement. Surprising yourself, and her if the wide eyed reaction is any indication, instead of trying to struggle  you wrap your arms around her in a hug. Quickly regaining her composure, the mare seemed pleased by this, licking her lips and giving you a hungry, lustful look.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although, it was going to be difficult to remove your pants with the mare still sitting on you. You wiggled your hips from side to side to loosen the accursed garment from your hips, causing the mare to give you a confused look. She turned around to look at your hips, then gave you a knowing look. Pivoting on her butt, she turned around, finally letting you get a proper look at her goods, and easily rolled it off you body, throwing it into a corner of the room. While she was distracted you reached a hand up and began to fondle her aroused vulva, tracing a finger around the soft lips and spreading them to expose her pink center. The mare moaned loudly, as scooted further back so you could have better access. Not wanting to make you feel left out she released her long tongue and wrapped it around your dick, lengthening and retracting it like a wet spring, which felt amazing on your cock. Wetting your fingers with saliva, you inserted a finger into her pussy and began to slowly steady pump it in and out, feeling the needy muscles grasp at your appendage.<br>\r\nThe mare could seemingly control her vaginal muscles at will, as you could feel the tract ripple in waves back and forth, starting and stopping on a whim. Eventually you added another finger, and then another until almost your whole hand fit into the stretchy canal. Likewise she managed to take your whole dick in her mouth with tongue still wrapped around and without gagging. Whoever she was she was a champion dick sucker, no bones about it.<br>\r\nRealizing that you needed to up your game you pulled your hand from her cunt and pulled her entire backside towards your face, holding her steady with both hands while you get your lick on. The moment your mouth comes in contact with her she lets out a muffled shriek and quickly clamps her hind legs on your head. You eagerly suck and lick at the cuntlips,smoothly rolling your tongue ans sliding up the center of her slit. She moans nonstop, gently squeezing your head with her thighs and rapidly massaging your dick with her mouth.<br>\r\nShe tastes like mint and milk back here too, oddly enough. You eagerly lapped at her vaginal juices trying to get more of it. You had to have more. It was addicting, it was like a drug. Just lapping the vulva wasn't cutting it so you went straight to the source, sticking your tongue straight out and plunging deep inside her. The muscles rippled and pulled, trying to milk a cock that wasn't there. A torrent of the juice poured into your mouth. You drank eagerly sucking like a baby to get as much as you could. The mare released her hold on you and collapsed onto your somach, letting your dick free with a pop and heavily panting. She came before you, which meant that she had \"won\" and you were still left wanting  There was an easy way to rectify the manner however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the mare and flipped so she was facing you. Her mane was a mess, drenched in sweat and disheveled, and she had a glazed look in her eye with tongue hanging out. She was panting heavily and smell of your dick was on her breath. You pulled her in close and began to sloppily make out with her, this time with you being the main aggressor. It didn't look like she had any complaints as she closed her eyes while kissing her deeply. You ran your hands all over her body, lightly smacking her butt and grabbing her teats. Through all this her mental faculties seemed to be coming online as she slowly lost the vacant look for a look of wild lust. She almost didn't want to let go of you until she realized you were ready for the main course.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't even grow flaccid because she was preventing bloode from flowing out of your penis. The mare looked like you just jammed a concrete pole up her cunt, with eyes unfocused and tongue hanging freely from her mouth. You swear that you could see hearts inside her pupils, like she's some kind of cartoon character. Her velvety insides continued to gently massage you as she came down from her high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords couldn't convey the look in her eyes, the love they held, the trust, like she's known you her whole life even though you'd just met. It was this look, moreso than the lower appendage penetrating her love canal, that made you feel warm inside. All of this just felt so right, and you could tell that she felt it too. As you remained connected she butted her head into your chest, making you hold her even closer and gently stroke her ears and hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued like this for several minutes, her pussy giving you a pulse every now and again to remind you where you are. If the tip of your cock is sticking straight out of her cervix you wonder if you stay in long enough the foal will bump into it? You weren't up on horse biology but you thought there would probably be some barrier protecting the fetus. Maybe you would bump into that instead. That same barrier would protect it from your jizz as well, but you still idly fantasized about feeding a baby pony with your semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She clearly didn't want to hurt you and you wanted to keep the good times going. You gleefully approached the mare's foal hole and easily slipped in, well lubricated by the juices she was leaking. You crawled on your hands and knees eagerly slurping at the delectable juices and dragging your cock along the soft ground. Once again the highly developed muscles pulled you forward, massaging your entire body as you went. You were carried up like a wave and pushed against something squishy, the very same cervix you invaded earlier and now you were right next to it. On the other side was her child, as well as the bucketloads of cum you blasted her with. It seemed like this was the end of the line but the muscles behind you flexed, forcing you into the tightly closed cervix and squeezing you through into the space beyond.</span></div></div>",

Upon getting a closer look you could see that the foal's color was a bright magenta, with dark purple hair, similar in hue to it's mother. It was at the wrong angle to tell what it's sex might be, so you didn't exactly know what to call it, yet.<br>\r\nThe foal's eyes were slightly open, giving it the appearance of being half asleep. It didn't seem to notice you floating nearby, and kicked out its limbs causing the liquid inside to ripple. Even as a fetus the foal was still much larger than you, though to a less extreme degree. You could probably just about wrap your arms around the umbilical cord.. You wondered just how far along the foal was, It looked just about ready to be born, you thought, although you really knew nothing about the species they belonged to so you couldn't say for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touched the membrane and found that, with some effort, you could pass through it without breaking it. <br>\r\nNow even more curious, you pushed your whole body through, leaving the thick semen behind and moving into the much less viscous amniotic fluid. Now you were very close to the foal,within short swimming distance. <br>\r\nThe foal looks so cute with its enormous head and comparatively small body, you couldn't help but daww as it opened its mouth in a soundless yawn. You just wanted to swim up to it and give it a hug. You settled with finding out what it's sex was so you could stop referring to It as It. With powerful strokes you moved swiftly down the abdomen and between the rear legs, where you noticed a glaring lack of a certain set of equipment. So, it was a girl, huh. Looking at the baby's tiny gash you chuckled internally. She was <i>still</i> bigger than you , but not by such a wide margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to linger in any one place you swam back around to the front  making a full circuit around the filly.<br>\r\nWell, you've seen all you need to see. Might be time to make your exit. <br>\r\nGiving the foal one last look you pass through back through the membrane and back out into the womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You spot the familiar tunnels off in the back ground, which are somewhat smaller as well. Turning back to the door you examine it closely, walking around it to get a better look. Impossibly, whenever you walk behind it the door seems to vanish when you get behind it and reappear when complete a revolution. You attempt to walk behind the door and see if you can still pass through it, but nothing happens when you walk  in a straight line and the door reappears when you turn around. How curious.

At its base is a line of even more monitors, this time with a standard QWERTY keyboard and mouse assigned to each one, which is convenient for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit at one and slightly move the mouse, making the computer come out of sleep mode. There's no passcode required, which is odd but once again convenient for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of dialogue options appear on the screen, all of which fail to catch your interest save for a few:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPEN QUERY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEGG PRODUCTION OPTIONS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSET ALL CLOCKS TO 0 (!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdter a moment's consideration you decide to choose</span></div></div>",

You could choose to go out for seafood or just stay home and cook yourself a meal. All of these choices are exclusive, meaning there's only one path, one decision to make, whether you want to go out or stay home. They're like opposites, see? Now, for every decision you make there's a road not taken, leaving an echoing image of what could've been, a fork in the road. The timeline that flows after each decision is perfectly valid and are now running parallel to each other and can have very different outcomes. While you're driving to the seafood restaurant you could get into a serious motor accident and die, while your other self is just fine at home.\"<br>\r\nYou slowly nod your head, an idea of what she's saying beginning to form.<br>\r\n\"Every decision you've made up until now has been creating alternate timelines, which is my job to guide and look over.\"<br>\r\nYou're beginning to get the picture but you still don't get it. \"I still don't quite understand all of this.

All you need to know is that you're extremely important to Equestria's future and just you just need to keep doing what you're doing, and everything will turn out alright. I promise.\"<br>\r\nShe leans back into her seat, looking like she lighted a large weight off of her shoulders.<br>\r\n\"So, do you have any more questions?

Here in Equestria, Mares are the dominant sex here just you humans have males as the dominant gender. We shaped our society around it as Mare-Stallion ratio is 1 to 100.

She <i>did </i>take care of those, gaining recognition through all world, she went in the history books as the miraculous breeder, the pony mother of humankind, the mare who gave birth to the hundreds and whose children saved Equestria from a possible population crisis and the first Alicorn Stallion that became Prince and consort of the Princesses. There were countless documentaries detailing how what that possible but none were close to the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped loudy. \"I won't go there when I wake up and just by curiosity. what happened to other me's human daughters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They had normal lives, they grew up found job, love and had children, one married to a Griffin and the other to a Dragon.\" You wanted to argue that those things weren't real but then again you were inside someone's impregnated womb while having a conversation with a magical talking pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to assume that those could potentially be real and intelligent as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...

Grace had found a beanbag somewhere and was currently resting on it while Harsh decided to stick with a standard lobby chair.

Moonlight shakes her head. \"Am I gonna have to muzzle you?\" she scolds, Didn't your mother teach you not to treat a man in such a way, especially one of this much importance?

He... Look weird.\" The new alicorn pony was white coated with a dark blue mane, unlike the others, she was smaller and younger than the others, perhaps a filly?

He is our...  steemed guest!\" Loving Grace chided the younger pony who simply rose an eyebrow then shrugged, she went to one of the empty standard lobby chairs but has a book on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you.. a bit young to be cooking on your own?\" you ask while you dig on your meal. who simply shock her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really, I like cooking, My grandma and aunts taught me.\" She says while digging her own. \"I like baking cakes too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She makes really good ones.\" Gentle commented while eating her salad. \"You should try some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No cakes for today, we're out of flour.\" Snow said in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! We just stocked two days ago, how come we have no flour?\" Said the pink alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I baked pastries with that flour yesterday but they \"mysteriously\" disappeared overnight.\" Snow looked on accusing glare to Gentle \"I wonder who gobbled them.\" Finished Snow with narrow eyes but Gentle for her part wasn't intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, that's your defense?\" Moonlight snorts and looked at Sunlight in disapproval \"All that sugar is going to make your flanks fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous, you know that my flanks are perfect, unlike you who keeps devouring those moonpies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's a lie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it.\" Gentle said with a smirk after she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two alicorns began to bicker, it was nothing serious other than a friendly banter between siblings while keeping the atmosphere friendly enough. You on the other hand looked at Grace who giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always, they take it after their mothers.\" This declaration made you blink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mothers?\" The Pink Alicorn's eyes wide realizing her mistake but quickly said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. Mothers, We're all cousins rather than siblings but we were all raised together in the same place.\" Loving Grace explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, that makes sense.\" It makes sense on your perspective but-- Why is Dashing Light sighing in relief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lunch, Falling Snow and Loving Grace teleported the dirty dishes and the table away leaving everything as it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. that was nice..\" Gentle says in a content tone. \"Sadly that we didn't have any dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate them all, parasprite.\" Moonlight said in a dry tone. Gentle simply made 'Hush you.' but sighed then her eyes focused on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we're all reunited here, I guess its time to address you on the task that you need to fulfill.\" Gentle said with a serious tone.

The truth is...\" She looks to her sisters for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoving Grace chimes in.<br>\r\n\"The truth is that your semen is quite possibly the most potent substance on the planet. Like an atomic bomb going off in your womb. Fwooosh!\" She gesticulated to make her point.<br>\r\nAll the other mares in the room nod in agreement, with Fallen Snow blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGentle beams with approval.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Grace, I couldn't have put it any better myself. Ahem, yes your sperm is extremely powerful, able to knock up just about any creature including many found in the pony family like kirin, hippogriffs and seaponies. It even works on animals, surprisingly enough! There are huge colonies of cats and dogs that contain your dna, among other animals\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" you breathe, gripping your armchair like a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but your semen is almost guaranteed to take on the first try, whereas a stallion might take a few tries a day at best. It's really a miracle of biology. I wager you humans are so successful at breeding that you must number in the billions,\" Dashing Light exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she's not wrong. \"So, let me get this straight. You want me to go out and keep impregnating ponies that are in heat, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we want is for you to keep being you,\" Moonlight replies, \"and the future will sort itself out eventually. Enjoy life, take it slow and easy, show kindness to others and quench their heat, and we'll look after you and help you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you'd be lying if the idea didn't have appeal, and with these lovely ladies helping you it wouldn't be too bad.<br>\r\nYou nod your head, :Alright you'll do it. For the good of Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of joyful squeals fill the air as the group rushes to hug you. You laugh as your chair nearly tips ove backwards from the furry onslaught. You spend a lot of time just brushing and stroking the ponies before Gentle announces that it's almost time to for you to leave. A lot of tearful heartfelt goodbyes are exchanged with the promise that you'd see them again soon, after which the room begins to grow very hazy and then melts into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The itch was gone just after it appeared the worse and she's been feeling better, satisfied even. If only she could sleep for a few minutes more but she can't, she has job to do, filling in Filthy Rich's office role, When going to his office, she hears the voice of Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon waking up. she frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara was growing and fast. It seems like yesterday that she was just born, sucking her teat for food and now? with a Cutie Mark and on School, tomorrow she'll be graduating and the next day, she'll marry with her own foals as she takes hold of the family's business empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe admits that she's been harsh with her daughter but she did in thinking the best of her but as now? a lot of things changed, She's been hanging around with those Cutie Mark Crusaders aside of Silver Spoon, engaging more with other fillies and colts of her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is genuinely happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiled felt that she has failed somehow. She saw her smile and interact with other ponies before but all because she was tasked to do, taught specifically as she was going to inherit the business, of course, that lead for her to bully other ponies that were deemed \"inferior\" to her. She pushed her to befriend Silver Spoon, her mother was a friend of her and she also hails from a wealthy family as well. She wasn't afraid to admit that it was for her to build connections from a very early age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat friendship was a bit forced but necessary, luckily, it flourished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now? She has much more than Silver Spoon, her behavior has improved, she no longer bullies, fillies were more approachable to her. She was genuinely smiling, happy, bringing in friends to her house. Carefully choosing her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what she had failed? She thought her what she knew and what she needs for the future like any other parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached Filthy's Office. She sighed, maybe she was right and was raising the filly wrong. Filthy Rich was warning her after they started getting reports of Taira's Behavior and now she was believing him to be right all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only wished she had another chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she does not know, is that she was getting her chance with a new life growing inside of her and te the one causing it jumped out of her vulva and used her violet tail as a rope to get to the floor.</span></div></div>",

I'm not a one member species. Of course there are others although we are small in number.

Alicorns can either be born or created by powerful magic, and when they are created they grow set of cock and balls just like a natural alicorn would have. Alicorns are basically rulers over the other ponies by default, so having sex with one would be a great honor, especially if that union were to result in a child.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brow furrows in thought at this revelation, then you come to a realization. \"You said sisters, that means you're going to commit incest.

Indeed, the smell of both male and female arousal was incredibly strong, and a few castle staff passing by couldn't help but get wet as well, sometimes quickly shuffling off to a room so they can go relieve themselves.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt wasn't long until they had reached an door at the far end of the corridor that they both stopped.

I've missed you so much.&gt;<br>\r\nShe dove back in, trying to get into every nook and cranny of the younger's mouth, filling the air with lewd slurping and throaty moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful flap of her wngs she pushed Gentle onto her back, leaving her open for penetration. She embraced her then,with both hooves and wings wrapping atound her daughter's midsection, wanting to get closer and lovingly look her in the eyes as she shot a load into her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;\"How about... mutual penetration?&gt; Celestia whispered. &lt;We both get what we want at the same time, how's that sound?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;*Huff* *Huff*, are you sure mom? I've never done anything like that before.&gt; Gentle Sunlight whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;\"Just relax and follow my lead, and you'll do fine.&gt; Celestia planted a chaste closed mouth kiss on Gentle's lips, arching her back to prepare for the final descent.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She thought her old age had granted her the knowledge and wisdom to run circles around any other pony in the bedroom, but it seemed the even more ancient matriarch still had more secrets to teach.<br>\r\nThe room is filled with the sound of wet slaps and shameless moaning, each of the partners saying the other's the name in hushed, strained whispers.It was so hot inside that the windows on her office door were fogging up.<br>\r\nCelestia's hips moved slowly, giving the overwhelmed younger pony time to acclimate to the sensations wracking her body. She held Gentle close, softly caressing her body and planting kisses on her head, telling her what a good girl she was and whispering sweet nothings in her ear. When Gentle whimpered she would embrace her all the closer. Her insides rippled over her daughter's rod, trying to milk her of her precious seed that Celestia was so hungry for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Celestia began to pick up speed, working herself into a rhythm that Gentle would be comfortable with. Celestia wanted her reputation as a gentle, cuddly lover to persist, after all. Gentle herself, was doing her best to keep up, but was still lagging behind somewhat. It didn't matter to Celestia that she wasn't receiving quite as much pleasure as the other pony, just being this close to her baby more than made up for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGentle felt like she was about to reach a climax. She tried to hold off the best she could but her mother's walls were just too perfectly hot and wet. She was surprised that she hadn't already blown her load, and the secret cargo that waited inside it. \"Mooom, I'm--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, sweetie,\" the elder alicorn replied, \"Just hold on a little bit longer and we'll finish together.\"<br>\r\nCelestia lit up her horn and rapidly stroked the member inside her daughter's pussy. This served to increase Gentle's pleasure further and almost pushed her over the edge. This seemed to work as Celestia felt like she was almost ready to pop. \"Alright, I'm ready,\" she groaned. \"On three... One, twoooo,...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A thick layer of goop coated your eyes, severely impairing your vision. Your hearing was similarly blocked. It was a wonder you could still breathe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lumbered forward blindly, trying and failing to clear your eyes of obstruction. Your foot caught onto something and you helplessly fell forward, only to be caught by something and lifted back onto your feet. A pair of hands that were not your own gently scraped at your soft prison, little by little clearing your eyes until you could finally see properly. What awaited you was a stunning beauty of a face, vaguely equine, looking at you in concern. Her lips moved but no words reached your still covered ears. Her brow furrowed in either frustration or concentration, and you felt the muck heat up and then smoothly fall away, falling into a puddle on the ground. Instantly your gaze began to wander from the equine woman and pass over other things. You were in some kind of busy town square, with groups of similar creatures either obliviously walking to their destinations or standing at a distance, staring at you and whispering among themselves.. <br>\r\nBuildings of varying heights with odd shapes formed the backdrop, with holes with light pouring through them serving as windows.<br>\r\nA hand gently tapped at your cheek, bringing you back to reality.<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey buddy, look at me. Are you alright? Do you need any medical attention? I can get a doctor in here to look you over.\"<br>\r\nYou turned back to the horse-woman and slowly shook your head. <br>\r\nThe pony woman pursed her lips. \"Are you sure you're alright? You just crashed into a building with that jizz wave. You don't look hurt but I think we should get you to the infirmary just in case.\"<br>\r\nYou carefully consider her words. You don't feel physically hurt, but the sudden movement did nauseate you and force you to choke down a hefty amount of alicorn semen...<br>\r\nUltimately you decided that you didn't need any help and told the woman so, curving her mouth into a relieved grin.<br>\r\n\"Well that's a relief. You're in Wombtown, the city inside Princess Celestia' \"princess maker\", heheheh.  My name's Cellestia #36347, but my friends call me Celli.\"<br>\r\nYou tell her your name and she scratches her chin in thought. \"Hmmm, that name sound really familiar, but I can't quite place my finger on it. I might have to consult with the mares upstairs about that. Anyway, it's not often that we get any visitors this far inside the body. In fact, you might be the first in a long, long time.

A couple of them smiled and waved hello at you as you passed. You waved in return and they giggled before hurrying on to their destination.<br>\r\nCelli was in full tour guide mode and was talking nonstop about every little detail she could think of.<br>\r\n\"... and this is the gestation center, the main headquarters of our operation. Here we aid in conception, monitor the health of the unborn foal, and when the time comes, transport the fetus to the loading bay when it's ready to be born.\" Celli explained in a crisp and businesslike manner. \"We have a train that runs eggs in from the ovary and hold it here until fertilization. Before that can happen we must scan the eggs and correct any damage or genetic imbalances that may have occurred during storage.\"<br>\r\nSo they handle all stages of life within the womb. Very, very interesting.<br>\r\n\"So how often does this happen?\" you asked.<br>\r\nShe looked confused. \"What, the egg transport or the fertilization?\"<br>\r\n\"Both, I think.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, let me see...\"<br>\r\nCelli scratched under her chin thoughtfully. \"The eggs come in about three or four times per year, depending on the length of the solar day, anf then when that time is up we send them back into storage to be recycled. As far as I can tell an egg has only ever been fertilized once in Celestia's entire lifetime, so as you can imagine we have to send a lot of eggs back, sadly.\"<br>\r\nHer ears drooped a bit as she continued. \"Even so, there's always a chance the day will come when we're needed so we maintain a constant vigil until it happens. Such is that of the life of an immortal uterine cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds like a tough and thankless job. Clearly these uterine cells were extremely hard workers deserving of more respect.<br>\r\nCelli just sighed and shrugged her shoulders, before putting on a practiced smile.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, the next stop on the tour is where the fetus would be held, and I think you'll be quite impressed by what you'll find there. Now,  if you'll just follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her loins burned and itched, driven by a biological need to mate and procreate, and every time she sat down she would get a sharp reminder of that fact, and it was driving her crazy.<br>\r\nIf only her husband hadn't taken that stupid business trip all the way out to the Griffon lands to find new investors for the company. Had he been here she would've pulled him into the bedroom, locked the door and engaged in nonstop rutting until she produced a second child, <br>\r\nSpoiled growled in frustration. Screw the griffons, she needed him now! <br>\r\nSpoiled Rich tiredly entered her room and closed the door, then proceeded to climb into bed and nestle in between the sheets.<br>\r\nShe was leaking everywhere and making a mess, but she didn't really care about that right now.. Let some servant take care of it, that's what she what she payed them for, didn't she?<br>\r\nHer breath came out in a deep huff, and groaned and turned about in the bed as she felt her snatch pulse and twitch in want, and her clit continuously throbbing and peeking out of its hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what is she going to do now?</span></div></div>",
