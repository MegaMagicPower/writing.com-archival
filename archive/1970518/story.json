Camp chop had received great reviews, and all of you were in love with the idea of NBM 100%!  You had come across some people in the nearby hick town on your way to the cabin.  One crazy old man gave you a cryptic warning.  He told you the legend of the Headhunter, a voodoo wizard who steals the heads of young women for use in his spells!  He used a magic knife to capture his victims alive, one that cut without killing.  The old man said he currently needed the souls of four young women (how convenient!) and told you to head back the way you came.<br>\r\nYour thoughts buzzed as you presumptively tried to place which would be friends and which would be foe.  You all made some light chit chat as you unpacked your bags, acting completely oblivious to the fact that a sexy head hunter was coming to play this game of cat and mice with you!  You were about to jump out of your skin with excitement as the minutes ticked down to zero hour, getting wet at just the thought of being hunted like this, at possibly becoming a trophy, or even winning!  Now, who are you?</span></div></div>",

You had saved up for a while to get a chance to come here with your friends and now you were so pumped!  You were fantasizing heavily as you stood under the warm water of the shower, thinking about all of the possibilities of this trip.  You imagined you and your friends losing pieces slowly, one by one, having to take care of each other and compensate for your newly missing parts.  You imagined stealing the fallen parts of your friends, or even their whole bodies!  You imagined being in control of them, having them helpless and maybe a bit limbless before you as you got to have your way with them however you wanted.  You even imagined finding the hidden blade, and getting to use its power as you saw fit!  It was seriously hot just thinking about it!<br>\r\nThen you started thinking about the headhunter, and getting caught by him.  You imagined being fucked like you never had before, in pieces!  You'd get to try so many new positions, styles, and places, it was like a whole new world of sexual possibilities, just a few minutes away!  You watched the clock on the bathroom wall tick away the last of your safe time, smiling as you scrubbed yourself down again.  You were plenty clean a while ago, you just knew that by staying in the shower the whole time you might throw one of the other girls off if their game and make them easier bait for the headhunter, giving you more pieces to play with!<br>\r\nYou actually did have a plan for winning, though it was just a crapshoot and you didn't care if it succeeded.  It basically involved distracting the headhunter with fucking, then quickly cutting his head off and plopping your own head onto his body.  It was somewhat vague, but you're sure that it would elaborate when the time came.<br>\r\nThe last seconds ticked away and the game officially started, it was then that you turned off the water and stepped out of the shower.  You looked at your naked body in the fogged mirror, all wet and sexy.  You weren't really the most drop dead gorgeous woman alive, but you're sexy where it counted and that's what mattered, and all of the newly wheelchair bound guys (and some girls) would agree that you were no slouch under the covers!  You wrapped yourself loosely in a towel around your waist like a man (you grew up with three step brothers and a hippie mom, you were never told how to cover yourself like a lady and your brothers never complained, or your step dad for that matter!)  and you were about to just leave the bathroom when something caught your attention.</span></div></div>",

Walking over slowly, you reach out your hand and wipe away some of the condensation distorting your view.  You peer out into the dark woods, the last fleeting rays of the sun partially illuminating the sparsely wooded forest outside.  You survey the area and see that there is indeed a person out there!

He is bent over in a position like he's ready to pounce, pointing his naked body directly at the cabin.  Both of you occasionally broke eye contact to admire each other's naked anatomy, but neither looked away from the other.  He was watching, waiting expectantly to see what you would do about seeing him on the prowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually was a rather tough decision for you.  On the one hand alerting your friends would offer all of you the best chance of survival, as you'd have more time to escape, which would give you more time with your buddies and a better chance at winning in all probability.  On the other hand... maybe a deal could be made?  If you helped the headhunter you could last the longest, could play with some of your friends most valuable parts, and if you were able to lull him into a false sense of security you might even be able to pull off a surprise victory!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You motion for him to to come to the window, maybe you can broker a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headhunter stands firm, unmoving, still staring you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that the best way to deal with this stubbornness is to approach him.  You climb out of the window, re-adjust the towel so it doesn't fall off, and approach the man.  \"Hey!  I want to make a deal.\" you say as you get within arms reach of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headhunter finally moves, puts his finger to his lips in a motion for you to be silent.  You comply, judging by his size and apparent strength, you know you are under his will, like it or not.  \"Its going to cost you\" he says in a low, batman like voice.  It was almost too fast to comprehend what he did next; with two quick swipes of his blade he severes your arms at the shoulder, you feel them run down your side, knock off the towel and fall on the leafy wet ground beneath you with the towel that was your only protection land on top of them.  The suddenness and weirdness of the moment made you let out a short shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the headhunter motions you to be quiet.  He then inspects his handiwork, running his hand over your empty shoulders, across the side of your breast where your hair was dangling, then around to your back where he gently pushes in a way to turn you around.  You oblige and do a full 180 so now you are facing the stump.  The pressure he applies to your back changes direction to infer you should bend over.  You think you know now what he meant by cost as you lean over slowly (you no longer have arms to stop a fall) and rest your perky breasts on the stump with you legs spread and ass in the air.  You were horny, wet and ...... oh my.......he is HUGE!  You feel him enter you in a not so gentle motion.  Its ok, you like it rough.  He places his hands on your hips, fills the entirety of your pussy, and then starts pumping himself in and out of you.  You want to moan and cry out but you force yourself to be quiet so you don't alert your friends.  Out of reaction you try to reach your arms up to get your hair out of your face, only to feel leaves and dirt.  You remember your predicament but you don't care, it feels so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes are closed and in mid-orgasm when you feel him grab you by the hair, it feels so good to have it rough like this from behind.  Then another feeling hits you, felt like your arms did when you lost them earlier, but this time in your neck.  By the time you open your eyes you no longer see the wood of the stump, instead you see your back.  As you realize you are the headhunter's first victim you feel him cum inside you.  While you are careful not to move (you don't want to fall down since you are disoriented) your head is grasped by both his hands, tilted down so you can witness his incredible shaft pulled out of you.  You can't help to realize how sexy you look, bent over, naked, armless, headless and dripping cum out your pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headhunter throws your head under his arm, grasps your breasts from behind, and helps you stand up.  You slowly turn around and have your body take a seat on the stump while looking at it waist level.  Man you were gorgeous, but then you think about Tanya.  If you were this hot missing parts, Tanya would be something else!  You didn't care about the other girls, Tanya was the sexiest.  You had to get Tanya and yourself in a shared detached experience, and if that meant the headhunter too, so be it, you swing both ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" says the headhunter turning your head to look at him \"you paid the cost.  You get to be assembled, disassembled, and/or fucked however you please.  All you need to do to keep this privilege is to help me hunt the rest of the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" You whisper \"I'll help you get all the other girls, but could you leave Tanya for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll still eventually need her head, but I can let you two have fun for a little bit.\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"  you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head hunter puts your head back on your neck and attaches your arms back to where they belong.  \"You are going to need all your parts to have fun with the other girls.\" he smiles.  Then all of a sudden he jumps and thrusts his blade deep into your ribcage, between your breasts.  He looks closely into your startled face and says \"You will not turn against me; you will help me in any way I want.\"  Just as quickly he retracts the blade, but there is a blue glow emanating from where it was.  The hole quickly healed and when it did your whole naked body gave off a blue aura of magic for a split second, then faded.  All of a sudden though, you had a new purpose in life.  You existed to serve this man, help him get the naughty girls, and do whatever he wants....weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which way is best to get you to your friend Tanya?  We will do her next.  Front door or through the window you came?\" the headhunter asks.</span></div></div>",

He comes running to the porch and you let him in. He looked no older than 16. And kinda cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out there kid? Its almost time for the head hunter to arrive! Who are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy caught his breath and finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Mitchell. I was camping by myself when I heard about this camp so I decided to come out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're kinda cute so you can hang around me kid.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I was hoping that the headhunter would chop up some girls and-\" Mitchell quickly stopped himself when he realized he was thinking out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" This boy might have something that I could use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind its nothing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull him into a hug with his head between your breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell me you little perv. What were you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to get free and the sensations felt good. You finally let go so he could speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed faced he spoke. \"I was hoping to get cut in half so I could re-attach a girls lower half to mine. I know, I'm a perv!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kid wasn't that bad besides you always wondered what it was like to have a manhood. You were getting wet just thinking about it. So you replied with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I've got a plan. If I get myself cut in half I'll swap with you. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that sounds excellent.\" You both turn around and see the headhunter standing in the doorway. Before both of you could scream he cut both your heads off. Right when he was about to collect your head Tanya screamed outside causing the headhunter to go after her. You lookover at Mitchell's decapitated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry Mitchell, this will have to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you placed your head on Mitchell's body. You got up and flexed your arms. This was turning you on because you could see yourself getting a growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. I need a body here!\" Mitchell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" You place his head on your body and watch him feel up his breasts and moan and grow weak in his legs as he felt his new pussy through the bikini.</span></div></div>",

Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you run from the cabin and into the woods, heading in the opposite direction of where Tanya ran off from. You felt your male legs traverse the terrain more easily than your less well muscled old legs would've allowing you to cruise along at a steady clip. It was weird to run with a package between your legs now, though luckily (or unluckily) it wasn't a monster, six inches though a rather nice girth to it. One downside though was your heart. Your old one had picked up a TON of mileage due to how often you had to put it into overdrive so it could pretty much keep up no matter how hard you pushed our body. This heart on the other hand seemed to lack that experience, and was having a hard time with all of this running.

Mitchell nodded and the two of you proceeded to the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw open the door, revealing a very basic interior with only two rooms. Before you there was a living room, populated with a single bed and some chairs, behind it was a kitchen with a metal stove and some outdated looking utensils. \"Not much of a home, but it'll work for now. Lock the door, I'll see if I can find anything useful.\" You tell Mitchell. He nods his head and does what you asked, locking the door behind the two of you before sitting on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search but find nothing of use. There aren't any hidden items of value, and while the knives would be helpful if this were a real life or death scenario it would be absolutely insane to pull a real weapon on a guy who you knew for a fact was just a paid actor/sex worker, so you ignored them.

He's mad I tell you! He runs around with this magic knife that he uses to chop peoples heads off. He keeps most of them as trophies or something I think, I'm not really sure. Sometimes he takes bodies instead though, that's what happened to me. Say, maybe you could help me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you?! That this headhunter guy sounds like bad news. I'm taking my friends and getting out of here as soon as possible!\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please, you have to help! I need my body back, I can't go on living as just a head!\" Amy pleaded, her acting seeming just a little too real for your liking. It had to be an act though, right? The headhunter didn't really keep the heads of the girls he caught did he? No, of course he didn't, it was all just part of the adventure. Sill, Judging by her appearance, Amy looked to have been trapped in that hole for a very long time. Maybe you should question her a bit further? On the other hand, Seeing just what Amy's willing to offer you in return for your aid sounds like it could be far more interesting, as, being just a head, you can only think of one thing she has to offer.</span></div></div>",

Like, eight times in a row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was first to five!\"  Tanya retorted defensively.  \"And don't talk like you could do any better, she's like a freaking rock-paper-scissors psychic!  I swear, if she took me up on my offer to arm wrestle for the next shower I would've totally owned her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane smirked and gave an agreeing but condescending \"Mm-hmm.\"  Tanya huffed but didn't continue the argument, instead peering over the corner of the magazine to see what Jane was reading.  Jane gave a subtle wink with the eye facing away from Tanya, causing you to smile and wink back.  It was just like Jane, you started a fight and she was right there to draw the heat away from you and onto herself before defusing the situation.  For all your scheming and Ramona's planning Jane wasn't exactly a slouch in the brains department either.  You'd have to keep that in mind while you plotted your moves.

It seemed like the perfect thing to wear with a sexy Headhunter on the prowl.  Then again, you kind of liked the 'topless and wet with an easily dropped towel' look you were rocking right now.  Why tease sex with words when you could use the very flesh you were offering instead?  Besides, if you were going to compete for the Headhunter's attention against Ramona's big boobs, Tanya's tight butt, and Jane's curvaceous hips and thighs you'd have your work cut out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could come to a decision on how much or how little to wear however you hear the shower shut off and the bathroom door opening.

I hope you saved some energy for the rest of the evening.\"  You said, observing your sweat soaked friend as she gulped down half a thermos of ice water in a single pull.  While you'd been showering for the last half hour, it seemed as though Tanya had spent every minute of it sprinting on the rickety old treadmill the four of you had unearthed in the basement while 'just looking around' (and certainly not looking for the other blade, because that would be meta-gaming!)  Her thin and slightly too tight workout clothes had been all but rendered transparent, though to your slight surprise and disappointment Tanya was wearing a full set of undergarments beneath them.  You suppose that, assuming the Head Hunter was watching them through hidden cameras or something, she wanted to tease him a little more subtly than you were.  You had no idea why, this was a fetish retreat after all and you'd all paid a lot of money to cut loose here, but whatever floated her boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding me?  I'm fresh as ever!\"  Tanya flexing her bicep and smirking.  Her smile faltered when she caught a whiff of her own pit stench, but she recovered well enough.  \"Trust me, I can go the distance tonight.  Just need a quick little soak to cool off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you take cold showers?  That's convenient, because I used up all the hot water.\"  You said, motioning toward the nearly impenetrable haze of steam behind you.  Tanya rolled her eyes and playfully punched you in the bicep, nearly throwing you off your feet.  While you'd certainly been hit harder, hell you'd asked people to hit you harder than that, you couldn't help but rub the spot sorely as Tanya stepped past you, scooting you into the hall and closing the door behind you.  You frown, realizing you'd missed your opportunity to ask if Tanya wanted any company.  Oh well, the night was young and the opportunities for sexual misadventure were abundant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your room, and by extension your clothes, was directly to your right on the second floor, you decided to wait a few minutes more before you got dressed.  The early bird got the worm, as it were, and if the Head Hunter were ballsy enough to strike within the first few minutes of the game then why not reward his worm with... wait, reward the bird with a naked worm... uh... whatever.  You knew what you were trying to think.  Strutting downstairs in nothing but your towel, you saw Jane and Ramona together in the living room, the former staring out a window into the cold, dark, ominous woods, and the later hunched over a table with some sort of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\"  You asked, pointing to the scroll looking thing Ramona was studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it!\"  Ramona said, swatting away your damp finger.  Several drops of lemon scented water (not the scent you would've chosen for your soap, but that's what was provided) had already landed on the scroll thing, though it didn't look like any real damage had been caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, touchy much?\"  You asked, rubbing your hand and frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're touchy!  Don't touchy!\"  Ramona said, waving a hand to shoo you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it personally.\"  Jane said, not looking away from her window.  \"She found some old parchment with cryptic shit written all over and now she's convinced it's a pirate treasure map.  Spent the last fifteen minutes staring at it.  Won't let me or Tanya help, says we'd just distract her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, do you know Latin?  Because last time I asked you didn't and neither did Tanya.\"  Ramona demanded.  \"And I never said it was pirate treasure!  All I said was that I think the painting has a map hidden in it, and the Latin on the back is some kind of riddle that could decipher the map.\"  She flipped the parchment over, revealing the painting that had been previously hanging over the fireplace.  It looked to just be a bowl of fruit, some oranges and melons, however the longer you looked at it, the more it looked... wrong.  The fruit was arranged in a weird layout, the bowl had many strangely shaped cracks and floral patterns in it, and a lot of the outlines bled into one another in a very suspicious way that drew the eye to certain seemingly inconsequential spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you just want all the doubloons to yourself.\"  Jane joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush!  I need to focus.\"  Ramona said, not bothering to disagree with Jane's assertion as she flipped the painting back over and continued to analyze the writing on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were pretty sure you knew exactly what treasure the map led to, and knew that Jane was also probably sure about what lay at its end, you didn't want to break character quite yet.  Speaking of characters, you were really hoping that Ramona was just playing the stock bitchy smart girl for this game, and that she hadn't turned into an actual bitchy smart girl mere minutes into this retreat.  You knew she could be a bit anal about details and planning things, but this was supposed to be a fun game with friends (soon to be friends with benefits).  There was no need for her to be so up tight and rude.  Plus, you did know Latin!  And she didn't even bother to ask you!  She knew you went to college too, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath to relax, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

You worked the bag up and down, your fists knocking it back and forth forcefully.  You knew you probably wouldn't get the chance to take shots at the headhunter like this.  Of all the groups ever only one has won the game, and they were a posse of twelve gals.  The four of you were a lot fewer in number.  Still, with a planner like Ramona, an Amazon like Jane, and with your own Strength you still held out hope that you could maybe pull this off.  You didn't really care either way though, at least that's what you told yourself.  This whole thing was about experiencing your weird dismemberment fetish first hand, winning or losing wasn't EVERYTHING... Still though, maybe you could pull it off.<br>\r\nYour real threat (apart from the headhunter himself) was Linda.  She made jokes along the way up here about wanting to meet the man personally, and how she would love to help him.  You want to think she was joking, but knowing that little skank you wouldn't put it past her.<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour on the bag you walk upstairs panting.  You pass both Jane and Ramona who are doing there own business.  You reach the restroom on the highest floor, but you can hear Linda is currently using it.  \"Ugh, come on Linda!

It takes you little time to cover the distance between you two, and soon enough you are actually jogging ahead of her, trying to find a suitable place to go.  After about five minutes you spot something.  \"Hey Linda, let's head over to that second cabin.\"  You say, pointing one of your stumps at what was indeed a small wooden cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't he be expecting us there?\"  Linda panted, out of breath despite the rather short run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I don't plan on staying, I just want to get some supplies and maybe some sleeping bags.  We ran out on such short notice that we're a little empty handed... no pun intended.\"  You declare.  It takes you little time to reach the cabin, but you have to wait about a minute for Linda to catch up, as you can't work the doorknob with your stumps.  When Linda opens the door you both enter the cabin.  It's rather quaint, just four rooms made up of a bedroom, a living room/kitchen, a heater room, and a bathroom.  You are about to begin scrounging when Linda speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe locks the door to the cabin and looks you dead in the eyes.  You see a devilish expression spread over her face.  \"Tanya... would you like a little present?\"  She asked with a hint of menace.  You are about to ask what she meant when she reaches into her purse and pulled something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt it before you saw it, her fingers wrapping around your palms as she withdrew your detached hands from her purse.  \"Your hands held onto my hair as we ran away.  I guess you were so full of adrenaline that you didn't remember to let go.  I put them in here as we ran away.\"  She informed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome!  Give them back and we can carry twice as much!\"  You say, extending your stumps out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh!  Not so fast!\"  She said, putting your hands back in her purse and zipping it shut.  \"I saved your bacon by getting these, so you're going to have to earn them back!\"  She said lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saved your neck!  Literally!\"  You protest, taking a step forward.  Linda shoves you backwards with surprising force for her size, making you land on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I wanted to be saved?  You're going to have to earn your hands back and I'm not letting you have then until I'm FULLY satisfied, so why not make this quick?\"  Linda said in a dominating tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think it over you can't stop yourself from smiling.  \"You bitch.\"  You say playfully, beginning to get into this.  Linda had a reputation amongst people as secretly being a major dom in private, and you rarely had anyone tame you.  Being helpless like this with a person like her gave you a rare opportunity.  Why not enjoy it?  You know that if you actually didn't want to she wouldn't force you into anything (though she would probably still keep your hands and wait for them to get numb...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, keep saying that, you're only making me want to give your hands back less.\"  She said plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I will.

You come to rest in a small clearing near the lake, the fading sun reflecting off the lake and illuminating the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What...

I'm happy to learn!\"  She begins kissing Ramona's sole, making her giggle loudly.

You toss Jane Linda's head and tell her to have fun while pulling Jane's shorts down.  Jane begins making out with Linda, while you begin eating Jane out.  She tastes amazing, and the position of power you are in is satisfying.  You were satisfying, and you loved being the one to bring Jane to her long awaited release.  Out of the corner of your eye you see that Ramona has gotten behind Jane and slid her arms beneath the larger woman's shaking limbs, and was squeezing and tweaking her nipples forcefully while her own huge warm rack sat atop Jane's burning hot scalp<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nUnder your combined assault Jane cums, her hot pent up squirt amplifying the already wonderful taste in your mouth as you lick up every drop.

Probably a little better than fine!  Guess what I found?\"  She called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane moves past you and reaches in, having the longest arms of the three of you.

What is it?\"  Ramona asks, trying to get a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane pulls her hand out and you all gasp.  Clutched in her palm is the second blade!  \"Wow, I didn't expect that!\"  You exclaim, examining the small ornate weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome!\"  You hear Linda call from inside the fox hole, then adding \"You can repay me by getting me out of here!\"<br>\r\nJane hands Ramona the blade and reaches deeper into the hole.  \"I think I've got you.\" She says, pulling her arm back out.

After a few seconds she gives a short \"Aha!\" And withdraws her arm, along with Linda's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw!  My hair!  The stupid blade must've cut it all off!\"  Linda shouted, catching sight of the hairy wad you were holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think a little more than that was cut off...\"  Jane said, looking at the top of Linda's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, captain cryptic, mind telling me what you mean?\"  Linda snarkily responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda, your whole scalp just got cut off.

We have no idea what kind of damage that could do!\"  Ramona cautioned \"and your last brilliant plan got you thrown down a hole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My last brilliant plan got us the second blade!\"  Linda responded \"besides, I'm sure that if I can get friggin' DECAPITATED and suffer no ill effects then the blade is safe enough to do this!\"  She reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane seemed to agree, as the next thing she did was reach in and pull Linda's squishy pink brain out of her skull.  She held it in front of her, allowing Linda to look over every crease of it.  \"This. Is. AWESOME!  I'm literally looking at my entire collective consciousness!

This little pink orb made up of squishy wrinkled meat was all that you are.  Your thoughts, hopes, dreams, personality, memories, soul, now held in the palm of your hands.  You get the strong urge to prod it with your finger, finding that your thoughts remained perfectly clear despite your digging though you weren't sure if that was the magic or the nature of the brain.  \"This is.. this is heavy.\"  Was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane approached you, holding Linda's beaming hollowed out head under her left arm and her brain in the right.  \"Well, see you again soon.\"  She said, handing you Linda's brain.

You all follow her gaze to a deer that has wandered into the same clearing as you. Judging by the antlers, you'd have to say it's a male. Judging by the huge sack hanging between its rear legs, -very- male. Linda grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That body. Put me in that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona raises an eyebrow. \"Are you -sure-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'm sure! Now quick, before you scare it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding Linda's brain off to you, Jane creeps up on the deer, holding Linda's head in one hand, and the blade in the other. Linda decides to talk to the deer in a soothing voice while Jane cautiously walks up to the suddenly alert creature. \"Shhhhhhh... It's alright. Just stay right there... Don't move...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stag flicks his ears a bit, before taking a cautious step towards Jane! You and Romana gape. You can't believe this is actually working. Linda giggles as the deer bends his neck forward and licks her nose. \"Heee, st-stop! That tickles~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the deer is distracted, Jane carefully raises the blade up and slices it through the top of his head. Unfortunately, his skullcap falling off alerts the deer that something is wrong, and he bounds away as it hits the ground. As he does so however, his brain lands in the clearing in the middle of all of you. \"Quick!\" Linda exclaims. \"Put his brain in my head before his body gets too far away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape for a moment, before catching on to Linda's plan. Scooping up the tiny deer brain, you sprint over to Jane and drop the animal's mind into Linda's empty head. As soon as you do so, there's a crash off in the direction the deer tried to flee in. Simultaneously, Linda's head blinks as the stag brain takes over. She (or he?) starts babbling fearfully, though there's nothing intelligible. You and Jane hand the head and Linda's brain over to Ramona to retrieve the now brainless deer. After several minutes, you manage to drag it back to camp. Now what?</span></div></div>",

Linda wants to try out Jane's body, while Jane thinks it'd be hilarious to put the dumbest brain in the head of the smartest person, I.E. Ramona. Romana isn't exactly fond of that idea, while Linda objects to being called the dumbest brain in your group, insisting that dubious honor belongs to Jane. As the three of them bicker, an idea pops into your head. You've already proven that the blade is brain safe, right? So, what if you used it to split Linda's brain up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, guys, hold it! I've got it! What if we each take part of her brain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane tilts her head at you. \"What, like, cut it into thirds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda gasps. \"Oh my god I love that idea! I can be skullmates with all three of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gets a laugh out of everyone present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona chuckles and shakes her head. \"Alright, alright, so, who gets which part of her brain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda hums in thought. \"Well, I think I read somewhere that the left brain is the logical side. Jane can have that part! maybe it'll make her smarter!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane sticks her tongue out at Linda. \"More likely it'll make me dumber, but sure, I'll take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda grins and looks over at Ramona. \"And the right brain is more creative! Ramona could probably use a little more creativity in her life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona snorts. \"A, I object to the idea that I'm less creative than you. B, that's not -really- how it works. But sure, I don't mind taking your right half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda grins. \"Great! Sorry Tanya, but I guess this leaves you with my cerebellum. Not too exciting I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"I don't mind. I just wanna see what happens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that having been said, the three of you with bodies sit down in a circle, with Jane holding Linda in her lap. You take Linda's brain from her and cut it into three parts; the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere, and the cerebellum. You then have Jane and Ramona lean over so you can scoop their brains out with the blade, before doing the same to your own. Arranging all three on the ground, you first take Ramona's. Cutting off the right half, you stick Linda's on in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Linda. \"How was that? Feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to nod. \"Y-yeah. I gotta say, it feels weird suddenly having only half a brain. Like, I could -feel- half of my mind just... vanish, when you did that.\" She grins. \"What about you Ramona. How're you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona rubs the side of her head. \"It's really weird... I could feel myself get dumber when you got stuck onto me.\" Linda cackles at that, as Ramona grins and continues. \"But seriously, it's super strange. I can feel you in here, talking my ear off. Metaphorically.\" She taps the side of her empty head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane sniggers. \"Now I -know- you've got part of yourself replaced with Linda. Otherwise you'd know you're actually in -here-.\" She playfully pokes a finger into Ramona's half of the combined brain, causing her to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \"Great. In that case I'm gonna move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand Ramona's brain back to her. She examines the lopsided organ for a moment, before plopping it into her head. Taking Jane's brain, this time you slice off the left hemisphere. You set it aside on the ground next to chunk of greymatter you carved off of Ramona's brain, then pick up the corresponding piece of Linda's. Squishing it onto what's left of Jane's brain, Linda's head goes almost completely slack, and you hand the combined organ over to Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling? Everything okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane giggles as she takes her fused brain from you. \"Hahah, yeah, I'm alright. Linda and I both feel a lot dumber being one brain, but neither of us can agree who's dragging whose mind down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ramona laugh at this, before you take your brain up. Hesitating for a moment, you carve the cerebellum off the back of your brain, replacing it with the one from Linda's. Unlike Ramona and Jane, you don't feel immediately different mentally. However, by concentrating, you realize that you feel a lot clumsier than before. Also possibly a bit more grabby, but it's hard to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona grins. \"Okay, cool! We've divided Linda up among ourselves. What do we do with the parts she displaced in our heads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a good point. What DO you do with the leftover lobes?</span></div></div>",

What sort of modifications?\" you ask, but Linda doesn't answer you, instead she attacks her former body with the blade, hacking off the arms just above the elbow and the legs a few inches above the knee, leaving it limbless except for four short stumps of more or less equal length, then grabbing your head and attaching it to the near limbless torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think of your new body my pet?\" Linda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an improvement over being just a head I guess, but not much of one.

Due to the swiftness of her movements, the slipperiness of the floor, and the fact that you were viewing all of this from an unfamiliar vantage point you feel hard onto your ass, \"What the hell Linda, I could've been hurt!\"  You complain, though in all honesty her roughhousing was already getting you excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\"  Linda responded insincerely \"I can get a little bit too physical when I'm in the mood.  I hope you don't mind too much.\"  Her legs unraveled themselves and straddled your thighs shortly before her arms released your chest.  With one hand she shoved you forcefully onto your back, with you only half way allowing her to do so.  She then reached down and held both of your hands in place above where your head once resided, her powerful grip both a surprise and a turn on.  Linda began grinding against you, her lower lips rubbing against yours in slow yet powerful drags.  Her chest was pressed into the bottom of your own, her shorter body topping you like one twice it's size.  You could stop her, you could take the lead, but in all honest you didn't want to.  She knew what she was doing, she knew what she wanted, and by yielding to her you were feeling just how good she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe changed her grip and held both of your hands together over where your head had been with just her right hand, a hold that while simple enough to escape freed up a hand that you sincerely wanted to feel on your more sensitive flesh.  She brought it down ever so slightly and began rubbing the empty pink expanses of your shoulders, her fingers applying just enough pressure to make you satisfied yet still want more.  From there she traced down the center of your upper chest, down your sternum, lifting herself off of you slightly to give herself greater access to you.  She rolled her fingers forcefully over your left breast, sliding your nipple between two of her fingers and shaking it roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched from a distance, a bystander in your own fucking, as she drew her hand lower, down past your stomach where she teasingly scraped her short nails across your flesh causing you to squirm, down beyond your navel where she stopped momentarily just to get a rise from you.  \"Care to continue?  You look a little tense.\"  She joked.  She could see you out of the corner of her eye and saw just how flustered you were.  You did not even realize you were biting your lip or when you had started, but now saliva drenched your lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\"  You commanded, wanting more than anything else to feel what she could do to you down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the magic word?\"  She asked tauntingly, dragging out your release as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please fucking do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\"  She chirps, and with that she plunged two fingers into you with the swiftness of a cheetah, her thumb rolling over your clitoris and her last two fingers wiggling back and forth to stimulate your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely lasted four minutes.  Not four minutes until your first orgasm mind you, but for minutes before you had to ask her to stop.  You came four times, approximately once a minute as she bounced up and down on you.  By the end of it you were incredibly light headed, every drop of blood pooling (somehow?)  into your body, into your lower body more specifically.  You could barely breath, but in between ragged breaths you managed to say \"Thank.... you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda responded in a puzzling manner.  \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no more energy for words, and could produce only the questioning sound \"Uh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda then says...</span></div></div>",

You unpacked your stuff and put it all into the drawer in your room of the cabin, but left a spare set of clothes, a water bottle, some food, and your map in a small backpack by the door for when he comes knocking.

You idiot, you'll get yourself killed!\" I screamed after her, but of course, no one was listening, as the next thing I heard was Jane yell \"Hey, wait for me, attempting to rush out after her friend, but I was closer to Jane than I had been to Tanya, allowing me to grab her before she could rush go rushing off and wind up stumbling around in the dark with Tanya, another easy target for the head hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, stop, you can't go out there! that's just what the head hunter wants!\" I said, trying once more to reason with her, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramona, what if that was you out there?

And I'm coming with you!\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Jane has been making plans of her own however, as she says \"No, one of us needs to stay here in case Linda comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And be here all alone when the head hunter comes calling? I don't think so!\" you disagree, pulling out a pair of flashlights and tossing one to Jane before shouldering your pack of survival gear. Then, turning back towards the other girl, you ask \"Well, are you coming or what? If we're going to do this, we need to get moving as soon as possible, so as to maximize our chances of saving at least one of the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, you're right of course.\" Jane agreed, quickly shouldering her own pack before flicking on her own flashlight and heading out the door after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready knowing that Linda's fate was most likely sealed the moment she left the cabin, you still believe there might be a chance to save Tanya at least, but not if you and Jane end up falling victim to the head hunter yourselves. For that reason, you've already considered a couple of different routes that might allow you to reach the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first route is the most obvious of course, straight down the well maintained trail made for just that purpose. It's certainly the easier of the options you've come up with, but it's also a near certainty it's what the head hunter expects you to do, so he's most likely waiting in ambush somewhere ahead if he's not still busy with Linda and Tanya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other path, making your way through the forest, is less obvious, but also more dangerous, for reasons that have noting to do with the head hunter, although that threat is still present as well. No, the real danger comes from the possibility of getting lost, stumbling over a loose rock, tree root, or uneven piece of ground and breaking a leg or twisting an ankle, or even running across some sort of dangerous wild beast, such as a bear, wolf, or wild hog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment of thought, you decide to take the path, as though it puts you at greater risk of running into the head hunter, the simple fact of the matter is, that particular danger pales in comparison to the others, since those are real dangers, with real consequences, and, however real it seems, and however much you'd like to win, the contest between the four of you and the head hunter is, ultimately, just a game, with little or no real danger to any of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling as quickly as you're able, aided greatly by the beams of your flash lights, though you know they also make you an easier target for the head hunter, the two of you head down the forest path towards the lake, listening and searching for any signs of Linda, Tanya, or the head hunter. Rounding a bend in the trail, you manage to spot the lake off ahead of you in the distance. You do not, however, immediately spot any signs of anyone else. You and Jane look at each other for a moment, both of you knowing this most likely a trap of some sort, but then then you both nod and press forward, knowing you have no choice if you want to find and help your friends.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Tanya bursts through the brush, the headhunter in hot pursuit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET'S GO!\" Tanya shouts, sprinting past you as the headhunter gained on the pack of you. You are quick to begin following as is Jane. You glance at Tanya and see that the headhunter got a good jump on her. Her tight work out shirt has been slashed to bits, deep skin covered gashes run across her chest, and most shockingly her left arm has been chopped off just below the shoulder, leaving only a two inch stump that wiggled as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back and see the headhunter is only a few feet away! You try to look back at where you are running, but you can't look away. Despite your best logical reasoning, and despite your need for survival, the man behind you was practically entrancing. His muscular body, his black and white war paint, his devilish smile, and you're embarrassed to admit it but his engorged penis pointing right at the pack of you. You look him right in his powerful, demanding eyes and nearly stop running. Tanya and Jane grab your arms and pull you along, bringing you back to your senses. All of you run for a little while longer, but you aren't built like the rest of them. Your big boobs weren't for running and that plump belly you liked as a cushion also slowed you down. You were running out of steam fast, panting for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to tell them to leave you behind, to save both of themselves since they are the stronger members and could come back later to save you. Then Tanya lets go. Tanya is fast, she's strong, and she's been in her fair share of brawls (mostly when guys try and get a three way out of her and the girlfriend she's experimenting with, but there have been other reasons). You watch as Tanya drops your arm, turns at incredible speed and throws her arm out like a lightning bolt. She slams her fist directly into his gut, knocking the wind out of him as he coughed in surprise. He dropped to his knees, gasping as he clutched his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya grabs your arm and all of three of you try and put as much distance between you and the headhunter as you could. After another fifteen minutes the three of you reach the cabin again. You drop down and wheeze hard, your lungs burning like fire as you try to get some air back into you and stop the room from spinning. Your sweating bad, though your still whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya... what... what happened? Where... where's... Linda!\" You cough out, trying to stand despite the tilting of the world. Jane is trying to barricade the door though she clearly needed some help positioning the board properly for maximum efficiency. Meanwhile Tanya was closing the gashes in her body and breasts by squeezing the skin shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda-\"</span></div></div>",

We shouldn't be separated for long periods of time. Call out if anything is suspicious.\" You answer. Tanya heads up the stairs while you get up and help Jane. She might be the bravest of the four of you, and probably the strongest, but she clearly wasn't used to working with these kinds of tools. She positioned the boards awkwardly and nailed them in poorly. You on the other hand were the captain of the college engineering team, and had taken woodworking classes since grade school. \"Here, let me help you with that.\" You say, repositioning Jane's hands to support the weight of the wood while you took the hammer and nails for yourself. You worked for about ten minutes, and by the time you were done, the door was sealed tighter than Fort Knox. You and Jane repositioned some of the furniture to cover the windows effectively. A whole fifteen minutes had passed and it was then that you realized that Tanya still hadn't come down yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jane exchange a look that says you were both thinking the same thing. \"Tanya!

Judging by the angry look she's giving you, it seems she might be considering the latter, but before she can make up her mind, you quickly whisper \"Wait a minute Jane, this is most likely a trap set by the head hunter, and Linda's the bait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but we can't just leave her laying there like that can, we have to do something!\" Jane hissed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly formulating a plan, though not one of your best ones you feel, since it requires you putting yourself in danger, you explain \"And we will. Or rather, I will. I want you to stay here. That way, if anything happens, you'll be in the best position to do something about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you can't be the one to stay here? I mean, if it comes down to a fight or flee scenario, I'd stand a better chance against the head hunter than you would. Uh, no offense.\" Jane replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. You're right of course, you would stand a better chance, what with you being practically an amazon and all. That however is exactly the reason you should be the one to wait, as you're also most likely to be able help bail me and Linda out of trouble if it should become necessary.\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't argue with that logic I suppose. Alright, you go, but be careful and hurry back as fast as you can. Last thing I want is to have to haul you and Linda back to the cabin because the head hunter got to you before I could.\" Jane cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll be careful. Also, if you see or hear anything that seems out of the ordinary, anything at all, make sure to warn me right away okay? The head hunter could be hiding almost anywhere after all.\" you instruct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do. Now get that cute ass of yours out there and save Linda.\" Jane orders, lightly slapping you on said ass in an attempt to help get you moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs slowly and quietly as possible, you move forward in a crouched position, sweeping your gaze back and forth from left to right, searching for any signs of the headhunter. Fortunately though, nothing happens, and you manage to reach the waters edge where Linda's still laying, wiggling and squirming impotently. The reason for this becomes more and more apparent as you draw closer. It seems that the head hunter decided to have a little fun with Linda before taking her head, probably in an effort to draw out the game a bit longer, as well as making things more interesting for himself, while simultaneously burdening you and the other girls with a helpless invalid. And Linda was truly helpless now, all four of her limbs having been removed entirely, leaving her as nothing more than head and torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching sight of you, Linda exclaims \"Ramona! Oh thank goodness, I thought for sure that I'd be left laying here cold and alone for the rest of the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're safe now, or safer at least. What...\" you suddenly stop cold, your eyes drawn towards Linda's naked crotch, which appeared to have been covered with a whitish, sticky looking substance that you were quite familiar with, having had your fair share of boyfriends over the years, with more of the stuff slowly oozing out from inside of her, giving clear evidence that Linda had been abused sexually as well as reduced physically, and recently too by the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp, covering your mouth with one hand, and drawing back slightly, eyes wide with fear and disgust at your friends apparent violation. \"Oh my God! Linda, did he... did he rape you?\" you inquire softly, not wanting to upset her, but not having the time, nor the necessary social skills to come up with a more delicate way to ask such a question. So sure are you in your assessment of the situation that you're totally unprepared for it when Linda starts laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! That's a good one girl! Rape, yea right!\" she replies, continuing to snicker a little, obviously amused by your assessment of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he didn't rape you then?\" you asked, wanting to be clear on what had actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he tried, don't get me wrong. The thing is though, you can't rape the willing, and once I got a good look at the size of that Shillong he was packing, I was definitely willing.\" Linda replied, her eyes taking on a somewhat dreamy expression at the memories of her recent sexual encounter with the head hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-you slept with the enemy!\" you gasped incredulously, unable to believe what it was you were hearing at first. After taking a brief moment to adjust to the idea however, it didn't really seem all that far fetched, given what you knew about Linda's sexual habits and proclivities, not to mention her fetish for detachment, a fetish that you share, and presumably Jane and Tanya as well, otherwise, they probably wouldn't be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer to your question, Linda replies \"Sure did, and I'd do it again in a heart beat, He really knows how to use that weapon of his, and I ain't talking about his knife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, you are such a slut! Seriously though, it couldn't have really been that good could it?\" you ask, curiosity overriding your good sense temporarily.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, you have no idea. If you manage to get captured, you might see if he's interested in going a round or two with you as well, trust me, it'll be worth it.\" Linda suggested. \"Anyway, I don't suppose you've seen my limbs laying around anywhere have you? I'd kind of like to get those back as soon as possible.\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't. They could be somewhere in the woods nearby, but I suspect that the head hunter probably took them with him so as to keep them from being reattached.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! Well, do you think we could at least look for them? There sort of important you know.\" Linda requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can form a response, you hear a scream from Jane's direction.</span></div></div>",

He leers at you for a moment before pulling you close, licking your cheek with his rough tongue, sobering all over you, before tucking you under one arm and running off into the forest, the trees whizzing by at an incredible pace, the shouts and screams of Jane and Linda growing fainer and fainter behind you before fading away entirely, and you're forced to realize that less than two hours into the game, and already you've somehow managed to be the first one captured by the head hunter, your head completely and totally at his mercy as your body is left farther and farther behind. You hope that your friends can manage to save you somehow, but it seems unlikely. Having noting better to do, you decide to try and strike up a conversation with your captor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, mind telling me where we're going?\" you ask, hoping that he'll let slip something you can use to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry girly, you'll know when we get there.\" the head hunter replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was uninformative.\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to try a different tact, you ask \"Alright, if you won't tell me where we're going, can you at least tell me what you plan to do to me once we get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, haven't decided yet. Now be quite, we'll be there soon enough.\" the hunter instructs as he continues racing through the forest, dodging between trees, around thorn bushes, and over rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempts at interrogation having failed, you do as you're told, knowing that screaming for help is unlikely to do you much good at this point, and settle down to wait for the trip to be over. The feel of someone touching your arm however soon catches your attention. You had been too agitated to notice at first, and afterwards too focused on your attempts to extract whatever information you could from the head hunter to notice, but you can still feel your body! Maybe you can control it as well? You decide to try, grasping onto the hand touching you for dear life, not wanting this person, whoever it might be, to leave your headless body alone out in the wilderness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person touching you seems to understand what it is you're trying to tell them, patting you on the shoulder reassuringly, tugging on your hand as though expecting you to follow them. Even though you have no idea who this person might be, you decide to follow them, as it's most likely Jane or Tanya, and even if it's someone else entirely, going along with them to wherever it is they plan on taking you seems like a better idea than wandering headless around through the woods, blind and deaf to any dangers that you might come across. The person continues to lead you through the woods, until you encounter what seems like some sort of gravel path judging from the feel of it. The only gravel trail you remember seeing is the one running between the cabin and the lake. Maybe the person is trying to lead you back to the cabin? It seems like the most likely destination if it is indeed one of the other members of your group leading you. After a good while, the person slows and changes direction. Still lacking any senses beyond touch in that particular location, you change direction as well, only to trip and almost fall over a small obstruction in your way. You would have fallen in fact if the individual leading your body hadn't caught you wrapping their strong arms around you and drawing you close, their chest pressing against your own_________________?</span></div></div>",

Muscular chest? That must mean the person who's been leading you around this whole time must be a guy. But who? So far as you know, the only guy around here is the headhunter, and given that he's still running through the woods with your head hanging from his belt, you know it can't be him. Does this man work for the camp as well? If not, than what is he doing here? More importantly, what does he intend to do with you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't left to wonder for long, as suddenly, the guy bends down and gently kisses your neck stump, causing a small shiver of delight to run through you, as the area is quite sensitive. Then, before you can react, the man scoops you up in a bridal carry, and carry's a few feet, pausing briefly for a moment as he fumbles with something, before depositing you on a soft, flat surface. At first, you think that perhaps the piece of furniture is a couch, but a bit of exploration reveals that it's not a couch at all, but rather, a bed, a large one it feels like. Does he intend to take advantage of you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you aren't forced to wait long to find out, as you suddenly feel the hands of the strange man running up and down your body, gently massaging you through your clothing. You're a bit startled by this, but his touch actually feels pretty good, and he hasn't really done anything too inappropriate yet, so you allow him to continue, even reaching out blindly slowly running your hands over that hard masculine chest of his, wondering at the feel of it. This guy must work out a lot to have a body this good. Between that and his hands, you're beginning to wonder if you don't WANT him to take advantage of you, as a situation just like this has been a long time sexual fantasy of yours for a long time now, and, though you can't be sure without a head to see him with, judging by feel alone, this guy does seem fairly attractive, and he's definitely good with his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as you thing that thought however, the man ceases his massage, and begins undressing you. Hmm, looks like moment of truth time. You can either let this strange guy that you don't know at all continue to use your headless body, or, you could attempt to fight him, though you're not sure if you're capable of putting up much resistance.

Jane hops down and sure enough you find your body caught in a bush, limbs twisting blindly as you blindly tried to escape.  Jane quickly plants your head back on your body and pulls you out of the bush... a little too roughly for your taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\"  You curse, your shirt getting ripped to shreds on the branches and leaving you clad only in shorts and a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that!\"  Jane commented, setting you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I know you didn't mean to.\"  You remark, shivering slightly in the night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you turned as Tanya yelled.  \"Not to break up the tea party you ladies are having or anything, but could one of you please lend me a hand here?!\"  You saw that Tanya was still tightly wrapped around the headhunter, her arm holding back his knife wielding hand as he stumbled back and forth.  It was evident that he had gotten a few good hits in though.  Tanya's left leg had been cut off right at the butt line, now thrashing about uselessly on the ground beside the two.  Her shorts, having been compromised, had by now slid off, revealing a black skin tight thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane reacted first on her instincts, charging in to help her comrade.  \"Grab Linda, I'll save Tanya!\"  She commanded over her shoulder.  You did not argue, instead running back onto the track and over to Linda, who looked at you excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\"  You say, taking Linda by the waist and hoisting her surprisingly light body onto your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my limbs?\"  She asked with a hint of panic in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time for this, we have to get moving!\"  You argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't have the energy to haul me any sort of distance.

I don't see it anywhere, and if we stop to look for it, we're all done for!\" Jane responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about then, the head hunter finally succeeded in dislodging Tanya, tossing her to the ground and attempting to pin he to the ground with his foot, only to have her roll aside into the lake.

Staggering up the couple of steps to the front door, Jane staggered her way inside, dropping you and Linda on the nearest soft surface, which just happened to be a nearby sofa, before she began barricading the door behind her, using whatever furniture or other object she could find that was large enough to be useful for that purpose, while at the same time still being light enough for her to move on her own, as you and Linda were obviously in no position to be able to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd finished erecting the improvised barrier, Jane slumped down on the sofa next to you, and sighed in relief, having successfully evaded the head hunter for the moment. Or so she thinks. A pounding at the door caused her to jump to her feet in fright, but after a moment, the frantic pounding ceased. A brief moment of silence ensued before the sound of creaking hinges was heard from the back door of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot to lock the back door?! you demanded incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't you hear you mention it either.\" Jane rebutted, adding \"You two stay here, I'll go check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like we have a choice?\" you said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring your comment, Jane grabbed a nearby vase and crept quietly towards the back door and out of your line of sight. everything is quite for a few moments, before you hear footfalls coming your direction.

Breathing a sigh of relief, you say \"Tanya, thank goodness, I thought for sure the head hunter would have gotten you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya, dripping wet, smiles and says \"Yea, me too, but apparently he's not a very good swimmer, because he didn't even try to follow me once I made it to the lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder why not?\" you said before you suddenly realize the answer. \"Oh crap! We left my body back at the lake. I bet the head hunter's going after it!\" you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll get it back, somehow.\" Tanya says reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, but that's not what I'm...Oh!\" you gasp suddenly, as you feel masculine hands brush against your body's neck stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! What is it?!\" Jane Asks, her voice tinged with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think the head hunter's found my body.\" you say, as the hand continues massaging your neck stump. It's a lot more intense and pleasurable than you'd have thought it would be, the cut surface having become quite sensitive to the touch, providing a sensation almost akin to having your breasts stroked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Oh no, we have to stop him before he does something terrible!\" Jane exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that Ramona would thank you for that.\" Linda quips from where she's lying next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jane asks puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me on this, it'll be a lot more fun for her if we just let the hunter do his thing.\" Linda answered, giving a brief nod towards where you were now gasping and moaning a bit from the hunters unexpectedly erotic neck massage, pouting in disappointment as he stops suddenly, letting go of you, but only for a minute, before he reaches down, gasping the bottom of your shirt and pulling it up, over your arms and neck stump, and tossing it aside before you can react. \"Hey you jerk what do you think your doing?!\" you demand as your unseen lover continues to undress you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing your arms over your breasts and backing away, you try to ward him off, but the head hunter is not to be deterred, tackling you to the ground and jerking your pants off, taking your panties with them, leaving your lower half totally exposed. You make a feeble effort to swat him away, but the only result of this is for him to grab both your wrists in one meaty hand pinning them to the ground above your head, grabbing your bra with the other and ripping it off and tossing it aside as well, leaving you completely nude. You try to kick at him, but he simply forces your legs apart then pins them beneath his knees. Now having you right where he wants you the head hunter begins groping your breasts, kneading and caressing the sensitive flesh, first one tit then the other, before leaning in close, grasping the nipple of your right breast between his teeth and sucking on it, causing you to gasp and cry out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's hurting her!\" Jane exclaims, and starts heading towards the back door intent on rescuing your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look again. Does she really look like she's hurting to you?\" Linda suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, actually, no, she looks like... Oh my God! Ramona, you little slut! You're not doing what I think your doing are you?\" Tanya demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not my idea.\" you manage to say between gasps. \"C-can't c-complain though.\" you add, as your face takes on a dreamy expression. Indeed, what had started out as attempted rape had now turned into something else all together, as you felt yourself becoming more and more turned on the longer the head hunters sexual assault on your body continues. You relax, allowing yourself to get into it. It's actually what you'd intended to do anyway if you'd found yourself in this situation since being taken like this has long been a fantasy of yours, but that didn't mean that you ever intended for the hunters job to be easy, wanting to make him work at it a little first, as it made the whole thing more intense and realistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling you relax, the head hunter relaxes his grip on your arms as well, allowing him to use both hands to stroke and caress every inch of your body, causing you to purr with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! This is like, so totally Hot!\" Tanya exclaimed. Scrambling out of her wet clothes and tossing them aside, she lays back and begins fingering herself furiously right there in front of you and the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's no fair, what about me?!\" Linda whines, wiggling her limbless torso back and forth desperately, trying in vain to get herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry girlfriend, I gottcha!\" Jane said, stripping off her own clothes and sitting down next to you and Linda, then grabbing the limbless girl and spinning her upside down so the Linda's pussy was level with her face, while Linda's face was level with Jane's own cunt. Soon the two of them were going at it hot and heavy as they engaged in a steamy sixty nine session, lapping away at each others pussy's, muffled screams and moans issuing from them as they worked one another closer and closer to orgasm. Meanwhile, the head hunter had decided to end the foreplay grabbing his cock, and after a bit of careful positioning, slamming it all the way into you, causing you to scream in mingled passion and pain as the long thick shaft penetrated your tight wet hole, pounding away mercilessly at your cunt as the hunters hands continue teasing your nipples, pinching and squeezing them, while he pounds away at your pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing forced to listen to your frantic cries of pleasure, and seeing what Jane and Linda are doing, Tanya exclaims \"Oh, that looks like fun!\" and leaves off fingering herself, grabbing your head and shoving it between her legs, practically burying your nose in her pussy. Being bisexual, you've no objections to this, and begin eagerly lapping away, running your talented tongue back up and down the length of her gash a few times to get her good and wet, then sliding into her, swirling the damp organ around inside of her as you suck on her clit, sending her into an orgasmic frenzy in practically no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for orgasms, your about to have one of your own, rubbing furiously at your clit while the head hunter continues to pound into you, his huge dick filling you up entirely to the point where you're almost afraid that he'll split you in half. You cum explosively, shivering and shaking, your arms and legs coming up and locking tight around the head hunters muscular frame as he continues pounding you with an almost machine like intensity even in the face of your orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jane and Linda continue to go at it, using their lips and tongues to work each other into one orgasm after another, neither of them showing the least interest in stopping, or even slowing down their lesbian loving making session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after bringing you to several more orgasms, even as you do the same to Tanya, the head hunter can hold back no longer. You feel his massive dick spasm inside of you as what seems like practically gallons of hot, sticky cum shoots deep inside of your womb, filling you up until you feel like you're about to burst, before finally the flow subsides, and the head hunter slumps, his large muscular frame pressing down on your smaller, slighter one, his dick still inside you, softening only slightly despite having delivered more cum than you would have thought humanly possible, and that only shortly after having already having made love to Linda earlier. Perhaps he even has enough stamina for one more round? you think hopefully, even though you're not sure that you yourself are in any condition to handle another go with that massive member of his. it's not to be however, as the head hunters body slumps against you, his head pillowed between your breasts the warmth of his body flowing into you, keeping you reasonably comfortable despite the cold ground beneath you. You lie there for a time softly stroking the hair of your erstwhile lover and adversary, and after a while, you feel a change in his breathing, signalling that sleep has claimed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Tanya is done with you, and, quite tired yourself, you slowly drift off into slumber, thoroughly satisfied, to the sounds of the muffled screams and moans of Jane and Linda, both of whom ate STILL going at it even now.</span></div></div>",

As you watch, it seems to pulse a bit, jiggling slightly in the cool evening air. There doesn't seem to be any other body parts nearby. Presumably, the headhunter left this behind for some reason. Gulping a bit, you step forward and bend down to pick it up, prompting Jane to grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww! Ramona, no! Don't -touch- it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, and leave her just lying on the ground? This is our friend we're talking about here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's just so... gross!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. She's just a brain. It's not like she secretes acid or anything. And stop calling her 'it'. It's not like this is just -part- of Linda. This IS Linda! Or, what's left of her anyway. Er...\" You trail off as a thought occurs to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just realized, for all we know, this could actually be -Tanya-, not Linda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you don't -know-? Aren't you supposed to be, like, the smart one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break! It's not like I know how to distinguish one brain from another! Aside from anything else, I've never seen -either- of their brains before now!\" You gesticulate wildly, waving Linda (or possibly Tanya) around to make your point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, okay, sorry... So... What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think for a moment...\" You look down at the brain in your hand and try to come up with a plan of action. Eventually, a few possibilities occur to you. You could head back to the cabin. This event has shaken you pretty badly, and you'd rather get back to the relative safety of the indoors. Plus, you need to figure out a way to determine who exactly this brain that you're holding -is-, and that'll be easier at the cabin, if for no other reason than because you'll have access to better light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could also try and find Tanya. Or possibly Linda, if this is actually -Tanya's- brain. If it's Linda, you need to find Tanya and let her know so that she can stop searching. After all, it's pretty clear that there's no point in looking for her right now. She probably won't be much use without her brain. But if this is Tanya and not Linda, then you need to find Linda and warn her about what the headhunter has done, and try to convince her to come back to the cabin. Either way, if one of them is still in one piece, it'd be a good idea to go and find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third possibility is that you and Jane could comb the beach for any more body parts. It's possible that when the headhunter removed -whoever- this is from their head, that he scattered the rest of her body around. If that's the case it might be a good idea to try and gather as many of their pieces as possible. It's not likely to do the brain much good, since the headhunter doubtless is carrying around their empty skull, but some spare parts might come in handy. After all, you just never know what could prove useful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Quickly focusing your attention on it, the two of you cautiously approach to take a closer look. As you get closer it becomes easier to identify what, or rather, who, it is you've found. You breathe a sigh of relief as you realize that you've found Linda. But something seems... odd. She seems fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane scowls. \"So this is what the fuss is all about? She scares us half to death, and it turns out she was just taking a nap the whole time? Unbelievable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown a bit. \"I dunno... that wasn't a lot of time for someone to fall asleep, even Linda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane snorts. \"Oh please. We should have -known- it'd be something like this. Well, I'm waking her up! She can take a nap later!\" She marches over to Linda's unconscious form. She gives your prone friend a hard nudge with her foot, but Linda doesn't seem to react. Frowning, she bends down to flip her over, only to stumble back with a scream, landing on her butt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly rush over to help. \"Jane! What is it? What's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts a trembling finger, pointing at Linda's head. \"H-her head! It- it's-!\" She can't quite seem to get it out. Looking in the direction she's pointing, your mouth drops as you realize what the problem is. Linda isn't asleep. The top of her head has been sliced off, and is lying about a foot away. The inside of her head is completely empty. Her brain has been stolen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well! Um... That would certainly explain why she's just lying here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane gives you an incredulous look as she staggers to her feet. \"H-how can you be so calm about this Ramona? Linda's been lobotomized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place a hand on her shoulder to try and help her relax. \"Hey, calm down. It''s magic, remember? She hasn't -actually- suffered any permanent damage. If we can find her brain, we can put her back to normal good as new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh. Right. I kinda... forgot. About that part, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, it's fine. This IS pretty shocking. I certainly didn't expect the headhunter to steal her brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane giggles a bit, having calmed down somewhat. \"Heheheh, yeah. I mean, she's not exactly the brightest bulb on the tree. I mean, if -I- were going to go around stealing brains, I'd go for yours! You're like, the smartest one here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and chuckle a bit despite yourself. At least Jane is no longer freaking out. Still, you really wish she hadn't said that part about how the headhunter should have gone for -your- brain out loud. It's your favorite part of yourself. If the headhunter is still around nearby (And he almost certainly is!) you don't want Jane giving him ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now?\" Jane asks, turning to you for instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Okay, you carry Linda's body back to the cabin. I'll stay out here and see if I can find either Tanya or Linda's brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Why do -I- have to cart the brainless bimbo around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two reasons, actually! First, you're a lot stronger and more physically fit than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane gives you a grudging nod. \"Okay, I guess that's true. But what's the other reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin playfully. \"Because if -you- look for her brain and actually -find- it, -you'll- have to be the one to pick it up and bring it back. Are you -sure- that's what you want to do~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane goes green at the thought of having to handle Linda's brain. \"Ergh... Okay, point taken. But what about you? Aren't you worried that the headhunter will get you while you're out here on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"I mean, a little? But the faster we get this done, the less chance he has of ambushing us. And the fastest way to get this done is to split up. Don't worry, I won't be long. If I don't find Linda's brain or Tanya soon, I'll head straight back to the cabin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane bites her lip as you give her your best reassuring smile. \"Well... Okay... But don't take too long!\" She bends down and hefts Linda's brainless body over her shoulder, holding your brainless friend's skullcap in one hand and her flashlight in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh, I'll be fine! Now, you better get going. I'll see you in a few minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nods and sets off down the path back to the cabin, leaving you on your own to search the beach for Linda's missing mind.

I mean, I payed good money to come on this trip and I don't want all of that to go to waste by getting sent home tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the membership fee for the cl... the cabin was the most expensive part.\"  Tanya said, skirting around breaking character by specifically referencing the company that ran these bizarre fetish camps (there were actually quite a lot).  They didn't really care if you stayed in character or not once you were here, it was mostly just up to personal preference how seriously you took it and Tanya seemed to want to keep playing along with it for the time being at least.  \"I mean, the actual processing and booking wasn't too bad on the wallet.  I'm sure now that we've got the biggest cheque out of the way, we could make this a yearly thing, maybe even two times a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you were idly chatting you hear the front door open.

Her body feels around in front of her for a moment, her arms passing through where the door was moments ago, before she takes some tentative steps.  Tanya closes the door behind Linda, staring at her bare bottom as it passes by.  Linda is slow, and judging by the way she is feeling around blindly you don't think she has retained her senses.  Jane takes a hold of Linda's arm to guide her to the couch, but is surprised when Linda wraps her hand around Jane's wrist.  She feels it for a few seconds, before moving her hand up to Jane's face, feeling all of the angles of her head before patting her on the back, content with knowing who it was.  Jane guides her to the couch, where Linda lies down stretched across it.  She begins feeling at her smooth neck and shakes slightly at the feeling, which judging by how her nipples reacted felt very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe she went and got captured not even a half hour in.

You should stay back here and watch Linda's body to make sure nothing happens to it.\"  Tanya instructed, trying to be productive about this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to watch her body?  The headhunter already got her head, he doesn't really need this.\"  You reason with Tanya, motioning toward Linda's shivering body.  \"But he does need this!\"  You point at your own neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda ran off to get herself captured, that's pretty impulsive, and judging by the fact that she wandered her body all the way back from the lake shows that she can't keep still.  You need to be here in case she wanders off or if she accidentally hurts herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\"  You concede, feeling foolish for not thinking of that.  \"But what if the headhunter shows up?  What'll I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it yourself, he's got what he wants from her. No reason to come back now.\"  Jane interjects.  Looking at Linda's body, a coy smiles spreads across her face.  \"Besides, I think the Headunter is going to be distracted for a little while.\"  She poked Linda's throat, which you just noticed was bulging out with the obvious outline of a cock inside it.  Linda was sucking him off, and her throat was acting like some sort of portal!  How far away was he? How far was his cock travelling to get here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jane and Tanya marched off, leaving you with Linda's headless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer helpless headless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer helpless sexy headless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body which was getting moist at rubbing herself, and was using her free arm to motion you towards her helpless headless sexy moist body.</span></div></div>",

You quickly throw up token defenses around the house, wedging chairs under the doorknobs to hold them in place and placing tables over the ground level windows.  It won't hold for much more than one or two good hits, but it will keep him busy long enough (hopefully) to escape if you are caught with your pants down.  After you finish with that you turn back to Linda's headless body.  It is rubbing slightly faster than it was before, using its left hand to feel her sensitive new skin on her neck stump and her right hand to tease her outer labia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your glasses and set them on the nightstand, wanting them to be within reach but out of the way of danger in case things got rough.  You then pull your shirt off over your head.  You toss the shirt over to Linda.  She is clearly startled by this, her hands flinching and her body curling slightly.  After a moment she reaches down and feels the cloth curiously.  She seems to realize it is a shirt, but seems confused as to why exactly you have thrown it to her, as it is too large for her petite frame.  Next you unclasp your bra, releasing your sizable rack.  You toss it to her, the left cup landing on her neck.  Her hand tentatively reaches up and feels it, her fingers running over the soft material.  She realizes then that this is not a bra for her, it was yours, and you had removed it.  Her body sits up and drops the clothes next to it on the couch, her whole body practically shaking with anticipation.  You pull off your shorts and panties in one motion, tossing them to Lydia.  She feels them, rubbing them all over as you watch naked before her.  She rubs them across her stump before tossing them into the pile with the rest.  She is ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way over, your breasts swinging lightly as you saunter.  You lean over and plant a kiss on Linda's neck stump while your unrestrained buxom brushes against her bare skin.  She shudders and grabs your hips tightly, though thankfully her nails had been clipped recently.  You brought your legs up onto the couch, straddling her slender body with your heavier set one.  You reach down and begin fingering her while using your other hand to reach around an hold her close, your chests pressing hard on one another.  Linda can't really reach your pussy from this position, so she latches onto your ass with a passion.  You continue sliding in and out, nibbling on he smooth skin as you feel her grip grow in power.  With one final gnaw and a thrust she orgasms, her hands sharply squeezing you one more time before she relaxes her grip.  You stand up, rubbing your ass while smiling.  You are pretty sure that there will be pretty bad bruises on your bum come tomorrow morning, but right now you don't really care, all you care about is getting yourself off now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Linda can read your mind she launches herself from the sofa and takes hold of your shoulders.  She spins you around quickly and plants you on the sofa, causing you to wince a little but grin wider.  She lowers herself and begins massaging your genitals with her smooth neck stump.  It feels very weird, but in a very good way.  You giggle as she continues to grind against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so of this she raises herself and lifts you off the couch.  She sits down where you were and then pulls you onto her lap.  You are facing away from her and you are not sure that she knows what she is actually doing, until she wraps her arms around you.  Her left arm wraps around your cleavage and begins rubbing both of your tits harshly, bouncing them up and down while her right hand moves down to your womanhood.  She shoves two fingers in forcefully, making you squeal with pleasure.  She handles you roughly, exerting a lot more dominance than her small body would imply.  After a minute of her thrashing you up and down you get off, slumping back onto her as her movements slow.  She releases you and you nearly fall over, landing on all fours as she lies back contently.  You kiss her neck again in gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no time to get dressed or hide the scene though as a voice calls out from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for showing me a good time!\"  Linda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes bulge open and you scramble for your glasses.  How the hell did Linda say that, how was she here, what was going on?!  You throw your glasses on and see that Linda's head has been carried into the house...</span></div></div>",

Finding a good spot, you bend over as far as you can go, grasping the hem of your sundress between your teeth and pulling upwards, bringing the garment up around your shoulders, then bending over once more, placing one foot on top of it then sliding backwards, pulling the dress up over your head and off, allowing it to fall to the ground in a pile. You're underwear would have been a trickier matter, but fortunately for your current situation, you're not wearing any, as it would have only get in the way of all the sexy fun you'd planned on having with the head hunter. once you're naked, you squat down, sighing in relief as you relive yourself.

While easy to open for a normal person with a full compliment of limbs, in your armless state, you would find it impossible to open, at least in the amount of time you likely have available.

As for the guys themselves, they where just standing there not saying a word, eyes and mouth open wide in surprise, and, judging from the bulges in their pants, no small amount of lust, as they took in your appearance, with your nudity and total lack of arms. They appeared to be a couple of hikers judging from their backpacks, probably somewhere around your age or possibly a little older. They were also kind of cute, being tall and muscular with regular features, and under different circumstances you might have enjoyed looking at them. Now though, you were just trying to figure out a way to explain this situation, hopefully one that will allow you to get back inside and get some clothes on before the two guys decided to rape you or something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, look, i can explain this, it isn't what it looks like!

Bet she never expected us to follow her.\" the guy identified as Mike replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStamping your foot in anger over being ignored and leered at, not to mention frustration at being trapped naked outdoors by something as simple as a door handle, you growled \"Look, i don't know who you guys are, or what you're doing here, this is suppose to be a private club after all, but right now, all I want is for one of you to stop leering at me long enough to help me get inside and get some clothes on, is that too much to ask?!\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we'll help you get back inside.\" Mike agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though the clothing part may be a bit of a problem. It would be a shame to cover up a body as hot as yours.\" Steve added, giving your naked form yet another leer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your irritation at the two of them, as well as your situation in general, you can't help but blush a little at the compliment, corny as it is. \"Whatever! Just hurry up and open the door would you?!\" you demanded, though you wondered if this was a good idea, as once inside, there was nothing to stop the two horny jerks from doing whatever they wanted to you. Of course, on the other hand, there wasn't really much to keep them from taking advantage of you now, as their didn't seem to be anyone around aside from the two of you, so what difference did it really make whether you let them inside or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure pretty lady, allow me!\" Steve said gallantly, stepping forward and opening the door, then ushering you inside. \"Ladies first.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to stare at my ass some more, don't you?\" you growled. Steve didn't bother to reply, simply grinning and waggling his eyebrows suggestively, causing you to huff angrily, before stepping inside anyway, the two guys following close behind, mesmerized by the roll and sway of your full sexy ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing around the living room of the cabin with your foot, you said \"Welcome to my humble abode, don't get too comfortable, because you won't be staying long. As soon as the other girls get back, you're out of here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other girls? How many? What do they look like?\" Mike inquired excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way they can be as cute as you.\" Steve added, causing you to blush once more. Maybe he wasn't so bad after all. And you were still sort of horny and frustrated from your encounter with the head hunter... \"No! Bad thoughts! Bad thoughts!\" you mentally berated yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's none of your business. Now, how about one of you get me a soda or something? I'm sort of thirsty.\" you requested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go.\" Mike said, being the quicker to volunteer, much to Steve's chagrin, as he seemed to have developed quite the interest in you in the short amount of time that you've known each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, pretty lady, what's you name, and what are you and those other girls you mentioned doing so far out in the woods? My name's Steve by the way, Well, Steven technically, Steven Boyd, but my friends call me Steve.\" Steve said, taking his friends temporary absence as an opportunity to chat you up. \"I hope you and I can be friends?\" he added hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just friends huh?\" you inquired skeptically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for a start, though I certainly wouldn't mind more if you're up for it.\" Steve admitted. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright <i>Steven</i>.\" you said, making sure to emphasize the long version of his name so as not to encourage him making yourself sound friendly, as jumping into bed with guys you've just met isn't really your style, the head hunter being a notable exception. \"My name's Ramona, and frankly, I think you're a pervert and a bit of a jerk. I mean, denying me clothes, really! As for what me and the rest of the girls are doing out here, you seem to know most of it already. Thing is though, despite what you may think, considering where we are and the circumstances of our meeting, I'm not a slut, and I've no intentions of sleeping with you, so why don't you find yourself another girl to pursue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's you I want. And i don't think you're a slut at all, merely a young woman who's comfortable enough with her sexuality to experiment a little. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here, am I right?\" Steve replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned a little, as he was surprisingly close to the mark, and the way he had phrased his response left you thinking that perhaps he wasn't as much of an idiot as you'd originally thought. You still had no intentions of fucking him, especially with his friend so close by, but the idea was slowly starting to grow on you. Maybe if you could find some way to get the two of you alone for a while... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, at least for Steve, before your thoughts could travel too much further down that road, Mike came walking back in from the kitchen, a gallon of punch and a trio of plastic cups in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see any soda's, but I did find this punch in the fridge. I tasted it, and it seems pretty good.\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll have to do.\" you said with a sigh, as you'd really been craving a soda, being somewhat addicted to caffeine, but the punch would be good enough for now, as at least it would help take care of your thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sets the punch down and begins fills two of the cup, taking one for himself then setting one down in front of you, leaving Steve to fend for himself. Rather than taking the bait however, Steve quickly gets up and plops down next to you before either you or Mike can protest. Picking up your cup he says \"Here Ramona, let me help you with that.\" Raising the cup to your lips and allowing you to drink. Not seeing a better option, as there are no straws around, and drinking by yourself would be difficult at best without arms, you simply shrug and open your mouth, allowing your would be admirer to help you drink. It mostly works, the punch tasting strongly of strawberries, with a hint of another flavor to it that you can't quite place. All in all it's pretty good stuff you decide, much better than most of the punch you've had over the years. As Steve pulls the cup away from you however though, he spills a bit of it, the cold liquid running down your front and down between your breasts en-route to your pussy, the chill of it causing your nipples to harden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, let me get that for you!\" Steve immediately says, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a handkerchief, which he uses to dab up the liquid, though he's a bit more through with your boobs than absolutely necessary, running the cloth over every inch of them paying special attention to your rapidly stiffening nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you can stop now, I'm clean enough already!\" you snapped, slightly irritated, well, more so than before at least, certain that he had spilled the punch on purpose, though you were also more aroused than you'd like to admit, the feel of the cloth against your breasts having been fairly pleasurable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Want some more punch?\" Steve inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to say no, but you were actually still pretty thirsty, and it was good punch. Deciding to extract some minor revenge on Steve for his little cleaning stunt, you replied \"Yes, but I'd rather have Mike here help me this time, you seem sort of clumsy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I know I can do better this time if you'll allow me to try again?\" Steve pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply nodded, confirming your decision, and Steve reluctantly moved aside, allowing his companion to sit next to you, picking up the cup and bringing it to your lips, the tangy liquid sweet against your tongue. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jane wasn't so fortunate however, nothing but a stump, covered with a patch of blank skin remaining between her shoulder blades, her head having apparently already been claimed by the head hunter, probably while defending Tanya if you had to guess, as the taller girl is loyal to a fault. Not being able to see where she's going, Jane relies on Tanya for guidance, Tanya applying pressure with her leg stumps, signaling for Jane to turn either left or right, pulling back to get her to stop, leaning forward to get her moving again, and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two enter the cabin, Tanya can't help but blink, her surprise so great that she nearly forgets to tell Jane to stop. Seeing you siting there with the two guys, naked and armless, she says \"Are we interrupting something? We can come back latter if you and your two boy toys are busy.\" She said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No! These two are just a couple of gate crashers who caught me at a bad time is all, and they were just leaving, weren't you fellows?\" You said menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until after you introduce us to your sexy friends here.\" Mike replied. \"Hi, I'm Mike, and you two lovely ladies are...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tanya, and the headless amazon here is Jane. Hmm, you are kind of cute. Hey Ramona, if you don't want this one, can I have him? I haven't had a drop of sex on this trip yet, and I doubt We'd stand much of a chance against the head hunter in our current condition.\" Tanya inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you want them, you can have them! Take both of them for all I care!\" you replied, though in truth you were slightly miffed, having become used to being the center of attention for the two guys rather quickly, even if you didn't exactly enjoy all the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you don't really mean that do you honey?\" Steve said, wrapping his arms around your shoulders from behind. \"Just when I thought we were starting to get close you go and kick me to the curb like that? I'm hurt, wounded, even!\" he continued, throwing in a few fake sniffles for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, but you will be if you don't get off of me!\" you threatened, directing a glare back over your shoulder at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine, well if you're going to be that way about it, maybe I'll just join Mike and your two beautiful friends here, what do you think about that?\" Steve demanded, seeming genuinely irritated this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, see if I care. Though I doubt they'll have you, I wouldn't.\" you replied, wanting to get both of the perverted jerks out of your hair as soon as possible, though you did have certain doubts. After all, this vacation was supposed to be all about having fun and exploring your sexuality, not to mention being cut up with a magic knife and having your body parts scattered around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I will!\" Steve said, before turning to Tanya. \"What do you think ladies, is there room for one more?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, the more the merrier. Jane still needs a partner after all.\" Tanya agreed. \"That is, unless Ramona here is having second thoughts? You sure you want to turn him down?\" she asked you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three sharp knocks echoed through the cabin, the flimsy wooden door shaking in its frame as though it'd been assaulted by a battering ram.  The two men exchanged a look, not quite concerned but not particularly pleased either.  \"Friends of yours?\"  Steve asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell should I know?\"  You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could ask.\"  Mike curtly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So could you?\"  you snap back, though thinking about it, no he really couldn't.  He and Mike weren't supposed to be here, and if the Headhunter was behind that door you doubt he'd be quite as playful with them as he had been with you and the rest of your well paying female compatriots... \"Hello?\"  You ask, loud enough for anyone was on the other side of the door to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I speaking to Ramona?\"  A male voice inquired, one that definitely didn't belong to the headhunter.  It was softer in tone, lacking in the theatrical flair the Headhunter had put into his performance, yet the voice had something in it that carried a far more authority than the Headhunter had.  Like Ramona was speaking with an entire SWAT team condensed into a single voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  You answered, looking at the two much paler men as they silently contemplated what they should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in immediate danger?\"  The man asked, with no hint of urgency but a great deal of severity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mike and Steve shook their heads, staring pleadingly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\"  You answered, a rock settling in your stomach as the tension mounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  The man answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a half second pause, then the door snapped in half straight from top to bottom, its pieces tumbling away as a stocky man in full body armor swung himself into the room, drawing a pistol that would make Robocop blush and taking aim at Steve's head with a movement more fluid than water.  You, Steve, and Mike screamed in unison and with an almost identically high pitch, and if you hadn't already relieved yourself in the bushes outside you probably would've done so now. For one terrified instant you expected Steve's head to be spread across the room like a waterballoon filled with salsa, followed shortly by you and Mike.  However, when the trigger of the almost comically large pistol was pulled there was no boom, nor bang, nor crack to suggest the firing of a bullet.  Instead, a soft \"<i>Fwiiip</i>\" was heard, and Steve dropped like a sack of potatoes with a syringe-like projectile sticking out of his completely intact head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike had the opportunity to flinch, and produce a single syllable (\"UH!\") before the armored gunman snapped onto his head and fired a second time, Mike dropping just like his friend with an identical projectile lodged in his forehead.  \"Don't worry, the darts and their contents are magic.  They aren't hurt.  Yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to wait until your heartbeat had retreated from behind your ears and back into your chest before you registered that the voice you heard was not the one you'd heard at the door.  It was female, and judging by the Canadian accent it wasn't the voice of any of your friends.  Looking up from the tangled heap of limbs that was Mike, you saw the cabin had become a lot more crowded, with four figures standing before you.  The was the body armored man, still training his weapon on the downed Mike with his eyes on Steve, as though the two of them were about to spring up for one last scare like a cheap horror movie villain (wait, was the Headhunter planning on something like that? You'd have to remember that when and if the time came...), two moderately athletic but unarmed and nonthreatening people in blue jumpsuits with the Impossible Fetish Club's logo stamped over the breast stood behind him, one of them a man and the other a woman, and standing in front of them all was a short, middle aged Chinese woman wearing a cream white business suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese woman raised her hand, and the 2 jumpsuited people stepped around her, pulled the darts from Mike &amp; Steve's foreheads, and began dragging the pair of them out of the door.  The Chinese woman turned her attention to you, and asked in her Canadian voice that sounded much younger than she looked, \"I'm very sorry about this unfortunate intrusion into your experience.  I hope you know that we at the Impossible Fetish Club value our clients' privacy, comfort, and safety above all else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can tell.\"  You answered, glancing at the great mass of muscle that had exploded into the room and took down two men in one second.  \"Thanks for...\" you stopped.  You wanted to call this a 'rescue', but frankly neither Steve nor Mike felt particularly threatening.  They were annoying and gross and pervy, but you didn't feel physcially threatened by either of them.  The same couldn't be said by the crack team of Fetish Club goons who'd just barged in, your skin crawling beneath their unfazed gazes.  \"Thanks for your vigilance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that the lead woman had picked up on your unease, as she waved her hand in an identical motion to the one she'd given the 2 body disposers, and immediately the man with the gun relaxed his posture and left the room whistling, leaving you and the suited woman alone in the cabin's living room.  Somehow, this felt even more intense.  \"We didn't mean to alarm you just then, and I'm sorry if Kyle's entrance seemed a bit dramatic.  The doors and window's here are designed to break easily and with great fanfare, you see.  It helps give the Headhunter that slasher feel you kids crave.\"  She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\"  You wanted to explain that your near-heart attack had more to do with 'Kyle' whipping a gun out than his entrance, but the words failed you.  \"I'm fine, thank you.\"  You felt your shoulder twitch, you'd tried to extend your hand to shake but found that action impossible for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream suited woman seemed super-humanly perceptive, as she immediately reached out and gently tapped your bare left shoulder in the best approximation of a handshake she could exchange.  \"I'm glad to hear that.  My name is Carrie, and I'm the assistant manager of this branch of the Impossible Fetish Club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello Carrie.  I'm Ramona.  Though, you probably already knew that.\"  You say, blushing as you recalled Kyle saying your name very loudly and clearly.  \"So... what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first, let me just say that we are immensely embarrassed by this lapse in security.  Those two ruffians slipped through a gap in our camera network and our surveillance team was-\" there was a very slight but very noticeable pause in her very official sounding speech \"preoccupied watching your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're alright, right?\"  You ask, leaping to your feet almost literally as your much lighter body flew much higher than you'd intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they're perfectly fine, they've just been enjoying the game as intended with the Headhunter.  I won't spoil, but you'll be very surprised when you next meet them.  Assuming your comfortable continuing the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"  You say, more quickly and defensively than intended.  \"I mean, I paid good money to be here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that.  We're comping your group's entire trip, and as a further token of our appreciation for your understanding in this troubling situation, we will be providing you with 5 tickets for a trip to any one of our camps, all expenses paid!\"  She said, genuine excitement entering her voice as though she were announcing you the winner of a sweepstakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, what a deal!  You gladly would've let those pervs perv on you for another hour just for the comp, let alone the 5 trip tickets.  \"That's very kind of you, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome.  I hope you continue to choose the Impossible Fetish Club for all of your impossible desires!\"  She said, standing and turning curtly towards the... huh.  you hadn't even noticed that her lackeys had replaced the door and removed the shattered pieces.  They worked fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait... what's going to happen to those guys?\"  You ask.  While you weren't exactly sad that those douches got tranquilized, they... weren't the most awful they could be.  You weren't hurt or anything, and for some reason you felt a compulsion to make sure that they weren't hurt either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?'  Carrie asked, the question catching her off gaurd.  \"Oh, well first we're going to magically wipe their memories of meeting you, so your visit here can remain discreet.\"  She answered, as though it were the most ordinary thing in the world.  \"Then we're going to...</span></div></div>",

You had expected her to be eager to meet this guy, but this was just insane!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, I like playing for the winning team!\"  Linda deflected, her body tightening its grip on your wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had an opportunity to retort the headhunter lashed out with three separate moves, moving with grace and precision that was amazing for a man of his size.  With one move he lopped your head off, the knife cleaving through you like you were made entirely of jello.  Before gravity had time to take effect he grabbed you by the long blond hair and tossed you into the air.  While you were still airborne he planted Linda's laughing head right onto your body, removing your connection from it.  You landed on the couch in a state of stunned awe, staring at Linda who was now mounted onto your shorter body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda's former body relaxed its grip but remained standing, meaning that Linda now had control of two bodies, though you're not sure how much longer the second one would remain hers as it had been nearly two hours.  \"This.  Is.  Awesome!\"  Linda announces, cupping your large breasts in what were your hands.  \"I love all of these new curves!\"  She squealed, feeling up your round hips and cute belly.  She then turned around to face her old body.  \"And I still have control of this, fuck yeah!\"  She really was satisfied with her bargain.  She then skips over to you, boobs bouncing around wildly as she did.  She lifted you up to eye level slowly, giving you a fantastic view of what was once yours... are you turning yourself on?  A little narcissistic but whatever.  \"Thanks for the loan!\"  She chirped, bringing you in for a kiss.  You were not planning on this but found yourself enjoying it much more than you would've liked.  She really was skilled with that tongue of hers, and it was no surprise that the headhunter enjoyed her.  She eventually broke off your lip locking, her eyes digging into your own bespectacled ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to do now?\"  You asked, a mix of genuine fear and legitimate excitement in your tone.<br>\r\nLinda looks over to the headhunter who nods, allowing her to continue.  \"This!\"  She said.  What does Linda do?</span></div></div>",

She spread her legs ever so slightly and lifted her arms out to her sides, likely having been told what to do before.  The headhunter lashed out quicker than you could believe, sending all four of Linda's appendages flying and sending her newly limbless body crashing to the floor.  \"Ouch!  Be careful, I just got this ass!\"  She complained, looking up at the towering headhunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored her, and went around the room pressing the severed parts against the far wall, removing Linda's connection with them.  When he had completed that he turned back to Linda's old headless body.  Before he could do the same to it the body's shoulders seemed to sag, it's knees going weak, and it stumbled forward a step.  It toppled over, ass in the air, now completely motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can't feel my old body any more!\"  She noted, scrunching in concentration to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, the two hours must be up.  Convenient timing.\"  The headhunter remarked, leaning over and slapping Linda's old butt as hard as he could to make sure it was really numb, the force of his blow pressing her flatly onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I'm going to want that body back eventually!  What is it with you destroying perfectly good asses?\"  Linda remarked, her face reddening with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?  I like wrecking asses.\"  He said slyly.  Linda was about to retort when she realized what he meant and instead giggled with excitement.  She wiggled her hips a little, signaling that she was ready for him.  The headhunter lifted her up by the hips and carried her over to the couch.  He picked you up and set you down on a chair facing them, sneering as he set her down on the couch, her chin resting on the arm rest as he positioned himself behind her.  He reached around and grabbed two handfuls of what was your abundant rack and slowly inserted himself into what was your rear!  You cringed as he slid his python in, unsure how the hell Linda, even being Linda, could deal with that huge thing going up there.  After he was in up to his balls he began slowly dragging himself out, taking his time to make sure he didn't rip her apart with the sword between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?!  We're fucking here, not performing brain surgery!  Pick up the pace!\"  Linda taunted, turning her head back as far as she could to glare at him.  You were mortified, the thought of having to put your body on after what was about to happen making you cringe even further.  The headhunter shrugged and began slamming away, causing Linda to grunt with excitement.  He squeezed her boobs harder, making sure to keep his grip on them as tight as he could without damaging them.  Despite how rough it looked, despite how much pain there would be afterward, despite how he was pretty much just raping her... and you hated to admit this... the more you watched the more you wanted to be in Linda's position.  The way the man handled himself, the way he handled your body was making you hot like never before, and you had to bite your lip hard to avoid whimpering at the sight of them fucking on the opposite couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou averted your gaze and caught sight of something that surprisingly was more interesting.  Linda's body, which was thought to be numb, was moving.  It slowly got to it's hands and knees, careful to not make any noise.  You couldn't believe it, Linda still had control of her old body, she had tricked the headhunter!  Man, she can act!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body very carefully rose to its feet, blindly feeling around for what it was looking for.  Linda kept up her banter, keeping the headhunter distracted as her body finally did something.</span></div></div>",

You had heard about this place only recently and it sounded too good to be true, but here you were, about to play a great game of sexy cat and mouse with magic!  You'd always fantasized about something like the blade, something that could cut you down to size a bit.  Though you were always confident in yourself and your figure, it did start to wear on you over time that guys tended to avoid you.  You are a bombshell with silky smooth skin the shade of milk chocolate, a rack that would be an E on an average woman but to you was a D, full black hair that ran down to the bottom of your shoulder blades, and a well defined face that draws attention to your soft blue eyes.  Really you had never had a lack of guys complimenting you on your looks.  What you did have a lack of was not boy friends, but boyfriends.  You hit a growth spurt early in your teens, and by the time you were twenty you towered over most guys at 6'2\".  They always seemed intimidated by you, or afraid that their masculinity would come into question dating a woman of your stature, and though you had learned to cope and had found a few guys who accepted you, mostly extremely tall men, you had always dreamed of being smaller, more vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was your chance!  As the minutes turned to seconds you finished applying your nail polish, setting the kit aside and allowing your toes to dry on the table.

You knew that each of you had your weaknesses and that you'd need to try and protect them.  Ramona wasn't really a physical girl and would have trouble keeping up, Tanya was cocky and could get in over her head, Linda had the build of a stick and wouldn't be able to stand up to the head hunter if she tried, and you were a huge and very obvious target.  In all probability none of you were going to win, but maybe if you all covered for one another you'd be able to last longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to begin reading a magazine when...</span></div></div>",

Her hair and eyes were a light red and deep blue respectively, rounding off her lovely facial package.

Either this Greg guy is the hulk, or this girl... whatever her name is is just pulling our strings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya put her hand on the table.  \"I don't know, she seemed really sincere.

Besides, even if she is in cahoots with the headhunter if we're all together and on the move it'll be harder for him to pick us off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look girls, this woman needs our help, and the more people we have on our team the more likely we are to win this thing.

Would you be his first victim?  Would you get first fuck, when the Head Hunter was at his freshest and most virile?  Oh, it was so exciting!  Unless this was a fakeout, and the real trap was for the three girls locking themselves in a cabin without their biggest, strongest, and most protective teammate... maybe you should stay here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we should probably leave two windows open, and have Tanya watching one and me watching the other while Linda patrols.

They don't make good plans until at least a few of them were killed off, raising the stakes.  You knew she was the smart one, but she should be smart enough to know what's fun.  \"Just stay safe, I'll be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better be.\"  Linda said, surprising everyone present (save for Lika, who didn't know your group dynamics and didn't know what was expected) by standing on her tippy toes and planting a firm, wet kiss on your lips.  You'd never kissed her before, or any woman for that matter.  While you obviously wouldn't have come to an all girl's trip to a fetish role play resort if you were utterly repulsed by the idea that maybe some of you would do something sexual with each other, you were still straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why were you shaking?  When did you close your eyes?  Why were did you whimper a little when she broke off the kiss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for you, my little Lamb.\"  She said, turning her attention to Lika and sauntering towards her.  \"Don't get my girlfriend slaughtered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your girlfriend!\"  You said, blushing.  Why the hell had Linda said that, you two were roommates, not girlfriends!  And were you embarrassed, Tanya and Ramona knew that she was lying and Lika had likely seen so much weird shit working at this place that she couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, my love, you don't need to hide your feelings any more!  If you are so set on risking life and limb to help others, selfless and kind woman that you are, I cannot think to have you perishing with any regrets!\"  Linda said, grabbing your hand and kissing the back of it dramatically.  You recoiled like her spit was acidic.  \"Take care my sweet, and return safely!  Let my worries be in vain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop talking like that!\"  You said.  Grabbing Lika's hand, you pulled the smaller woman toward the door while saying \"Come on, let's go.\"  As you left the cabin behind you, you could hear the girls preparing the defenses, the dragging of heavy furniture and the breaking of boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, where are we going?\"  Lika asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To find Greg!\"  You snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you know where we were attacked?  Because I do, and this is not the way.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped, and realized that you'd been dragging Lika along behind you for a good few minutes without asking for any directions on knowing where you were going.  You'd almost forgotten why you'd left, only that you were leaving Linda.  \"Sorry.  Lead the way.\"  You said, sheepishly releasing the hand of the girl named sheep.  The two of you walked in silence for a few minutes, Lika moving through the forest with the familiarity of someone who'd walked this path a hundred times before.  While you saw one or two distinguishing landmarks that may have allowed her to find her way, a big tree that had been struck by lightning and a rock formation that looked like a fish hook, you were soon enough lost in the woods.  While you knew that getting lost was about the worst thing you could do with the Head Hunter on the prowl, and you were by no means trying to throw the game even if you were making a few bad moves on purpose for dramatic effect, you just couldn't concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're roommates.  Linda's not my girlfriend.\"  You said, wanting to slap yourself in the forehead as soon as you'd said it.  \"Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Just... I'm not... we're not a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not judging you, my sister's a lesbian too!\"  She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a lesbian!\"  You say, louder than you should've with a Head Hunter hiding somewhere in the foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\"  Lika said, pressing a hand to your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her thin wrist and pulling it away with a deliberate force, you much more quietly hiss \"I'm serious, I don't know why she said that, we came on this trip because we're all into NBM, not because we're into each other.  Not that we won't do things together here, because we're here to cut loose and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to break character for a minute?\"  Lika asked, her before American voice suddenly tinged with an Australian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure?\"  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give two shits who you bang.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...okay.\"  You responded, suddenly feeling really stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your friends are all here to have fun, she probably said that she because she thought it'd be a fun bit of story, I didn't look into it any deeper than that an' neither should you. Like you said, you're here to satisfy some kinks.  No one's judging you, just go with the flow have fun.  If anything here bothers you, no matter if it's staff or your friends, then say your safeword and we'll stop the show to deal with it.\"  She said, her tone suggesting she'd delivered this same speech or one very similar to it to countless campers before you, and would give it to countless campers after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I'm sorry.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No apologies, just breathe and let it go.\"  Lika said, taking a long deep breath with you.  \"Now then, do you want me to go back into character, or do you prefer not to roleplay and just have some simple slicey dicey fun without all the storyline faff?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... back to character, please.\"  You said, feeling a little more comfortable about your feelings if it was all understood to be pretend.  \"Wait!  One question first, what's your real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLika scoffed.  \"I'm not about to let some yahoo pervs have my personal details.  Have you lookin' me up on LinkedIn or what have you and spreadin' word that I moonlight for the Impossible Fetish Club during off-seasons.  I'm Lika Lambert, whether you Lika-t or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chortled, slapping her on the shoulder and nearly flooring the much smaller woman.  After straightening herself out and restraining her own laughter, 'Lika' seamlessly switched back to her American voice and said \"Come on, Greg needs our help!  We have to hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Lika, wondering what sort of other jobs she may have if she had 'off-seasons', the two of you jog through the woods for almost half an hour, taking a zigging and zagging path that left you completely turned around.  Eventually, you reached a suspiciously circular clearing in the trees, the grass suddenly knee height despite being bare soil not even a foot outside of the clearing.  \"Greg?  Greg?\"  Lika called out, looking around expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching the tall grass, you discover...</span></div></div>",

For some reason college chicks always start off their vacation taking a dip in the lake.  This one was no exception, as I headed down the hill towards the shore I heard girl laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stealthily creep up to some bushes by the shore to get a closer look.  Behold, four sexy girls in skimpy bikinis completely unaware of my presence distracted and getting in the water.  The last one to get in was the sexiest, judging by the conversation I guess her name was Tanya, she had brown hair french braided into a ponytail that went down to her shoulder blades, an amazing tan figure and wore a black bikini.  She pauses for a moment to send off one last text before putting her phone in her purse by the treeline.....I see my opportunity.  I always go for the prettiest ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya is coaxed into the water by her friends, once she enters it I sneak around to her purse and slip her phone out of it and put it on silent.  I withdraw to a safe distance to remain hidden and watch, but not be heard sharpening my blade.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs twilight arrives the girls retreat from the water and dry themselves still completely unaware of my presence.  I'm just far enough to hear them but not understand what they are saying but they start up the path back to the log cabin they are staying in.  I stalk them on their way up the path, gaining on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reach the cabin I keep hidden as they enter, once they do I take Tanya's phone off of vibrate and place in on the front porch.  I quickly climb onto the low roof and wait, any minute now she will realize it is missing and I will strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the girls talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda, have you seen my phone?\" Tanya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not since the beach\" Linda replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, Ramona?  Have you seen it?\"  Tanya desperately asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" says Ramona<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't leave it at the beach did you?\" questions Jane<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not, can one of you call it real fast?\"  Tanya begs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later her phone starts ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, it must have just fallen out of my purse when we walked in, nothing to worry about.\"  Tanya replies as I hear the front door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya walks out, still clad in her black bikini....now is my chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" She yells as she turns around to head back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drop down behind her, grab her ponytail to hold her head up and swing my blade through her neck in one swift motion.  Tanya moans as her headless body falls tits down and her three friends are startled.  After the initial shock of comprehending what had just happened to their friend, the three other girls bolt for the back door.  I let them go for now, no fun getting them all at once.  Time to play with my prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn her head around so she is facing me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her eyes and looks me over.  Eyeballing my manhood she smiles \"Hi, my name is Tanya!  Looks like you got me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure, you're mine now!\" I stated with an evil smile as I hooked her hair through a hook on my belt.  I picked up her body, brought it in and laid in on the couch then closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"  asked Tanya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we play\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You watch with astonishment as she removes her top without you even asking her to, unleashing her firm C cups.  You turn to her head and smile, winking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles a little, before saying.  \"I can't really fight you from this position, I might as well enjoy myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that it would be best to play with your new captive further away from the other girls, as there'd be less chance of getting ambushed.

You pick up her head and kiss it while you think, her eyes closing as her body grows moist and shivers.

They had planned it with Tanya, in case the Cabin was deemed unsafe.  A site was chosen, which was easily defensible, and one of the girls watched the perimeter beyond then fence of branches the girls built to secure their location.  It seemed despite the loss of Tanya, their position was at least defensible when the Head Hunter found them again in the morning.  It was already twilight and Jane was taking the first watch.  As Jane looked out in the darkness, a naked female figure came running at her.  Jane rose up, wondering who it could be, but heard the sobs.  The sobs sounded like Tanya's sobs.  \"Help!\" She heard her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane ran over to the naked figure, who was covering her eyes to bury the tears that were covering them.  \"What happened?  How did you get away?\" Jane asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He took something from me!\" she spoke.<br>\r\n\"What?!  What was it, are you hurt.  What did that crazy naked Head Hunter do to you?\" Jane asked as she helped carry her friend along as they headed back to camp.  To her surprise, you looked at her with your eyes, part of your head you mounted on Tanya that was still her body below your eye line and said, \"He stole my body!\"  With a swift movement, you pulled out the magic blade you hidden in Tanya's back and used it to cut off Jane's surprised head.  You muffled Jane's screams and spoke softly, \"Two to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ramona and Linda sat around the campfire, they saw Jane leading what was apparently a naked Tanya back to the camp.

Linda asked Tanya, \"What happened to your clothes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story...\" you replied with Tanya's voice as you watched Ramona walk towards Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona asked Jane, \"What's wrong?\"  She then looked with shock to see that there was a reason Jane was staggering, she had no face!  Someone had just taken a black magic marker and drawn eyes, a nose and a mouth on the smooth surface where Jane's visage had once been on her head.  \"Jane, your face!\" Ramona said.  She she heard some muffled shouts coming from Jane, but she couldn't realize how she was doing it.  She had no face after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ramona looked down and saw that below the bottom of Jane's shirt, part of a nude colored elastic sports warp was peeking out from under it.  Ramona pulled up Jane's shirt and as she tried to remove the bandage she found a large bulge on her lower back that the wrap was covering.  As she removed the wrap, she discovered Jane's missing face had been replaced on to her lower back.  \"Run Ramona!  That Crazy Head Hunter stole Tanya's body!\", Jane cried out as the last of the wrap was taken off of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Ramona said, instantly looking over at you (Tanya) to see what you were doing.  You were already behind Linda, pressing the magic blade through her throat as she screamed.  \"Holy Crap on a craker!\" Ramona screamed as she saw your eyes and eye brows were not Tanya's.  \"You cut off the top half of Tanya's head and replaced it with your own.  Then you scalped her with the blade and used her scalp to replace yours!\" Ramona said in horror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's what I did!\" your replied pulling Tanya's pouting lips into a huge grin as you held Linda's severed head up before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run STUPID!\" Linda's head screamed at Ramona.  Ramona took off like a frightened deer as she jumped up some logs and leaped over the edge of the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were more careful and quickly strutted towards and opening in the fence of logs and branches they had built.  You spotted Ramona as she was running as fast as her curvy body could carry her down the trail that lead deeper into the forest.  \"Looks like you aren't going to win as quickly as you thought..\", Linda taunted Markus.  Markus turned to Linda, speaking with Tanya's voice in glee, \"Say, how many College and State women's cross country medals has your friend Tanya won in the past?\"  Linda's face contorted in thought as she replied \"About 10...\"  Suddenly Linda's eyes widened as she realized, \"And you got her body!  But you can't run like her!  Tanya's an athlete!\"  You smiled as you replied as you started up the trail following Ramona that you could see in the distance, \"Funny thing about this blade, I put my head or brain on someones body, and I tend to move like them, walk like them, RUN like them.\"  \"But you can't...  Ramona!\", Linda cried out.  \"She can't hear you from here, Linda.  But don't worry.  I have a feeling when I put Tanya's buns into fifth gear, Ramona will be able to hear you very soon.\" You taunted as you began to run down the trail after Ramona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had previous ran in this body earlier, and you were surprised how fast it actually was.  The goodly sized C cup breasts bouncing as you ran took some getting used too, but you got up to the hill you saw them working on in a much shorter time than when you were just Markus The Headhunter earlier.  You impressed and felt if you had used your own male body to chase her earlier, Tanya would have made you eat her dust.  You held up the knife in your right hand and Linda's head in your left as you felt Tanya's legs surge forward under your full command.  Tanya's bouncing chest and heaving lungs moved rapidly as you pulled air in the runner's lungs to move at her full speed.  A wide grin spread over Tanya's and Yours composite face as you saw you were starting to get nearer to Ramona.  Part of you was thrilled at chasing Ramona, but you felt another something come over your body.  A kind of a bliss.  Suddenly muscles that were starting to register aches and pains, didn't bother you.  You mind focused solely on Ramona, who was still ahead of you, but you were closing the gap between the two of you as her steady pace did not come close to keeping up with the rapid speed Tanya's legs were carrying down the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it seemed like your body was moving in automatic, you could feel Tanya's legs working as they rapidly pumped you forward on the ground, her lung breathing hard, her arms holding up the blade and Linda's head as her shoulders complained with pain about holding them up for that long,  but it seemed for a moment your brain got up to blissfully stretch as it was tired from sitting in the drivers seat.  Then it came to you, you read about this before.  It was called a Runner's High.  Your brain was pumping out endorphins into Tanya's body as it commanded her legs to surge forward.  You were a Sprinter when you were younger and you had experienced endorphins before, but his was much more intense experience.  Then you remembered what you said to Linda, about how the magical blade you used made the bodies your brain was in control of moved the way their previous brains made them move.  Maybe the reverse was happening, your brain was doing what Tanya's body expected of hers and releasing a much more massive amount of endorphins than you had ever previously felt within your own body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to earlier, when Tanya submitted to your sexual demands so quickly.  Sex was part of the package of coming to this camp, but she surprised you when took off her top for you as well as you took advantage of headless body.  Tanya might even get more of high from it than most people if her body's demanding this much endorphins.  It's something he would have to look up later.  Using another person's body was always a learning experience for you.  As good as this felt, you were highly tempted to take up endurance running after your foot healed if you could feel this way again.  Suddenly Linda's head began screaming, \"HEY!  HEY!\"  Your brain jumped back into the drivers seat as it suddenly registered the fact that Ramona was stopped on the trail, her body bent over to catch her breath.   And you were rapidly burning the scant yards away between the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona suddenly looked up and saw you charging forward holding the blade in your right hand and Linda head in your left.  Linda began screaming, \"Run!  He can move fast like Tanya now!  Run you stoopid bit...\" Linda got out, but didn't have a chance to complete the sentence as...</span></div></div>",

Linda growled, \"I was told I was going to get chased around by a well endowed naked slasher man, not some transsexual body thief!\"  You were lifting up Ramona's body to put the blade down her neck, which would allow you to control her body too as long as you head onto the blade.  But Linda's comment annoyed you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hurt my foot, I needed another body to continue the chase.\", you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda rolled her eyes.  \"You think Freddy, Jason, or Micheal Myers would complain about a hurt foot?  You sound like a big wuss to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought came to you to put Linda's head on Ramona's body and leave her there, it was part of plan you were thinking of extending the game and getting back at Linda.  Exhausted as Ramona's body was, Linda wouldn't be able to give you much trouble.  Besides your current body could outrun her anyways.  But you could just take all the heads back to the cabin and win the game, which would send these girls packing home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up Ramona's body and...</span></div></div>",

If you took just her hips, or took her body without any of its limbs, you'd have to use both of your hands to carry her head and whatever part you took, leaving you vulnerable to the lady's if they came after you.  With that in mind, if you took her whole lower half she'd be able to follow you on her own two legs and would be easy to subdue if she tried running or fighting back.  With that in mind you took the blade and pressed it into her waist.  She yelped as the tingling sensation of the magic did its work.  You sliced one straight line across her waist, cutting her in half right above her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou help her legs stand up, moving Tanya's head so that she could see them.  \"Wow, that's...  REALLY hot!\"  She remarked, her legs spreading a bit and wiggling her firm ass for her own amusement.  You hold Tanya's head in her hands and give her instructions on where to move, her naked legs walking in front of the two of you so that Tanya could see where she was going, butt swaying side to side as she marched.  After around ten minutes Tanya gives a startled gasp.  \"I...  I think the girls got my torso.\"  She said, her legs slowing down slightly as she concentrated.  \"Yeah... It's Linda.\"  a gasp \"Definitely Linda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow \"How can you tell?\" you ask in sincere curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her hands.  They're too soft to be Ramona's, and they're too small to be Jane's... that, and they're playing with my boobs.\"  She said, giggling as she informed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's frisky, is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed.  \"Trust me, you don't know the half of it.  There are a legion of guys and girls who were essentially paralyzed from the waist down for months at a time, and when they recovered they STILL came back for more!  She's a wild one, no doubt about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good next target.\"  You remark.<br>\r\nTanya answers.  \"I'd love to have her with us, though I have to warn you that she's a bit... commanding when it comes to fucking.  She's also known for being pretty craft-EEE!\"  She gasped, her legs actually coming to a complete stop and buckling from the unseen treatment that she was getting.  You smile, knowing now who you'd go for next.  You pick up Tanya's legs and carry them over your shoulder the last two minutes, her flaming hot pussy slowly dibbling onto your shoulder as her head continued to moan and yelp.  You make it to a small cave and head in, pressing onto one of the more mundane stones along the side.  The entrance to the cave sealed, and a light turned on, revealing a miniature lair.  More of a fuck den really, just a mattress, some toys (both magical and mortal), some books, and a radio.  You flick on the radio for a brief moment to confirm with the camp that you now had possession of Tanya's head and legs, and that you were hiding out in cave 5 for a private session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set Tanya's legs down on the mattress and watched them squirm, her head now cherry red and panting breathlessly.  \"Hurry!\"  She simply instructed, now wincing.  You could tell that she needed release more than anything, now in physical pain from how much pent up lust she had in her from Linda's toying with her, and you were more than happy to oblige.</span></div></div>",

You set her brilliantly sexy pelvis down and picked up her left leg.  With a quick flick of your wrist you sliced clean through her ankle, causing her left foot to plop down onto the bed.  You tossed the writhing leg aside and picked up its right counterpart, doing the same to it.  You now had her lower half in five pieces, and you were looking to enjoy three of them in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin tickling the soles of both of her feet, causing Tanya to laugh violently.  You keep up your assault, Tanya begging you to stop through her laughing.  After a short while you do indeed stop, and bring the feet over to Tanya's jubilant head.  \"Hey, I'm going to have some fun with these before the main event.  Would you mind cleaning them off for me?\"  You ask, presenting Tanya her dirt covered soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more than happy to help, subserviently licking the dirt off of her feet for your enjoyment.  Eventually not a single speck remained on her scrunched soles, and you could begin.  You placed one foot on either side of your throbbing junk and began sliding them up and down, Tanya's spit acting as a lubricant as you pumped.  You watched as her toes flexed instinctively, moving and squeezing together as you moved her fine feet over your dick.  Before you could blow your load you dropped her feet, the two appendages bouncing on the sponge like mattress as they hit it.  You sat down and lifted her pelvis up, moving so that she could see everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how hot she already was it took pretty much no time at all to bring her to several long awaited orgasms, and soon you came as well, filling up your tiny fuck toy to the brim while the head that controlled it cheered enthusiastically.  For the longest time Tanya was silent, then she slowly panted.  \"Money.  Well.  Spent.\"  You smiled, kissing her on her stove temperature forehead.  \"What now?\"  She asks, weak but excited.</span></div></div>",

I like it!  Well, goodnight then.\"  She said.  You brought her in and kissed her, Tanya kissing back earnestly.  You then got down and fell asleep on the mattress, cradling her warm head to you chest, her breathe soothingly lapping over your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes slowly fluttered open, your internal clock telling you that it was time to wake up.  You yawned and stretched you back out a little,making sure not to let go of Tanya's head, which you were still clutching against your body.  \"Look who decided to wake up!\"  Tanya called out, mock annoyance in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so keen on getting the day started?\"  You asked, running your hand through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I've been up for the better part of an hour and I've only had one thing to look at!\"  She said.  You looked down and saw what she meant.  Her head was facing downward, and you were sporting a rather severe case of morning wood, which was stuck in her immobile line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you like me to fix that?\"  You ask coyly, picking her head up and slowly moving it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask!\"  She responded enthusiastically.  You brought her fully down and then impaled her on your dick.  Despite being nine inches she took you in up to the base, her head lacking any form of gag reflex now that it had no lungs to choke.  You began spinning her head around, her tongue working over you from every angle imaginable, her throat constricting tightly against you.  You grabbed her by the ponytail after two spins and began pulling her up, the weight of her head against her hair causing Tanya a to grunt a little in pain.  When she had only your tip left in her mouth you let go, gravity pulling her head down your shaft.  You burst, your hot semen going up her non existent throat and into... well, the magical science behind it was actually really complicated and you yourself barely understood it.  All the actors just called it \"the void\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you began to soften you you pulled her up by the ponytail again and brought her over to your face, her head slowly swaying over your own.  \"Thanks, I thought I'd never get a taste of that!\"  She said, winking at you.  You both laughed a little, then Tanya spoke.  \"So anyway, I noticed this morning that I actually couldn't feel any of my body parts at all, even the ones in this room.  Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't know?  It was in the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggled her neck a little, the best shrug she could do in her current state.  \"I must've missed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any part that isn't reattached to something after two hours becomes numb and can't be controlled any more until it is reattached.\"  You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright then, good to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want me to put you back together a little?

I know I'm happy to see you. You look so yummy that I could just gobble you up!\" She says, suiting actions to words, using her feet to pull the rest of her closer, spreading her thighs and bending her knees until she's close enough that she can just barely wrap her lips around the head of your dick, taking it into her mouth and sucking on it like a lolly pop as her talented feet continue to pleasure you, trapping your dick between her arches, the wrinkly surface providing extra stimulation, rubbing back and forth, up and down, slowly working the cool velvety skin of her feet back and forth over every inch of your cock, all while giving you a blowjob that would have made a lesser man cum ten times over all on it's lonesome.

Somehow though, you valiantly hang in there, managing to avoid cumming for the moment as Tanya begins to move, flexing at the knees and hips, bouncing her abbreviated form up and down on your shaft, forcing you to use every bit of will power you possess just to keep from blowing your load too early, Tanya's cries and moans of pleasure growing loader and more frantic as she rides you, eventually working herself into an orgasmic frenzy, screaming and thrashing around as the intense waves of pleasure wash through her, her already tight pussy clenching down on you like a fleshy vise. It's too much, and you shoot your load, splattering the inside of Tanya's pussy with great globs of hot sticky cum as she suddenly collapses on top of you like a marionette with it's strings cut, totally spent from her recent efforts, her breath coming in short, panting gasps. Being in much the same shape yourself, neither of you say anything for a moment, content merely to remain close to one another as you slowly recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you feel you're capable of intelligible speech once more, you say \"You, Tanya, are a very special woman.

Wouldn't want the others getting bored now would we?\" Tanya replied, hopping out of your grasp and walking over to the hidden door, then turning and looking at you expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but laugh at the situation. \"In a bit of a hurry are we? Don't you at least want to get cleaned up first?\" you ask, staring meaningfully at her crotch, still dripping with a combination of your seed and her own vaginal secretions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Tanya replied \"Latter.

The only downside of it being that you couldn't fuck any of them while they were whole, or they'd surely become pregnant. Fortunately, once they'd been cut up, that particular function of their bodies was suspended as well, so you could screw them as much as you liked totally risk free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I do.\" you said, grabbing your cock and waving it back and forth in front of her nose, prompting Tanya to try and lick the head of it once more, but you kept it just out of reach. \"Ah ah, first you've gotta say the magic words!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,  place my pretty pink pussy back on my person so you can pleasure me with your pulsing prick!\" She said eagerly, her charming little tongue twister making you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, since you asked so nicely!\" You say, carrying her head over to what remained of her body and setting her down on her down in front of her pelvis a foot from her groin, giving her a perfect view of the action. You walked around and held the part down with one hand and with a quick flick or your wrist you sliced her vagina right off of her crotch, reducing it to a sliver of skin. You tilted Tanya's eager head back and after carefully lining it up so that it can parallel to her face you reattached it. Tanya choked and gasped as she instantly grew as wet as she had been, just short of having an orgasm. \"Oh yeah, forgot to mention.

She orgasms almost immediately, making a bizarre stifled gargling moan as you pumped her up and down. She came just about every other thrust, her overcompensating brain making her more sensitive than she had ever been. You continue to work your toy up and down as she licks the shaft of your cock as well as she can with how badly she was quaking.

The only downside of it being that you couldn't fuck any of them while they were whole, or they'd surely become pregnant.

You walked around and held the part down with one hand and with a quick flick or your wrist you sliced her vagina right off of her crotch, reducing it to a sliver of skin.  You tilted Tanya's eager head back and after carefully lining it up so that it can parallel to her face you reattached it.  Tanya choked and gasped as she instantly grew as wet as she had been, just short of having an orgasm.  \"Oh yeah, forgot to mention.  Your brain was deprived of stimuli for a while, so anything reattached will feel insanely good for about an hour.\"  You explain.  Tanya can't even speak, simply giving off sounds of desperate pleading.  \"You want me to try you out?\"  You ask.  Tanya mouths a yes.  \"Alright.\"  You say, lifting her up.  \"Open wide!\"  She does so and you begin bringing her down again.<br>\r\nJust before her mouth can touch your tool you spin her around and shove yourself fully into her, your manhood poking through the front of her open mouth.  She orgasms almost immediately, making a bizarre stifled gargling moan as you pumped her up and down.  She came just about every other thrust, her overcompensating brain making her more sensitive than she had ever been.  You continue to work your toy up and down as she licks the shaft of your cock as well as she can with how badly she was quaking.  After a while you burst and draw yourself back though her mouth, wiping off your discharge inside of her throat.  \"How was that?\"  You ask.</span></div></div>",

The beheaded Tanya stood up on her stumps, tripping, and landing on her hands and knees. She had no chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detached feet still struggled, but I didn't care. I took both and placed them around my penis; the toes were scrunched down, likely the tanned girl was feeling a bit embarrassed and wanted to be as little involved as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the only thing Tanya thought could do to stop me, was scrunch her toes to pinch the tip of my dick. She probably was trying to get my hard member away from her, believing she was hurting me. So, I started thrust back and forth.

As I place the ball inside the small cut I go on explaining \"You see, the mine records all the cuts I make to your body over the first minute of being inside it.  Then it saves your end-state and arms itself.

I figure the rest could wait until I take her back to my lair, grab her head with both hands. \"I'll just take this...for now...\" I state as I bring her mouth to my dick.  She licks her lips; and just as she tries to open her mouth to say something I shove my manhood in it.  Apparently whatever she was going to say wasn't an objection since she gladly accepted my entire shaft.  As I was moving her head back and forth and upside down she continued to suck and twirl that tongue around my member.  I couldn't hold it anymore and blew inside her throat (what was left of it), she proceeded to willing swallow all of it and licked my dick as I pulled her off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that big boy?\" She said, looking up at me with the cutest face.  \"By the way, my name is Tanya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You definitely know what you are doing Tanya, I knew there was a reason I picked you.  Let's continue this at my place.\" I said as I got up, carrying her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood her body up off the couch \"Can we follow my body?  I need to see where we are going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already planning on that, this ain't my first rodeo.  Just listen to my directions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn we go, back to my lair; her head in my hand and a gorgeous body wearing just bikini bottoms in front of us.  After about an hour hike we finally arrive at the moss covered door in the side of a rock face, this is the entrance to my lair.  I poke an odd shaped stone and a biometric fingerprint reader pops out.  I place my finger on it and the door opens.  I grab hold of Tanya's hand and lead her body in behind us.  Tanya takes a moment to take it all in, in front of her is a large room with an assortment of furniture, computers, and parts of women; most notably my girlfriend and business partner Julia who, at this moment, was nothing more than a head with red hair on top of a pedestal in the middle of the room. Julia had a multitude of wires leading to her neck so that she could control all the computers in the room.  \"Tanya, meet my girlfriend Julia.  Julia, this is our partner for this round Tanya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I already know who she is, I watched her suck your cock.  She has skill and potential.\"  Julia goes on \"You see Tanya, think of this like the movie The Hunger Games.  There are camera's everywhere and the landscape can be changed at will.  I am interfaced with and in control of all the computers that make that possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya reacts, \"If you control all of this with just your head, where is your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a nightclub in town that we have a special contract with.  They have a section in the back for premier members of the club; where they get a selection of private rooms, women and magical blades.  Use your imagination what goes on there, but my body is there collecting tips for favors.\" Julia informs.  \"It's been a slow night so far though, but let's just say it's a good thing you can't get pregnant while cut-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't get knocked up when separated?\"  Tanya excitedly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, bodily functions don't work normally for any part of you.  You don't need air, food, water; you don't have to go to the bathroom, nothing.  Sure you can eat, breath and drink if you want, but nothing happens if you don't want t...\" Julia gets cut off by a sudden moan of ecstasy, shortly followed by more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Tanya's perspective she couldn't see where it was coming from so I lifted her head so she could.  In the back of the room there was my very ornate California King bed, on top of it lay the naked top half of a beautiful asian girl with purple hair rubbing her huge tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tell Tanya \"Don't mind her, that's Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she is having a good time at the club as well?\" Tanya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no, she has a very unique story.  She was a camper like you once, but came back a couple months after her stay.  It turns out her brother is military and got deployed.  Just after that he got a 'dear john' letter from his fiance. Kim didn't want her brother to feel lonely so she asked me to cut her in half and mail her lower half to him saying they were for his enjoyment from a secret admirer.  Since then she has disclosed to her brother whose legs they are, apparently he didn't care because she still gets some at least three times a night.  In payment I get to keep her top half until he comes home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya replies \"Man, that's love!  I wonder what it would feel like to have sex with my brother when he is thousands of miles away.  I gotta try it sometime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come get to know her, maybe you might become close friends\" I say as I carry her head and lead her body to my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to be close friends with someone so loving like her, but she's in no mood for chatting, you're just looking for an excuse to get me in bed aren't you mister?\" Tanya states quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but not like that.\" I reply as I once again pull out the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya lays her body tits up on the bed \"Well how then would you like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise Tanya's head up and place it on the bed post so she can see her body and Kim right next to her.  \"Well, first, you can't infiltrate the other girls if you don't have some body part missing.  They are expecting you...different.  Second you wanted to get close with Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I like where this is going\" Tanya excitedly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one quick motion I separate Tanya just above her belly button.  \"I'm going to join you with her like a card queen, minus your head.  Be prepared, when this happens your nerves with merge with hers and vice versa.  This merging is limited only to the parts that are connected, so you will be able to feel her breasts but not her brother ramming her.  Likewise she will be able to feel yours. However, neither of you will be able to control what the other's parts do. Now since I am about to fuse your top half with hers, this means your spine will fuse as well, which, from what I have heard that the feeling is quite intense but enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds kinky,\" Tanya flirts \"I love kinky, let's do...\" Tanya stops her sentence as both she and Kim both let out a scream of erotic job as I place Tanya's upper half upside down where Kim's lower half should be.  It was obvious Kim was still getting railed by her brother when the two joined, but now Kim's hands started fondling Tanya's breasts while Tanya massaged Kim's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is just for you\" I tell Tanya as I grab her head and place it on her lower half.  With ease I pull Tanya's panties off to discover a nicely shaven and very wet pussy.  The scene before me is AMAZING!  Tanya's head now meets with her naked lower half and Kim now has Tanya's upper half to mirror her abbreviated form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya is much lighter in her much shorter form.  \"Get on with it and FUCK ME!\" She screams as Kim moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gladly ram my shaft into her warm, moist, succulent pussy.  At first I let her be on bottom, but why not just let her do it all?  I lift her truncated form up with ease and lay down next to Kim, letting Tanya ride me like a mechanical bull; both girls are moaning and groping each other's sensitive tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally blow my load deep inside Tanya, she climaxes as I do it.  She leans forward and places her head on my chest while she allows my cock to slowly slip out; I notice her ponytail runs between her ass-crack and goes on down between her still spread legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spend a couple minutes laying there and enjoying each other's flesh until Tanya finally pipes up \"That was GREAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fun's over now though\" yells Julia from across the room.  \"There are still three girls out there and from what my cameras tell me, they have the other blade.  You have to get out there and talk them into dismembering themselves so they can't use it on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, well can we play more with the blade later?\" Tanya asks me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but next time we will do it with your friends as well.\" I explain.  I pull her off me and get up out of the bed.  \"Before you go though, I need collateral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tanya wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This\" I say as I take the blade one again, very carefully slicing her pussy off like peeling an orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I peel her lips off Tanya shudders.  \"What are you going to do with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim?\" I ask.  The asian looks at me seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind holding onto this?\" I ask as I carefully place Tanya's vagina where her head used to connect to her shoulders (opposite Kim's head).  This allows be to fuck both Tanya and Kim as they are now one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, I don't think my brother would be jealous.  I mean, after all he has the real one and I sure as hell don't mind another dick in me.\"  Kim quips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how am I supposed to have fun with the girls if my pussy is here?\"  Tanya worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, they are going to eventually arrive here.\" I explain with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya gets directions from Julia, they have a long kiss between each other and Tanya heads out to find her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what to do to pass the time.</span></div></div>",

I liked to rip their heads off, Julia liked to remove their limbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just pretend, what do you say?\"  She replied peeling off her shirt, revealing her bra and giant cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unzip the backpack \"That's just it!\" I pull out Julia's head \"We don't have to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" Says Julia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the!?!?!  AWESOME!\" Barbie reacted  \"I've experienced every other thing a doll can experience, but I've never been taken apart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to watch this!\"  Julia said excitedly as I set her on a bedside table to watch me take her limbs off! I reach down underneath the mattress and pull out a magic blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this could make my previous offer to give you head more interesting.\" Barbie replies as she rubs her neck quickly, as if wondering what it would be like to lose her head.  She removes her skirt, bra and panties lays down on the bed \"Go ahead, play rough with me master!\"</span></div></div>",

I have added the maximum allowed 5 options to every single chapter and have deleted as many short \"more options\" style chapters that I reasonably could (because the new 5 options makes those chapters somewhat redundant), and I have combined a few short chapters with uninteresting choices (ones that would never be taken) into longer continuous chapters to reduce bloat. Before this update, this story had 143 chapters. Now, that has been reduced to 119.  I would like to emphasize that very few chapters were truly \"lost\". Most of the reductions were simply compiling \"options\" chapters where possible (unfortunately there were a few big string that couldn't be compiled, but all that could be were), combining strings of very short chapters into more substantial chapters, I will not be doing another large-scale update pass on this story for a long time, if ever, as this process was time consuming, exhausting, and I still have 1 more stories to get to (though I will be taking a break from this update process before tackling the last story). That said, I will be implementing a new rule, or rather I will be updating an existing rule:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--From now on I will update all chapters posted without 5 branches to have 5 branches. If you have specific ideas for what you want the extra branches to be, please email me with a link to the chapter you posted and the options you would like added. If you do not do this within 24 hours, I will create the options myself. If you do not like the options I created, email me what changes you'd like me to make at any time and I will update the choices, assuming they haven't been taken.--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will obviously be exemptions to the 5 chapter rule, such as when you are ending a particular storyline or if there really is no reasonable way to make more than a certain number of options (even with \"Reader's choice\"), but overall I hope to expand the freedom and possibilities people can take in my stories by providing more choices, while also reducing the guff people have to go through to reach content by eliminating as many repetitive \"options\" chapters as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please send me a message.  Thank you, and happy posting!<b></b></b></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You and three of your friends have signed up for a special vacation at a remote resort called \"Camp Chop\", a fetishist camp that allows you to cosplay as hapless campers on the run from an insane head hunter!  None of you can be permenantly harmed, no real pain (apart from mild cuts and bruises if you ask real nicely!) is inflicted on you, and you are all fully aware of the situation, making it all the more fun!  There are four of you in total, all bursting at the seams to try out anything and anyone ;P<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the campers:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda;  Linda is five foot six with light hazel hair, pale skin, and a petite frame.  A thin waist, B cup breasts, and a fair butt disguise her true perverted nature!  Linda is a wild one, is unpredictable, and is willing to do anything, even get captured by the headhunter if need be to satisfy her libido.  She is quite dominating in private!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya;  Tanya is five foot nine with brown hair, tanned skin, and a highly athletic frame.  She sports a C cup, girl abs, and a very tomboyish attitude.  She likes to be the leader and takes any challenge head on, though she is not above the ocassional underhanded prank or two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona;  Ramona stands in at five foot four and wears her long blonde hair in a ponytail.  A pair of round spectacles cover her round face.  She pushes into DD territory and doesn't mind showing it off, nor her little round belly.  Despite her looks she is actually one of the smartest girls among them, and likes to plan out every detail of a situation before taking action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane;  Jane stands at an impressive six foot two, and has the build of an amazon.  Her jet black hair, black skin, and D cups are beautiful to behold.  Jane is a loyal friend and always looks out for their interests first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well, the headhunter is-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus:  six foot even with a well muscled and well endowed body (nine inches).  You love your job, and love cutting some people up, though you also love the chase.  You sometimes intentionally let them get away, minus a body part or two, just to toy with them further.  You like to go into the arena wearing nothing but a belt for their heads and your knife, as well as some war paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules of the game are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  The killer is armed with a magic blade that can cut through the human body, yet not harm it.  It instead leaves smooth skin that is sensitive to the touch.  The body part can be reattached at any time, and is still under the owners control for two hours, though it will go numb and will be unable to move after that time unless reattached.  Parts can be reattached to any person, even people who the part did not belong to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The four campers are dropped off in the cabin, and have an hour to get comfortable before the head hunter arrives!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  The head hunter's job is to sever each girls head and wear it around his belt.  Once he has all four heads on his belt and none of the girls still have a connection to their body the game ends and he is the victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.  Hidden somewhere in the cabin or the forrest around it their is a second magic blade that the girls can use against the killer, and if the girls manage to cut off his head and keep it away until his bodystops moving they win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.  If the girls give themselves up they can be assistants of the headhunter, though he will still take their heads once all the other girls are found and captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.  No one is \"out\" of the game until the game is over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for the story:<br>\r\n1.  NO DEATH!  THIS IS COSPLAY OR LARP, PEOPLE GENRALLY DON'T GET KILLED DOING THAT, EVEN IF THESE GIRLS DO GET CUT TO PIECES!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  Sex is fine and ecouraged, and can be lesbian, straight, or even gay.  How can it be gay with only one male character?  Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  You can add in new characters!  They all must work for the camp, and will remain in their given character barring extreme circumstances.  They can either try to help the girls last longer, or be secret helpers of the Headhunter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Try to use every of the 5/3/2 options available, if you can't think of anything, leave it as a reader's choice. From 6/28/2020 until at least 12/31/2020, Story owner will create additional options for all non-ending chapters so all chapters have 5 options. If you would like specific options to be added, email story owner. If you take issue with added options, email story owner.</td>",
