The light glows brighter and brighter until it eventually materializes into a new form. With it a strange, male, Mobian cat, wearing nothing but a top hat and a tuxedo walks out of the newly formed tent. This man, is Mezarro, ring master of the Cosmic Circus<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....Well this place sure feels familiar. Have I probably crossed into a similar dimension? Oh well, no matter. The show must go on after all~ \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his hat, Mezarro soon sends out his trusted raven drone out into the world once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go my dear...you know what to do. Besides, we do need to set up for the big opening after all. Heh heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven nodded to him, before flying off to search for a suitable set of \"guests\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, as if on cue, Mezarro's ears were filled by the sound of footsteps approaching the entrance to the expanded tent. He pokes his head out to see a new guest make their way to the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Who's coming?)</span></div></div>",

One of them was a very young looking fox cub with yellow-orange fur wearing nothing but white gloves and a pair of red-and-white sneakers. The other was a surly looking, teenaged black hedgehog with patches of red on his quills wearing nothing but white gloves with black cuffs and red tongues, a pair of shoes which also and black cuffs and red tounges, and gold rings around his wrists and ankles. The fox cub appeared to be excited to be there, while the hedgehog just scowled with his arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezarro quickly walked out to greet them. \"Welcome; dear travellers! Welcome to Mezarro's Circus of Wonders! I am Mr. Mezarro, the owner of the Circus!\" He bowed while tipping his hat. \"I assume you are here to have some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox cub happily answered: \"Yes; we are!\" The black hedgehog let out a huff full of contempt. The cub looked over at his companion with a face that was somewhere between irritated and sad. \"Or; at least I am.\" he continued. \"My name is Tails. And the sourpuss over there is Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe that you managed to talk me into this.\" grumbled Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Shadow; this will be great!\" said Tails. \"All of our friends agreed that you need to smile more often. And what better place to do that than in a Circus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow mumbled something indecipherable, but didn't argue with the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezarro smiled to himself. 'So; Shadow doesn't smile often? Let's see if I can't manage to turn that frown upside down.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured towards the entrance. \"Please; do enjoy yourselves here! I hope you have a good time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails excitedly walked towards the tents, with the still scowling Shadow following reluctantly behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails and Shadow walked down the path filled with different kinds of tents. Tails was happily looking at all of the different signs while Shadow just huffed. After a moment, Tails went over to Shadow, pointed at one of the tents and said: \"Hey; let's go in there first!\" Shadow looked up at the sign above the tent. It said...</span></div></div>",

We have been through too much together with Sonic to not be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tolerate others; that's all,\" growled Shadow, \"but I am not 'friends' with you or anyone else; especially with that blue faker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's precisely why I want us to go in there,\" said Tails. \"You need to be more friendly with others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine on my own,\" replied Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" said Tails, \"but that's why you need to open up; if only just a little. You can't go through life without having at least one close friend and since Rouge was unavailable, and we all know how much you dislike Sonic, we decided that it should be me that went with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow grumbled something unintelligeble, but didn't object right away. He couldn't believe that he had been persuaded into coming here, and with Tails of all people, but they had managed to make him promise it and he did keep his promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he muttered just loud enough for Tails to hear him. \"We're going in, but only for a short while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" exclaimed Tails as he went into the tent. Shadow scowled as he reluctantly followed Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent was full of various things; there were several large mirrors propped up in a row, a bunch of different kinds of devices, a table with something that looked like potions on it, something that looked to be a Lazer-Tag labyrinth, and various other stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was currenly busy with reading a sign placed just in front of the entrance. Shadow decided to read it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt said: 'This is the Friendship Funhouse. Everything in here is designed to make everyone understand each other a lot better than they already do. We hope you'll enjoy the experience.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Shadow?\" smirked Tails. \"This place is perfect for us! By the time we exit this tent, we'll know each other much better, making us better friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that will ever happen,\" sneered Shadow as he followed Tails over to...</span></div></div>",
