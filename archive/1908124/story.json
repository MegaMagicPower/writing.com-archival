It's a place that's said to utterly rejuvenate one's body and brighten their mind, to the point that they feel young again. Curiously it isn't particularly expensive, and even more curiously is that you must be over sixteen years of age to visit, but those who do go there will find that the staff consists entirely of young boys about twelve and under who're distinctively pre-pubescent (though not necessarily lacking in musculature). Of course most people don't realize this until they get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resort has all the amenities you could think of, and even some that you wouldn't think of. All have unique ways of transforming guests, but not as much as the resort as a whole (in other words you can't transform out of childhood).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Characters)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Smith; 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa Anderson; 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter Jacobs; 76<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana Hutcherson; 76</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a story about a character who travels to a mystical hotel that transforms all its guests into pre-pubescent boys about twelve years old and younger; shota in other words. This hotel also contains a gateway to the Realm of Eternal Youth, a world where everyone is a child and nobody grows old. It's much like the real world, just everyone's a kid. There can be other transformations, but never aging over twelve-years old. The character must remain a young boy, even if they were originally a girl (though there's probably a Loli Island and the Eternal Youth world has both genders, so they can switch to a young girl there if they want, but only if they were originally a girl).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules and Guidelines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Proper spelling and grammar, to the best of your ability, at all times.<br>\r\n2. Make sure to avoid one sentence chapters unless you want to extend choices a little bit, but only extend choices once, or at best twice.<br>\r\n3. Be sure to be descriptive about events. One of the main parts of writing is description.<br>\r\n4. Sex is allowed. I'm no fool, I know shota does have erotica extensions, so sex is fine. Just try to be realistic about it (no ten year olds with giant penises), and don't be too descriptive.<br>\r\n5. Ultimately though don't feel limited by transformation and erotica. Let's see more aftermath of the change. Let's see some drama.<br>\r\n6. You don't have to have a character visit the Realm of Eternal Youth. If you want to do something else with a character, fine, just be creative and make sure they remain a kid throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that's all. Don't be afraid to have these kids in strange situations either. Just because some of them may look eight or ten or twelve doesn't mean they actually are those ages numerically.</td>",
