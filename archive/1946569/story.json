Today was no different, as you stumbled and climbed over the different trees in the park. From your higher vantage point you noticed something in one of the bushes. \"Hey what's that?\" You leapt from your perch and took a look in the bush, thinking you'd found something cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted it from the dirt. \"An amulet.\"  It fit nicely around your neck. Maybe you could sell it at a pawn shop and make a bit of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as cool as mine!\" Rachel said, now sporting an identical amulet. Identical, save for the fact yours was blue and hers was red. As you turned to her, as sudden light struck you from her amulet. Everything went red for a fraction of a second and then you looked around yourself. You were standing on a really big leaf. It was the size of a field to you. You realised that you had been shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan? Dan? What happened? Oh my god, Dan! Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's enormous face loomed like the moon, as she lifted the leaf to her face to inspect you. \"You must have shrunk, you're like a speck! What are we gonna do?\" She tilted the leaf to get a closer look at you. In doing so, she caused you to slide down the leaf. You were hurtling towards her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on something soft and wet. You slowly got to your feet and began to look around.

Cindy had long black hair, brown eyes, and was really skinny. While you were eating and having a good time, you both notice a shimmer in your food, as if it was from something shiny. You and Cindy pick the strange objects up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you ask with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like an amulet,\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that, the amulets started to glow incredibly bright. You were blinded by the light and covered your eyes. When you opened them again, you realize that the world was absolutely huge, and that you were about half an inch tall. You landed right next to Cindy's lunch tray, and tried to get her attention. When she took notice of you, she took a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like a piece of food is trying to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't recognize you, as she picked you up and put you in her mouth. You were afraid of being chewed by her perfect teeth, but after her tongue moved you to the boulder-sized(to you) teeth and she chewed on you, you found that you were not harmed in any way. You realize that the amulets not only made you shrink, but also made you indestructible as well. That was a good thing, for the most part. You still had Cindy's stomach to look forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out of Cindy's mouth into the outside world and found out that you would never see it again. Cindy, after much chewing, eventually tilted her head back. You fell towards her throat, and tried to grab hold of something to stop yourself, but everything was much too slippery for you to get a good grip. You then heard a large GULP as you were swallowed by Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride down the throat seemed like minutes, the muscles pushing you down rhythmically. You finally reached the stomach and were deposited into the hot chamber. Since you were indestructible, the acids obviously don't harm you. You could hear Cindy talking to some friends on the outside, possibly wondering where you went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she will never know where you are, nor will anyone else. You help yourself to some food still in the stomach, despite the saliva coating. You decided to try to make the best out of the situation you were currently in. Since you seemed destined to live in Cindy's stomach for the rest of your life, you might as well make do with what you got.</span></div></div>",

After tasting it, you realized it was a red apple. Her stomach began partly filling up with the decently tasty mush, and as you sat back, some acid splashing on you, still leaving you unharmed, you realized that you could potentially live here.

He was a fun guy to hang with and you two sure made some fun memories together when you were a kid. Because of his odd behaviour, not many relatives came, except for you, your cousin, and the relatives that hope to gain something from his will. It was amazing that you took a day off from your busy workplace, but there wasn't work to do at the moment and the boss accepted your leave of absence. The funeral went on for a long time and eventually, everyone went outside so they can bury him. Once again, they had everyone say their piece, which went by quickly, and they began to bury him. You don't remember what you said, probably not important, and everything afterwards, as you find yourself stuck inside the office of an attorney with everyone present, minus the priest.<br>\r\n\"So, what did his will say in short?\" One of your aunts(?) asks, as the lawyer takes out his files and searches through them.<br>\r\n\"Seeing how everyone just got back from a funeral, I'll go through as quickly as I can, so you can grieve properly at home,\" he says, oblivious to the others' lack of care and heighten greed they show off their faces.<br>\r\n\"The vultures will probably get nothing, knowing Gramps!\" An all too familiar voice you know too well, quietly whispers to you, snickering at her comment.<br>\r\nThat voice belongs to your cousin, Shelly, whom you disliked, even as a kid. She was a tomboy and loved making you squirm, by eating gross things in front of you and gassing with her emissions. She was a stick back then, despite being older than you by three years, but over the years, she fatten up to bear large breasts, butt, and her trademark gut, which was straining her clothes. She was beautiful back then and even now, most people would gawk at her for her beauty, even at the age of 29. Besides you, she was the one that cared for her grandpa the most. <br>\r\nHearing both yours and Shelly's name being called, you both perk up and are given two amulets. Both were big, heavy lumps of reddish metal and quite ugly, the only difference being the color of the gem, a dark violet with one while the other was a sickening shade of orange. Accepting as his gift of inheritance, you both take it, yours the orange  one while Shelly's was the violet one, and the lawyer announces that was all there was, Grandfather Peter's home being sold to cover his debts while he had nothing else of value.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's all?\"<br>\r\n\"Positive, and now, if you excuse me, I have to deal with a woman suing her cat for embezzlement from her husband's company,\" he answers, rushing out to deal with his next client.<br>\r\nEnraged, they all leave, glaring at you two until it was just you two alone. You prepare to go home, but Shelly stops you.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Rick! Don't be like that! If it's about the past, how'll we forge...\"<br>\r\n\"Easy for to say, when you're the one who was doing the raping, when I asked multiple times for it to stop and nobody believed me when I told them that afterwards! It nearly ruined my life!\" You retorted, trying to control your anger, and again, you try to leave.<br>\r\n\"Let's just visit his home, for his sake. Please!\" The fat woman pleads with you, begging you with her puppy eyes, that still work.<br>\r\n\"Fine, but after this, I'll never see you again, got it?\" You said, Shelly nodding her head, and the both of you leave the funeral home leave, unaware of the gems faintly glowing in your grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen do you shrink?</span></div></div>",

You fumbled through the brush, following the sound of his voice, your long, braided hair thumping against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Connor had deeply entwined history together, even for your brief years of life. For starters, you and Connor were born on exactly the same day. Your first birthday was the day Connor was born. You were seven now, Connor six. He and your uncle and aunt lived just down the road from yours, so you were always coming over to one another's houses to play. You trick-or-treated together, celebrated Christmas and Easter together. You shared birthday parties. You even went to the same pre-school. Suffice it to say that, even though Connor had some habits that got on your nerves, the two of you were tight. It was almost as if you were destined to stay together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, you were playing \"forest explorers.\" Connor's backyard was part of a thick forest of trees; it was your favorite place to play even if your parents were always concerned about the two of you getting lost. You hopped over fallen logs and ducked under branches, venturing deeper into the woods, to the place where you heard Connor's voice. He was always calling after you to show you something interesting, usually an exotic bug or snail he'd found. (He would generally proceed to eat said bug, just to gross you out.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, look, look!\" You came upon him crouched over the big, hollowed-out stump of an oak tree. \"I found real treasure!! Look!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you,\" you said, but your voice trailed off as you peeked over the edge of the stump and saw, in its depths, two glowing jewels. One glinted a fiery red; the other's cool blue hue reminded you of the sky on a sunny day. You reached in, grasping for the gems, but as you felt around inside, your fingers wrapped around fine silvery chains. They were amulets, meant to be worn. \"Woah,\" you marveled as you held them up; even the gems' metal setting and chains gleamed coolly in the verdant light that filtered down from the leaves above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't they neat!\" Connor was practically bouncing up and down in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we show them to our parents?\" you asked. You were always the more reserved, practical one of the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck no!! These are gonna be our secret treasure!! They'll be like, our buddy charms!!\" His grubby hand darted toward yours and abruptly he yanked the red amulet out of your hand. \"This is the one I want!!\" Of course he'd go for the red one; red was his favorite color. He threw it around his neck and let it dangle against his chest. You always preferred blue, yourself, so you had no problems with this arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you slipped the blue amulet's chain around your neck, a strange reaction occurred. Connor's amulet started to glow, casting a hot red light over the both of you. You opened your mouth to speak, but within the blink of an eye, the gleam of the amulet turned blinding. \"Con--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ray shot out from Connor's chest, refracting against your own, blue amulet. The sheer force of the radiant blow knocked you to the ground. Your vision went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fluttered, and you slowly stirred to consciousness. When you pushed yourself up from the ground, you realized something was terribly wrong. You were laying against a huge maple leaf... And the giant shadow of your cousin loomed over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Just how small had you shrunk down to be?)</span></div></div>",

You think. You didn't get to the \"measuring\" unit in school yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful sense of vertigo brings the taste of bile into your throat and sets your head a-spin as you're lifted up; you close your eyes, letting it come and pass. When you open your eyes again, you are face-to-face with your cousin's... well... face. His mouth is slightly agape as he looks at you, his warm breath washing over you when he exhales. He inhales and you can feel the rush of air against your body as it's sucked into his mouth. When he speaks his voice is small, tight and scared, even though it's deafening to you: \"Did... did I do this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl up in Connor's hand, clutching at the amulet around your neck. It's still warm with residual heat from the blast. It sets in--this is real. This isn't just a dream. \"I-I think you did,\" you say slowly. \"Or, I guess, we both did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor's lip quivers; his wide eyes are watery. \"I didn't m-mean to!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your hands out, rushing to reassure him. \"No no, Connor, it's ok! Don't--don't cry. Ok? I'm ok, see, I'm not hurt at all!\" You stand up shakily on the soft surface of his palm, doing a little pirouette. \"Ta-da! I'm fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems, briefly, to reassure him, but his eyebrows furrow, as other concerns run through his mind. Perhaps the same ones running through yours. Is there any way to change you back? Or are you stuck like this? Forever? How are you supposed to live when you're the size of a bug, and as small and fragile as one? Being a tiny person sounds like fun in storybooks, but right now you're just scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Of course, neither of you has any inkling of the amulets' true power or purpose...)</span></div></div>",

You look up to Connor expecting a concerned face or a face that is looking for you, but to your unfortunate suprise, it didn't, Connor's face was one of Hunger. You then look to see Connor's massive hand come with a spoon, you watch in horror as that spoonful of cheerios is brought to Connor's face and instantly divoured.

Lemme out!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor is breathing heavily; you peer through the cracks in his hand and see him, with his free hand, taking off the amulet. He spins it in his hand by the chain and lets it sail through the woods--in a flash, it is gone; a gleam in the distance and then no more as the forest swallows it. You scream. \"Connor!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't have to tell 'em what happened!!\" He looks down into his hand at you, his eyes gleaming with a strange light. You instinctively know his intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Connor! No!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand rushes up toward the black, gaping hole of his mouth, and you are thrown onto the hot, spongy surface of his tongue. You struggle, but his tongue fights back, curling and squeezing around your body. His hot, smelly saliva slathers you. What light beams into this dark, hot cave peeks through the cage of his crooked baby-teeth--but even this light disappears as his lips close. You feel gravity shift around you. It's all happening so fast--no. No. \"No! <i>Please! NO!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumble into a dark, cramped space. Muscles seize you, crushing your body tightly, and you're sucked down to the tune of a deafening *GULP*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip down his gullet is at once ages long, and only seconds. You can't breathe in the suffocating embrace of his throat. Let alone move. You try to scream, but as you slip deeper into his body, surrounded by the frenetic hammering of his heart, you realize you're never going to be heard. And then--all of a sudden--it's over. You drop into a waist-high pool of viscous slime. In the darkness you only realize what it is by the smell. Connor's lunch--peanut butter and banana sandwiches. Pulverized to unrecognizability by the pushing, shifting, gurgling walls of your surroundings. Connor's stomach. You push against the goo-coated wall. This is really Connor's stomach. Your own cousin swallowed you alive, and no one but him will ever know. You're a prisoner inside his belly.</span></div></div>",

It didn't matter anyway because Connor was already lowering close to his open mouth. \"Connor! No! Stop! Ahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor dropped you onto his tongue and closed his teeth and his lips behind you, trapping you in darkness. Using his tongue, Connor bounced you over the inside of his mouth, squishing you against the roof of his mouth, against his cheeks and his teeth, sucking on you and enjoying your flavor. You screamed, but was cut off when his saliva entered your mouth alongside Connor's moans of pleasure at your taste. Then, lifting his tongue, you went sliding down to the back of Connor's throat. He opened his mouth one more time so you could see the last view of daylight you would ever see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connor! No! NOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GLURK!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor's esophagus muscles grabbed your feet and dragged you down his throat, the sensation making him moan again. You screamed as the muscles squeezed you on all sides, suffocating you so much you couldn't scream. After a short time, you felt your feet kick in the open air, then you were dropped into the cavernous pit of your little cousin's stomach. You splashed down in a thick, murky liquid that was warm to the touch, and his stomach gurgled upon your arrival. A rush of air erupted up Connor's threat and out of his mouth, making him giggle as he rubbed and pat his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're going to stay in there until you've learned your lesson,\" Connor said playfully, patting his tummy one more time before...</span></div></div>",

The playful little giant took advantage of your size by swallowing you whole, and all because you ate his lunch! Okay, that one was on you, but still, eating you the way he did was taking it too far! Even if it was a joke, this wasn't funny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were lamenting your plight, you heard the distinct sound of swallowing right above where you were. Just as you turned your head up to see what it was, you were met with masticated food splattering all over your face. It smelled like Connor's spit, there was also peanut butter and banana mixed in with it. Connor must've made himself a peanut butter and banana sandwich! You screamed as two more big bites filled up what little space you had in Connor's stomach. You waded over to the stomach wall and pounded on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connor, please stop! Stop eating while I'm here! It's so disgusting, I'm gonna throw up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Connor's only response was a little giggle as he patter his belly, bumping you back into the growing marshy mess of his digestive acids and melting food. \"Sorry, tummy toy! Guess I shoulda told ya I was hungry first! Hey, at least you'll be able to eat while you're down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dry heaved at the thought of eating what your cousin ate. \"Oh, by the way, I'm having milk with my sandwich so you might wanna hold your breath for a bit. Here you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard the sound of multiple gulps as Connor drank his milk straight from the glass. Just as you swam away from the stomach sphincter, you were splashed down into the liquid with enough milk to fill seven, maybe eight gallon jugs your size! You swam up to the surface and coughed and gagged. The stomach walls pulsed as it released a belch of mighty air up your cousin's throat and out of his mouth. You felt your liquid prison jostle as he patted his belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh~ that was filling!\" your cousin said oh-so-innocently to himself. \"I hope you enjoy your lunch, buggy. I wouldn't want you to go hungry now, would i?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, starvation, drowning, or dehydration was more preferable than this torture. You felt emotionally deflated, the trauma of your misfortune finally taking its tool. You wished for death, but at the same time, you wished to live. To Connor, you were nothing now, nothing but a tiny toy your cousin swallowed whole to keep in captivity inside his growing body. You were trapped in the young boy's stomach, and there was nothing you can do now...</span></div></div>",

Inside the box, mysteriously, were two amulets, one blue and one red. You take the blue one because it's your favorite color and he obviously gets the red one. Joey takes a bite of his sandwich on a plate next to him, gulping it down quickly as he examined his new toy. *BUUUURRRRPPP* Joey let out a loud, digusting belch. You always hated when he burped like that, and the fact that he was bigger than you despite being younger. He also would eat just about anything edible he could get his hands on, even some things that weren't edible, which you found absolutely disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you put your amulet on, so did Joey, and the two reacted to having human possessors as they were built to do. The blue one was built to make the wearer indestructible and completely invulnerable to physical pain, but the red one...the red one gave a much different power...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red amulet glowed with a brilliant light, unlike the blue one, which kept a soft brightness about it. Joey bragged about it to you. \"Mine glows more than yours! Ha ha ha!\" He pointed the jewel of the amulet in your face, and activated its mysterious power...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in what appears to be a sea of giant carpet fibers. Because it is a sea of giant carpet fibers. They go up to about your waist, so your face is completely unobstructed in viewing the colossal, towering body of Joey, trying to find you after you disappeared when he shoved the red amulet at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis giant bare feet stomp closer to you, and the glow of his amulet reveals you to him, except, he thinks that you are...</span></div></div>",

Because you retained your amulet (seeing as it shrunk with you), you were unharmed but immensely terrified from the fall. You got up and realized that your amulet must save you from feeling pain or dying, and that the two are meant to work together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye bye, bug!\" Joey put the bread back, picked up the large piece of sandwich, and shoved it in his mouth. It was very warm inside, and his chewing freed you from being trapped. You fell onto his saliva-coated tongue and quickly too were covered in wet, sticky saliva. In his ravenous chewing with his mouth open, you got quick glimpses of his bedroom (where you were the whole time before he ate you) and realized that was the last you would ever see of the real world. Your hand got caught under one of Joey's massive teeth as he swished his food around and chewed it for the last few times, but of course, you weren't hurt at all and Joey just thought that the hard thing he felt between his teeth was your \"bug shell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed for dear life as he pushed the mashed-up food and you to the back of his throat, and then, *GULP*, you were sent on a one-way trip down into the boy's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GUUURRRGGLLE* Joey's belly rumbled as you and the food were deposited into his cavernous stomach, full of a soupy mixture of his past bites of sandwich, and stomach acid. You fell right in and struggled to swim back up to the surface. You were surprised to find that you weren't affected by the burning acids or even the horrible smell inside your cousin's stomach, but then quickly realized it was the amulet at work once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of the situation as best you could, you waded over to a semi-solid piece of...something and sat on it, watching gas bubbles rise up from the lake (the amulet gave off great glow now, after being set in use).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP* \"Ahh...\" Joey burped and patted his stomach. \"I hope you're having a nice time in there, bug!\" Joey spoke to his tummy, specifically to his special snack, and rubbed his belly thinking about the bug digesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the bug was not digesting at all. In fact, you found it weirdly relaxing, sitting on that slowly-digesting thing and watching Joey's food digest, listening to the loud rumbles and growls of his stomach. Even though you tended not to like those sort of sounds, and certainly not coming from Joey, the whole \"being eaten\" experience somehow gave you a bit of perspective on life. If you were destined to stay in here forever, you might as well find a way to enjoy it.</span></div></div>",

Mike and Thomas started walking, but not long before another groan escaped his midsection and he stopped to clutch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but something in those nachos are not agreeing with me.\"</span></div></div>",

You two grew up together and even though he was very shy he had this odd obsession with eating things that he shouldn't.  He would always eat a ton of food, and you even caught him eating insects off the ground.  Yeah he was weird, but he was still your little cousin.<br>\r\nYour name is Jake and you are a normal 16 year old boy, and today you were gonna explore a cave you found in the woods with Anthony.  He reluctantly follows you into the cave and after about a half hour of \"spelunking\", you both find what looks like a shrine.  On the shrine are two amulets, one blue and one red.  You both are interested so you grab them and go back to his place.<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

You might get annoyed with him if you didn\u2019t find it strangely interesting him to watch him gobble down the savory biscuits.

However, they were identical in some cases: both had DD cups, large butts, a hourglass figure and the same smile. \"I just need to apply my makeup and it'll be yours.\" Stella replied. \"You said that ten minutes ago! I need to go <i>now!</i>\" Stella's 19 year-old cousin cried out, before barging in. Stella was about to kick Linda out, when her phone rang. Answering it, Stella's face turned to disgust and ended the call. \"Our folks want us to clear out the attic. Gah!\" Stella complains. \"S-ser-riously?\" Linda stutters. Both girls never did like going to the attic, feeling there's something creepy waiting for them. \"Let's get this done with. The longer we stall, the more we to clean, okay?\" Stella says with an annoyed tone. Once they finished their business, the girls head up towards the attic. The attic was a small room, filled with must,  memories, dust, and broken things. Like the railway Linda was leaning on, as it fell. Linda squeaked as she fell and had several boxes fall on her. \"I better see if she's, or else the family is going to think I murdered the nerd.\" Stella sighs, before walking where her cousin. Yet, Linda did not need any help as she got up, holding a strange box. Curiosity taking over, Linda opens the box and gasps. Stella, wondering what her was looking at, walks over to her and looks inside. In the box, was two identical, yet, most beautiful necklaces, making the Hope Diamond put to shame. One difference between the necklaces, was one of them was blue and the other was red. \"No way we're putting this stuff on EBay.\" Linda spoke, as she broke the silence around the girls.</span></div></div>",

Linda on the other hand didn't get to see the other necklace very well so she picked it up to examine it. Out of no where, Linda was blinded and now freed selling from the air. She landed in a wet substance that smelled like honey. Linda started to realize her surroundings and noticed she shrank really small. She then figured out she was in a bowl of cereal, Stella's cereal. She was smaller than the Cheerios that surrounded her. Linda was panicking when suddenly the ground started to shake and Stella was returning. \"Linda where did you go now?
