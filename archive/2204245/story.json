Here is a couple of options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: After another 'Stone of Cold Fire' shows up in the sky Littlefoot sees it breaking in two, with one half landing in the Mysterious Beyond and the other landing in the Great Valley. The next day, Littlefoot and his friends go to see the stone. However, unlike the last one, this stone HAS magical properties, so when Littlefoot touches the stone, he accidentally ends up swapping bodies with a huge Sharptooth in the Mysterious Beyond who'd touched the other half because it thought that it was eatible.<br>\r\nLittlefoot now has big problems, for although he quickly figures out how and what caused him to swap, the young Longneck is still stuck in the body of an adult Sharptooth, which means that he not only has to get used to suddenly being a biped, but he also has to figure out a way to send a message to his friends so that he can swap back again.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, all of Littlefoots friends are frightened of the behavior of whom they think is Littlefoot, since the Sharptooth's savage brain can't really comprehend that it's now in the body of a young Longneck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: One day, Littlefoot finds a strange new bush in the Great Valley. After eating some of the leaves on the bush, he then has a conversation with Chomper, which for one second causes Littlefoot to want to try being a Sharptooth. At the exact same time, in the Mysterious Beyond, a savage Sharptooth gets a burning desire to enter the Great Valley (to find more food). During the night, the odd leaves that Littlefoot ate causes his mind to be exchanged with that of the Sharptooth, because the leaves has the power to grant any strong desires and this way, it gets to grant the desires of two beings at once.<br>\r\nWhile the Sharptooth in Littlefoot's body causes confusion and worry throughout the Great Valley, Littlefoot in the Sharptooth's body has to figure out a way to let his friend know of the situation he's in, since the only way to swap back is to get the Sharptooth in his body to eat some more of the strange leaves.<br>\r\nBut this turns out to be quite a challenge; because not only doesthe frightened Littlefoot have to get used to his new, enormous body, but he soon finds out that the Sharptooth whose body he is in, has rivals. Rivals that won't hesitate to try and eliminate the Sharptooth whose body Littlefoot currently occupies...</span></div></div>",

However, he only grows when he is inside a realatively inclosed space where he can fit; like a cave, a hollow tree, or something similar. He will then grow just enough to completly fill up the aforementioned space and not an inch more.<br>\r\nThis could prove to be a problem if he decides to play hide-and-seek with his friends as he would be constantly looking for bigger and bigger places to hide his growing form.<br>\r\nIt could cause even more trouble if he ends up falling asleep in a big cave, since he would end up growing MUCH bigger in his sleep; though that depends on the size of the cave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: After eating a weird-tasting tree-star, Littlefoot obtains the power to siphon physical size from another dinosaur to himself, and vice versa. Unfortunatly; he doesn't know that he has this power at first, which results in him slowly growing while all other dinosaurs near him grow smaller.<br>\r\nWhen he does figure out what is going on, most of the other dinosaurs in the Great Valley have shrunk down to be smaller than the grass, while Littlefoot himself has grown so big that his body towers above everything else in the Valley, even allowing him to see over the great cliffs that circle it. He then has to find a way to give everyone their size back, either before he accidentally steps on someone, or before everyone else shink into nothingness...</span></div></div>",
