They saw that it looked ancient in its outdoor environments. It reminded them of \"places\" from where they believed they came from during \"Ancient Times\", including Europe. <br>\r\n    \"By goodness, where are we?\" Asked Mario.<br>\r\n    \"I do not know. I really do not know.\" Said Luigi. Then, something occurred to them both that they were there, before, out of some sort of feeling. They decided to look around.<br>\r\nThey, while in some forest area, noticed some strange tree bark like object, with some \"sewer door\" like door on it. They decided to open it, and see what was inside. They looked around in there, and noticed what resembled \"a manor from underground\". They walked up to it, opened the door on the doorstep - first knocking before than, but then, opening it. They obviously closed it after entering, but then looked around, to down stairs, opening a door into a big basement room, where they saw food everywhere. Mario, being as fat as he was, was hungry, while Luigi decided to look upstairs. Mario saw some forty cheese burgers, eating them all, one by one. Then, fries from forty barrels containing them. Then, he ate from plates with sixty servings of cookies. His belly bulged up to where his red shirt and overalls were becoming too tight for him. He then ate eighty servings of fried chicken whole, discovering he had capabilities in his stomach of handling any food in any manners in the process. The more he was eating, the fatter he was becoming. In fact, he was becoming so fat, he was a quivering blob. He ate forty servings of pizza, from cheese to pepperoni to beyond. After eating it up, he saw that his belly had bulged up to where his shirt could not fit him, and his overalls had unbuttoned. Mario then ate eighty-eight servings of chicken parmagiene (sorry if misspelled), spaghetti with small meat balls, and garlic cheese bread. Finally, he was so fat, he looked like some creature that ate thousands of clones of Mario, and Mario himself. He was even fatter than Marvel's The Blob as depicted in X-Men: Origins: Wolverine, which was from later. His shirt could barely fit, his belly was so big that he could not look down or below himself - or see his legs, feet, or anything else bellow him - and his overalls were way too tight. He ate so much, that he lay down on his back out of exhaustion. He hiccuped, patted his belly, and then just proceeded to lay there like a squid. Then Luigi came back to the room, and was surprised.<br>\r\n   \"Mario, did I not just see what I thought I saw?\" He asked.<br>\r\n   \"You sure *hilp* did, Luigi.\" (The *hilp* thing means he hiccuped) said Mario.</span></div></div>",

Sure, he got to be the star in a few games, but every one of them got bad reviews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he got that I don't got?\" Luigi said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be obvious at this point.\" Luigi was startled by the young toadett sitting next to him, she was reading a book and hadn't said a word to him untill now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why he is so popular.\" She said, without looking up from her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...

I mean, all of Wario's games are succesful. Yoshi, Kirby, Pacman, even you had alot of popularity back in Super Mario World when you weighed about the same as Mario.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that in order to be more popular, I need to gain weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" </span></div></div>",

In the top drawer, were 30 pairs of green shirts and blue overalls. But in the bottom drawer, were 12 un-opened mushroom boxes. Luigi kept these just in case of emergency, but didn't tell Mario because he was afraid that Mario would waste them on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi picked up one of the mushroom boxes, he clenched his fist and hit the bottom of the cube as hard as he could.

Luigi looked at himself in the mirror, he was now at his full height. He didn't really know what would happen when you eat a mushroom at full height, Mario had always gotten to them all before Luigi. Everytime Mario ate an eccess mushroom nothing happend, but maybe the all the over indulgence in mushrooms was what was making him fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi looked at the remaining eleven mushroom boxes.

Of course this caused the king of the Koopas to go from overweight to obese. Bowser now exceeded the size of his throne by a great margin. His behind was now so large that it acted as its own cushion while his tail just a giant stump. Now his belly stuck out a good three feet or so completely obscuring him from seeing his tree stump legs and was starting to overlap his shell. His pecs were now the size of watermelons. His once toned arms were now padded with fat with some strength to keep them from being totally unmovable yet this caused some strain against his bracelets to the point to were they could pop off. Bowser's fat neck also stained against his spiked collar in a fight of dominance. This caused Bowser to almost have a triple chin even though another day off gorging could bring it about. In the mind of this fat king there's nothing interesting to do anymore. Why work out if there's no incentive and why find a hobby when he could sit in his throne and watch TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still nothing interesting on. Hey can someone change the channel? Where the heck is my lunch I'm starving! Bowser roared as he continued to stuff his face with his 1st lunch while impatiently waiting for his 2nd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now routine for Bowser to have two times as much for a typical meal. This caused the cooking staff to work double overtime. He even remarried his ex-wife so that he could indulge himself and not deal with the affairs of his kingdom, which worked out to her advantage seeing this as the easiest way to usurp her tubby hubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard your king bring him his lunch already so he doesn't die of starvation.\" roared the psychotic Koopa queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Queen Clawdia. We'll do whatever you want your wickedness.\" replied Bowser's minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... Looks like you'll need some new clothing for your plump frame. But as long as I'm queen you must do something productive. I admire your adorable size but at least do something worthwhile or else you won't get your dinner.\" threatened Clawdia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no say in what I do! If I want to eat I eat! Plus everything just seems so boring and uninteresting.\" said Bowser in a lazy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me but have you forgotten that I outrank you. For as long as this kingdom has been around it's been matriarchal. We all saw how your drive to have men been treated as equals failed. If you at least prove yourself then I will call you my equal.\" argued Clawdia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then rises from his throne angered by the insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here witch! I'm in control and you do what I say. Second, I'm your husband and you treat me as your equal. Third, You're just as guilty for trying to kidnap the Mario Bros. as I was with Peach.\" roared Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Bowser waddled angrily towards the kitchen to demand that his 2nd lunch should of been ready by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare he mention that name in my presence.It's her fault that this moron divorced eight times and it's also her fault that he blimped up to the size of a whale. But none of that matters for this is what I've been planning I'll use my husband's expanding girth to takeover the mushroom kingdom and then the world! Wahahaha!

Sheer power-lust in his eyes. The demon smiled. This had been the most ambition Bowser exhibited in quite some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah mortals.\" The demon said. \"Goormond is our former master's gatekeeper.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a discarded drinking goblet from the floor and poured in a silver liquid. Bowser leaned forward while the demon held out the cup. Within, he could see a tall stone building. A picture so clear he felt tempted to reach in and grab it. The image shifted to reveal a stone slab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunes of ancient origin adorned its surface. They appear gilded in the setting sunlight. A staircase rose from the left side to what Bowser could only describe as a giant metal plate. To the right sat a giant statue. The four-armed stone effigy sat with crossed legs. Its corpulent stomach sagged well beyond the confines of its lap. Its heaving chest sagged over the sides of the mammoth gut. Rotund cheeks merged with a plump neck. Fat biceps nearly consumed bloated forearms. Most intriguing of all, the statue sat upon a similar metal plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a giant scale.\" Bowser said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smarter than you look.\" Said the demon. \"After the celestial courts banished our master, Goormond enchanted the temples doors and sealed himself in stone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to enter the temple I would have to weigh as much as that statue.\" Bowser stroked his double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That plain enough English for you?\" Said the demon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser chuckled with his deep menacing baritone. \"It's that easy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The statue is enchanted to weigh 10 times more than your species' average weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3000 pounds!\" Bowser gasped. His blubbery body quivered at such an exertion. Sure he had been no stranger to being plump. Bowser had always been a little overweight at 328 and a half pounds (it's all muscle, he would swear). Even now he only weighed, what? 400 pounds at most? Sure 100 pounds over weight was pretty big, but ten times his normal weight sounded crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need some help.\" Bowser looked to the demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lip curled into an impish half-smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One ponderous step after the other, Bowser navigated the vast courtyard of the Mountain Sumo Academy. Carved into the face of a granite mountain itself, the prestigious school of sumo served all the needs the Rikishi and their fans could ever desire. A feasting hall more grand than even Bowser's own dining chambers,  several sparring arenas, a sumo stable officiated by the worlds greatest sumo wrestlers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're delighted to have such an honored guest here in our halls.\" Said Tanzo. A heavy-set dragon that gave Bowser's own girth a run for its money. His gut bunched up as he bowed. \"Celebrities rarely decide to learn our craft, especially one's so suited for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I woke up one day and realized what I was born to do.\" Bowser said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exciting.\" Tanzo replied. \"Though you are much bigger in person, I must admit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I put on some weight lately.\" Bowser patted his soft middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to it my friend.\" Said Tanzo. \"You are quite thin compared to most of  our esteemed Rikishi. Something that will change very quickly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fast are we talking?\" Bowser said. Thoughts of god-hood swam about his mind. The sooner the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanzo chuckled and led Bowser to a small counter. He reached his plump paws into a cabinet and fished about. Seconds later he plopped a thick binder on the counter and beckoned for Bowser to come forward. He opened it to reveal several \"before-and-after\" photos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople of all shapes and sizes came to the Academy in different sizes. Tall, fat, short, thin, somewhere in between. They all came out much the same. Three months of training and these people became massive sumo wrestlers. Tanzo flipped to a specific page and pointed a familiar looking blue dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is myself three months ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser shook his head in disbelief. The blue dragon in the before picture was, to put it bluntly, quite puny. Gangly limbs without an ounce of muscle on them, and the only fat appeared to be a slight paunch on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding.\" Bowser turned to the fat dragon. \"You could eat that scrawny thing three times over and still have room for more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No jokes here.\" Tanzo bowed again. \"Our system works. You need only stick with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm more than ready to go.\" Said Bowser. \"When's dinner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must perform your workout routine first.\" Tanzo replied. \"Then you may have dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Working out?\" Bowser said. \"That's a little...counter-intuitive isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanzo smiled politely. \"It may sound that way, but do not worry. Your body will greedily store those calories if it is starving. And to starve it, you must work it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know so! And I have the body to prove it.\" Tanzo replied. \"Now come with me to the exercise room and we can begin your first day of training.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat pearled upon Bowser's forehead and rolled down his fat cheeks. Breath escaped him faster than he could take it in. One more stomp and I'll die, Bowser thought. He strained to lift his meaty leg into the air, the squat burned his lower-back and glutes. Stomp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, we have much work to do.\" Tanzo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I admit I'm a little out of shape.\" Bowser huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to be too caustic, but I do not think there is anything little about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pretend I didn't hear that.\" Said Bowser. \"Can't we go back to the weight bench again? I'm good at that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not want to admit it, but lifting heavy plates of food to his greedy maw for the past year kept his chest and arms in some respectable shape. Even underneath layers of blubber. Even if they weren't as strong as they had always been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must challenge yourself. Otherwise you will not improve.\" Said Tanzo. \"Unless you intend to walk on your hands, I suggest these stomping exercises. You will be thankful when you reach the bigger sizes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd back to stomping he went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nHow wonderful, to sit and not stomp. To lift ounces with his arms, rather than pounds. To take in sweet, hot, smells with each breath. Dinner never quite tasted so good. Whatever it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to quit tomorrow, I can just hit 3000 pounds eating.\" Bowser mumbled between mouthfuls. \"Oh stars this is good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he looked up from his bowl. Sumos of all ranks and sizes surrounded him. He could tell the newbies from the veterans instantly. And the veterans were huge. Massive piles of muscle and fat that horked down their food with zeal. Gluttons and proud of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep with it, Tanzo said, and he could be like them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll be their god.\" Bowser grinned evilly. No matter how hard these poor fools would try, they would never be better than him. He fantasized about sitting his temple. No need for a throne, his own backside served well enough. Never having to worry about exercise, or getting full. Just devouring and reigning king over those who devoured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be the god of the sumos, and the fat kids at school, the college student and their freshman 40, the buffet junky that takes of two seats alone. All his quarry. all his servants. Like his father always said, dream big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to stick with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he gorged on every last bite. Plates of food disappeared while he relished the very act of eating. Something he found solace in for so long would prove to reward him in the end. Little by little the crowd left for bed. Leaving him and a few of the more massive stragglers to their meals. Bowser decided that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The meat felt like lead in his gut, weighing him down with each visit to the buffet table. He needed to push on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach is a muscle too, Bowser figured, and if he could work that out like everything else, he could hold more food. More food and he could get bigger faster. The thought drove him to eat beyond his limit. He felt ready to burst. His plush stomach taut with food. He grabbed a sweet sugary drink and chugged it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should fill in the cracks.\" Bowser mumbled. He stifled a burp and shoved down a few more bites of roasted meat. It wanted to come up so bad, but he resisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tempted fate and tried his very best to stand, but his sore muscles and swollen midsection quivered in protest. His stomach gurgled, no doubt trying to digest his meal. Come fatso, get up, Bowser grumbled in his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urf!\" Bowser stifled a belch and somehow managed to stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddled across the feeding hall, and out the door. Each step a painful reminder of his feast. Worth it, it was all worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumo wrestling huh? Now that's an interesting way to tackle the situation.\" A familiar voice spoke from the shadows. Bowser cocked his and looked around. He looked to see a shadow standing beside his own. Yet no body there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I'm a shape shifting demon.\" The shadow appeared to be that of a curvy woman. Roughly Bowser's height in the shadow, yet that could just be an illusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that. Why are you here?\" Said Bowser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To check on my favorite fat lizard king.\" Said the demoness. Bowser yelped the moment he felt something grab his bloated love handle. \"That and to deliver some news.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can that wait after I get to the room.\" Bowser grunted and burped loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone had too much on their plate.\" Said the demoness. \"Or plates rather. Here perhaps I can ease the stress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA icy feeling washed over Bowser's gut, and then a numbness afterwards. No more pain. Even his muscles felt better. He shivered and poked his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you couldn't help me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help you directly gain weight. No potions, no magic food, and the like. But I can make it easier in some ways. Ways I find much more fun anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser hobbled off to his quarters at the academy and sat on a cushion. It was fashioned in such a way not to budge at his weight. That might change a thousand pounds later, Bowser mused. He reached to take off his shell out of habit, but realized he was in presence of another being. He blushed and stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, never got your name by the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucidity.\" Said the demon. \"Or Lucy for short.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow pulled itself from the wall and formed into a scaled female koopa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that how you normally look?\" Bowser blushed even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just assumed a form you might be more comfortable with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you end up running with a god of gluttony?\" Bowser said. \"You're a bombshell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could change that fact in a heartbeat.\" She grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still didn't answer my question.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my goals and my former master's goals were quite aligned.\" Said Lucy. \"He wanted to preside of more gluttons, and I'm weak at the knees for making people bigger. And while I could just magic them that way, that gets boring after the first ten times. I like the slow transformation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser gulped and looked at his own gut. Lucy took a seat next to Bowser and placed her clawed paw on his beefy love handle. A wicked grin crossed her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to make you the biggest of the big, Bowser. I can assure you of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what was that news you wanted to tell me.\" Bowser stammered. His face a few shades darker than his hair. Lucy's eyes lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Seems news of our mission has gotten out. An...old friend of mine...has decided that he wants to grow his own lard ball and snatch the throne from beneath our feet.\" Lucy walked towards a vanity mirror and tapped its surface.

Earthworld technology invaded his homeland years ago, and for the most part he enjoyed their presence. This one still seemed a little foreign. A device which lets you communicate in real-time with only his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we just communicate with your magic?\" Bowser panted.<br>\r\n\"Just humor our R&amp;D department. They are testing out these new communicators for our public to use. I hear they make a killing in the Earthworld.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Said Bowser. \"Anyways, can you bring the pictures?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my broom as we speak m'lord.\" Kamek replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now time to talk to this 'headmaster.'\" Bowser pulled the phone away from his ear and kept walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't hang up, sir.\" Kamek's muffled voice said. Bowser groaned and pressed the red end-call button. His face red with exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headmaster's office made its home at one of the highest points of the academy. Bowser resolved that in his world order, stairs would be a thing of the past. Hot breath met cold mountain air. From the windows he could see the entire academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck of a view isn't it?\" A jovial baritone voice called from up ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser looked up to see the headmaster. A gargantuan wolf cast an eclipse's shadow down the entire staircase. Bowser walked a few steps up to meet him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taiho is my name.\" Said the wolf. \"Though Master Taiho to you. Not to be rude or anything, as you are royalty I assume you are used to being the one in charge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling even some of the new comers here could beat me in the ring.\" Bowser rubbed the back of his head. \"I hate to admit it, but I'm a little intimidated by this place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiho nodded and gestured for Bowser to follow. The \"office\" appeared to be more like ceremonial chambers. A traditional mural depicted famous former headmasters dining together in a serene riverside landscape. Bowser saw no chairs, just ornate cushions like in the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say pull up a seat, but seeing as most of us are too big for chairs, just grab a cushion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser did so and took a seat. Taiho poured a strong smelling tea into two cups and laid them out before the two. Bowser lifted the tea to his nose and tried his best not to grimace. At least not in front of this wolf whose biceps looked to be as thick as Bowser's own thighs. Taiho lifted the comically small cup to his lips and took a sip, Bowser did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing beats my great-grandfather's old recipe. He made it from special leaves here on the mountain.\" Said Taiho. He smiled happily with his tea. \"I give all Rikishi a taste of its potency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low rumble startled Bowser. His stomach gargled and shivered. Then a warm filling moved throughout his body. No longer did he feel full, in fact he felt quite famished. Taiho's stomach did the same, though his much more intense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Bowser licked his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tea has many properties.\" Said Taiho. \"It aids in repairing your muscles after a hard workout, and speeds the digestion of your food. The secret to my size, and to our successful students.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to give me the recipe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiho smiled and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must earn it, only my Yokozuna are allowed to learn it. And they too must keep it secret, or they will be stripped of rank.\" Taiho stood from the cushion and pulled back a curtain to reveal a startling high-tech camera rig. \"But we are here to get your photos for your first week, not to talk of my tea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser stood from the cushion, his muscles did not fight him. Rather they welcomed the sudden exertion. A sigh escaped his lips while he stood before the camera. A white X sat in the middle of the floor. He placed his feet there and looked forward. Then a flash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now turn to the side.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser did as he was told, and again there was a flash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we shall see you again once every major mile stone.\" Said Taiho. \"First three months, then six, then a full year.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a sharp rapping came from the window. Taiho turned to find Kamek hovering from outside the window on a broomstick. A small chest tied firm to the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the pictures of me from a year before.\" Bowser replied. Taiho opened the window to let in Kamek, who hopped off his broom and shivered madly. He managed to stop shivering long enough to open the chest and hand a small envelope to Taiho, then one to Bowser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah thank you, I will go put these on file.\" Taiho grabbed a the teapot and poured a glass for Kamek. \"Here, something to warm you for your troubles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiho left the two koopas alone for a moment. Bowser looked at the envelope to find it signed by Bowser Junior. He chuckled a little and looked to Kamek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long trip?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your chunkiness.\" Said Kamek. \"I'm starting to realize why you like the extra weight up here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamek lifts the cup to his lips, when Bowser...</span></div></div>",

Bowser was scheduled to compete in the Jonokuchi division and thus was to partake in seven bouts, which wasn't bad since Rainbow Beach did allow Rikishi free admission to the attractions due to the tournament, yet any money Bowser would be allowed to receive was prize money since he is not high ranking enough to receive a salary or even an allowance and thus, had to rely on his investments and royal funds if he needed any cash. It was then time for the Regal Sumo Koopa to begin his first bout and to achieve his dreams of becoming the new celestial of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is my big chance. I can't fail. I have too much that depends on how well I do. I have to become a Yokozuna so I can become a god.

Bowser's opponent was much smaller than he was, which gave the corpulent Koopa a size advantage. Bowser wins his first match just by throwing the other wrestler out of the ring. As the ref declared Bowser the winner the crowd cheered as Bowser raised his fat arm in the air showing off the muscle that was starting to redevelop thanks to his intense training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** ******************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the tournament went pretty much the same. Bowser would either push his opponents out of the ring or use legal throws to toss them out of the ring. Bowser's final match was against another spherical alien like the one at the academy. Yet what confused Bowser is that these aliens had antennas poking out of their heads and that they were strong despite being small. The final match lasted a few minutes, longer than a typical match, and end when Bowser body slammed the alien due to being tossed into the air. Bowser gives a sigh of relief as he stood up and the alien paralyzed from the impact. The crowd then cheers wildly as the host gives Bowser a trophy with a check worth 50,000 Bills. Yet 50,00 was only the amount that the lower divisions received while the higher ranks received one million Bills. Just as Bowser received the check his wicked ex-wife appeared. Bowser then glared at Clawdia who was taller than him. Clawdia also donned a scarlet shell and had black hair and yellow eyes. She also wore black lipstick and wore Dark green shoes and wore jewelry as opposed to Bowser's chokers and arm bands, which needed dire replacement. Her hair was also styled to resemble horns since she didn't have horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Bowser, you sure got fat. Fat and handsome that is. I'll be taking the money you owe me. Let's see now. Oh yes, I'll take half of your prize for that child support. If you have problems with that you can always remarry me, but that won't solve your money problems with all of the merchandise you bought from my stores. Now I have a certain queen to destroy and a king to force into being my minion. My two best henchmen are in the middle of trying to reclaim a certain boy that escaped my clutches and was turned back to his normal form after that Peach defeated me. Call me when you want to consider the remarriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawdia then laughs evilly as she uses her black magic to teleport to her Koopacycle. The wicked witch Clawdia then rides her Koopacycle into the sunset all the while torturing citizens in her wake. Later that night Headmaster Taiho announces that due to Bowsers performance that he will be promoted to Jonidan. The other wrestlers congratulate Bowser on his victory, despite the fact that tomorrow would be another hard day of training, but Bowser decided to relish the moment for he knew as he got into the higher ranks his recognition as a royal would apply, since he he would of worked his way to receive that respect.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bowser went from being a depressed 400 pound blob into a 540 pound mountain of fat and muscle. Yet the changes Bowser had undergone were all part of his training. Bowser's cheeks were now fatter than ever and he now donned four chins and almost forming a fifth. His stomach was almost five feet wide and created lovehandles that females of his kind would go bonkers for. His pecs though fatter actually firmed up somewhat, but stilled rolled off to his sides., however Bowser could now flex his meaty pecs which made some of the other Rikishi jealous. Bowser's arms though fatter and wider had regained all the strength that he lost during his depression and also were slightly stronger  due to the layers of fat that rested on top of them. Bowser's legs having gained alot more girth and muscle were almost another foot and a half wider. Not only that but his stomps improved a lot. No longer struggling to raise his meaty legs Bowser was able to complete the exercises with more ease. Bowser also wore a larger shell, bracelets, and necklace since he out grew the others once he reached 450 pounds. The new larger duds offered more wiggle room and would only need to be replaced in four months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser was in the middle of training when he was greeted by Tenzo, who grew bigger over the course of the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Bowser want to have a practice match before lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser thought carefully since Tenzo was two ranks higher than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I could always learn some new moves.\" said Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great.

A side of him Bowser never saw before. Always smiles and polite gestures. Now he was a machine built for sumo. Now Bowser was in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rikishi serving as their referee shouted. Tenzo charged. Deep breaths Bowser. Steady those meaty ham-hocks you call legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmash!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon and koopa collided hard enough to split atoms. Bowser's entire lower body wobbled. Pain never bothered him. Years of being thrown into lava, explosives, or having castles collapse on him proved that. This became unlike anything he ever experienced. Like trying to stop a Tsunami with his clawed hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo achieve god-hood, he would have to best such forces of nature. To do things no other mortal could do. He was Hercules and this was one of his many trials. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd fell silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzo's concentration turned to astonishment the moment he felt his entire body fall back. Bowser managed to muster enough strength to push him back an inch. Then another, and finally two more inches. Four inches, he moved a Tsunami back four inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm doing it! Bowser smiled to himself. He always prided himself on his strength, but now it reached new heights. Then the initial surprise wore off. Tenzo pushed back with twice the intensity from before. Bowser gasped when he felt his feet leave the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground that took him so much effort to gain had been lost. However, his greatest concern became his fall back to earth. Tenzo threw him from the ring, and Bowser crashed on his back. The wind knocked from his lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo cheering, just stunned silence. The new meat proved the unthinkable. His potential far from realized, and he stopped someone twice his size. They could only imagine what Bowser would do at Tenzo's size, or better yet, even bigger than Tenzo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite impressive.\" Tenzo said, holding his hand out to help Bowser back up. \"Your stance is good, and with that burst of strength, you could easily defeat a bigger opponent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was all polite smiles and a good sport. All ferocity gone. What planet was Tenzo from? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Bowser wheezed while Tenzo pulled Bowser back to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you need to learn to conserve energy. Endurance wins the day more often than a simple sprint.\" Tenzo said. \"It's a game changer though. Save that burst of energy for when you know victory is just one leap away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSore, defeated, and yet triumphant all at once, Bowser walked beside Tenzo as they left the murmurs of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down in the feasting hall, facing one another at a table near the serving area. A spot reserved for the higher ranks, Tenzo figured Bowser earned it for the day. And the higher ranks, well, they did not want to be on Tenzo's bad side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cooking has improved some.\" Tenzo swallowed a bit of meat reluctantly. \"Some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you learn to cook?\" Said Bowser, who ignored his own culinary exploits in favor of Tenzo's hefty meat stew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father owned a traditional Khori family restaurant.\" Tenzo replied. \"He wanted my trade to be in the culinary arts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You chose sumo instead?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of.\" Tenzo scratched his chin. \"The island I come from, there were three competing families. Mine, the Torri, and the Furri. Some decided honor by the sword, others by spoken word, us by food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser stifled his chuckles and continued to eat. What a silly thing to fight over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father, the newest patriarch of the Khori family, continued our five generation streak of retaining control of the island. Then I happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds silly, but a skinny chef is a bad omen on the island.\" Tenzo played with his thumbs. \"You saw my picture before I came here. I grew up on food, I breathed and lived food, and only got a smallish paunch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanted to get bigger.\" Bowser nodded. He understood the motive somewhat. It was his all along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But then I discovered my other passion.\" Said Tenzo. \"Sumo is something that came natural to me. So when I became much bigger, even more than my own father, well, I stayed here for awhile longer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't recognize you by the time you get home.\" Bowser chuckled between mouthfuls of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think whatever bad omen was with me, is lifted.\" Tenzo said as he patted his hefty middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser finished his meal, then let a thought stew about in his mind for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you teach me how to cook, Tenzo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked surprised for a moment, but then resumed his polite smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last exercise consisted of Bowser trying to push a steel pillar to the other side of the room. Bowser was struggling since he tended to use up his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on. I need to get that pillar to the other side!</i> thought Bowser as sweat  ran down his fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Bowser, that's enough. By practicing everyday you should be able to learn to have the endurance so your strength isn't wasted. Now It's time to teach you how to cook.\" said Shingo as he led Bowser to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the kitchen Shingo readies the cooking supplies and ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best way to learn something is by example. If you can learn how to cook something simple then you should be able to cook up a large banquet fit for a royal party. Pay attention and do what I do or tell you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Master Shingo.\" said Bowser who still felt strange about calling someone higher than him by such a formal title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then imitates Shingo as he puts the ingredients into a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, now put the pot on the stove  and let it cook for two hours at 400 degrees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" said Bowser as he was about to use his fire breath to start the cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShingo then grabs a fire extinguisher and uses it Bowser. Bowser coughs up the foam that got into his mouth. Shingo then gives Bowser water to wash the foam out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a campfire. I thought Sergio informed you of that. Also if this place burned down due to your fire breath then Headmaster Taiho would make you rebuild this place from the ground up.\" scolded Shingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how will I know when the food's well cooked. Without my fire breath the food is almost undercooked and the flavor is bland.\" replied Bowser who was still trying to get the taste of the extinguisher out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have tools for that and if you look at the stove the temperature and time left to cooked is displayed. Also you'll need to add spices. Adding spices add flavor to your food. Food with great flavor makes a happy wrestler and a happy wrestler is a full one. Now add these spices After that watch this tutorial and follow every step.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then adds the spices and plops the disc into the Digitrix  video player.

If you're new to cooking or want to learn a new recipe then you tuned into the right show.

Also wrestlers have a specific seating order. The lowest ranking among both the higher ranks and lowest ranks sat at the far end of the buffet, while the highest ranking sat closer. Yokozuna and ozeki have the privilege to live outside of the academy if they chose so. Bowser was in the middle of his sixth plate when Shingo approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty good cooking, but you still have a lot to learn.

At Mountain Sumo Academy up to four ozeki are chosen to be promoted to yokozuna, however they must pass an evaluation. During this time all, some, one, or none of the candidates may get chosen. But the good thing is that the candidates are reevaluated a few months later to see if they are worthy. If unworthy they must wait a whole year from the first evaluation before being rechosen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find that out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Shingo told me.

You have great strength, but you lack control. By controlling it you'll become much stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all have to do is push this pillar to the other side of the room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Mr. Koopzilla. Don't feel bad if you can't get it to the other side. Endurance training takes time to master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser than walks over to the steel pillar and gets ready to push it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I'm ever going to balance that Goormond's scale and become a god, I need to become the biggest, strongest, and baddest Yokozuna. I must do this so I can make that Mario pay for all the times he messed up my plans.</i> thought Bowser as his eyes shone with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser tries to push the pillar, but it barely moves an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're trying too hard. Slow and steady is the way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser tries to push the pillar again, but he fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've put everything I've got into that pillar and it won't budge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bowser, you need to push it slowly. It will take sometime before you're strong enough to push the pillar with ease, but this is the only way to improve your endurance. You have so much potential to become probably one of the largest and strongest Rikishi in sumo history if you take the time to practice strength control. Now it's time for your first cooking lesson.\" said Shingo as he pushed the pillar back to it's original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShingo and Bowser head to the kitchen for Bowser's first cooking lesson.</span></div></div>",

It depends on your fat to muscle ratio. If your muscles are just as prominent as your girth or almost as prominent then you begin developing a muscle gut. Not all Rikishi can develop one and some even lose it when they put on more weight. You'll start seeing results of developing one or not after your fifth or sixth month here.\" Shingo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser and Shingo arrive in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Bowser let's teach you how to cook so you can bulk up faster. Follow my lead and do as I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser watched as the massive tiger gathered ingredients and started mixing them into a bowl. Bowser proceeds to do the same. An hour later Shingo tests what Bowser made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... That's better than what you had this morning and it's not terrible. It needs more flavor though.\" Shingo said as he offered Bowser a taste of his dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! That definitely tastes better than mine. Your food is on the same level of Tenzo's. Maybe a bit better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To become a yokozuna I need to know how to cook so I can grow big and strong.\" Shingo said as his muscle gut jiggled as he flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Bowser was eating at the table for lower ranked wrestlers. At Mountain Sumo Academy Rikishi have assigned seating order based upon rank starting from lowest to highest at each respective table. Bowser was gorging on his food when Tenzo walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bowser, I'm finally a Juryo. Now I can receive a salary. So how was training with Master Shingo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good, but he push a steel pillar in one of the training halls. I find his discipline to be strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Master Shingo for you. He usually has his reasons and I'm sure that you'll eventually be able to push larger opponents out of the ring. Did you here about the next tournament? It's suppose to take place in Boulder Valley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is it taking place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Within two weeks.\" Shingo interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to know. I can focus on my training and get stronger.\" Bowser said pointing to his belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't take this too lightly Bowser. Rikishi from our rival stable are said to be participating.\" Tenzo responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I have to work on my endurance and cooking. Within a few months you'll be seeing my face on merchandise everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only if you keep up your winning streak to where your victories outweigh your losses.

A shiver crawled up Bowser's back as his mountainous gut over took his bare lap. He relished the act of sitting for just a moment longer, then stumbled out of the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever would he have guessed that the act of getting out of bed would be a routine all on its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passage of the Boulder Valley tournament would mark his second month as a Mountain Sumo student. He never thought he would be a pound over four-hundred in his life, and now he figured he long since passed six-hundred. Shingo's cooking classes certainly helped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most of all, he never thought he would derive enjoyment from his gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in front of a vanity mirror and watched himself from every angle he could. The jiggling fat coat might fool a bystander or two, but anyone could see the massive layers of muscles supporting the koopa king. Two weeks under Shingo did wonders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only imagine what he might be like a year from that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright enough fantasizing, time to get ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nBoulder Valley, an artificial oasis in the blistering Boulder Desert. Most days of the year it served as a resort to house the more adventurous tourists, but that weekend things changed for the bigger. Some of the regulars joked that the valley itself formed because of the attendee's weights. The sumo took pride in such a boast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser stood with the members of his academy. He realized then that he was only one of three rookies in attendance. Taiho chose only the best of the best to perform here. Bowser felt honored, especially since the competition looked so fierce. For once since he became a sumo, Bowser did not feel intimidated. No one would stand between him and victory, he had the muscles and size to prove it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony began with a flash, the headmaster of each academy stood in a circle at the ring in ornate garb. The Rikishi took their seats while an announcer prepared to take the stage. Bowser heard a voice above all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get 'em papa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head swiveled and he saw Bowser Junior seated as close as possible to the Rikishi.

Unfortunately Bowser's weight gain was slowing down despite getting slightly bigger. This concerned Bowser for he feared that someone may take his rightful spot as the god of gluttony away from him and he didn't want that to happen. Bowser first started showing signs of slow weight gain after he hit 700 lbs. Bowser even noticed that some of the other wrestlers were catching up to his weight or surpassed it. Even Tenzo surpassed Bowser's weight at 1000 lbs which made him the fourth biggest wrestler and biggest non-yokuzuna. As Bowser climb the stairs he was filled with both nervousness and excitement. The stairs no longer felt like a burden as his strong and stubby legs ascended each step, causing a mini earthquake on the higher floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Bowser. Just stand on the x like you did three months ago and we'll take your pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser does just that. The first picture was a frontal pose and the second was a sideview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you're done. If you keep up the good progress you'll be a juryo within two months or so. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Taiho. I've noticed that my weight gain is slowing down and I'm worried that it might cause me future tournaments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it's only natural for makushita to experience a slow in their growth, That's why I'm making you wait two months, however, my eldest son is coming in and he specializes in bulking up. If you do well enough in the tournament he might want to train you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Master Taiho.\" Bowser said as he b owed causing his stomach to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

From within his prison he saw a vaguely familiar figure stand before him. The figure laughed evilly as she cast a spell on Bowser. Bowser then felt as if his stomach was getting smaller. To his horror he was rapidly losing his hard earned weight. This continued until he was skin and bones. The figure then uses her magic to summon a mirror. Bowser looks into the mirror and is horrified by what he sees. In the mirror is a severely underweight Royal Koopa who looked nothing like the powerful sumo that he was. The figure then disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This can't be real. This is only a nightmare. Once I wake up I'll be my fat self again.</i> Bowser thought as he panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser was about to give up until a light poured in the room and surrounds Bowser. Bowser looks into the mirror to realize that he is 700 lbs. again. He then sees Lucidity standing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"m'lord, I have come with urgent news. The competition for the title of the Celestial of Gluttony has increased. A few people that you know will try to outweigh you. In such conditions, the new celestial will not only be chosen by meeting the requirement of being 10x their own species' weight. For every additional pound over the requirement ensures your claim. I cannot speak of any more details now, for my rival Slingo has teamed up with a powerful witch. Be on your toes and outsmart that unworthy witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream then ends and Bowser wakes up feeling refreshed and five pounds heavier.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bowser rushed through his morning routine, or attempted to at least. Space proved tight. Even if the sumo trappings of his quarters appeared much larger to the average three hundred pound rookie -- Bowser started to outgrow his quarters around the five hundred pound mark. Now it seemed impossible to brush his teeth at the counter without his ponderous gut knocking something over. He took a few steps back, only to knock over a decorative vase with his tail. He swiveled and snatched the vase out of the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately his tail swatted the counter and knocked his toiletries to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw jeez.\" Bowser winced at the smell of a busted cologne bottle. \"I was saving that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at himself in the mirror and realized he looked like a rabid animal. The tooth-paste foam coated his lips and dribbled to his bare chest. He, with much care this time, reached over and grabbed a towel. Bowser wiped his face and chest clean, an irritated layer of scruff exposed itself to the world. He scratched his cheek and eyeballed the mess for his razor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can wait 'til tonight, I need to get going.\" Bowser mumbled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw on a pair of sweats and a baggy tank-top. It felt good to be so \"casual.\" To not worry about ceremonial garb or royal appearances. At the very least he was allowed a \"lazy day\" in preparation for the tournament. If you train every day, you leave your body no time to rest, and if you don't rest, your body will fail, so Taiho said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped away from the mess and squeezed through the doorway into a wide corridor. A few of his fellow rikishi stirred from their dormitories, no doubt wondering why everything smelled like \"Essence of Fire Flower.\" Bowser lumbered past them, dropping a terse greeting to anyone he recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's the day I'm getting past this slump, Bowser thought to himself. He exited the dorms and found himself beside the sparring arena. In the center it looked to be Shingo and another wrestler he did not recognize. With so many faces at the academy, he figured anyone might get lost in the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Bowser, hope you are enjoying the day off.\" Said Tenzo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser turned to find his friend walking towards him. The big blue dragon made his way towards Bowser at a slow, deliberate pace. The royal koopa sidled to give his friend some room. He tried to think back to when he first met him at the academy. They were about the same height, heck even the same weight. No one would believe him if he said that now.  At half a ton, Tenzo almost quintupled his starting size. He even seemed taller somehow. If ever the dragon returned to his family, they might not recognize him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to think, Bowser needed to triple the dragon's weight to pursue godhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, needed the break.\" Said Bowser. He noted that Tenzo was clad in his mawashi. \"You should take the day off too, even super-stars such as yourself need a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I am!\" Tenzo blushed a bit and chuckled. \"It is just, well, my mawashi is the only thing I own that still fits. I lost track of my growth and now I'm stuck without clothes. I was going to ask Shingo if he had some I could borrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How'd you do it so fast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate.\" Tenzo shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser rolled his eyes and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good luck with that, hey any news about Taiho's son?\" Bowser said. \"Been meaning to meet the guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzo smirked at Bowser, then folded his arms as best he could with his fat middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Bowser said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd ask Shingo, he might know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser looked to the arena just in time to see his part-time mentor hit the ground. To his surprise, Shingo stood to his feet once more booming with laughter. He clapped his opponent on the back. The both exited the sparring arena while the small audience they accrued spoke in excited, hushed tones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the arena, Bowser realized something. When they stood side by side, his opponent by and far out-sized Shingo.  To realize the tiger held his ground for so long in the ring made the match all the more impressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch more relevant, his sparring partner that morning resembled a wolf. Though something in his countenance made Bowser question that assumption. Like ears a bit too wide, or muzzle a bit too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's Koopzilla, been wonderin' if you would be out and about so early this morning.\" Shingo said. \"Been meaning to introduce you two, Bowser this is-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taiho Takeshi.\" The wolf said. His voice graveled and deep. It seethed with nonplussed tones. \"I know you, Bowser Koopa. At least, have heard of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser prepared to shake hands, but the wolf gave a simple bow. His stomach prevented him from going further than normal, Bowser knew the dilemma all too well. Bowser figured he might return the gesture and attempted his own bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem surprised to see me.\" Bowser said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured your being here as silly rumors, or my father's mention of you made for a good joke.\" Said Takeshi. \"Seems we have a real celebrity here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser winced at the tone. The gigantean wolf seemed only to talk down to him. Not at all like his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say the same for you, about celebrity status I mean.\" Bowser said. \"People have been talking about you since your father said you might show up at this weekend's tournament.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi savored the thought and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That true Shingo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Ever since you left we've only heard stories about your accomplishments. To see you here today and see what you did, I have no doubts about the truth.\" Said Shingo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi nodded and then paced around Bowser. He took notice of Tenzo and tilted his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Tenzo, my father mentioned you.\" Said Takeshi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm honored.\" Tenzo gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Said you are a sumo prodigy.\" Takeshi nodded. \"I saw your starting photos and I must say your progress is very impressive. To say nothing of your record books and highlight footage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just do what I do best and a lot of it.\" Tenzo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope such humility does not make you weak in the ring.\" Takeshi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a completely different beast in the ring.\" Bowser spoke up. \"I know first hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi glared at Bowser. He paid the koopa no mind, then went on to speak with Tenzo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your progress and your record is impressive Tenzo.\" Said Takeshi. \"If it is all true...then you might be a perfect candidate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what? Might I ask?\" Tenzo tilted his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi smiled, an earnest one if Bowser was not mistaken, and paced around Tenzo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to save this announcement for later, but for you I might make an exception.\" Takeshi's voice lowered. \"I came back in hopes of recruiting the best wrestlers around and starting a team of sorts. One that might best the Kings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzo gulped. \"Reigning sumo champs for five years straight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very ones. I made a wager that I could muster a team together to best them. So now I come back home to see if any of my father's rikishi are worthy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzo looked to Bowser, then at Takeshi.</span></div></div>",

I have to meet with my father to see who else among his star pupils are worthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Takeshi was about to leave Bowser steps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeshi! You should consider me for your team. I might be a juryo yet, but I haven't lost a tournament or my matches when I help sponsor the academy. The only bouts I've lost have all been training matches.\" Bowser said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi stops and faces Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? My father has mentioned your perfect record for the season, but according to Sergio you're stuck-up and prideful. Being a sumo is not just about power and girth. It's about how honorably you face challenges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll prove it by winning this tournament!\" Bowser declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, if you're so insistent then as a sumo you must honorably take on the challenge. If you fulfill your vow then I'll consider making an exception to my pro sumo only policy. See you in the tournament Koopzilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi then proceeds to meet his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit Koopzilla! Feel free to join me for breakfast. The girls have cooked up a banquet for this occasion.\" Shingo said as he patted Bowser on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Shingo do you have any clothes I can wear? I outgrew all of mine.\" Tenzo said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem my fine friend. Ever since I became a yokozuna I gained too much weight to fit into my old clothes.\" Shingo replied as he patted his muscle-gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Shingo did you prepare that tea? I've noticed that you only do so once a week and since I'm not a yokozuna yet I'm not allowed to make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in luck. When I woke up earlier today I've prepared some. I just hope that none of the smaller rikshi have jumped on it. I don't mind making it, but when those who lack my approval or do not ask me drink it I consider it to be rude and undisciplined. I only allow rikishi one glass, because it is all they can handle. I remember the last time I drank more than one cup that I almost ate all of the food meant for the customers at my restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser and his friends proceed to the dining area. The dining area was set up more casually then other days due to the tournament. The rikishi were chatting among themselves and having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like no one has noticed the tea. It's still full. You may be in luck Bowser. If there is leftover tea after this meal then I'll give you bottle for it. Yet it appears though that the only activity today is to feast like gods.\" Shingo said as he gave a hardy laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey middle weight! Before you return to your room Master Taiho wanted me to give you a key to your new room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Master Sergio.\" Bowser said as he bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me, thank the headmaster. I was only doing a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio hands Bowser a key and then proceeds to take some of Shingo's tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang Shingo, I only make Mountain Tea once in a blue moon for other rikishi who prove themselves, but you make it every week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only do so to help my fellow sumo who are struggling to pack on the pounds and for those who want some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? You the most selfless sumo I know. See ya later pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergio then walks over to speak with Takeshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't Mountain Tea. I've been gaining weight off of my own recipes. I even managed to find a place on the summit where there is these special herbs and berries. I've been using them to help flavor my dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShingo's face turns serious after hearing what Tenzo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice to hear but I thought it took a few days to reach the summit of the mountain.\" Shingo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally it would but I usually take a morning flight up there to train and gather ingredients. There's nothing better for a sumo than wild game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShingo then returns to a less serious face and starts laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot that you can still fly. No wonder you can reach the summit without having to take a hike for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bowser begins drinking his tea he suspects that the herbs and berries must be key ingredients for the tea, but he didn't want to get Shingo in trouble by asking him why he reacted to Tenzo's response, so instead he just piled a few plates of food and ate. For the rest of the day Bowser did nothing but eat. It wasn't until late at night that Bowser had finished dinner. Bowser then decides to retire for the night since tomorrow the tournament would begin.</span></div></div>",

I didn't know you were going to be here too? Does father know that you're here as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. Titon and I just got into town late last night. I must say that Koopzilla is really doing well for his first season. I might be the second oldest, but I know talent when I see it. Whoa! That juryo tossed Koopzilla in the air! What's this? Koopzilla used his sheel to help aim his landing and landed on top of the juryo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck. Despite being outsized he was still able to win. I'll have to keep an eye on this Bowser. Later Larzo. I have a match to win. The two brothers proceed by belly bumping each other as was custom among the Taiho brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bowser was resting up from his last match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was tough. I was almost thrown out of the ring, but thanks to my shell I was able to land in that other wrestler. Hopefully Takeshi will consider me for his team of champions despite being a makushita still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dude you'll definitely get accepted on his team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser turns around and sees a black wolf that is roughly the same size as Takeshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? By the looks of things you must be a yokozuna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have guessed correctly dude. The name's Titon Taiho. I'm the youngest out of three brothers. My eldest brother has always been rough around the edges when it comes to recognizing rikishi who aren't professionals yet. I'm also here with my older twin Larzo. He's a white wolf about Takeshi's size. He's a big fan of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that Master Taiho had any other sons besides Takeshi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We kept our coming to the tournament a secret. Don't want to miss dad's birthday tomorrow. Later Koopzilla. See ya tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser watched as the humongous wolf walked away while a crowd that recognized him started to follow him. Bowser was relieved to know that Taiho's other sons didn't look at him the way Takeshi did. Later that before dinner was ready Bowser was walking down the hallway with a few of his friends until Takeshi stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bowser, that was an impressive victory. As promised I'll let you train with me, however I won't add you to the team just yet. Before I add you to the team you must weigh at least 900+ lbs. If you can accomplish that by next month then you'll officially be on my team. AS of now you're only a guest member, which means you can easily get replaced if you don't keep up with my training. See you bright and early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi then walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it isn't Koopzilla. I see that you finally got on Takeshi's good side. I'm Larzo Taiho.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A frigid mountain breeze gripped Bowser's entire being. An unfamiliar cold pierced his blubber and stabbed his innards. He tried to concentrate his inner fire to warm himself, but his fire breath proved either too weak or out of practice. It did no help that he only wore a muwashi. Not too far ahead lay a sheet of white across the mountainside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that snow?\" Bowser said through chattering teeth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winter comes early in the mountains.\" Said Takeshi. \"My ancestors used it to their advantage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The body is an impressive machine. On its own it quickly adapts to any environment.\" Said Takeshi. \"With training, and a push, the body can be forced to adapt. Molded to fit anyway you so desire. So long as you train it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi tromped through the snow, not at all affected by the weather. Bowser pondered Takeshi's words.  His natural fur coat must have kept the cold at bay. Though Bowser knew he was not without some natural fur. Since he chose life in the mountains, his body began to compensate. Beneath the shell a soft layer of orange hair started to come in thick. His species confused him in some regards. He passed for a fuzzy reptile, or a scaly mammal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ancestors used cold to their advantage?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most creatures have an in-born defense mechanism to the cold.\" Takeshi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibernation.\" Bowser nodded. \"You mean to say they forced a hibernation state to put on weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, I have misjudged you in some respects.\" Takeshi said. \"You catch on quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser beamed and nodded. A decent start for the first morning of training. They trudged a few feet further in the snow and approached a staircase. Massive stone cut and fit by hand. Bowser noticed every few steps presented a unique etching. A written character he did not recognize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the writing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing you must understand Bowser, is that my family did not just pick up sumo as a hobby.\" Said Takeshi. \"For maybe thousands of years they lived it. Honed it. Created an entire society built on upon it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds...odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a mythical story of how the gods gave our oldest ancestor the ability to stay awake through the winter months, and since they did not sleep off that weight they only kept growing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little. I think the moment they realized they did not have to sleep through the winter months they built warm homes and lived life as usual. Whether or not gods were involved, I know not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne step after the other Bowser and Takeshi scaled the staircase. His clawed toes kept traction on the iced steps. One misstep might send him tumbling to the bottom, he pressed on. The idea of a sumo society burned in the back of his mind. Perhaps the old god of gluttony imbued his family with such a lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very top, Bowser found himself standing before several stone structures. They looked to be houses of some sort. Save for huge stone doors no one could move on their own. Takeshi approached one such residence and pulled a switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened for a moment, then a distinct booming sound. Bowser recognized it from the academy. He heard the rumbling of Headmaster Taiho's footsteps from a room away.  These felt no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of stone grinding against itself filled the air. Bowser took a step back while the massive stone door slid to the side. A single, massive wolf tugged it over with ease. Bowser gulped. The family still lived there in the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeshi!' The wolf spoke. \"So it is true, you have returned.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, getting the best of the 'Kings' proved a little difficult on my own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder wolf gave him a thoughtful look then nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so you are recruiting then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am.\" Takeshi replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am not mistaken, this one is much too small.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser fought hard to keep his mouth shut. He doubled the weight of his average species in the short space of a few months. How dare they talk down to him. Then, the elder wolf walked next to Bowser. His full height towered over the royal koopa, much like the Taiho family. His arms looked thicker than Bowser's neck. This specimen of wolf may well be a ton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is not an official recruit.\"  Takeshi said. \"Not yet at least.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you hope to shape him up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see some potential in this one. Yes.\" Said Takeshi. \"It just needs a small push to be realized.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout his condescending tone, Takeshi almost resembled his father. It seemed sincere, the way he spoke of Bowser. The koopa realized the weight of this trust when the elder wolf objected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not suggest training an outsider in this manner. Our ways, are ours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you think I know nothing of Tenzo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf became silent at that. Bowser tilted his head and raised his brow. What about Tenzo? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive as he is, the moment I saw him I knew he had your mark Aki.\" Takeshi said. \"He has trained with you, and that is how he grew so big so fast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw his potential and it needed to be realized.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is what I see in this one here. So please, let us in and we shall discuss the treatment of outsiders later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki the wolf stepped aside and let them both in. He eyeballed Bowser for a second, perhaps trying to see what Takeshi saw in him. Then he shut the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when does training begin?\" Bowser said beneath his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're eager, not a bad trait.\" Takeshi chuckled. \"I need to sort some things out with the village elders before we begin anything officially. I would say the trek here is your training for the day. Dinner is soon, and perhaps that too might be an exercise on its own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser bit his bottom lip and then looked around himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you mean those things you said? About my potential?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm many things and a liar is not one of them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why this change of heart? The other day you thought I was a waste of training.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forget you are known for being quite forward.\" Takeshi replied. \"Let's just say that my brother Largo reminded me of a story. One about a young wolf whose arrogance made many enemies and lost many battles. All he needed was some humility and a push to make him great.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser nodded and followed Takeshi further. He asked no more questions. He just hoped dinner was filling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe council of elders had seen many winters, Bowser figured. A few of them could not rise to their feet on their own without the assistance of another younger wolf. Sometimes two or three wolves. Too frail to train, but not too frail to eat. Bowser looked to his own plate, loaded with steaming hot piles of meat, berries, and a bowl of stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To just agree to your training, even on Takeshi's word, is too much.\" Said one member, between mouthfuls of a stew. \"To dine with us as a guest is almost an insult.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so hasty, you are so hesitant of these outsiders. Even the ones who are so open to our lifestyle.\"  Said another, he must have been younger, for he could still stand on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I get a feeling that you, Bowser Koopa, are here with bad intent.\" Said the first member.  \"Everyone knows the stories, of your attempted conquests of the mushroom kingdom. If we train you, what is stopping you from attacking us next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi began to speak, but Bowser opened his mouth too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realize my past, and it's not something I'm too proud of. It's true, I joined sumo to try and gain an advantage, but it has made me see the error of my ways along the way. I want this to be my new life now, to forget my mistakes and try something better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe council mumbled and then looked to Bowser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must understand us, when we doubt the validity of such a statement.\" Said one elder. \"You have never been known for truths.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, perhaps you may be able to prove it to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a proposal for you, Bowser Koopa. One that will prove your dedication to sumo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\" Bowser leaned forward with interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will allow Takeshi to train you, on the condition that you make sumo a tradition in your home. Just as we have done here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser's thoughts instantly flashed to Junior, even Clawdia and his closest subjects. They might reject such a notion outright. He sighed and looked at the council. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will send a message home tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow you will have your response, we are certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when you get your answer, you will either train here, or leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser gulped and nodded. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bowser was surprised the next morning to have received a text message from his family. Apparently they all agreed save for Wendy who was opposed to the idea. Even the fashion obsessed Queen Shy Gal agreed as long as Bowser would promise to shave off his excess hair, for she deemed it too unfashionable for Regal Koopas. Bowser replied that he'll see about getting a haircut before the tournament. Yet, Bowser found it odd that Clawdia agreed. Then thoughts of his nightmare from the other night reminded him that something is amiss. Everything was going according to Bowser's plan. Even though he said he had given up his evil ways, truth be told he was following his ex's advice of playing along and preparing properly before launching an invasion of the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser then pictured himself finally beating Mario and his family and finally ruling the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser then laughed evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>For once listening to my ex might prove useful. It won't be until I'm the god of gluttony that I'll go for world conquest, but if I can invade the Mushroom Kingdom before then, then all will be perfect.</i> Bowser thought as he laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good you're up. Today's training will focus on speed, strength, endurance and eating. Follow me for your first training session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then follows Takeshi out into an open area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you're first challenge we'll work on improving your natural abilities of fire breathing. I figured that you have been restricted from doing so by Sergio due to your recklessness. However, here you can hone it. This is also an agility and accuracy test. Normally I would allow rikishi to see how fast they can break these blocks of ice without relying on brute strength by using this slingshot, but for you I thought I try something different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then tries to focus and blast out a fireball, only for the fireball to dissipate once hitting the first block. Bowser then tries again, this time with the fireball leaving a small dent in the ice block. Bowser attempts two more times before giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, next we'll work on your strength and endurance. Please follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser nodded as he followed the wolf to a temple, yet something was familiar about it. Bowser realized it was one of the many temples dedicated to the former god of gluttony except this one didn't have the fabled Gourmand's Scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this an ancient temple?\" Bowser asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Our ancestors used it to pay homage to the gods in ancient times. We even have a dedication to the Protector of the Universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser raised a brow for he knew what the wolf meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As part of your training you'll spare against me. You may not win but training against someone that has more experience will help improve endurance and strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sumo proceed to bow before starting their practice match. With Every bout Bowser would gain some traction before losing. A few hours later the two walked back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad Koopzilla, but with time you'll be able to stand against opponents like Sergio and Shingo given time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving in the village Bowser helped prepare a huge feast. During the feast Bowser gorged himself till he was bloated. The rest of the day followed the same pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\nA few weeks later Bowser's training was definitely showing results. Bowser had managed to over 300 lbs. making him 1050 lbs. He also got much stronger and faster. Even his fire breath was better than before, making his newly grown fur coat an inconvenience since he was starting to become overheated. His shell, bracelets and choker were beginning to strain his heavier frame, and was hoping that he could get new ones asap. Bowser then looked at himself in the mirror and was shocked to see a fatter and hairier version of himself. For a moment he had a hard time recognizing the figure as a Koopa until he spotted his too small shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today starts the tournament tour. There's a few tournaments with each tournament lasting a day. I really need to shed this unnecessary fur coat. My inner fire should provide enough natural heat for me to survive a harsh winter like this thanks to Takeshi's training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready Bowser the airship is here to pick us up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Master Takeshi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then boards the airship only to be greeted by his fashion consultant, Queen Shy Gal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been ages since I've last seen you. Tsk tsk. This will never do. We need to get you cleaned up and into bigger clothes. Follows me to my mini-salon that's on this airship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser is then groomed and fitted for new attire. A few hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all done and my do you look fashionable. That will be 3000 coins or 300 bills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser looks in the mirror and is impressed with the results. He was glad that his unnecessary fur coat was removed for he felt a lot cooler without it and he noticed he he several new shells to choose from instead of just one. He noticed that the chokers and arm bands could easily be adjusted as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, this is sweet, but your make overs are never cheap.\" Bowser said as he pulled out a check for 300 bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you darling, but you have to go now. My next client wants me to make a fur coat for them.\" said Queen Shy Gal as she used magic to combine Bowser's former fur with some other hair from other clients to make a fur coat. \"Perfect. Now I can sell it to that human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then walks out only to see Tenzo who is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first tournament bore a heavy burden on Takeshi's team. This one needed to prove that Takeshi chose the right sumo for the job. Each victory brought them closer to advancing to the final round, but each loss hit hard. Bowser shifted in his seat, his eyes cemented to the action. The dull roar of chatter surrounded him on all sides. Then it rose to deafening heights each time a rikishi hit the ground. He lost track of his team, or their team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only saw the power and skill in the opposing rikishi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nervous?\" Tenzo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be a fool if I wasn't.\" Bowser turned from the action and faced the dragon. \"I have a lot to prove here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I have faith you will do fine.\" Tenzo stretched back in his seat, his gut shifted weight and settled between his legs. \"You've gotten a lot better at sparring, for sure. I almost broke a sweat our last practice round.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great and mighty Tenzo, how could I ever doubt myself.\" Bowser rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzo chortled to himself and watched the next match unfold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Bowser, and for a moment he thought he might win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser entered the ring with a million eyes on his back. He imagined their dismissal of him. A celebrity that paid his way into the elite Takeshi's team. He took to his section, noting his distance from the boundaries. They felt closer than normal, maybe there is such a thing as too big in sumo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inhaled deep, and took stance. His half-ton girth felt weightless in the moment. Adrenaline surged through his veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis opponent took position across from him. The beast stomped the ground. Bowser swore a small crack formed in the clay arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slowed to a crawl. Bowser's heart pounded in his ears. The beast took off. A mighty wall of sumo came hurtling towards him. Bowser hesitated. A mistake on his part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver a thousand pounds of rikishi smashed into him. Powerful arms snared him by the shoulders and began to pull him to the side. Bowser's muscles throbbed and seized in an attempt to fight back. His right foot rose from the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not today. Not here. Not now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser slammed his foot back down and struck the beast in the chest with an open palm strike. A thick slap drew a pained gasp from the opposing rikishi. Meaty pecs quivered while he stumbled back. Bowser charged forward, ready to seal his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to snag his opponent's shoulders, when the reeling rikishi sprung back into action with surprising speed. The beast grabbed Bowser's arms and threw down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser felt his left leg give out beneath him while his momentum took a downward shift. Months of training, of practice, and his overzealous sumo strategies would prove him the loser. The image of him stuck at a thousand pounds, no way to move up without Takeshi's help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe roared and struggled, a vague hope that his fury might break the beast's grip. Then, an opening. His arm broke free from his opponent's grasp with only milliseconds of time to turn the tide of the battle. Bowser hooked his free arm around the beast's side, Bowser's face pressed into its belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one powerful shove of his foot, his falling moment swept the beast off its feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser and his opponent entered free fall. The crowd screamed to life. Their voices muddled behind a wall of concentration. Bowser snarled, and tried to force the other rikishi to hit the ground first. He clenched his eyes tight and rolled his weight as best he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser hit the ground with a dull rumble. A sharp pain seared his shoulder. The clay ground cracked open at his force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over, and he had no idea if he won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rikishi stumbled to their feet. A strain due in part to low gravity centers. Bowser's monstrous gut brushed against the ground while he shoved himself up. He looked to his shoulder and saw a raw scrape and the tender black flesh of a bruise. A small crater where Bowser's shoulder smashed the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to his fellow teammates. Their eyes ranged from stern, to sad. He lost. He hit the ground first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Replay the clip.\" A judge called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge screen above the arena flashed to life. Bowser's struggle flashed before his eyes. To see himself on screen gave him shivers. What felt like hours of fighting did not even translate to a minute of replay time. Then, the moment of truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fell into free fall. Bowser held his breath. He watched his shoulder. He scrutinized it. He cursed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop the footage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser snapped to attention. His head dizzy from breaking his concentration. A yellow circle appeared on the screen. His opponent's fat hip brushed against the ground, with Bowser's shoulder mere centimeters away from the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koopzilla takes the victory.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser nearly fainted there on stage.</span></div></div>",

The intensity of the stomp was so great that Bowser landed on his belly. Bowser then heaves himself off the floor and heads to the training room.

I admire Shingo, but when he decides to sleep on the airship during these mini-tournaments barely anyone...\" said Berkon the bear before he was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough. You need to save that aggression for the ring. As a sekiwake you should be an example unto others.\" Shingo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser then notice that Shingo has definitely gotten larger. He figured that he was almost Takeshi's size. Yet Bowser didn't realize until now that Shingo must have been training over the past month, for he was now bigger than Sergio despite retaining his unique muscle gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up men. We were chosen to be the best of the best and I and my fellow yokozuna noticed that you were not at your full potential. So we have decided to do intensive training to help the team grow stronger. We will continue this type of training until the number of losses goes down for our team. So I suggest that you give it your all or go home. This is not the place for wimps.\" Sergio said glaring at the twenty something rikishi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser gulps and tries his best to keep up with the exercises. With that the three yokozuna started the intensive training. This was almost daily and everyday Bowser and his fellow rikishi would train until they dropped, which was followed by eating food that had tons of minerals and vitamins that would help the rikishi add more muscle while allowing some fat to be gained. Bowser was surprised that at each new mini-tournament that the team would start losing less and less. Bowser's doubts about being too large for sumo were also starting to disappear as he was gaining more flexing ability and strength. A few weeks later...</span></div></div>",

With this reputation Bowser was promoted to maegashira 13. This made him the same rank as Tenzo. Bowser was also the same size as his big blue friend. With both of them weighing 1200 lbs. Ithe was no doubt that they were known to the powerful rising stars on Takeshi's team. Yet when it came to muscle to fat ratio, Bowser had an even amount of fat and muscle while Tenzo had slightly more fat on his body. As the academy airship approached themail mansion Bowser noticed that the mansion was situated between two crevices in the mountaintop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, whoever owns this place really picked a good spot. The house is only a good walk from those volcanic springs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Bowser's team members looks at him as if he said something foolish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you heard that this mansion was abandoned?  There's been talk among the council a b out turning this place into another sumo stable.  That is why we're having a tournament here.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even amid the bustling crowds that now filed into the mansion-turned-arena, Bowser made out Clawdia from miles away. Of course Clawdia's tall, almost serpentine body, made it difficult to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser noticed some \"damage\" to her usual sleek figure, the hint of a paunch and the gap between her thighs closed a smidgen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clawdia.\" He said as he walked to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bowser.\" She nodded and narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood silent together while the crowd moved about them. Bowser cleared his throat and cracked a smile. This did not amuse his occasional flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is some ludicrous scheme to get back at me, then you've got another thing coming fat boy.\" Clawdia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really think you could exploit this stuff without getting your hands dirty? They're just a pinch smarter than you might realize.\" Bowser said. \"Did you think I was going to compromise my plan for the sake of your waistline? If anything, it's nice to see someone other than me pull some weight around here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser lumbered a little to the side and leaned up against heavy metal railing. He tested it with a fraction of his weight. When it stood up, he gave it a gradual amount of poundage before relaxing his full weight against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, you are going to need a much bigger castle this time next year.\" Clawdia prodded Bowser's fat side with a clawed finger. \"The boys are getting more 'regal' every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of turning his own castle into a sumo stable rattled in his mind. Perhaps upon reaching Yokozuna rank, he might be more qualified to run such an endeavor. Mario and company falling to an army of sumo gave him a new short term goal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have been following the training videos, correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kamek enforces it by cutting mealtimes for anyone who disobeys.\" Clawdia shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no wonder you're not so big yet.\" Bowser said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardy har.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just you here then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the whole clan showed up. They wanted to see if this whole sumo thing is worth it.\" Said Clawdia. \"Present company included.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, if anyone should be on board it's you. What with your power-lust.\" Bowser said. \"You don't know power until you have the strength to move steel pillars with your bare hands, pick up a thousand pounds and hurling it away, or make the ground quake beneath your feet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawdia pondered it for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I'm concerned, 'attractiveness' does not equal looks. No one dares call a commanding presence unattractive, wouldn't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have a point there tubbo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser shrugged and took his weight off the railing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everyone else you brought?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food court no doubt, your so-called training regiment wrecked their appetites. You know how hard it is to feed a castle of prospective sumo and run a country?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound like the extra money I make here is going nowhere, just relax will you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser smirked and trudged away. Making sure to stomp extra hard to shake Clawdia up a bit. She glared and focused for a minute in an attempt to levitate off the ground. It took her a second longer due to a few pounds extra weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumo friendly food courts were a new concept. That is to say, portions friendly to the sumo crowd. Amateur rikishi came from miles around to watch the pros compete, and \"inspired\" by their massive sizes, decided to overeat to compensate for their relatively small waistlines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser did not see them at all tournaments, the traditionalist ones more often than not, but the one outside the abandoned mansion took the cake. Then it went back for more. Booths circled the entire property with hundreds of different cuisines from all around the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of so much food forced a rumble from Bowser's titanic stomach. He kept his eye out for familiar faces, though it did not take long to find one. The distinct sound of a hovering broomstick drew Bowser to a hotdog stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, a rather overweight magikoopa awaited him there. His usual uniform, a billowing blue robe, pulled tight around his bulbous figure. A broomstick hovered beside him while he ordered his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kamek?\" Bowser said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Bowser! Good to see you had some time away from your business to come visit us common folk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking...well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you get so kind?\" Said Kamek. \"I haven't even reached half the size needed to compete as a rikishi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser felt his jaw hang a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're training to compete?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heavens no, I just figured that to uphold our end of the bargain, we all need to be at least competition weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not expect you to be so gung-ho about all of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will admit, the first couple of pounds frightened me. I never was all that thin, but to officially be fat, that's a different beast altogether.\" Said Kamek, then he rolled up his sleeve and flexed his bicep. Sure enough beneath the fat a small layer of muscle rose up. One alien to most magikoopa. \"Then I started seeing this I realized why you like it so much!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good look for you.\" Bowser said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Kamek nodded. \"Oh come, these booths are fantastic. I've been to at least twelve today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two approached the hotdog booth. Kamek stood on is toes to reach the counter and cleared his throat. Bowser peered inside. No one manned the thing, yet the greasers still appeared up and running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want eight, wait no, ten dogs with mustard. Hold the ketchup. And I also want a basket of fries.\" Kamek said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough a small box gave a small bell-tone and revealed the total amount of coins needed to complete the transaction. Kamek placed a small pile of coins on the counter, then shut the booth window. A minute or so went by, and the booth opened once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn place of the coins stood Kamek's order of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for ordering so much food, but you know you will need much more to feed me.\" Bowser said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense sir, but this is all for me. I figured you could get our own now.\" Kamek patted his middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser chuckled and approached the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" Kamek took a bite, a small amount of mustard dribbling onto his robe, \"it's easy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser peered into the empty stall again, curious as to how it all worked. When he saw a silhouette. Or rather, the silhouette of a silhouette. Almost like peering at someone through water or ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boos run these stands?\" Bowser mumbled out loud. A shy ghost flickered into vision, it's ghastly smile mere inches away from Bowser's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good eye, your majesty.\" The boo spoke, it's voice like the midnight breeze. \"No one spotted us yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tricky ghouls seem to have an affinity for mansions. Abandoned ones especially. Surprised I haven't seen your kind yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're all out here, manning the booths.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and what's the catch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None really.\" Said the boo. \"We used to serve the old master of the house before he left, and now we've tried biding our time 'til a new master found us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, boos serving someone for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it.\" Said the boo. \"We ghosts lack the means to enjoy a delicious tastes and smells of a meal, it's made some of our kind bitter yes, but we discovered a way to work it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" Said Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, when the old master of the mansion ate, one of us took turns 'sharing' his body.\" Said the boo. \"We got to experience all of the wonders of the living, and he got free food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume that's why you are all so eager to serve a food court.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, so we mean you no harm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser glanced at the ghost, then took a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Bowser said. \"Well, I'm not all that hungry, and really I'm just looking for family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That so?\" Kamek said, he already finished half his plate.\"I can take you around, I'm sure they're dying to see you again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy magikoopa approached his broom and saddled it. Rolls of fat spilled over the sides of the stick while he attempted to pull it upward. His belly jiggled while it rose a few feet up, stopping just short of Bowser's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast, I think I'm in need of a bigger broom.\" Said Kamek. \"Alright then, I'll lead the way. Just might take a bit, I'm not as fast as I used to be.\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Nearly, but slowly heading towards immobility. From last time, Bowser's gut was just merely three feet thick with fat, now it was more than eight feet thicker now, spreading and growing as much as the fat paunch could do. His pair of plump moobs grew and rounded out to the size of beach balls resting on his large fat pile of a belly. His chins had doubled since too, now six thick ringed chins occupied where his neck was. His arms and legs grew thicker, flabby scaled flesh drooping and sagging greatly. His face cheeks were now the size of basketballs, wobbling even just for breathing with a soft and very doughy muzzle accompanying them. His love handles grew in numbers and thickness since then while his sagging, gelatinous, spherical rump cheeks were the size of extra large bean bags. His tail had been swallowed up a long time ago by his growing ballooning rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob that was once the proud King of the Koopas, open one of his eyes  and look at Kamek for interrupting his sleep to sleep off his latest binge today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it? Can't you see I'm busy sleeping?\", Bowser asks tiredly, his cheeks wobble and bounce greatly from him speaking with his muzzle's blubber jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamek hesitant for a moment before addressing his king of the news he bears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My King, someone has wished an audience with you. He said you and him met on opposite sides once.\" Bowser raised an eyebrow at this little information. Someone who was once his enemy wishes an audience with him? Who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamek continued,\"With his master gone, he has no where else to go and the Mushroom Kingdom bears ill will towards for serving his master. He wishes to lend you his service for place to stay and sustenance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser wanted to say that this stranger's desire for an audience with him to be denied, but couldn't. He had nothing better to do. What was there for him to lose just for accepting an audience with someone who knows him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\", Bowser finally said. Kamek look at his king surprise at his acceptance. \"Let him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right away, your majesty.\", stuttered Kamek, leaving to inform and send in the guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled Bowser's bedroom. Bowser decide to take the time by wondering who is the being who wanted an audience with him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud. Bowser blinked, startled from that thud from nowhere. Thudthudthud. Bowser tries raise his immense frame up, preparing for whatever is coming his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wait that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wide doors burst open, a rotund figure enters the room before bowing before the huge wide eyed koopa blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Bowser, I Midbus, wish to lend my services and strengths to you.\", announce the rotund pink warthog like creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIDBUS!?!\", Bowser shouted, his entire soft blubbery frame jiggling, wobbling, and rippling like an ocean in a stormy weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lord Bowser.\", Midbus answers the morbidly obese Koopa King, still bowing before him. \"It is I, Midbus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser stared at the pink hefty pig creature for a long moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..you wish to serve me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus nodded, still not getting up from his bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser cough a little, still a bit caught off guard. \"Well, how can you be of service to me? What skills and reasons why I should take you in my humble abode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus immediately answers without a moment to waste. \"My strength for one, if you could remember, physically out matches against any of your minions you have now. Two, my strategic and tactic skills are far above any of your current high-ranked minions could ever hoped to be. Finally, I'm a great chef in many areas of cuisines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence once again filled the chamber with the exception of the breathes of the two beings within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser closed his eyes and sigh,\"...I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus looked up in slight surprise at this from his bowing position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be provided shelter and sustenance here in my castle for your services to me for this day on.\", Bowser continued, feeling tired and just want this day to end. \"Now leave me be, I wish to return to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGratitude filled Midbus's eyes. \"Thank you, Lord Bowser. You won't regret this, I swear.\" Bowser rolled his eyes at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah now go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus stood there, looking at Bowser in uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Lord Bowser?\", Midbus questioned nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus looks at his new blobby master expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will I do now? How will I serve you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser blinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I guess you can start using your so-called chef skills you said you have in my castle's grand kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus gratefully bows yet again before getting up leaving his new master's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Lard Bowser!\", the hefty pink colored warthog yells at the koopa blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then a thought occured to Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait!\", Bowser yells at his new servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus stopped and turn around swiftly to his master with a questioning glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda curious.\", Bowser said hesitantly. \"Why haven't you said anything about my...obvious recent change?\" As best as he could, the very obese koopa gestures towards his massive blubbery blob of a body to his warthog servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I haven't said anything because there isn't worth anything to you saying about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser slightly raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanna hear what you think about it.\", Bowser says with a commanding tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus at this point, started to shuffle nervously and tried to look anywhere but his master who raised an eyebrow again at this display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lord Bowser, I think it's...\", Midbus tilts his head down. \"I think it look goods on you. Kinda handsome and a bit cute even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidbus, without warning, spun around and ran towards the door of the bedroom. \"I WILL GO TO THE KITCHENS NOW, MY LORD!!!\", the pink tubby warthog shouted, leaving the room and the wide eyed koopa behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring where the pig was for a few moments in awkward silence, before putting his head on his pillows groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well', the bewildered and irritated overly corpulent koopa king thought.

The preps at the back of the lunchroom, nerds off to some teacher's classroom for sanctuary, the jocks always parked themselves close to the lunch lines, and then there was Ludwig, whom always sat in the corner of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow first looks would tell you Ludwig was a loner, an introvert. For the most part you would be right. At this point it was slightly his fault. To fully understand, Rewind to his Freshman year. It was at an odd point in his Koopa life span that would ultimately turn him away from everyone. You see, koopa puberty is much like human puberty in that all organs develop and such and such. However Depending on genetics, koopa puberty is supposed to build the alpha male. Unfortunately the alpha male in koopa history was usually on the portly side. The bigger, the more power. So metabolism changes rapidly and appetite grows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fateful summer Ludwig went from pretty thin, to portly and pudgy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a bit of a laughing stock, the butt of many jokes for a good portion of that year. Changing in the PE locker rooms was a nightmare, with his  bare soft flabby stomach out in the open for everyone to see . It didn't help that he would wolf down his meals and go back for not only seconds, but fifths at lunch. Everyone thought he was just letting himself go and he was just turning into a nasty slob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthree years later and while he managed to gain control of his appetite, and it had seemed he had plumped up for good. Fortunately for him he evened out with height and managed to hide a bit weight gain. Unfortunately for him, you can't fight nature, and if you try it will bite back hard. </span></div></div>",

Its for my birthday and I thought you might like to come.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks went off in Ludwig's mind, a pool party with her? Was this a joke or something? Ludwig scanned her face hoping to spot a joke in her eyes. It almost seemed to good to be true! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course\" Ludwig replied a little dumbfounded, praying she could not hear his stomach rumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I'll see you there.\" She said with a smile and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLudwig smiled to himself and folded his arms. He could hardly believe it. Of course there was still  a few problems. One, his appetite was still killing him. Two, did he even have a swimming suit that still fit? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of that day Ludwig was about ready to pass out. His stomach ached and roared through all his classes, so much so one of the teachers asked him to leave the room so as not to distract the students. Not to mention the nervous butterflies fluttering around in his stomach, and the hopeful air in his brain. He raced to his room and threw open his drawers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sifted around to find a pair of swimming trunks frantically. Tossing clothing left and right hoping that he would eventually find them. The fruits of his labors paid off and he eventually had a pair of swimming trunks in his hands. He held them up in front of him and prayed they would still fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed aside his shell and poked his legs through his trunks. He closed his eyes and pulled up. With a sigh of relief they slid up with ease and in fact dangled off his hips. He tied the draw strings taught and stared at himself in the mirror. The past few years had been generally kind to him, his once doughy belly was now mostly flat once more and the beginnings of his double chin had disappeared. He was not at all embarrassed to go to that pool party at all. He smiled to himself and nodded his head, this weekend might just be wonderful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Growl!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLudwig clutched his stomach and stared down, the noise was a grim reminder of what his body was trying to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no...not now\" Ludwig groaned at his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting worse too, the growl was more of a low roar. The room was getting blurry and he didn't just want something, his body <i>needed</i> something to eat immediately. He sat on his bed and stared at the ceiling, his mind rationalizing everything. Your trunks will fit by the party if you just give in once or twice, no big. They are baggy on you now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes widened with excitement as he tore open the wrappers and stuffed his face bar after bar. The chocolate melted in his mouth and flowed down his throat. Never had he tasted something so magnificent, so sweet and amazing. He could not bring himself to stop at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his greedy claws scraped the bottom of the box and the binge was stopped in its tracks. Ludwig groaned and laid upon his bed again. His stomach full of chocolate and guilt, he licked his lips to savor what chocolate was left and stared at the ceiling. He was rather upset with himself, but a soothing voice at the back of his mind spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>just once didn't matter at all Ludwig, you're fine, see the trunks still fit. You're going to be fine</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be fine.\" Ludwig agreed and rubbed his stomach as his eyes closed shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Ludwig slowly stirred awake to the sound of his alarm. His eyes still heavy with sleep, the last night was a restless one. He had the same vivid nightmare over and over, him at the pool party three times as huge as he is now. Jumping into the pool splashed everyone, people stared at him as he walked, he couldn't see his feet anymore his belly was so large. It was so vivid, so real, it scared him. As he rose out of his bed he stared down at this body, and sighed with relief. The binge from yesterday had no visible damage. Unfortunately, the hunger pains had come back worse than before. He tried to ignore it throughout his daily routine, but he reached dangerous pass out levels in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked much faster than the day before, he rushed to the breakfast table still in his underwear and began scarfing away the delicious array of foods. Pancakes slathered with butter and thick rich syrup, bacon as long as rulers and more than an inch thick. Plate, after plate, after plate, he just couldn't stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it's good to be royalty\" Ludwig said as he wiped away bits and chunks of food from his lips as he chugged away a gallon of orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ludwig!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLudwig choked a little on the juice and swallowed the last gulp and turned around. It was Iggy restraining a laugh as his older blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh...uh I can explain all this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"right, right, how about you get some pants on so you don't scare people.\" Iggy sniggered a little, \"wow you didn't save any bacon for me did ya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLudwig stared at the plate and scratched the back of his head nervously. The mountains of pancakes had been reduced to hills and grease stained plates were vacant of bacon.  Blushing even more so than before he ran upstairs and finished getting dressed, his stomach pooching out from the stuffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate my worst dreams are going to come true...\" Ludwig muttered to himself as he made his way to school<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After forty times of each, he looked like a creature that had eaten forty thousand and one clones and the real Wario. He went back to his home, and went to look in one of his other fridges for more food. He looked in his freezer, and saw a big container of chocolate ice-cream, and took it out. He also searched one of his droors, and found some cookies of all kinds of chocolatey type. He started gobbling it all up, and finally looked even bigger than that. He fell over on to his back, with his shirt being above his huge belly, and his thighs being difficult to see. In the process of falling onto his back as a result of balance loss, he hiccuped. Luckily, because of his skills in mystic arts, he managed to teleport himself to a home of his with a big bed in a bedroom. He made some more of the food he ate earlier with these skills, and had them all fall into his mouth while he was sitting, with a huge amount of the ice cream he ate earlier being forty times as much callories being the last of it all. As a result of that, while his hands were in front of his belly, it bulged to the point where he looked like a creature that had eaten sixty thousand and one clones of Wario plus the real Wario himself. He hiccuped, as he laid himself on his back because of balance loss. For once and for the time being, he felt full. Feeling like he needed to rest for a while, he still felt there were more options.</span></div></div>",
