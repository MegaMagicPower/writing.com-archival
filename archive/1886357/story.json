The sky was a faded grey with the suns light faintly shining through. Marco did not know where he was going nor did he care at the moment, his only focus was a very large rusted pillar of metal. In one of the books Marco had read as a kid it described buildings like that were called Skyscrapers because of there height, It even showed a picture of a beautiful building reflecting the suns light from windows that shone like mirrors. But this building now was nothing but rusted metal with no windows and half of it blown off from what Marco suspects was a bomb that was dropped here 100 years ago. Marco wore Black combat boots, a spiked leather jacket with light but tough chainmail lining the inside, a kevlar vest, black camo pants, yellow sunglasses, and a battered slightly ripped scarf wrapped around his neck that his father wore while hunting. Marco's hair was snow white and he had blue eyes. Marco stopped walking before slowly moving his left hand down towards his belt to grab one of the 8 throwing knives he kept. He could sense someone was behind him, watching him, He could hear there breathing which sounding different than normal human breaths. Marco slowly turned around with a firm grip on the knife but what he saw wasn't a mutant, Instead it was another human. \"Don't you fucking Move!\" shouted the person with a female voice and Marco stared stupidly with shock. She wore black camo pants, Black boots, Black gloves, A black jacket, A Black Kevlar vest,  A black backpack and covering her face was a obsidian black gasmask with 2 filters attached to it. On her belt she wore a pistol and underneath her backpack was a large sniper rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco kept staring for a second before looking down at her assault rifle that she was pointing at him. \"Where is your gasmask?\" she asked looking him up and down and Marco shook his head. \"I do not need one\" he replied and this seemed to anger her. \"Bull shit!\" she shouted at Marco who shook his head. \"Im immune\" he replied and she stared at him for a few seconds. \"Drop your blades!\" she shouted to him and he sighed before beginning to take all his daggers and his two swords out of there sheaths and he dropped them onto the ground. The girl slowly moved towards him till she was only two feet from him before she hit him with the butt of her assault rifle in a flash causing Marco to fall backwards and crashing down onto the ground. \"Agh!, Bitch!\" shouted Marco before he was looking down the barrel of her assault rifle again. \"Alright you son of a bitch, Where are your Anti's?!\" shouted the girl before Marco pulled the hidden knife out of his dagger, Hit her assault rifle to his right before jumping up and putting the knife to the side of her neck. \"Calm the FUCK down....Alright?\" asked Marco and the Girl nodded before Marco put his knife back in his boot. \"Where, Is your gasmask\" she demanded again but Marco shook his head. \"My parents wore them, My mother worn them, I have never worn one in my life, I am IMMUNE\" said Marco clearly and the girl was speechless.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How is that even possible?\" asked the girl and Marco shrugged before lifting the pot lid to see if the water was boiled yet. The two of them had gone down into the subway station of the ruined city to avoid detection. The subway walls were filthy with dirt and dust from over the years, The floor was red and what use to be signs were now nothing but rusted metal. \"So what is your name?\" asked the girl and Marco smiled. \"Marco, And yours?\" he asked. \"Raven\" she replied and Marco smiled. \"So, I got a question, Are there any other humans alive?\" asked Marco and Raven nodded. \"Many, But not here, we have to go to the Fortress North of here\" replied Raven before she pulled out a syringe from her backpack. \"Whats that?\" asked Marco before Raven rolled up her sleeve and pushed the syringe into the underside of her arm before injecting a blue tinted liquid into her arm. \"It is a anti-mutation injection, It allows me to take off my gasmask so I can eat and drink while outside of a fortress\" replied Raven before pulling off her mask. Raven had short black hair with her bangs near her eyes, Her eyes were ice blue. Raven pulled out a paper bag before pulling out half a venison sandwich. \"Want half?\" asked Raven and Marco nodded before taking the half Raven held out to him. \"Nice sword\" commented Raven looking at Marco's longest sword. \"My family calls it a Wakato, My father says it comes from somewhere named Japan\" said Marco and Raven Nodded. \"I don't know what it is originally called, But there identifiable by the thin blade and the slight curve\" said Raven and Marco nodded with a smile. \"So, Are you going to follow me to the Fortress? Im collecting my bounty reward\" asked Raven before taking a bite out of her half of the sandwich. \"I might as well, If I don't Im probably going to die, So yeah, I'll come\" replied Marco before Raven finished her sandwich. Raven pulled up a bottle of water from her backpack before unscrewing the lid and taking a few drinks before offering some to Marco but he shook his head not wanting any. Raven then picked up her gasmask and put it on before tightening the straps and then pulling her jackets hood up. \"Lets go\" said Raven beginning to pick her equipment up and Marco grabbed his things before following her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So tell me, whats your story?\" asked Marco walking down the road beside Raven. Marco was now curious about Raven's history and what it has been like living with other humans her whole life. \"Well, I am a bounty hunter\" she replied and Marco gave her a confused look. \"Whats that?\" asked Marco and Raven smiled underneath her mask. \"A Bounty Hunter in the 21st century was a person who went out to collect criminals when they did not show up to court I believe, Now, Bounty Hunters are assigned to kill Mutants by Fortress' for Merchants to easily come into an area and find anything worth caps\" she replied and Marco looked at her confused. \"What?, You've never heard of Caps? beer bottle caps? the current currency?\" she asked and Marco shook his head. \"Well you use Caps to buy things, for example, A bottle of Soda is 10 caps while something like an assault rifle is 4000\" said Raven before the two of them turned the corner to find a Mutant standing 40 feet infront of them facing them. \"Ah, A Morger scout\" said Raven before flicking her assault rifle to single shot and then aiming while she looked down the enhancing scope that zoomed in 4x more than human vision. \"Head or Heart?\" asked Raven and Marco shrugged. \"Heart\" he replied before Raven pulled the trigger on her rifle and a loud <i>Bang!</i> echoed through the air. The bullet shredded through the Mutant's chest and finally its heart before ripping out the other side and it collapsed down onto the ground dead. \"You called it a Morger, Whats a Morger?\" asked Marco. \"Morgers are humans that have become infected and have reached the stage where there brain begins changing but have not mutated past that point, They are much more organized than normal Mutants but they are extremely stupid and piss poor runners\" explained Raven while her and Marco approached the mutated corpse. When they reached the corpse Marco closed his eyes for a second in disgust before examining it. The Morger was wearing shredded up blue jeans, No shoes and a shredded leather jacket. The left side of the Morgers head no longer had human properties. Its left side of the head was made up of a series of Large boils and growths that covered the area where its eye use to be and and flopped out of the Morgers mouth was a long lizard like yellow tongue that had enlarged taste buds the size of pee's. \"Lets keep moving\" said Raven pulling the scope off her assault rifle before flicking it back to automatic and her and Marco kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Raven and Marco had left the city and were now walking towards a large lake in the distance with what looked like a large fortress on the other side. Marco couldn't make out any details of it yet but while he was looking at the fortress he did not notice the 2 very large men walking towards them. The two of them looked like they had been building there muscles up all there lives to Marco. They approached and greeted Raven before they got to asking about Marco. One of the men had light skin, He wore a long grey trench coat that had been modified so he could carry 4 pistols on the outside on each side. He had Black steel toe boots on and a black gasmask. The second Man had dark skin and wore a black jacket with a bullet resistant vest for heavy fire. He wore a grey gasmask and a pair of brown work boots. \"Hello Raven, How'd your bounty go?\" asked the light skinned man and Raven smiled underneath her mask. \"Very well actually, I met a new friend\"  she replied gesturing towards Marco who gave a small wave. \"Where is the guys mask?\" asked the dark skinned male and Raven shrugged. \"He say's he is immune, He hasn't worn one the whole time I've known him which is about 4 hours and none of the symptoms have appeared so I guess he really is\" said Raven and the Light skin male nodded. \"So, You guys going on a bounty or...?\" asked Raven and the Dark skinned man shook his head. \"Nope, Were going to see    Mr Wise\" replied the dark skinned man and Raven nodded. \"I'll come up there after I do a few more bounties, I might bring my friend here as well\" said Raven before shaking hands with them. \"See you between a week to 2 weeks then\" said the light skinned man before Raven and Marco kept walking. \"Who were they?\" asked Marco walking backwards so he can look at Raven's face. \"2 other bounty hunters that are close friends of mine, I've known the two of them since I was 6, Im 19 now so thats 13 years of friendship, The light skinned man's name is Hammer and the Dark skinned man is Axle\" said Raven before she looked up at the fortress in the distance. \"You can share my room with me, They make new comers sleep in the lower parts of the fortress and they are usually filthy, I just hope you know how to share a bed because if you try hogging the blankets or groping me, Ill shove a knife down your urethra...Got it?\" asked Raven giving Marco a serious look and he smiled. \"I shared a bed with my mother and father every day of my life, Ill behave\" he said before chuckling and Raven smiled. \"Good, Then you and me will be good friends, When we get inside the fortress you will have to go through a medical examination and fill out a form for a job, If you want you can become my new partner!, You seem to know how to handle yourself\" said Raven while leaning closer to Marco near the end of her sentence and Marco smiled. \"What happened to your old partner?\" asked Marco. \"Ill tell you later when you get clarified to walk around the fortress\" replied Raven before the two of them began walking around the lake to the fortress. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh shit\" said Raven while she took out her assault rifles scope and locked it onto her rifle before looking through her scope to see a swarm of Morger in the middle of a fight with the fortress guards. \"Come on!\" shouted Raven to Marco before Marco drew both his Wakato and his Kinashi. The Kinashi was the same as the Wakato except it had a shorter blade and Marco mainly used it for blocking in his left hand. \"Help me kill these things\" said Raven before aiming her assault rifle and beginning to open fire while running towards them at a steady pace. Marco sprinted by her with her swords pointed backwards. Marco reached the first Morger which to Marco looked like the walking dead. Marco slashed with both his swords at the Morger with his right arm going left and his left going right allowing him to cut the top of the Morgers head off before chopping its head off at the neck at the same time. The dead morger collapsed to the ground with its blood gushing out of its neck. 2 other Morgers ran towards Marco one carrying a large 2x4 with 4 large nails sticking out of one end. \"Graah!!\" screamed the Morgers before Marco blocked the nailboard with his Kinashi and slashing the other's neck open before quickly spinning around and chopping the hands off the Morger holding the nail board. The Morger let out a inhuman scream before Marco stabbed both his Wakato and Kinashi through the chest of the Morger. Marco threw his sword up into the air before quickly grabbing one of his throwing knives and throwing it through the air. The knife spun through the air before burying itself into a Morgers forehead and it collapsed to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die!!\" shouted a Morger with a high pitched voice before it charged towards Raven while it screamed like a banshee. Raven took aim with her assault rifle before pulling the trigger sending 3 rounds through its chest and the Morger collapsed backwards coughing and choking on its own blood. Raven heard running behind her before she spun around with her assault rifle held only by her right hand before the assault rifle crashed into a Morger's head so hard the right side of its skull caved in and it collapsed to the ground. Raven used moist mud on the ground to spin herself to her right before she aimed again and shot 2 rounds through the skull. \"I will crush your skull!!\" screamed a Morger and when Raven spun around she found a Morger charging with a sledge hammer in its grip. Raven determined this Morger must be rather new to infection since he was carrying a actual weapon instead of a makeshift one. Raven quickly aimed her rifle to fire but all that came from her rifle was a rapid clicking noise declaring she was out of ammo. Raven looked down at the ground and saw a large rock on the ground and she smiled before bringing her foot back and kicking it like a soccer ball. The rock soared through the air before smashing dead center into the Morger's face breaking its nose. The mud on the ground caused the Morger to slip and fall onto its ass and Raven used this opportunity to eject the clip inside her rifle allowing it to fall to the ground before she grabbed her replacement off her belt and slammed it up inside her assault rifle before running up and shooting down at the Morger sending 3 bullets through its chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco looked around himself to find that he was completely surrounded by the Mutated and deformed Morger. Marco readied his Wakato and Kinashi before the Morger charged towards him. Marco stabbed his Kinashi into a Morger's chest infront of him while stabbing the one behind him with his Wakato. Marco ripped the blades out of there side before cutting another 2 in half before stabbing both his swords back and stabbing another two. One of the Morger's ran up while Marco did this and went to tackle him but Marco brought his foot up before kicking the Morger back causing it to fall to the ground. Before the Morger could get up Marco spin around and stabbed both his swords through its chest killing it before ripping his blades out the side and holding them in the Reverse grip while looking around for any more but they were all dead now. \"Nice sword work\" said Raven as she walked up to Marco and Marco nodded. \"I was taught how to use them by my father\" replied Marco before Raven pointed to the fortress. \"Lets go\" said Raven and with that Marco slashed his Wakato and Kinashi Cleaning all the blood off with the slash before putting them into there sheathes and the two of them began walking.</span></div></div>",

The Main door was a very large black door that lifted up when opened. It had large faded numbers written on it that said 63. When the door was fully open Marco and Raven both entered the Fortress. Infront of them were 4 guards wearing black Kevlar vests, black soldier helmets, Black pants and black jackets along with gasmasks. \"Please follow us\" said one of the guards before they began walking down the hallway and Raven and Marco began following them down a old rusted hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Loud <i><b>BEEP!</b></i> echo'd through the room before Marco, Raven and the guards were all sprayed by a white smoke that began to fill the room. \"Where is this guys mask?\" asked one of the guards pointing to Marco. \"He's immune\" replied Raven and the guard was speechless. \"Whats the big deal? So what if I am immune? Haven't they discovered a vaccine for this thing yet? You guys got those anti-mutation shots, They haven't developed it from that to make it permanent?\" asked Marco giving Raven a questioning look and she shook her head. \"No, Anti-mutation shots cannot be developed any further, It took scientists 20 years after the end of the world to make a single drop of it, When they knew what they had created they tried making it into a cure, But it can't be concentrated anymore, And this smoke is the anti-mutation in gas form to kill any of the mutation on us\" replied Raven and Marco thought for a moment. \"So, The shots give you temporary immunity and kills any Mutation before it can effect your body, Correct?\" asked Marco and Raven nodded before taking off her gasmask as another door opened. Marco and Raven began walking towards it but the guards stopped them. \"He will need to be examined by a doctor\" said the guard and Raven nodded. \"Alright, Follow them Marco, Ill meet you outside the doctor's office\" said Raven before Marco followed the guards to see one of the Doctor's.</span></div></div>",

He had been waiting for atleast 20 minutes now and he was getting fed up with it. The room was old, rusted and the chairs didn't match, The room was poorly lit with the only light being a desk lamp on the table. The chair Marco was sitting in was made out of old grey wood and the chair the doctor would be sitting in had the black leather shredded and 2 of the wheels were gone. The room smelled like chemicals and rust which was beginning to give Marco a splitting headache. Just as Marco was going to get up the door swung open with squeaking hinges and the doctor walked in. He had grey hair, scratched glasses and he wore a blood stained white doctor coat. \"Sorry about that\" said the doctor before taking a seat in the other chair. \"The guards and a bounty hunter claim that you are immune to the Mutation, I don't believe you\" said the Doctor and Marco rolled his eyes. He wanted to grab the desk lamp and smash it over the doctor's head at that moment. \"If you are telling the truth however, You won't mind me injecting you with this\" said the scientist holding up a syringe filled with a grey mucky liquid. \"Whats that?\" asked Marco curiously. \"This is a water sample from the wasteland, It is contaminated with the Mutation so if you really are immune this won't effect you, however if you are not then we will shoot you in the head\" replied the doctor before Marco rolled up his sleeve and put his arm out. \"Go ahead\" said Marco showing no fear in his eyes and with that the Doctor injected the infected water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfifteen minutes had past which was usually the time people began vomiting which was always the first sign of the Mutation and as the minutes went by the Doctor became more and more surprised. \"My god....Its true isn't it?\" asked the Doctor shocked and Marco nodded before standing up. \"Can I go now?\" asked Marco and the Doctor nodded still shocked before Marco walked out of the Doctor's office. The Doctor quickly run out of his office before taking a left and running down the hallway towards the Overseer's office. He had to tell the Overseer of the news, Without it they would miss out on a giant opportunity. The Doctor reached the Overseer's office at record time and opened the door as quick as he could. \"I need to tell you something!\" said the Doctor to the Overseer who looked up from his desk. \"Out with it then Doctor!\" demanded the Overseer. \"A man inside the Fortress...He is Immune!\" said the doctor. At first the Overseer did not believe the Doctor till the Doctor explained that he injected the man with Mutated water and with that the Overseer sat back down to think. \"Give me awhile to think\" said the Overseer before the doctor nodded and left the room.</span></div></div>",

Raven wore a black tanktop along with a pair of black jeans and black boots. Around her neck she wore a silver amulet in the shape of a bird spreading its wings, A Raven to be exact. Raven's room had a old grey cement floor and a 2 person bed made out of old wood. In the corner of the room was a shelf loaded with heapons and in the other corner was a chest. \"Here, You need one\" said Raven handing Marco a black pistol and Marco took it. \"Thank you\" said Marco and Raven nodded. \"Now, tomorrow I am getting a new contract, So your free to come with me and help out, its probably nothing special but it would be nice to have some company\" said Raven and Marco smiled. \"Alright Ill come...\" began Marco before someone began knocking on the door. \"excellent, One sec\" said Raven before opening the door revealing the Overseer and 12 fortress guards behind him. \"We need your friend Marco\" said the Overseer simply and Raven looked back at Marco for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours after the Overseer came to Raven's door Marco was laying strapped down on top of a table so he could not move. After a few moments of looking at the ceiling the Overseer walked into the room followed by 6 doctors. The Overseer came into Marco's sight and smiled at Marco. The Overseer wore a clean black suit and tie and had short black hair and olive colored eyes. \"Hello Marco\" said the Overseer before beginning to pace around the table. \"I am the Overseer, And I....\" began the Overseer but Marco interrupted. \"and let me guess, You are sorry for the inconvenience\" said Marco and the Overseer smiled. \"Yes, But I have some bad news and good News, What one do you want to hear first?\" asked the Overseer. \"There is no good news these days\" said Marco and the Overseer nodded. \"This is, We found whats missing from the cure\" said the Overseer and Marco forced his head up to give him a questioning look. \"And the bad?\" asked Marco. \"The bad news is, We have found a Tumor inside your heart that somehow is producing this chemical that we need to produce the cure, Which explains your immunity, Since your blood is constantly flowing through your body and it is mixed with this chemical it has made your entire body 100% immune to the mutation, This Tumor is 100% harmless and only the size of a sesame seed, But amazingly it has kept you immune your whole life\" said the Overseer and Marco got angry. \"And now you want to rip my fucking heart out\" said Marco and the Overseer smiled down evilly at Marco. \"Exactly\" he said before continuing to walk around the table. \"You see, In the 21st century the Surgeons at the time could have possibly done this and collected a sample of this chemical and then make it themselves, The problem is that you would have only had a 30% chance of living, Now, You have a 100% chance of dying\" said the Overseer and Marco began fighting his bonds. \"Ill fucking kill you!\" shouted Marco reaching for his knives but they were all gone, \"Looking for these?\" asked the Overseer holding up Marco's belt that had all his knives on it. \"You fucking Cock sucker!\" shouted Marco before the Overseer brought his hand back and then back-handed Marco across the left cheek. \"Shut up!. Doctors!, Cut this little dipshit open so we can begin the process, Then we will all be hero's!\" said the Overseer but the Doctor's did not come. \"DOCTORS!!\" yelled the Overseer walking to the door and he went to open it but at that moment the door was kicked open sending the Overseer onto his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards!\" yelled the Overseer to the guards in the room but before the guards could move a silver canister was thrown into the room before a very loud <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><u><b>BANG!!!</b></u></font> echoed through the room followed by a blinding flash. Marco couldn't see anything for 15 seconds and he couldn't hear anything but a loud ringing noise in his ears. When his senses came back to him he noticed all of the Guards on the ground dead and Raven holding a 12-Gauge shotgun to the Overseer's forehead. \"Move, and I blow your fucking brains across the ground\" said Raven who had her gasmask on and her other wilderness clothing. \"You do that whore and you'll be hunted down and burned!!\" yelled the Overseer before Raven moved towards Marco without taking her aim off the Overseer. \"You alright?\" asked Raven not fully looking at Marco. \"Yes, Thanks\" said Marco before Raven took a knife off her belt and cut the leather straps. \"You'll pay for this!, You hear me!?!\" yelled the Overseer before Raven ran up to him and smashed the butt of her shotgun into his forehead knocking him out. \"Lets go, I got 2 horses waiting\" said Raven before Marco quickly began putting his equipment on.</span></div></div>",

The Market place was a giant room 1000 feet in length and 500 in width. Many people were buying and selling goods and it many children played every day in the Marketplace. As Raven and Marco made there way through the Marketplace Raven noticed about halfway that 26 guards were after them. \"We have company\" said Marco and Raven nodded before getting an idea. \"Vomit!\" shouted Raven to Marco and he gave her a questioning look before she shoved a finger into his mouth while he tried to answer and down his throat to trigger his gag reflex. Marco leaned forward and Vomited up his last meal before Raven took off her gasmask and shouted \"MUTATION!!!\" while pointing at Marco. With that everyone in the Marketplace froze and stared at Marco before everyone began screaming and running in all opposite directions to get away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guards were trampled by the screaming and terrified crowd trying to get as far away as possible and with the excuse Marco and Raven sprinted out of the Marketplace and down a set of stairs. \"Where are we going?\" asked Marco before swallowing a drink of water to get rid of the acidic feeling in his throat and mouth. \"Secret exit, Bounty hunters use it alot\" replied Raven before reaching another door made out of steel. Raven began entering a code before Marco began hearing more guards on there way. \"hurry up\" said Marco before the door made a Beep and Raven opened it before her and Marco went inside and Raven closed it while the Guards were on there way down the staircase. Raven quickly locked the door before running up to another door similar and entering her code again. Just as the guards opened the door Raven opened the one to the outside. The guards of Silvermine instantly slammed there door shut from paranoia of getting infected and thats when Raven and Marco sprinted outside into the wilderness. \"You got everything right?\" asked Raven and Marco quickly looked at all his weapons. \"Yes\" replied Marco before Raven made a clicking noise with her mouth and 2 horses walked out from behind a rock covered in chainmail. \"Do you know how to ride a horse?\" asked Raven getting ontop of her horse and Marco nodded. \"Yes\" said Marco before climbing ontop and the two of them began riding away from Silvermine fortress.</span></div></div>",

Oh yeah just a bit tired, I haven't slept in 44 hours so...yeah, But we will make camp shortly\" replied Raven. Marco couldn't see much up ahead. The Night sky made everything invisible, If Raven wasn't on a horse he wouldn't even know where she was. \"Why don't we turn on a light or something?\" asked Marco. \"Morger\" Raven simply Replied before taking a deep breath. \"Morger are like Moth's in a way, They crowd around any light they can find during the Night, During the day they scavenge for food, if they saw us with a Light they would surround us and then rip us apart\" said Raven before Marco felt Raven nudge him with something and Marco took it. They were some kind of goggles made out of metal. When Marco put them on the Night changed from Darkness to clear as day. Everything was black and white but atleast he could see everything perfectly. \"How far from Silvermine are we?\" asked Marco and Raven took a moment to think about it. \"Probably....60 miles....give or take 10\" she replied before slowing her horse down and Marco did the same. \"We will make camp and enter that city tomorrow\" said Raven before getting off her horse and Marco did the same. \"So what do we do for pillows and blankets?\" asked Marco before turning around to find Raven pulling the saddle's off the horses and putting them down on the ground. \"Not the best pillow but id rather have it than putting my head on a rock\" said Raven before Marco walked up and laid down on the ground. \"Take these off\" said Raven pulling Marco's Nightvision off before putting it down beside him. \"Good night, ill see you in 4 hours\" said Raven. \"Good Night\" said Marco back before the two of them fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

In a flash Raven had her pistol aiming at the man but it was a worthless gesture because a second later Raven and Marco heard 10 assault rifles cock. \"Drop it\" said a woman's voice and when Marco looked she had a shotgun up to Raven's head. With that Raven dropped the pistol onto the ground. \"How long ago was it when you took the anti?\" asked the woman holding the shotgun. All 11 of the targets wore sand colored trench coats with old torn/beaten up cowboy hats ontop of there heads. Raven knew the clans name, It was called Keffrin clan, They were widely known throughout the fortresses and were considered one of the most efficient bounty hunter clans for clearing Morger caves, being able to clear one out in less than 20 minutes. There only flaw was that they did not wear any armor and mostly kept rifles instead of blades and pistols. \"Tell us, Why are you holding us like this?, Have you turned rogue?\" asked Raven and the woman behind her laughed. \"No Raven, We are after the 80,000 cap bounty that is on your head, We also need to kill him, cut his heart out and we will earn a extra 120,000 caps for bringing it back in a box full of ice\" said the Woman before Raven slowly moved her hand down towards her hip. \"You made one big mistake\" Said Raven and the Woman laughed before getting ready to pull the trigger. \"Whats that?\" she asked before a giant flash erupted blinding everyone but Raven and Marco who had closed there eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco quickly drew both his swords before sprinting towards the closest member of the Keffrin Clan who was shooting in the complete opposite direction clearly blinded. Marco quickly grabbed the back of his trench coat before tugging him backwards and then stabbing him through the spine. Marco threw his wakato up into the air before grabbing a throwing knife off his belt and throwing it across the camp into another ones neck. Marco then caught his wakato in time to decapitate another one before dropping his kinashi and drawing his pistol before unloading his pistols clip into the remaining Keffrin Clan members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking whore\" said the last living Keffrin Clan member to Raven who was holding a pistol to her forehead while Marco walked up. \"You didn't have to accept the contract\" said Raven and the woman laughed. \"Oh sure, Give up 200,000 caps, Enough for our entire clan to be set for life is a great idea, Your fucking lucky it was us and not Kitty who got to you first\" said the Woman before Raven pulled the womans gas mask off her head revealing a woman with a scarred face with blue eyes an long brown hair, She looked about 25 to Marco. \"Goodnight\" said Raven before pulling the trigger sending a bullet ripping through her head and after that she collapsed to the ground. \"Lets go, Other bounty hunters are on there way most likely, and I don't want to run into kitty\" said Raven beginning to pack up and Marco helped. \"Who's kitty?\" asked Marco and Raven sighed. </span></div></div>",

Kitty had bright pink straight long hair in a pony tail, Before the war she would be considered Japanese. She wore a tight black suit with a black full head gasmask. On her back she had a sword and on both her hips were obsidian black pistols. Kitty was known throughout the bounty hunter world as the best trained and most feared bounty hunter in the wilderness. She had deep ties to all bandit clans and was the Daughter of the previous Silvermine Overseer giving her deep connections to Silvermine as well. One of the things many bounty hunters told rookies was that if you run into kitty do not anger her because the next morning your head will be on a pike. \"Raven may not be as well trained as you Kitty, But don't underestimate her, She is just as agile as you and she carries more firepower\" said Crow to Kitty and she just laughed. \"Ill gut her like a pig\" said Kitty smiling at Crow. Crow had midnight black hair and green eyes. He wore a black trench coat and a gasmask that had a skull design on the front to look more intimidating. Underneath his mask on the left side of his face he had a Horribly ugly scar that Raven had given him when he turned corrupt. Raven and Crow grew up together and were part of a highly trained bounty hunter team, Crow however turned dark and soon betrayed his fellow bounty hunters and attempted to convince Raven to join him but refused and destroyed half of his face. \"We will send out 4 scouts to kill them\" said Kitty before beginning to walk away but Crow turned around in a flash and grabbed her by the neck before slamming her against the concrete wall. \"I! am in charge, If you want to try to play god under my command I will have a fucking Morger rape you to death you hear me you stupid cunt?!\" yelled Crow and Kitty nodded. \"What ever you say\" said Kitty before Crow released her. \"Sit the fuck down, If I need you to go kill her I will ask, till then go fuck yourself\" said Crow beginning to walk down a wooden ramp to where his followers were.</span></div></div>",

Marco's heart raced as shrapnel zipped around the pillar he had his back to and in a flash in sync him and Raven in one swift motion spun around with there weapons aimed at the now stunned bandits laid across the ground, Some dead from the blast, others wounded while few were left with just some bruises and cuts. Marco aimed his pistol and shot, Pulling the trigger as quick as he could sending one bullet through a bandits forehead while another shredded through another's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven aimed through the iron sight of her assault rifle before pulling the trigger sending 5 bullets shredding through a bandits heart before she heard another noise behind her. Quickly gripping the butt of her rifle with both hands she swung around and smacked the end of her rifle directly into a Morger's head caving in the skull and causing it to collapse to the ground in a blink. Raven noticed now that there was more than one, There were atleast 15 Morger charging full speed towards them, There bodies mutated and there eyes red with Rage. \"Shit, Marco!\" she shouted and in a blink Marco turned around after finishing the last of Crows bandits and his eyes widened. \"Where too!?\" asked Marco drawing his wakato and Raven saw an open doorway to what use to be a apartment building. \"In there!\" she shouted to pointing with her assault rifle across the street to the rusted, deserted building. The two of them quickly began sprinting across the street with the Morger now only 10 meters away (32 feet) and rapidly sprinting after them in there stumbling way of running, The only thought being KILL in there minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven and Marco both entered the apartment building which revealed a lobby destroyed by what Marco suspected the elevator causing when it fell from one of the upper floors, alot of the floors now full of holes from weathering and explosions from the apocalyptic war. Raven begin climbing up the staircase, jumping up them as quickly as she could covering 3 steps every second and a half with Marco quickly behind her only managing two steps at a time but keeping pace. The Morger however crashed into the staircase not remembering how to climb up them but quickly began sprinting up them after the two Humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven grabbed a sign hanging above her and used it to kick open a rusted blue door before Marco ran into it underneath her legs and she quickly ran in after him, The Morger Only 4 meters away (13 feet). Marco quickly slammed the door behind Raven and pushed over a old rusted shelf that would surely slow them down. \"Ah shit!\" said Marco looking at the dead end that they had come too, the room they were in use to be a electrical room but now was reduce to nothing but a rusted junk yard of old equipment. \"Up there!\" said Raven pointing with he right finger to a hole in the ceiling. \"lift me up\" said Marco before Raven covered her left hand with her right hand and Marco stepped ontop before Raven lifted up allowing Marco to grab a old rubber covered wire. \"FFFUCKING WHORES!!\" screamed one of the Morger with a gurgled and struggled voice, its vocal cords rotted halfway to destruction as it managed to get half its body through the door, its back still towards them. Marco grabbed the floor above him and pulled himself up struggling as he did, He was exhausted and now he had to help his friend up. \"Jump!\" shouted Marco holding out his arms and Raven jumped as high as she could with all her gear on and there hands connected, With that second the first Morger burst through the door and screamed with rage as he charged, Wearing shredded clothing that looked to be the remnants of a business suit. Raven looked to her left wide eyed knowing Marco wouldn't be able to pull her up in time but just as that happened a loud <i>BANG!</i> echoed through the air causing Marco to freeze as the Morgers head was ripped off its body, sending blood spraying and gushing everywhere for a second before its body collapsed and a steady dark crimson pool began forming quickly. Raven looked up to find a man wearing a black long coat, black worn out boots and fingerless gloves, His face covered by a gasmask with one of his eyes covered by a bandage and a hunting rifle in his hands. \"Pull her up you idiot!, Don't let the Morger's eat her!\" shouted the man, His voice steady and calm and with that Marco pulled Raven up. \"Follow me strangers\" he said and Marco and Raven looked at each other looking for the others opinion on the matter. \"lets follow\" said Raven and Marco Nodded, Making sure to keep his hand near his holstered pistol just in case.</span></div></div>",

The Morger that had been chasing Raven and Marco below them screaming at them, unable to reach them. Marco kept an eye on the Morger and watched as one wearing nothing but shredded pants attempted to make the jump but fell short of a whole meter (3 feet) and fell down to the bottom before hitting the concrete floor causing blood to splatter out of both its skull and back and Marco kept climbing the stairs behind Raven and Sai.</span></div></div>",
