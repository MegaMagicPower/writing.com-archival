When you finally wake up you find yourself no larger than a thumb, standing upon a school desk chair.<br>\r\n\"What am I doing on a desk chair?\" you ask yourself.<br>\r\n\"I was gonna ask you the same thing,\" said a voice from behind. You turn around and find an enormas pair of yellow eyes, which blinked twice. \"Seriously, it's dangerous.\" The giant green haired girl said, standing up straight with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I... Hey don't you care how small I am!\"<br>\r\nTsuruya didn't seem to be able to hear you from her new position, and was instead counting all the the horrible things that could potentially happen to you if you were sat up.<br>\r\n\"... pop! You'd be nothing but a stain on somebody's pants, or even more embarrasing if it's a girl and her skirt goes up, cause then your blood and guts would splattered across her panties! What a disgraceful way to die!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey! Can you stop talking about me being sat on and find a way to help me!?\"<br>\r\n\"Or imagned if you survied! You'd be turned into a tattoo on someone's butt!\" Tsuruya sudddenly paused, realizing what she had just said.<br>\r\n\"A tattoo on someone's butt?\" She suddenly put put a hand to her mouth trying to stifle her laughter. Unable to do it she instead started clutching her stomach, laughing as hard as she could, unable to stop. \"Butt tattoo! Ahahahahaha! Butt tattoo!\"<br>\r\n\"It's not funny Green Girl! I need help!\" you scream at her. However she is laughing so hard that she completly forget's your even their and pulls your chair out to have a seat.<br>\r\n\"Hey! What're you-HRMPH!\" you scream, as her panty clad butt slams into you, burying you right in the center of her two bulbous buns. Her weight was mammoth to you, and her laughter caused her to shift in her chair.<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Hoo!\" she sighed, finally brushing away a tear as she finished, still giggling as she reminised aloud, \"Butt tattoo... Hey!\" she asked swiviling all over the place in her chair, grinding you furiously beneath her rear.<br>\r\n\"Where'd you go chair man... Oh!\" She said with a very light blush. \"Is this your chair?\" She asked her butt. Upon realizing what she's done, Tsuruya...</span></div></div>",

Her face now red as  a beet, she walked noticed a mirror in the classroom for some reason, walked over to it, turned around, and raised her skirt. There you were. Shoved uncermioniously in between her butt cheeks. She could do nothing but stare at the situation for five straight minutes. Then she let out a light fart<br>\r\nPrpt!<br>\r\nAnd with that, she burst out laughing at your situation. Yes. She had been careless enough to sit on you, and had now passed her disgusting wind onto your body, and had the nerve to think it was funny! You want to scream at her but all you can do is gag on the putrid gas.<br>\r\n\"Your crazy little guy!\" she declared as if you had planned all of this, \"Hanging out on chairs, getting crushed by butts, and now sniffing farts... You know what? Your coming home with me! We're gonna have some real fun times from here on out.\"<br>\r\nWith that Tsuruya plucked you out of her butt cheeks and stuffed you inside her panties. You tried to protest, but it all came out as various grunts and \"mphs\" against her shapely rump, and the only response she dignified you with was a giggle and a fart. She cheerfully walked home, wiggling her hips in anticipation of everything she was going to do WITH you, while you lay in her underwear, gagging and fearing what she was going to do TO you. Finally,  far too long, she released you from your cotton prison. You were droped on her bed and bounced lightly. You spun around determined to give her a piece of your mind, but Tsuruya distracts you by taking off her skirt and underwear, leaving her naked butt in pefect view of you. And some how, despite everything you've been through, her wiggling hips keep you completly distracted, with your mouth hanging open like a moron. Tsuruya keeps dancing in front of you, showing her perfect butt as it wiggles left and right, untill it's thrown back and smacks you onto your back.<br>\r\n\"I've got it! I know exactly what we should do first!\"</span></div></div>",

You don't know why, you don't know how, but you've just shrunk. To makes matters worse your currently running away from a giant Cheetah girl who called you her small pray. \"All for the glory of the hunt\" she told you. Just before you ran away, into the deep jungle you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hide in the underbrush, trying to stay out of sight. Whether that was by the Cheetah or by other animals that are currently living in the jungle. Considering your at the bottom of the foodchain, hiding is the best situation. You don't know anyway you can get out of this situation. This jungle is massive and look like it goes on for miles. Being small makes it harder to travel and with a predator trying to get to you. You have to move slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOM!! You hear a giant sound crush next to you. You look towards the sound and sea a massive leopard print barefoot just before you. You look up and became encased with fear as you see the Cheetah girl looking around the ground. Looking for you. Thinking quickly you go over to a leaf on the ground and duck under it, getting out of her line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No point hiding prey\" the giant Cheetah girl said as she grew a smile, her sharp teeth being shown and scaring you as well. \"I can smell that your here, I'm going to catch you and chew you up for the goddess of the hunt.\" Every word this Cheetah girl said sends shivers down your spine. \"But I would be lying if I said it was only for the goddess.\" the Cheetah girl said continuing. \"Just the thought of the idea of you going down my throat is making me quite.............wet\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get away from the crazy cat lady. But do you risk running away from the Cheetah girl. Risking her finding you, or will you stay put and hope she just moves on?</span></div></div>",

Trying to put as much distance between you and her as possible, this however wasn't a smart choice as before you could make five normal sized meters the Cheetah girl saw you. \"There you are my prey\" you hear her say from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start running twice as fast as you were before. Adrenaline giving you a sort of speed boost. But the distance you were making was only a fraction of the distance the predator was closing. Within seconds her foot landed in front of you, causing you to stop in your tracks. You go to run the other way only for her other foot to drop in front of you. Her patterned hand descends upon you and grabs you within her clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cheetah girl brings you to her face and smiling as she finally caught her prey \"This is where you meet your end, goodbye!\". She lifts you above her mouth and opens her maw. You watch with fear as she lowers you down to her sharp teeth and mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Wait Wait Don't Eat Me\" you plead however the Cheetah girl didn't care as she continued lowering you \"I'm Begging you here, don't eat me\" you say tears falling down your face \"I..I...I I Can Help You!\" She stopped your descent as you hang above her mouth. Looking down into the chasm \"How Exactly?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gotta think quickly! \"Well you must get tired from chasing your prey all day. I can serve you, rub your feet, massage you, stuff like that\" Your Capturer thinks about this \"Quite the tempting offer, but the Goddess sent you to me as prey. I would be dishonor ring her to let you live\" \"Or she could have sent me to you as a servent?, the goddess would reward you for all that you've done\" You say trying to make her change her mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Cheetah Do?

I will spare you so you can serve me and my body\" she brings you away from her mouth and brought you in front of her face. \"Thank you, oh thank you. You won't regret it\" \"You best make sure I won't, if I find out that your lacking in your serving jobs or try to escape. I will not hesitate to gobble you down\". You get scared at her saying this \"Like I said you won't regret this-\" \"Miss Barbara Ann Minerva, and it would be wise to remember it, now stay quiet while I travel this forest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without any warning. The Cheetah girl Barbara threw you into her mouth. You panic as you land straight on the tongue. You thought she wasn't going to eat you! Before you could move her tongue lifted up and pinned you against the top of her mouth. You couldn't see anything except the pink appendage. It seems she isn't planing on eating you, she's just planing on holding you there. Which makes sense considering she isn't wearing any clothes. And the only other area she could hold you in was her 'private area'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of just being pinned by the tongue. The mouth finally tilted and the tongue finally stopped violating you. This gave you the opportunity to finally fall out of the mouth and land in the cat hand of Barbara. Even though your forced to be a slave, your happy to be out of there. You were just dripping withher saliva though. You look around to see where you were now. It was a run down shack in the jungle probably for some poachers or something like that. This shack had everything. A dusty bed, a dusty couch, even a little pantry. \"Now then\" you hear Cheetah say grabbing your attention \"As your first task you will ________________. And you better do a good job\"</span></div></div>",

You watch as the naked cat woman walks around to the other side of the couch and sits down also creating a much larger dust cloud. She pulls her legs up and rest her bare feet right in front of you. \"Well, little prey, you better start before I change my about keeping you alive!\" Barbara said somehow throwing a threat into the sentence. Not wanting to die you do as your ordered. You put her hands up to her fur covered feet and push as hard as you can, you move you hands around and push, trying to make this villain happy. You ignore the smell of her feet as she probably hasn't had a shower in years, granted she probably been in the water since then. You put one hundred of your percent into it, making sure to get every spot of her feet, rubbing hard. Her toes also had dirt in them so you pick it off, trying to please her even more. You look past her feet and notice that Cheetah is watching you actives and from the smile she has on her face, she must be very pleased with the obedience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you as she decided to test your obedience and loyalty to being hers. \"Now kiss them\" Barbara once again ordered you. You look past her to see if she was joking but unfortunately she wasn't. She really expected you to kiss her bare stinky foot. You've got to do it and show your loyalty to her, If you don't do It there's no telling what Barbara would do. You close your eyes and pucker your lips, you lean closer and closer to her foot about to kiss her orange furred sole<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you do it, of do you chicken out?</span></div></div>",

I'm quite happy and convinced with you\" Cheetah said as she reached for you. You didn't try to run or panic this time as it seems your on relatively good terms with this animalistic killer. She grabs you roughly and your pulled up to her face. She opens her mouth letting you see her sharp and terrifying teeth once again. However your not about to meet them as she brings her tongue out of her mouth. She starts licking you over and over again, saliva covering your entire body, each lick making you wetter and wetter. However it wasn't hard licks or violent licks. They were almost caring, for a killer that is. Once she's satisfied with the amount of her saliva on you she brings her tongue back into her mouth and drops you onto the couch once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you and speaks \"Now that I have claimed you as my own, your new life is forged. You will be serving me and enjoying it every second you get\" she gives you a smile which wasn't made of kindness but of superiority. \"Now stay her my little prey, I will bring us dinner for the night, perhaps some rabbit or maybe a fox\" she says as she got up from the couch. She walked towards the door and and disappeared within it. Since its quite dark out there you assume that she will be coming back soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour quite amazed that she trusts you enough to leave you alone, but your even more surprised when you realized that you don't mind staying. Maybe Stockholm syndrome is finally kicking in, or maybe it is fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You were going home tomorrow so you spent the whole day outside. You were currently walking around the local town buying stuff that you can bring home. At least you did until you heard a girlish scream coming from a nearby alley. Being the good guy that you were you dropped everything and ran between the two buildings. What you saw was three teenage delinquents surrounding one teenage girl. The girl looked distressed and scared. Which makes you even more angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, leave her alone or I'll call the cops!\" you yell at the three of them. They took one look at you and decided to leave.

Did they hurt you?\" you ask her. She smiles back and says \"No Rika is fine. Thank you very much, those three would probably have had their way with Rika.

Well just be careful\" you tell her as you start to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" she yells after you.

Normally you wouldn't drink something someone you barely knew gave you but considering that she seems nice, you make an exception and start drinking it. \"Hmmm taste good, kinda like Soda\" you joke after you finish it \"Thank you Rika made it in her own lab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what she means by Lab, and we're just about to ask when suddenly you get a massive headache and __________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You panic as you finally realized that you were shrinking, shrinking because of the vial that she gave you. You couldn't help but stare at Rika as you keep shrinking and shrinking even more. You descended to the ground and you wonder just how small you were going to be. Will you shrink into nothingness?. Will you be even smaller than an ant?. Finally most of your worries ended when you stopped shrinking, you look ahead and notice that your equal with Rika's shoe. Her foot being slightly taller then you are. You looked up to see the once petite girl now the size of a monolith. She was staring down at you with a excited smile with hints of seduction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so great. Rika never used the shrinking Mixture on anyone before but now Rika sees that it works perfectly\" Rika cheered. She lowered her hand down towards you.

Since you saved Rika from those boys, Rika wanted to repay you and this was the best way she could think of doing it. She's seen stories online and read that boys love being with a giant girl. Reading those stories got Rika all wet inside so she created the shrinking mixture and she was planning to shrink a boy she knew but Rika changed her mind to shrink you instead. Lucky you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe this girl, does she really think you want to be shrunken and played around by some teenage girl. You decide one last time to reason with this girl but Rika isn't listening to your reasoning. She leans forwards close towards you so her face isn't far away from you and smiles kindly to you.

Your just going to have to put on a show for now. \"Okay Rika\" you try saying as cheery as possible. \"What do you want to play\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika looked at you with eyes that shined. She didn't expect your attitude to change so quick but shes not going to question it.

You will climb up Rika's hand and give her a kiss on the lips,if you kiss Rika you win, if you fall off then Rika wins\" you look at her with disbelief and she reassures you saying \"Don't worry, if you fall Rika will catch you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as you walk over towards Rika's hand. You take off your shoes on the counter and step onto her once petite hand. You get your footing as you start walking towards Rika's lips.

You start climbing upwards to her shoulder. Lucky for you, Rika's clothes were easy to grip onto and you easily pulled yourself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on top of her shoulder you take a quick break and wonder how your going to reach her lips. Rika for some reason isn't looking at you but instead was looking forward, making it harder for you. After some thinking you've thought of the perfect strategy to reach her lips.

The first thing you noticed is that the room wasn't your and the second thing was that the room was Humongous! The bedroom was unbelievably massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on the blanket on top of the bed. You look around the room trying to figure out who the room belong to.

Well everyone knows who this girl is, she was the most unlikeable girl in the famous Television series Total Drama. You remember watching that show and instantly disliking this girl. She was just so rude and so conniving. Which makes you really not want to be found by this cruel girl at this size. She isn't focused on you but instead on her phone. This gave you the chance to run towards the end of her bed. Hiding on the right side of her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still looking at her phone she walks over to the bed and falls onto it. This caused shockwaves to go throughout the bed almost making you fall down the side. You see the giant girl laying across the bed, her hair spreading across the pillow and even some parts of it landing on top of you, which you gently took off. You need to get away from her without her seeing you. If she sees you there's no telling what this cruel mean girl will do.

She quickly turned around and pulled the pillow away, leaving you stunned and in complete view on the bed. You see the teenage girl look down at you with a shocked look. However she wasn't wearing that shocked look for long as she quickly grew an evil and conniving smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly try to run and jump off the bed.

You thought you were prepared but you obviously were not. The white haired woman saw you were still wearing a confused and amazed look on your face and decided to help you out a bit. She walks towards the giant desk and drops you off onto the edge of the desk. You hit the surface and you scramble to your feet. Still watching the white woman with amazement. She sits down on top the desk chair in front of you and cover your view. Her massive chest being in front of you and being quite nice. You would feel bad for staring but considering that she has it in the open she wouldn't mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Christie. I found you and I was simple flabbergasted at how small you were. I was wondering, how on earth could you become so small?\" The white haired woman asked curiously, due to her accent the way she said it sounded so elegant. You were also surprised that she didn't do this to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know, I thought that you did this to me, I was normal size last time I was awake.\" you say honesty. Christie must of been disappointed with your answer as before she started to talk again she lowered her deadly finger onto you, pinning you down onto the desk with tremendous pressure. The fabric of the gloves touching your chest. \"I don't know if your playing dumb or you truly don't know . Regardless think about how you could you have possibly gotten so small and insignificant, Or Else\" her voice sounding more cruel and harsh then it was before. Was she just putting on a show<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being honest, I don't know how I got so small\" you say trying to push her finger off you, however you couldn't even make it move. You must be as weak as you are small. Christie however is still giving you a hateful look \"If you don't want to tell me fine, I know many ways to torture the information out of you. Common knowledge for an assassin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the people in the world, You had to be found shrunken by an evil cruel Assassin. Just your luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'm shrunken and couldn't do anything to stop you from hurting me, why in the world would I lie to you?.\" you hope she sees your reasoning and logic and believes you. She seems like a smart woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman took off her finger and for a second you thought that she did believe you. However when two of her gloved finger dig into your legs, your dangled upside down in front of her face. \"You do raise a good point\" Christie said looking at you hungrily \"But I can't take that chance. If I find out why your small, my jobs will be so much easier, so if you do know, I won't torture you? How about that deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said before, I don't know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad answer\" Christie said as she angled her brow angrily. She started to shake her hand back and forth, causing you to shake back and forth as well. You feel like your going to puke by the motion, but hold it in. Once she stopped she started to raise her hand up and down throwing you for another round of trying to hold in your guts and stop them from spilling. She stopped and asked \"Well, do you want to inform me now? Or will you make this harder for yourself\"<br>\r\nYou respond by saying \"I told you, I don't know\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie is starting to get frustrated. She needs to learn how you got so small, this is an opportunity she cannot pass up. Even the toughest of targets will be rendered to nothing but disposable bugs, but she needs to get the information out of the small man. Thats if he even knows how he got so small. Still even if he doesn't know, Christie knows a certain former Wrestler current Scientist that could experiment on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now Christie is torturing you and she's decided to take it up a notch.

You hit the desk and groan in pain. You look to your captor and see what she was planning next. However she wasn't in the chair anymore. In fact she was on the other side of the room searching inside of a office cabinet. You wonder what she could be looking for, that was until Christie pulled out a roll of white Duct Tape. Your cant believe she's going to tape you up and make you immobile. Your already small, how much more control does she want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks back over and grabs you within her gloved hand. She pulls out some of the duct tape and wraps the tape around you. She wraps it around your entire body leaving only your head showing. Once she's satisfied with her work she placed you onto the desk and hovered her head above you. You cant help but look up and see your torturers beautiful face. Despite having every reason to hate her right now, you couldn't deny that her skin was flawless. She was probably one of the most beautiful woman you've ever met and seeing her so big was breath taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft lips part and you see a line of drool descend from her mouth. You couldn't believe it, shes planning on water boarding you with her drool. You try to wiggle away but you couldn't gain any distance. Just in time for her drool to hit you square in the face. You hold your breath trying not to get the liquid in your mouth. Your entire face feeling like your currently underwater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie saw that you were holding your breath and decided to fix that. She gentle tapped you in the stomach, (gentle for her, a punch for you) and you open your mouth gasping for air, but you didn't get air, instead you got the disgusting droll of Christie. She continues adding to the drool pool and makes it bigger and bigger, while you on the other hand was trying not to drown in her drool.</span></div></div>",

And whether you tried to stop it or not, you lose consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie who has been watching you struggle within the spit pool and has been making additions to the pool, watched as you stop struggling and moving. Christie quickly pieced it together and pulled your shrunken body out. Needless to say Christie was disappointed that you didn't want to talk, she isn't one hundred percent convinced but she does think that he doesn't know anything about how he shrunk. Sighing she puts the shrunken man in her palm and cuts the tape of him with her sharp fingernail. She then brings you back down into her pocket. She needs to go back to her apartment since its getting dark, and then she'll decide what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, you feel your body covered in wetness and spit. You see that you were in the dark damp spot that is Christie's pocket. You don't know how long you've been knocked out, but one thing is for sure, you need to get away. You listen to the outside and hear a car engine revving. You assume she's in a car, going to another destination. You decide to wait it out, she felt you trying to escape last time and even if you did manage to escape, you would have no where to possibly go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car stops after 20 more minutes and Christie walked out of the car. She has zipped up her suit and covered it with some normal clothing. She arrives at the apartment complex in which she was staying at and took the elevator up. She arrives inside of her Luxury apartment and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walks inside she reaches into her pocket and pulls you out. You decide to remain looking knocked out.

As your shrunken and in the eye sight of one of the most dangerous woman in all of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's recap first though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were an aspiring pirate. Dreams of sailing the seas, looting, pillaging and of course finding the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. You left your island a couple of months ago following your dreams. One day you found a Devil Fruit. All the famous pirates ate one of these and gained unique powers, so needless to say you wanted to eat one too. Too bad it was one called the Shrink Shrink Fruit. And it did what you'd expect, you shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you've been shrunken and have became defenseless, scurrying around a small town trying to survive. Eating left over food and running around people's feet trying not to get stepped on. It's been quite the pathetic life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this specific day you were moving around the small town looking for something to eat. Normally you only get food when somebody drops some food on the ground, that's why you watch and wait for your opportunity. You see a little pink haired girl in a furry hood walking around eating some pizza. Your mouth waters at the simple idea and taste of the glorious pizza. And you thought luck was on your side as she dropped it. As soon as it touched the ground you headed over, your hunger getting the best of you. You dodge feet left and right as you finally reach the pizza slice. However before you could lay a hand on the pizza, the girls hand comes down and picks it back up. You look up and freeze as you realized your mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl is looking down and eating the pizza. As You realized that the little girl isn't a little girl at all. It was the captain of the Bonney Pirates and one of the infamous Eleven Supernovas, Jewelry Bonney. You've heard that she ate a Devil Fruit with age related powers. Which would explain why she looks like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJewelry Bonnie is staring right at you as she destroys the pizza slice with her large teeth, staring right down at you. You were completely frightened, even too frightened to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You start running away, moving as fast as your small legs can carry you. You've been spotted before and usually lost the people thought the sea of citizens walking past. That was your plan but plans sometimes go astray. As before you could gain any distance worth caring about, her brown boot slammed right in front of you, stopping your movements. You look up to see the child's hand come straight for you as her slightly pudgy fingers wrap around you. Holding your body tight and firm. She lifts you off the ground and you get pulled up to her young face. Her lipstick covered mouth now showing a full fledged smile, Cause she's a kid who just found the greatest toy on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Ok, Ok, just put me down please?\" you say as you don't like being this height. Ever since you've shrunk you have stuck to the ground undetected. Now you feel that your staring down the edge of a mountain, with a big chance of dropping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it, did you meet someone with a devil fruit power that shrinks or did you eat a fruit that did this\" she asks you, surprising you as her voice doesn't sound young and like a child at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, the latter\" you say simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, talk about bad luck, I got the powers to change people's age at will and you got the power to be the size of a toy\" Bonney teased, making fun of your unfortunate situation. \"But don't worry, because I'll make sure to keep you safe\" her smile doesn't match her words, her smile is much more malicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for now I need to hide you, and I know exactly where to place you\" Bonney says as she brought you under her hat. She dumps you onto the pink hair and puts the hat back over you, covering you from seeing anything.

A lot more comfortable then the concrete ground that you've been sleeping on for the past months. You wonder what Bonney will do with you. Since she's got you, you highly doubt she'll just let you go free, And considering that she's a highly wanted Pirate, you doubt she's going to be that kind. You have the chance to slip under her hat and escape. Though you decided not too, her ship of course would have tons of food and you've been wanting a good meal for months, anything rather then people's scraps<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more walking, you hear a man say from outside the hat \"Welcome back Captain Bonney, did you have a good lunch in the town. If you didn't, just say the word, we will burn this place to the ground\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah the pizza was alright, plus i found something awesome there, lets leave this place in piece.\" she walks a little more before turning her head to speak to her crew \"Now I'm going into my Captains room. Don't bother me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonney walks a little more until she closes the door behind her which you assume is the door to her room. The hat comes off Bonney's head and you can see her Captains room. It was very luxurious with high priced furniture and cushions. She grabs you once again with her young pudgy fingers, you fly though the air until you hit her sleeping bed. You look towards the little girl smiling at you from across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started to walk towards you until her top half was like a giant wall in front of you. Just then something unbelievable happened as she started to use her devil fruit power and started to age right in front of you. You watched as she grew even taller, her breasts expand from nothing to giant mounds, her face growing more and more mature, it was frankly amazingly to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonney stopped aging as she became a very attractive _______</span></div></div>",

Her body was in fantastic shape, not that of a supermodels but that of a woman who focused on her shape. Even her face which looked all grown up and mature had no wrinkles or blemishes. She was truly a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know\" Bonney said as her voice sounded a lot older then it was before. Which is weird cause when she was a child her voice sounded like she was in her Twenties. Maybe thats a part of her Devil Fruit Power. Anyway what she was saying <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like going this old, it just doesn't feel right for me whenever I'm in it, so I usually stay around TwentyOne years old\" she's talking about changing ages like putting on a new outfit \"But every now and then I like to bust it out. Especially when I'm feeling like doing something a bit more 'Adult'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits on the bed right next to you, causing you bounce up and down due to the sheer weight of the Supernova pirate. She looks down at you right next to her right thigh and grins. She then turned on her side, squishing you underneath said thigh. You get pushed down underneath her thigh into the soft mattress of her bed. You try to wiggle out but her skin was just hard enough so you couldn't gain any advantage. After seeing that you couldn't possibly escape she rolled back onto her ass, having her fun. She pinches you between her fingers and repositions herself on the bed. So her legs were on it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hovers you over her breasts and right in front of her smirking face \"Are you ready for some playing?\" she asks you.

When you hit the bottom of her stomach you were no longer hidden by her white tank top. Acting quickly you jumped off of her body and onto her bed. Bonney sees you once again and reaches for you once again. This time you manage to get away by dropping down the end of the bed. You slid down the covers and then fell onto the hard wooden floor of the pirate ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little shit! Come back here, or else!\" she yelled from behind. Although she threatened you, you didn't stop. You just kept on running forward. Not turning back. You were halfway towards the door when her giant barefoot slammed in front of your path, causing you to hit her foot. Once you stopped she shifted her foot and trapped you under it. Leaving you stuck between her terribly smelling toes. You look up to see the older woman with a pissed off look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you now, you little runt. I don't know what I should be more Angry at! The fact that you snuck through my boobs without my permission or the fact that you were trying to escape!\" you try to push her foot off but your once again reminded of how weak you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Bonney do to you now?</span></div></div>",

It sounded like people saying goodnight. Wanting to figure out why your here you run to the direction of the voices. However as you got close to the wall. It opened and it revealed something you thought you would never see. It was a giant anthro tiger. She towered over you as big as a skyscraper. You say she because she had breasts sticking out of her chest. She wasn't looking down and instead her stoic eyes were focused ahead. You look past her and see more anthro animals behind her going into rooms. Such as a baboon, a crane, and for some reason a panda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could see what other giant animals were out there, she slid the door closed. You look up just in time to see the tiger take a step forward, this wouldn't normally bother you. It was the fact that the foot was coming down directly on top of you. You see the paw of her foot descend towards you. You panic and scurry away trying to avoid it, you watch as the orange furred foot landing next to you with a terrifying <br>\r\nTHUD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks past you and into the middle of the room where she closed her eyes and sat down in a meditative position. You watch the giant tiger and consider going to get her attention. She looks civilized and has a chance of helping you. On the other hand she's a tiger and she has just as much chance as tearing you apart with her teeth and swallowing you down her throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

However when you woke up you weren't in a classroom at all. But rather you were all alone in a giant room... with the head of the non-athletic clubs! \"Falling asleep in class? You should be ashamed of yourself.\" She grows a teasing grin, staring down on you like a sadistic colossal monster about ready to slowly crush you to death. You simply took a few steps back, paralyzed in fear. \"Not only is that bad for your grades, but girls like me would love to jump on the opportunity to do this. You left yourself vulnerable you little underachiever...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another step back, but you fumbled and fell over, causing her to giggle. You just laid there on your back, not moving even thought you wanted to move so badly. She was in control here. You couldn't move unless she wanted you to and even if you did she would stop you without even the smallest amount of effort. With fear controlling your mind you could only stay still and let it happen. She stands up, giving you a beautiful view up her skirt. You blushed as you could see her panties. \"Now you're going to be a tiny pervert?\" She sighs. \"You really are hopeless...\" Her face goes from disappointment back to an evil grin. \"Wonderful, hopeless ones are the most amusing.\" She turns around, and it only took you a second to figure out what was happening as you see her bend over, giving you a better view of her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, Miss orchestra club director pl-\" You never got to finish as her panty-clad rear plops down onto you. \"Call me Lady Jakuzure, you worthless bug!\" She smiles widely, chuckling by just the feeling of a tiny man under her enormous ass. \"So powerless, and to my butt of all things. What a worthless life you live, I'd just crush you if you didn't have one purpose in life in your tiny state...\" You had no idea what she was talking about, but her butt did indeed have you completely dominated. She was humiliating you with her ass, able to kill you at any moment but instead humiliating you, dehumanizing you, treating you like a cushion. \"Yes it is so fortunate that your new meaning in life is for my amusement... I think you should be thanking me.\" She looks back, roughly scooting forward on you body so that your head stuck out. \"Right?\" She says sternly, expecting you to say something. You didn't want to, but knew you had no choice. \"Th-Thank you, Lady Jakuzure...\" She smiles, bouncing on your tiny body a bit. \"Now you're getting it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply slams back down so you were completely smothered again. \"I may never sit down without a my tiny toy under me ever again. This is so wonderful...\" She begins shifting around, trying to get more comfortable. Her butt cheeks were so big and soft, but with all this movement and force, it was so painful and uncomfortable. \"Yes, this is good...\" She lets out a relaxed sigh when she feels you between her cheeks, firmly wedged in her crack. She bounces lightly a few more times to make sure you are jammed in nice and tight. \"Yeah, you make sitting so much more comfortable, especially like this! I bet you feel absolutely blessed to have a woman like me sit on you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trying to break you, so you'd be her new little object of amusement. This was becoming clear. But somewhere deep inside, a small part of you felt like you should give up. That she was right and you should dedicate your life to Lady Jakuzure like the goddess she is... You immediately dispell these thoughts, knowing they are crazy and if you are patient you can get away somehow, that is, if you can survive.</span></div></div>",

Her butt cheeks were like the strongest force in this world to you, nothing would move them except the will your wonderful goddess Nonon jakuzure. As the time passed, hearing her relax and giggle at you, you really felt like nothing more than a seat. A seat for the wonderful Lady Jakuzure. She had given you the honor of being her seat. For the rest of your life you have the privilege of comforting these perfect ass cheeks. The cute pink haired girl has you totally humiliated and degraded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this however, you yourself was getting comfortable. Maybe this wasn't so bad. Her butt was sexy... and she is really cute... She practically is a goddess at this size! A goddess you, as a lowly mortal bug served by being her cushion! As time went on, you could feel yourself coming under a spell of sorts. The feminine aroma, her soft skin... It was an intoxicating experience... That was... until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPfft!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound from within her bowels sounded, and suddenly everything was unbearable. such a small fart, but such an ungodly smell... \"I-it stinks!\" You cry out, muffled from her giant cheeks. She shifts around uncomfortably as you squirm. With a slight blush she speaks in a stern tone. \"W-well? Don't waste it! You better sniff my lovely farts when I give them to you!\" She begins to clench her cheeks onto you tightly, no sign of letting up. \"If you don't smell my farts, I'll just have to fart more!\" She blushes deeply as she lets another one slip, making it more insufferable. Worshipping her farts!? It was pure torture! You couldn't imagine how bad it would smell sniffing up every single one. It already smells bad enough, and they were small to a normal sized person! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were such a good boy before this, I know you understand how things work now!\" She says, her voice evidence she was getting a little pissed. \"If you don't listen to me, I'll have to make you suffer the consequences!\" She warns. \"Never disobey a goddess!\" What she was saying was true, but would you really sacrifice what was left of your dignity to smell some girl's farts? Her mammoth cheeks pulverized you, the huge jiggling masses treating you like putty in her hands. You would be completely stupid to defy her, especially after you have been rendered powerless to her butt of all things! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill give in, and succumb to her mighty ass, or fight against impossible odds...</span></div></div>",

You press your nose against the fabric of her panties and take a whiff, immediately shuddering in discomfort and disgust. Nonon bounces on you lightly, but her huge cheeks still uncomfortably compressing you. \"I don't hear you. Come on! Really smell it!\" She continues to say impatiently. \"I'm really getting annoyed having to say it more than once!\" Hearing her upset, you sniff a little harder, but she doesn't let up yet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smell harder... nothing. Harder... nothing. Harder... You feel her start to relax! Her cheeks start to relax around you. You were snug right in her crack now, but at least she wasn't squishing you... Although she was relaxing now, you didn't want her to start getting upset again. So you continue to smell. You smell the intense lingering scent of her two small but noxious farts. You smell harder and harder to appease her. You need to smell of it for Nonon to make her happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFFFFFFT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to squirm and gag again, as just when you went to take a big whiff she lets out a fart far greater than the last two. You can hear her sigh, it seems it was a great pressure for her to finally release. She then giggles, you know this is just mocking laughter. Your torment from inhaling a giant fart amused her greatly. She begins grinding you into her crack, trying to bring you as deep as her panties would allow. It smelled so bad, and was only getting worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered why you are here. You need to endure everything as long as you are her cushion. If you just stop smelling her farts you are screwed. Cringing and shuddering from the disgust, gagging by reflex you begin breathing in her farts like oxygen. You slowly went back to your rate of smelling before she released that big fart onto you. However it was very painful to keep yourself at that rate, much more than it was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were keeping at it well, if Nonon felt you slacking even a little bit she would flex her gargantuan cheeks onto you, squishing more motivation into you. She groan as she releases another fart similar to the last, but do not stop. You keep smelling it even as it escapes her ass directly into your nostrils. You were kind of getting used to it even though that doesn't make it much less painful. She gently rubbed her ass on you, as if she was rubbing the smell into your body. Finally she lifted up, you saw her cute ass as it rose up off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, staring down at you with a smirk on her face. \"You performed decently, I suppose.\" She giggles. \"Well then, are you ready to accept me as your goddess?\" Really it was pointless to ask this question, as you knew you didn't have a choice, but you knew why she did. Depending on how you answered, it would become much worse. However, maybe if you plead and beg, perhaps you can get to her? She might react negatively but it might be worth a shot. Any chance to never smell a fart from that range at this size would be worth taking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me now! You aren't thinking otherwise, are you?\" You had to make a choice now...</span></div></div>",

A delighted smirk crossed his face, as his horned head flowed with wicked ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muscle-enhancing spell, to tear apart mountains... Unimpressive. A meteor shower, to cleanse the earth... Dazzling, but a little extravagant.

Rulue's leg stood outstretched on the other end, decorated with a gold anklet, pale robes flowing down it. Owlbear guards lay behind her, decorated with marks from her fists and soles. Besides them, her battle-torn servant, Minotaurus, applied bandages to himself. The self-proclaimed Fighting Queen was sweating from the encounter; but hid her exhaustion with a calm face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling Satan~! I came to gift you some of my specialty curry - but I couldn't help overhearing you.\" She stepped in, tossing her blue hair back.

You're perfect the way you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master of evil groaned, looking back to his ancient volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out her fan, waving it to cool down- and to draw his eyes to her curves. \"Forget Arle.

I'm busy planning my honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a delighted coo, the martial artist strutted closer. \"You're so funny! Let's make jokes together... And put down that book, before you do something that you'll regret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached, Satan flipped through the pages, hunting a magic phrase to regain his privacy. \"Miniaturization!... No, Masochism!\" He cast them off clumsily, making magic circles flash throughout his hideout. \"Malleable! Manhandling! Mistaken identity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue ran to him, leaping forward. \"Take me in your arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Move away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this enchantment, the effects of his spells combined at once. A whirring light whisked the devil out faster than an exorcist.

The humungous floor tiles shook with insane energy. Something above cast a round shadow over you. Looking up, the sky was filled with a humungous bosom, clad in clean white, and approaching you fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUD</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue's great body compressed you. Due to the Dark Prince's confused incantations, he'd made you \"malleable\". It spared you from an embarrassing death beneath the woman's tits. Thank you, Satan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was excruciatingly painful being under her mass. Her generously curves folded against the hard ground, engulfing you in the salty-sweet-smelling fabrics that caressed it. The pounding of her love-struck heart echoed around you, an intense throbbing that shook you to the core. Her nipple pinned your torso down from behind the spotless material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... Just when we were going to hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squeezing force was so great that you were practically glued to the woman's hefty top. You remained stuck, like a sticker, as the titan-sized damsel lifted herself up. The sudden motion made you sick to your stomach, as her gorgeous legs whirred by in a peachy flash on one side, and the room's neatly-arranged furniture flew by on the other. The gentle bounce in her breasts didn't help. It felt like a road bump on the back of a bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatan's admirer sighed, fanning herself. You could see some sweat drops floating down from her neck in the sky. \"I have no patience for escape tricks...\" She punched a wall in frustration. <b>\"Iron Fist!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smooth arm flowed with bone-shattering strength. The combination of her sudden strike and booming shout detached you from the martial artist's soft mounds, and sent you falling. Adrenaline rushed through you as you prepared for the impact. You landed safely onto a yellow surface, which receded beneath your minimal weight. Looking around, it seemed like it was one of the wicked demon's fluffiest beanbags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mighty tower of a woman brushed her hair, and began to sit. To your horror, she aimed her rear end right for your teensy body! You dashed, stumbling over the uneven flooring below you. On all fours, you tried clawing away from the fleshy avalanche. No use - you were about to be her cushion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her round backside hit the bag, it took a moment for her to relax into it. Rulue's overwhelming butt smothered you. It pushed against the hillocks of beans, all of them moving aside obediently to accommodate the mountainous frame of her mounds. Still confused by the whole situation, you squirmed around, using her sweat as a lubricant to squeeze between the yellow landscape and her left cheek. The behemoth's weight was incredible, but the soft surface made it not fully unpleasant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she leaned back deeper into it. She sighed, stretching a leg up into the air and flexing it. \"Oh, where could my darling be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fighting Queen's buttocks spread out in every direction, cutting out all traces of light. Her careless bends ground you deep into the fabric of her robes, barely holding in her butt's skin. With every wave of her leg, the outside world grew more distant. It flattened you into more and more uncomfortable positions, made a plaything by her idle movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering all the breath you had in your tiny lungs, between a ribcage that felt ready to collapse from the pressure, you shouted out: \"HELP! I'm down here!\" You were muffled by the fabrics. You gulped again, and added: \"Under you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips lifted up slightly, giving you a moment to breathe - though you were plastered against the fighter's soft bottom, like you'd been with her breasts. \"Who? U-underneath me?\" Her hand groped the seat, gigantic fingers feeling for you - but sliding below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief washed over you. You screamed again: \"I'm stuck to your butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smooth skin touched you, stroking the tip of her index across your back. Yes! She'd spotted you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue stopped for a moment. Sure, it might take some time for her to understand everything. It would take you some time, too. But at least you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or so you thought, until you heard her smooth, but deafening whisper. \"Oh, you <i>devil</i>~\" She ran her finger down you again, this time with a little tickling motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not the sound and motion of a worried woman who would save you. That was <i>bedroom</i> tone and a <i>teasing</i> maneuver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggled her rear end, sending you rocking slowly. \"I <i>thought</i> I heard a miniaturization spell coming from those strong vocal chords. And I knew you were hiding somewhere - I just didn't expect to find such a noble man in such an <i>intimate</i> location. If you wanted to get close, all you had to do was ask. You didn't have to shrink to touch me, you tippy-horned trendsetter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, the Dark Prince's \"mistaken identity\" incantation was taking effect. She thought you were HIM. You screamed out: \"No! I'm - I'm not your boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thunderous slap of her backside, she laughed out. \"Oh-hohoho! But you're copping a feel here. And I bet <i>you</i> were that delightful little itch on my breasts! You can't deny your feelings for me.\" She kept running her hand over you, pressing your face into her rear. \"Which part of me do you prefer? Or am I simply ~perfect ~ all ~ over~? I know you are, my shrunken hunk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to escape. She had cupid's arrow planted in her backside more firmly than you'd been squeezed into it. You clawed up her fluffy robes, hoping it would bring you to a more visible spot. You came to her belt, and gripped it. \"I'm not Satan! Please, look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Riiiight</i>, you're the dashing <i>Dark Prince</i>, aren't you? Or maybe the mysterious <i>Masked Satan</i>?\" With a wave of her red fan, the emerald-eyed beauty locked the door - and indulged herself in the sensation of your movements. She felt you scaling up her, and tried to guess your destination. \"Oh? Are you trying to get in my underpants? Allow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn either side of you, an immense finger and thumb pulled her panties down. The shaking sent you falling - and landing right in the middle of the hammock-like fabric. Her tumultuous journey in had made it slightly moist, and gave it a strong fragrance. Slowly, it began shaking. She lifted it back up, making you ascend to her plump, bare ass above... It hung over you, coming closer and closer, glistening brightly in the reading lamp's light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue panted. \"Satan... Those devil-worshipers... what would they think... if they saw you... worshiping me?... Putting your everything into me... with your strapping, loving arms... And your chiseled face... Are you as excited as I am?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<script language=\"JavaScript\"><!--\n\t\tvar notex, thisx, mmove;\n\tfunction showPopNote2(notex, event, thisx, mmove) {  var thisxPosY = $(thisx).position();  var ccTop = 15;  if ($('#Content_Column_Wrapper').length) {  var ccPos = $('#Content_Column_Wrapper').position();  ccTop = ccPos.top;  }  var thisxBot = thisxPosY.top + $(thisx).height(); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).appendTo('#Content_Column_Wrapper'); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'top':event.pageY-ccTop + 15, 'position':'absolute'});  if ($('#bigPopNote' + notex).width() < $('#bigPopNote' + notex).parent().width() - 50) { $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'left':event.pageX-50});  }  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'block';   if (mmove == 1) {  thisx.style.borderBottomStyle = 'solid'; }  thisx.clicked = 0;  }\n\tfunction clickPopNote2(thisx) {  thisx.clicked = 1;  }\n\tfunction hidePopNote2(notex, event, thisx) {  document.getElementById('popnote' + notex).style.borderBottomStyle = 'dotted';  if (thisx.clicked != 1) {  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'none';  }  }\n\t\t\t\t//--></script><span id=\"popnote15941322931\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('15941322931', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('15941322931',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">Fun trivia!</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote15941322931\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\">In Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Scratch used Rulue's AI.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You approached the Fighting Queen's looming sphincter. The sky became an unbroken, rosy barricade. Humid waterfalls of cascading white cloth walled it in. Even if you managed to leave the plane of underwear, you'd just end up falling down, past her battle-trained leg muscles, to the cold floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist the tugging, pulling the ground into the overwhelming curves, you shouted at the immense woman: \"RULUE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movement stopped with a spring of the malleable material. Her butt was practically hugging you now. A shiver ran down the length of her spine, and knocked you off-balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... I love the way you say my name! Scream it again...\" Rulue looked over the study room's decorations, smiling up at her, fluffier and cuter than anything. She couldn't see Satan; but what did that matter? She felt his loving embrace just fine. She heard his voice so clearly. And when looking at his design taste, she could perfectly picture the smile across his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she couldn't hold herself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choked on the skin, trying to gather your breath. The toga's cloth draped across her wrists as she reached for her groin. Even if their smallest twitch could squeeze the life from you, even if they'd just pummeled guards - the fingers still looked delicate. The other hand took you by surprise: her middle finger slid under your backside. Its tip was so big, it forced you to spread your legs across its width. This uncomfortable yet plush seat rose under you, pulling upwards like a ski lift. The path led you right towards her welcoming mountains of the blue-haired pugilist's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness. For just a moment, nothing but darkness before you, behind you, in your future. You tried wrestling back, but had no idea where to put your hands. Everything you touched was the same dripping, wet texture. It spread across your arms, like morning dew over grass. Each ridge became a thing of nightmares as it slid across you, the flesh catching on your body. This mighty digit - not even a fist, or one of her devastating martial art techniques, just a finger - outclassed every muscle in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue flexed the finger back down. The phalanges near you twitched and curled. You'd never been so relieved just to breathe salty air. Sputtering out sweat, you looked over your hands, happy to see them again. This gave you a chance to use that air you kept in your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cease this, Rulue!\" You tried for the loudest voice possible - difficult considering the pressure on your groin. \"Relieve me of this pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"I'll soon relieve us both of our lovesick pangs. Have patience, darling Satan~\" That light, excited chirp soon became a booming, queenly laugh that pounded into your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting queen gasped for air between speaking. It was hard work making it up Satan's tower. Even with his amazing taste in interior decor, and stunning knowledge of fine architecture, his hired help were very wanting. None of those uncultured beasts had any inkling how to treat an innocent lady and her bodyguard. She was just giving a gift, and they kept dealing her magical and physical blows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she never gave up trying to reach her Dark Prince; and now, his voice made all the pain worth it. He didn't even care how unkempt she was, he just gave her unconditional love. How could her pure heart refuse that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she knew that Satan was long gone by now - out of his plushie-and-magazine-covered hideout, planning his next scheme...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creamy rump spread. She pushed you back against the crack, and brushed you around gingerly. Every breath you took was heavy, rife with the fluids from the Fighting Queen's earlier combat. And those fluids just kept building as her sighs grew stronger. No matter how much you struggled, your shrunken body remained on the fingertip, under her command. With as much air as possible rationed in your lungs, you shouted. \"Get me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mewed, tapping your backside. \"Oh, have I been selfish? Just getting myself off...\" The front segment of her terrifying finger curled up, caressing your lower half in a loving death grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan sounded out within your goliath \"lover\". You held your nose quickly with both hands. Some skin that you were holding back engulfed you. Soon, you realized the groan wasn't gas. It was the sound of the blue-haired fighting queen bending over. Every womanly curve and powerful sinew, moving at once... It was like being in the middle of an erosion time-lapse, caught between valleys and canyons within her flowing robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, it gave you a heady, weightless feeling. Mountains moved, seas fell and rose, simply because this godlike maiden misinterpreted you. It put you in a state of silent fascination, waiting to see what she did... and hoping not to misspeak, or dig yourself deeper into this backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin her blue head, dreams and fear rushed by. Her anus... It felt vulgar. But Satan was there, so he must like it - and his massaging made her heart light up. She awaited another response from her little prince. Something, anything to say how much he appreciated her, how irresistible she was, how long he'd dreamed of her, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was Satan so silent? Didn't he want this? The crackling flames stirred. Rulue thought she heard the minions moving beyond the door. And with Minotauros there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this the wrong place? Was the atmosphere wrong?... Or was she not trying hard enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue pulled her finger out once more, and took a step back. Stone trembled below, blowing back a page from the magic book. Even at normal size, these elegant legs had the force to crush bricks apart effortlessly with her \"Exploding Knee\" technique. At your present stature, either was a smooth, ivory weapon of mass destruction. Presently, they trembled shyly, with the gigantic undergarments that held you lightly strung across them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hurricane of wind entered her lungs. The anus before you clenched. Her fingers wobbled, sweat building all over from the pores. Her sex emanated a mustier aroma still, dulling your thoughts. No, not again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inserted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those ephemeral daydreams, of lovers holding hands and saying sweet nothings... They replayed before her eyes, mingling with the brushing movement. Every glimpse of her beloved Dark Prince's smile, his glowing eyes, his laugh, his magic skills... It felt so much more vivid, held so much more weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlesh and muscle parted with a squelch against your minuscule body. The Fighting Queen's anus welcomed you in, constricting all movement. It was dark again. Dark, humid, and active; the fighter's heartbeat drilling into your own chest, and breaths of anticipation. Attempts to move or struggle just made the pulse louder. Your legs dangled just outside the miasmic plane. Between them, Rulue's overpowering finger rubbed against your groin and buttocks rapidly with earthquake-like force. You gripped the walls, feeling its soft surface sink into your palms, and tried pushing back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation spread up her spine. Each pull of his hands was so careful, so delicate - but so enticing, so teasing, it kept her on the edge of her seat! She sighed, Satan knew how to be gentle. Rulue felt her knees trembling, and sweat pooling across her thin neck. But she held herself strong, held her dignity as the Fighting Queen tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sphincter massaged you. Pressure started building up around your pants, as the slender middle finger pushed and rubbed you more daringly. Thrashing to get out was useless; it just ended up with her squeezing harder. You attempted to kick back at the digit. This proved hard, since you darkness blinded you. Not to mention the sense-dulling odor making it hard to concentrate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, both your feet made contact with her invasive fingertip. But you underestimated the strength contained in the Fighting Queen's gigantic hand, and the overpowering backside's hold on you. Both your legs kicked against her dripping finger, while she pushed playfully: instead of forcing it away, the pressure moved you deeper in. Now, you were fully engulfed within her titanic butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue blushed. This far in? Wasn't that dangerous? Her iron will could weather anything, but would his elegant body stay unharmed deep in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! There was that intoxicating yell again, the delicious pull of his fingers! She dropped down and grasped a Carbuncle plush for support, biting into it. Slowly, either palm gravitated to her cheeks. If that door opened... If anyone saw her sprawled out like this, reduced from her haughty state to a bowl of jelly, so engaged in the handsome man pleasing her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No. No need to think of them. This was just a private time for her and Satan. With a soft pant and a smile, she began squeezing herself all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if an expansive landscape was cuddling you to death. The passage tightened, and tightened, constricting, kneading from every direction. Every involuntary shiver or spasm hugged against this lust-frenzied girl's ridges, and made her caress back with even more loving devastation. You felt every inch of yourself violated from deep within, every struggle only hastening your fall into madness. After what felt like an hour, it all came out in a single, ear-shattering moan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHN~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue held her fan to her mouth, barely drowning out her ecstasy. Her shoulders slumped down into the pillow-coated floor. She could feel her hair draped in a web across her back, clinging to the moisture. Every bit of her tired body fell into bliss. She focused her mind on the glimmering candles. \"Satan... thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her rear muscles relaxed, she felt her miniature lover leaving. So brave and selfless... He must have shrunken down specifically to give her this joyful experience. Her head playfully twisted over, eager to regard the expression on the Dark Prince's chiseled features...</span></div></div>",

This left you in her underpants. Disgust and exhaustion surged through you - but you realized you had to get away from this love-crazed titan as fast as you could. Navigating the panties' cotton with both hands, and pushing back some stitches, you crawled out on the back of her left leg. It lay relaxed, outstretched, like flowing hills of marble down to her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could still hear the pugilist's quaking sighs behind you. It was hard looking back - seeing the butt cheeks that had just kneaded you like dough, impossibly huge... Further, her head had turned over the bare shoulders to look at you. Betraying the chaotic, lewd acts she'd just finished with you, her eyes rested calmly, like clear ponds. She swept her azure hair off her back slowly - each strand visibly glimmering with sweat. This kept you kept moving faster, climbing off her limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... Are you really leaving, my love? We haven't even begun exploring each other...\" she smiled, cooling herself with her red fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she squinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment. Darling... Satan?\" Despite her size, her voice was a shy mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense pools of her eyes suddenly felt like focused darts. Rulue twisted her body around, still on all fours. A dainty hand fell to either side of you, shaping hills and canyons of cushion between them. She pulled her face closer, close enough for you to feel her breath pulling you back. for you to see the shadow of her slackening jaw stretching before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you weren't moving. Your feet dangled in midair. Like she would with a kitten, Rulue was pinching you up from the back of the neck with an index and thumb. It brought you before her queenly facial features, open wide in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plush lip hung some centimeters down. Every second, as she examined each of your traits, her pupils shrank more, while the whites of her eyes grew. \"You!\" She cried out, her tone half-demanding, half-pleading. \"You're... Not... My... Satan...?\" Her fingers lifted up to her red face - a tone made stronger by the disheveled blue hair framing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally! After all that humiliation, she recognized you! You let a happy sigh escape your shrunken lungs. No matter how worried you were about speaking before, this was your chance to clear up the confusion. \"Precisely as I've been telling you! Could you not hear my ejaculations earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you could hear her quickening pulse. In the fighting queen's silence, you heard it getting faster. The delicate face before you turned pale, mouth nearly frothing. \"But... But... The Dark Prince was right there reading, in all his majesty... and... I heard his voice! He wanted me, finally!\" As giant as her green pupils were, they were lost in her huge whites, darting all around the room and not daring to face you. \"We were... going to... be together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body ached from the pinch of her gigantic fingers. Her unsteady blew across your hair, rustling it. You shouted back: \"An enchantment seduced you, Rulue! Thankfully, it seems some force has finally relieved you during those lustful throes.\" You paused for a breath of murky tower air. \"I'm satisfied, too - your affection is horrifying enough at regular scale. Now, we must find an antidote before you molest me any more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pale hand fell limp, dropping you down the length of her partly-exposed legs, to the cold, moist stone floor. Four words pounded through the room: \"What. Did. You. Say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, you saw Rulue standing at her full, dizzying height. Her soles before you kept glued to the ground, and her firm legs struggled. The Fighting Queen froze, replaying the events of the past half-hour in slow motion. She gave a gaze below, down her white torso, looking more distraught and puzzled than a Puyo Puyo player with 7 rows of garbage. Then, her eyes widened and quivered at you, her gigantic body snapping to a defensive martial arts position. She inched back. Tears began to hit the ground. She soon held her gut, disgusted pangs running through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Satan... No, this person... This was the thing she had let into her? This was the person, the beast, that the fighting queen showed her secret place, her secret self? She'd been caught in the throes of love, taken to another dimension, dreaming of rose-tinted days to come... By THIS?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputtered: \"C-calm down! I was merely expressing my honest opinion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue couldn't catch her breath. Only a bit of sweet-talking and magic - and her muscles, her rock punch, wind kick, iron fist, each of them became meaningless! All by this thing, less than a dust mote... Who now demanded her help, as if she were a servant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands left her toga, clenched on either side of her. Her seat-soaked hair dripped from continued shivering. \"Insect... Close your eyes and grit your teeth.\" She fluttered more on each syllable, almost flirtatiously, sliding them gently across her tongue. It was so quiet, you had to focus to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted one leg up, the knee pushing back her flowing toga, exposing her heel. Five digits overtook your view. \"With my queenly feet...\" At each breathy word, her well-trained fists clenched tighter. It all hit you at once: the shock, the odor, the wetness, the pulsing sensation in your scalp - all telling you to RUN. You sprinted back, making it across one gigantic tile before you heard her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I swear I will maim and defile every bone on your body!\" A furious screech shook the candles that gazed on your path. The door stretched back further each second. Her foot pounded right behind your back, toppling some over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body tilted, but you kept on course. \"But - that attitude only further proves why you're terrifying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! Time for your queenly punishment!\" Lifting her fan to the air, she swept it down in sync with another stomp. You only barely veered away from the bare sole as it struck down, with all the potency and fury of a thunderbolt. Ziggzaging around the toes, you kept your sights on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other behemoth leg raised with a hushed grunt. She leaned in. You stopped right as the sweaty mass was about to make impact, watching the fight-blemished skin end up right in front of you. Right by her heel, a sharp *crink* rang out. The rock floor cracked under her stomp, the crevice stretching out to your own feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was this? Had she really been -that- hurt by the experience?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second, she leaned backwards, repositioning her silky leg. You dove back again, outpacing the sole swiftly. In response, Rulue swept the fleshy mass across the floor in a deft motion. You would've been able to escape, had you not been facing the Fighting Queen - your own leg speed couldn't compare to the reflexes, flexibility, and strength of this titanic woman. The side of her foot flew right into your teensy torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such a thin impact point, all the anger compressed in her limb flew directly into a focused spot - you. It kicked you against a wall, where you fell into the pages of an open book. Both impacts sent absurd pain jolting through your back. Biting your lip, you propped yourself back up quickly. But attempting to run just made the thin page slide under your feet, tripping you up! And your body ached too much to move quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunder echoed across the walls. \"I can't believe your audacity!\" Seeing Rulue from this distance, like a mountain on the horizon, gave an even clearer view of her whole well-trained body. Her blue hair rushed along her slender shoulders, dozens of feet in the air, as she leaned in. Enormous sweatdrops draped her exposed limbs and neck, each traveling impossible distances at every heartbeat. The glare across her face was like that of Kikimora regarding a stain - at once distant and intensely focused. When she opened her mouth to speak, it looked as if she were baring her mighty fangs: \"What has this pure, innocent, honest little maiden done to deserve this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step forward to you - or rather, a booming stomp forward. And again, the stone struggled under her weight, thin cracks emerging from the foot. \"Can I even call myself a maiden anymore? You've mocked my lovely dreams and used them to soil me! Not even that perverted Count treated me this lewdly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted a dainty leg again, showing her glistening sole for a split-second. When it came down, the shockwave rattled the book, knocking you over. You struggled up, trying to get a word in: \"Rulue, I didn't do anything! I was trying to speak the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't do anything?!\" She froze mid-step, fist curling near her face. \"Does a queen's dignity mean NOTHING to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*STOMP* - the mighty stone creaked, as she kicked a pair of books aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you NO conscience!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUSH* - beneath her steps, chunks of rock and newly-formed gravel went flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of you, I - I - ARGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis next steps sent you flying off the book. In her rage, Rulue's powerful soles carved permanent footprints in the rock, deep enough to go over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatan's merchandise and the stone walls blocked all escape paths. Above, the pugilist had her hands on her hips, gazing down in fury. Her green eyes were soon blocked out by her toes - bits of crumbling stone caught between the phalanges. She held her fan out, its bright redness almost hypnotic against the impossibly-high ceiling. It swung down briskly. Rulue dealt your judgement:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>THWOOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue's graceful leg lifted an inch to aim - and then came crashing on you in a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomp dug deep into the floor. Cracking noises rushed through your reddening head - it was hard to tell if that was bone or stone. You felt your limbs sprawl out, but they had no space to move. Even the refined, high arch wasn't a safe place, with how profound her footprint was. Years of defending herself (and chasing the Dark Prince without magic) trained the Fighting Queen to break through solid bricks. Rulue's treacherous ascent to the Dark Prince's chambers gave her ample opportunities to warm up her blows (a heat that emanated uncomfortably on you now). Now, every muscle, sinew, and joint in this towering, marble-smooth colossus of a limb joined forces in a single pound to smother you underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven muffled by warm flesh, this blue-haired mountain's queenly laughter was ear-shattering. \"Ohohoho, was that really your best try at escaping?\" Even without seeing her face, you could tell she was leaning in, by the shifting weight that built across your shoulders. \"Shall I give you another chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sudden jolt, her gigantic sole lifted, bringing you back in the candlelight. A thin string of moistness stuck on you. But you couldn't look back for long; you rushed forward, arms pumping out to swim through the air, focusing right on the door. She followed you - with the large digit's slender, dirty underside right above you. As soon as you took a breath - BOOM. The weight crashed on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you THAT eager to taste my bare flesh as it descends from heaven? My, my!\" She turned her ankle, twisting your minuscule legs, while she drew the word out. \"...What a CREEPER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled, kicking, swinging your fists. One blow made her flinch, drawing back with a yelp. A chance! You sped forward blindly. A way out, a way to escape the looming shadow of the vengeful giantess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM. Rulue crushed you again. Only one step was enough for a slender, shapely leg to reach you. Now, the ridges pressed deeper into you, harder. \"Honestly! Do you know who you're dealing with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass lifted, falling beside you. You took a breath, gathering your courage, and began crawling forward. You looked back up to see the long, draping toga move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM. She dragged you back in place, clearing her throat. \"You know... A year ago, a foul Count imprisoned me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled forward again, grimacing in pain. Now, Rulue wasn't even looking at you - just staring off at the wall, memories reflecting in the unattainable green eyes. A dim candlelight kept you focused on the outside world. When her imprisoning sole rose again, it gave you the will to move again - before the next careless SLAM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think - a lost, frightened little maiden, at the mercy of such a beast! I nearly escaped the villain, but... my weak, slender body couldn't stand to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face ground against the stone as she tugged you back with a single toe. She had her fan out, hiding her mouth. You could see her eyes had the faintest trace of tears in them... Until five powerful digits blocked out her face. She gasped in, and stomped harder than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But as all seem lost... A brave hero came in to help me. Satan! His beautiful green hair crashed down his manly shoulders, complimenting those firm, massive horns! Ahh!\" She fanned herself, breaking into a smile, with one hand on her chest. \"To be there, an awestruck doe, as my prince's beautiful, protective wings spread out! His cherry-red orbs flamed with righteous indignation! His gentle-but-strong hands cast bewitching spells on that hideous Count!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her heels popped up, lifting you from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was there looking for Carbuncle, but still... He filled me with the strength I needed to overcome my fears. That day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground blurred towards you, as she stomped firmly into the ground. You groaned, trying to turn your face away from the overpowering, salty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell in love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, her leg rose to the sky. You twitched, waiting for it to plummet down... Hesitantly, your head turned to your gigantic torturer. She had both hands clasped together, her eyes shut. Lost in her sweet memories. Could this be your chance? You took in a deep breath, got to your wobbling legs, and tiptoed backwards. The flowing toga stood still, framed against the dark stone room. Rulue's sighs and breaths less overpowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for that Count...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe draping toga moved in a sudden jolt; her statuesque legs sprung back into action. A brutal pressure knocked you off your legs. The Fighting Queen made a kicking sweep that shot you across to the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Satan and I stared into each others' eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM. Her smile grew wider, the force in her feet stronger. SLAM. Every time you thought you'd be numbed to the pain, it came shooting back through your spine again. A complex web of ridges and wrinkles kneaded across you, almost violating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stomped his ugly face into the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small gap you could almost squeeze through, right between her toes. Giving it a go, you pushed forward, fighting back the enveloping flesh. You felt the candlelight touch your eyelids... Suddenly, a toe on either end of your face pressed inwards, squeezing your skull between them. She hoisted you up by the head, caught in the crease between two dainty digits - and slammed you down face-first with the force of a comet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each time he tried to get up, I stepped on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM. Your body screamed, tears mixing with sweat. SLAM. You could feel her growing pulse when her sole pressed tightly enough against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, and again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM. Your breaths were quicker, lungs feeling tight and sore. SLAM. Rulue kept a calm smile, despite the blood racing through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until he learned to fear the power of a maiden's love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM. And once again, for good measure - THUD. By now, you felt completely pancaked. You pushed back a little, trying to pry yourself away. This just lathered you with the peds' perspiration; even the smallest inch of progress felt miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer twitching hand curled into a fist \"But you - you're far worse! Thanks to you, the Dark Prince got away from me... The Dark Prince won't take me as his queen... Arle will ensnare him in her filthy, tomboyish arms!\" She screamed, jumping on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue twisted her heel across the floor, wiping it back and forth. \"After all the ways you dragged me and my beloved prince through the mud... I'll have to break you into small, twitching pieces before my honest heart can accept your injustices!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother twist. At first, she ground her whole sole against you, dragging your minuscule frame along with simple twitches of her bare ankle. But then, with another all-engulfing STOMP, she began twisting you with the ball of her foot alone. Now, it felt as if each twist, each prod, each nudge drove you deeper into her skin, and flattened you more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to reply: \"P-please...\" It only barely came out of your mouth; the ball of this vengeful woman's dainty foot was pressing your ribs far too tightly. Even breathing stung, with the unbearable pressure and the heavy odor in the air. But worse, you knew you could only barely speak, only barely breathe, because your captor was allowing it. Her arch hung right above you, lifted from the ground, ready to descend at any moment. The wrinkles closest to you had thin traces of dirt and her perspiration between them; more and more folds stretched up, getting smaller in the distance, until they reached the shapely ankle. You sputtered out again: \"Please... Rulue...! Urgh... You can't! I'll do whatever you say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain squeezed in through your nerves as the woman delicately leaned over, her blue locks dangling over her arm. She rolled you underfoot so that you had a clear view of her face looming above you, a coy smile across it. \"Oh? Did I hear begging? Aren't you Satan, the proud Dark Prince?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP! She brought her heel down on your face, jamming it in tightly - right in sync with the word \"Prince\", to emphasize it. The floor creaked in your ear, the way a wood board would, protesting its treatment to deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Where are those charming words you used to lift this little girl's heart a moment ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP! It felt like the fighting queen was drilling right into you. Her smile grew wider as she fanned herself, shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's that strapping strength and delicious boldness that won you so many battles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP! It made your ears ring, and the candlelit study spin around you. The shockwaves knocked over a plush Carbuncle - still grinning, as if laughing at your torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...MY...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...DARLING...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...SATAN!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, she was vigorously assaulting you with her foot, dealing direct, crushing blows in rapid succession. The pauses between steps kept shrinking, as the intend deepened, and the squeezing grew more intense. She could easily torture you with only a touch; and yet, the blaze in her eyes told you that she was putting everything she could in this. The cracks in the flooring spread over multiple tiles. Hungry, unrelenting, the dainty sole fell again, and again, and again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd through it all, her vigor never left her heart. It seemed as if every shiver or shriek from you only renewed the rage burning through her fourfold. Thanks to the Dark Prince's spellcasting, your body could take much deal more punishment without facing death; but it did naught to save you from this humiliating, sense-numbing hell...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time she stopped, you felt more like part of Rulue's foot than an individual. You twitched every second, expecting the heel to come back down; but it seemed like she was content, for the moment, to admire her work on you. The ability to move your limbs freely felt unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your blurred vision cleared, and you wiped your eyes of the stinging sweat, you could make out her crossed arms high above. Her eyes still pierced into you. Every curve brought back flashbacks of your time in her rear; every sway of her toga put you on your knees; every second she glared down at you through her nose made your hope of escaping dimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to say? Your attempts at convincing her that it was a trick backfired - and any requests could just make her angry... What could chill her off? Bracing yourself, you asked: \"Rulue... What would Satan think if he saw you... like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held still. Both her hands twitched. For a moment, she looked at the cracks across the floor. She brushed sweat dripping off the nape of her neck, staring at it in disgust as it dripped off her fingers. The white cloths suddenly looked far heavier. Far above, her cheeks lit up in bright pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't...Don't...\" She stammered for a moment, before crossing her arms. \"Don't you DARE speak as if you know his feelings! How could you? How could a filthy creeper like you possibly understand our love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried speaking back: \"I didn't say - I-I just... Would a man like him truly appreciate these...\" Your mind hunted for a non-insulting word. \"...episodes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit deep into her lip, shaking her head. \"Silence!\" The fighting queen spread both muscular legs apart in two earth-shaking steps. Her right fist lifted into the air, shaking. You started up again, hoping to at least get on your legs. \"You're trying to take advantage of my romance! I can't let you manipulate a pure heart again!\" You were in a sprint by now, giving up all chances of reasoning with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyah!\" The breathy voice echoed through the room. Her arm fell from the heavens, delivering a knuckle sandwich with extra salt. It trembled through your bones, warping your flesh. You felt yourself going flat on the stone floor again, right into a puddle of perspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that!\" Her left fist now slammed down. You only barely managed to roll away - if it had hit, it may have torn the skin right off your body. Instead, it sent a catastrophic quake through the floor. The shaking was so intense, it sent you flying into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rock Punch!\" The titan was quick to react, calling her next move. With little time to wind this punch up, it had less strength. Still, when her middle knuckle collided with your tiny airborne body, it sent you flying. A stone wall soon greeted your back with another jolt of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wind Kick!\" You weren't the only one flying - Rulue leaped off the ground, one titanic leg stretched out. Thanks to the moisture coating your body, you remained stuck on the mossy wall. Soaring ahead, the side of her foot targeted your spot on the stone. Right as you managed to unglue your back, the fleshy mass tore into you with brutal precision. For one excruciatingly long nanosecond, it felt like the pressure would squeeze your insides out, all over the gigantic digits. When Rulue's mighty leg muscle snapped back, it left an indent in the wall large enough for you to stand in. (Though standing, at this point, was an arduous task.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iron Fist!\" With her hips in place, Rulue's fists flew wildly. The first two punches missed, shaking deep into the wall - but before you even caught a breath, a third strike collided. You could still feel that massive hand's pressure after it left - and soon, another struck. And another. Between painful, crushing strikes, you managed to dodge one or two; but that just meant your whole cranny trembled against the rage-fueled strength, putting you off-guard for the next meteor-like impact. And each time a fist pulled away, you saw a flash of your tormentor's face - glaring right towards you even as she threw her shoulders into the attack. Every glimpse, you hoped for her to show some sign of mercy, or fatigue, and stop targeting you with those horrifying green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exploding Knee!\" As the scream echoed through your head, you heard rumbling beneath you. In a quick flurry of consecutive kicks and knee-checks, she tore the wall foundation below you into an unsteady mass of cracks. The continuous strikes rushed upwards. It felt as if the entire building was rattling - the stone nook began to give way under your insignificant weight. Unable to hold still, you tossed yourself off, hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, of course, you fell into one of Rulue's many kicks. The pressure now compressed you into her right sole's arch. She breathed in for a second, dragging her leg back. Gravity once again cruelly forced the towering maiden's weight on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fighting Queen!</i>\" Rulue called her ultimate move - the climax of her destructive assault. A heavy dance, teeming with elegance. You felt every intricate, passionate step thunder into the very core of your being. Stuck in a web of inescapable wrinkles, you felt the tempo build - and build - the floor shattering under pressure, air and light falling away. Even when you fell from one foot, the other caught you, keeping you locked in the painful routine of squeezing and cracking. A clap from above, a tilt from her fan, a womanly laugh - and once again, you felt your skull engulfed deeper in the salty flesh. Even when she slid across the room, you remained caught to one sole or the other, tossed between the two in what seemed like an endless torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone floor rushed towards you once more. You winced, knowing nothing could prepare you for the impact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUMBLE*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot broke right through the surface. The stone broke away into rubble, running across your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween chasing you around, and torturing you, Rulue's punches, kicks, and steps had severely damaged the study's stone flooring and walls. With this final impact, all the cracks slithering across the rocky surface joined together, and gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" She gasped in surprise, falling into her own step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe -whole- room's floor collapsed under her feet - sending its contents falling. You screamed, trying to grab anything for support - and grasped Rulue's red fan. As for the Fighting Queen herself: her eyes and mouth were wide open, her massive limbs flailing helplessly. The room was right above a stairwell; you both saw rows upon rows of the tower's rooms rushing by as you fell. Quarters for Satan's minions; rooms with odd, mystic engravings marking the doors; what looked like rows of tanning beds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue arrived at the bottom floor - right on her head. Her eyes spun in for a moment, as she tried to lift herself up. As soon as she was back on her feet, the heaviest magic tome fell on her skull, knocking her face into the ground. A few stone pieces followed, hitting her body one after the other - with a single smiling plush to top them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fan floated softly down, acting like a parachute - and giving you a clear view of the chaos below. It was the first time that day you had to look <i>down</i> to see her. Soon, you spotted the main entrance, cracked open by the earlier intrustion. Nothing could dash your hopes this time! You'd wave goodbye to her, and find someone outside to restore you to normal! You tried to twist your body to glide towards it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil an opening door beside you sent a gust of wind that blew you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Rulue!\" Minotauros burst out of the room, covering his eyes. \"Are you unharmed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound from her below wasn't \"yes\", \"no\", or words in any human mode of communication besides maybe Tibetan Throat Chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hulking minotaur servant stepped forward, eyes still shut - stumbling right into her. This set the Fighting Queen's language centers working again: \"Off, idiot! Why aren't you looking?\" The two bodies struggled awkwardly, before she added: \"Where were you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got on his knees. \"Forgive me! I heard noises, and assumed - with a woman as beautiful as yourself, and the man she loved, behind a locked door, making loud noises...\" He cringed. \"I couldn't disturb your privacy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much had he heard? She put a hand to her chest, shaking her head quickly. \"Privacy? Ha! I was merely disposing of an insect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands moved away, helping Rulue up. This was the first time you'd seen a bull's face in a blush. \"Lucky insect...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should say so!\" Covered in dust and scrapes, she rose up - just as you landed behind some rubble. The exit was only a stroll away; but the Fighting Queen and her bovine servant were in the way. That humiliating crash couldn't have helped her rage. But this could be your last chance to get out...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she pulled her undergarments up, Rulue's slender fingers paused. Thanks to the sudden stop, the lingerie threads underneath you bounced gently. It sprung you up, nearly pushing your face to the fighter's rose-coloured sphincter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying still felt odd when her idle fan waves still stirred you. You clutched to the panty platform for support. It was wet - no, soaked. A cupful of musky fluids seeped out between your fingers, wrung out by your grasp - making you flinch back in disgust. \"Sickening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it?\" The two words erupted suddenly, a smooth reverberation echoing through your sprawled form. \"Forgive me, we're moving too quickly. The morning star's warmth was melting my inhibitions... No, the Glorious Fighting Queen can't allow even <i>you</i> to experience that... yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms sprawled out with relief. She'd stopped her love-crazy tormenting. She could listen to you! She could find out the truth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue moved an open palm down. It cast aside the cascading curtains of her robes, stretching out for you. \"...But that's not the only way us lovebirds can enjoy each others' presence. I'm sure Minotauros won't mind us staying longer.\" The pale monoliths began closing on every side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right, you may have declared victory a <i>little</i> too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped away on instinct. The intruder's fingertips snapped together, grabbing your own robes. You wrestled the garments back, feebly struggling against a trained, leviathan-sized fighter's strength. \"You're acting in error! A mysterious enchantment brought me here, and it's addling your mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense hand pulled back. It patted the side of her underpants - making you spring up again from the lacy platform. \"I know, my dazzling Dark Prince. You descended from the heavens, a gorgeous fallen angel, in a flash of sparkling magic light... And you've got me helplessly ensnared in your charm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Fighting Queen rambled, she coyly traced her huge index in a circle around you, shifting the world of silk. Your feet struggled to find a steady position. With this teasing maneuver, and the omnipotent purrs, the blue-haired flatterer lowered your guard. And she noticed - even without glancing, just by paying close attention to her \"lover\"s scurrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued. \"It's improper, erroneous, addling, maddening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRulue's wrist sprung forward. The five elegant, strong fingers fell from above, like towers descending to earth. They closed together, segment by supple segment, pinning you against the pillow of her palm. \"I can't take it! And finally, I've caught you in the same spell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing back only engulfed your limbs the soft wrinkles. It was like trying to tackle 50 puyos barehanded. Your hand caught between the segments of her ring finger as she stroked you. \"Release me! Your obsession is blinding you from my true identity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too humble! I know who you are, Satan, better than anyone else - and that's why you're here, in my embrace.\" The woman held her fan to her chest, eyes shut in ecstasy. From her heightened body heat, you could tell why. What kinds of trials had she braved to reach this place - and that sweltering temperature? Whatever they were, you felt like it was nothing compared to the monstrous tension you were facing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigher and higher, she lifted you. Unlike the fall, this was slow - so you could get your bearings. Dim lamps and candles gave the room a lighting style that resembled a romantic night (or a sacrificial altar). Moss forests covered the stone walls; giant insects and arachnids crawling the ceiling; and ancient books spread out in a pentagram on the floor, displaying dark spells and fashion tips; connected by a well-loved, grinning plush toy at the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you just LOOK AT ME?!\" You shouldered her unflinching middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Rulue tried to hide her face using the fan, you could see a blush crossing her cheeks behind it. Her eyes remained shut. \"The man of my dreams has finally given in to his love for me... And I, his queen... was acting without honor... I'm... embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed you lovingly - but harshly. You mustered up as much air as you could. \"And what of my honor?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the tower in pale robes didn't even try to hide her satisfied grin. \"What of it? I'd consider it an IMMENSE honor to have Lady Rulue grace you with her devotion. And soon, with her divine lips...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pinky ran across your chest, up to your right forearm. It playfully squeezed it into the crease where the long finger met her palm. The Fighting Queen's scale could only be called breathtaking, as you neared the too-familiar mounds of her chest. And her might was also shocking, easily manipulating your body this way and that as if some sort of game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most terrifying? Her self-obsession. Satan's pride was his downfall, they say; but this creature's narcissism and vanity, twisting your world to reflect her desires, matched it easily. Though she kept hiding her gaze... Was there some sense of uneasiness hidden behind the posturing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ascent met an end at the lips' plush expanse. Both of the glossy surfaces glowed warmly. When they parted, thin stands of moisture clutched to both segments, eventually sinking under her tongue. Rulue's delicate mouth, even when only partly open, could easily engulf you. A breeze from within brushed through your clothes and hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the strong fingers pulled off you - cupping into a little seat, and leaving your body fully exposed to her kiss. Her shut eyelashes above quivered in anticipation, nostrils emitting more ticklish air. After a second of total stillness, she tilted her wrist, sending you tumbling forward - and towards the wet cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAARGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her heels popped, a dizzying distance to the ground. Her bare shoulders sank, then lifted. Dropping the fan, and bringing the other hand up for support, she lost herself completely in the kiss. The insurmountable strength of her smooth palm smothered you on one end; and the weight and dampness of her oppressively active lips did the sanme on the other. The fortress-like woman took every trace of clean air captive with her continuous pants; each exhale replacing it with her distinct aroma. Liquid slid down your face and hands; it was hard to tell how much was your own sweat, and how much her cavernous maw had loosened on you. It sucked on your skin, and drenched your robes, in what could be less described as a \"romantic smooch\", and more \"cold-blooded torture\". With the compromising force of her jaw, and the marble skin below impenetrable to your blows, it felt as if you'd be either squashed softly, sucked into her taut stomach, or suffocated by her inhales and exhales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething slimy and alien tickled your neck. Looking down, your face met the tip of your admirer's tongue. It prodded your nose, then slid upwards, dousing your head in a layer of her saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried shouldering it back. Your attack bounced off the plush surface, squelching. The flexible muscle caught hold of your arm. All wiggling and squeezing just lathered you in drop after drop of Rulue's fluids. It slid tantalizingly up the length of your tiny limb - then over to the one opposite, caressing it in a twisting, iron-gripped embrace. Strands of moisture dripped across your shoulders, connected to the huge mouth facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the lingua started exploring you all over, crawling out of its confines. The behemoth covered you in a lick, leaning forward. Gentle moans vibrated you as she repeated the slurp. The strength in this fighter's tongue, alone, pushed your neck and legs this way and that atop her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt! I will not be made this woman's lollipop!\" another strong kiss cut off your words, a lip-lock that literally locked you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense jaws - inches away from you - smiled brightly. \"Shhh. I'm nervous, too. Can you feel my heartbeat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her hand, you sensed an intense, rapid pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Satan...\" she sighed. \"Use your magic to freeze us in place, and shrink the sun to a romantic ember. I want our first time to last four thousand years...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween excruciating breaths of your own, you shouted out: \"I AM NOT YOUR LOVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother kiss stole your words... Before it became something far more horrifying. You felt your arms slipping past Rulue's creamy lips - brushed by her taste buds on the other side. Your protests proved unable to reach the callous behemoth's distant ears. With a final lick, she sucked you within her mouth entirely. The roof rained wetness, pooling below the muscle - which kept curling around you, brushing your whole body brusquely, feeling over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried crawling back to the exit, clinging on a canine - only for the active tongue to block your path, flipping you on your back with a little click. You couldn't tell which way was which anymore. The shadows of a firm, dainty mouth swallowed everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer index prodded you in fully, and escaped gracefully. To anyone outside, you'd only be an occasional bump in the cheek of a beauty resting on a beanbag seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the smooth organ kept stroking you, brushing you - more bold and invasive than earlier. Every time you tried to wrest it away, your hands slipped off its surface in a well-calculated movement. It pinned you to the roof of her mouth, squeezing you harsher. Her tongue rubbed you in all the wrong ways - teasing taps on your face quickly transitioning to long, slow sucking motions that lathered your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flipped again and again, muscles weakening slowly to her soft organ's strikes. And from the continual hums around you - mixing with the brusque sloshing sounds - it didn't sound like the lovestruck giantess had any intention of giving your body up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At this point, there was no reasoning with Rulue about how you're not Satan. She firmly sees Satan whenever she looks at you. You're certainly far too weak to fend her off, either... And for whatever reason, this all felt strangely good in its own ways thanks to the Masochism part of the incantation. With a sigh you resign from trying to break the spell, instead trying to figure out how to enjoy and even cooperate in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out to hug and kiss the goddess's gargantuan tongue as it comes for your face, bringing your own puny tongue into the mix at the same time. You couldn't quite hold on to it, but it was something anyway. A couple lucky pecks later and it slows down greatly. Some giggles replace the humming for a while as Rulue brings you upright and near her teeth. Her queenly tongue curls up ward and gradually leans into your face. You smile and open your mouth, tongue out, meeting what you can of her far superior one. It swings up and down and side to side, dragging your whole body accordingly. This time you wouldn't let go, wrapping your arms over the top of this wild ride of an organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, though, you could feel the queen's gigantic jaw moving down from under you, leaving you almost hanging from the head between her two front teeth and tongue. Two masses pinched your sides and Rulue's giant tongue pulled away, revealing a light coming in from behind you. Her mouth is open, and with her thumb and forefinger the statue-sized woman brought your drenched-in-spit self out to greet her colossal, grinning lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Oh-hohoho!</b>\" A thunderous, booming noblewoman's laugh from right in front of you floods your hearing, causing you to smile a bit yourself, \"I was hoping you'd finally join in on the moment, my darling Satan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-i-it's not like I had a choice, really,\" you respond, noting how helpless you were for a vast majority of that. Gonna take a bit of getting used to not insisting you're not her lover, but you seem to do okay this time. The fighting queen sees something unusual, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" You suddenly freeze in fear she may have found you out, then she pokes your crotch. Seems in all that hoopla you found yourself with a hard-on. \"Are you <i>challenging</i> me, darling Satan?\" You look down and notice that you are indeed quite hard at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world could I challenge you to like this?\" you yell out, surprised Rulue is thinking of facing who she assumes to be her lover in something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a Puyo battle,\" the queen smirks, \"but our own little game.\" Rulue then sets you down on the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might want to take off your clothes for this one, dear,\" she commanded, and you quickly oblige in doing so. As soon as you're finished, however, the massive queen picks you up again. She leads your view to her huge breasts, towering over ten times your height and shaking back and forth. You're left in awe at the spectacle as Rulue lowers her top a bit, showing a vast amount of cleavage she parts open and brings you closer to. Then, with a very sultry voice, utters something you probably didn't want to hear;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"Paizuri time~!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive maiden pushes you deep into her cleavage, almost squarely in the center, and closes the opening behind you. Smushed in all directions by the queen's bosoms, her aroma flooding your sense of smell, and well-lubricated by you being so wet, you're clearly not going anywhere. The massive rack bounces up and down, springing you up and down like on a trampoline. They shake from side to side, shoving you like a car taking hard turns over and over. They even compress you together, flattening you like a pancake for a while. Your dick, now hard as steel, was really feeling the brunt of this ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you couldn't take all this arousal anymore. You unload cum into the seemingly endless valley of cleavage, with all the movement stopping shortly after. The massive queen squeezes and rubs for a bit more (to clean you, maybe?) before opening the valley again and pulling you out.</span></div></div>",

The last thing you remember was walking out of the school when suddenly you blacked out. Now you had no idea where you were. Just that it was dark... And soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the lights went on, and you shielded your eyes from the sudden brightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!\" three voices said in unison. You were finally able to make out what was going on. And it was really scary. There were three giants, two maids whose names escaped you, and Umenomori Chise the spoiled rich girl at school, dressed in a school gym uniform with bloomers, clinging tightly to her body and exposing her legs. Up above there was a banner that read \"Congratulations!\" with sparkles, glitter, and a childish drawing of Chise in a bridal outfit with what you assumed was a miniature you in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...?\" you tried to say only for Chise to suddenly spin around and slam her rear end into you, knocking you to the ground of what you now realized was some kind of stool at the end of her bed. You lay on your back as Chise waves her tushy above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been selected from hundreds of other candidates to be my groom! Yes yes I know, marrying me at such a young age must be a dream come true, there's no need to say anything,\" Chise declared smugly, still shaking her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To that end, we took you to the science division of the Umenomori Corporation,\" one of the maids said, suddenly popping up on the left side of the stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we borrowed their experimental matter reducer to shrink you so that you could enjoy madame Chise's perfect body to the fullest extent,\" the other one said, popping up on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry. It's a one way trip. You'll never have to worry about going back to your boring old life. From here on out your life will always,\" Chise suddenly kicked her feet out from under herself and fell backwards, causing you to whimper as her butt slammed onto your body, \"be spent close to me,\" she concluded smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on finding a suitable mate Ms. Umenomori,\" the maids said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Thank you. Now please go make sure that the preparations for the ceremony are going smoothly. I would like to have a moment a lone with my fiance,\" Chise said, grinding you with her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part, you were in excruciating pain. Your body was starting to compress from the weight of your bride to be, and her wiggling wasn't helping things. Suddenly you heard a rumble from inside of her. You knew that could only be one thing. You tried to squirm away from her big butt, but no such luck. She farted a particularly smelly fart onto your body. Your eyes teared up, your nostrils and lungs were lit on fire with the disgusting scent! How could someone who passed herself off as so noble let out something so disgusting?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chise quickly got up off you while you sucked in fresh air and took all the time you had to enjoy not being crushed. Looking up you saw Chise's face red as ever staring at you, it almost looked like she was holding back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh hunny I'm so sorry I swear it's just the nerves of getting married to such a wonderful man I swear it want happen again. In fact tell you what I'll just sit back down and wiggle on top of you like you like and we can just forget this whole thing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she got off you she was right back on and as quickly as she did that a she let out a small SBD right on top of your minuscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! It's just nerves I promise this will be the only time I do it our long marriage I mean it's not like I ever act like this..... So I'm just gonna go get ready for the ceremony one of the girls will help you here\" Chise was practically running from you letting small poots out with each step before leaving you alone on the stool wondering what the hell could be happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one of the women from before came into the room and grabbed you taking to some little side room where you can only assume you would be dressed. You decide that you should at least try and get some answers from this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm excuse me miss could you just explain what the hell is happening.\" The girl looked down at you with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lady has asked for your hand in marriage you will give it to her and live happily with her at your new height just as she has wanted you to\" <br>\r\n\"Yes I get that but than why all the squashing and why all the farting what the hell is wrong with this girl.\" The women stopped and clenched her hand squishing you in the process her apathetic tone quickly shifted into a much more sinister one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen her you little man that girl is one of the comes from a rich family if she wants to crush a tiny man and marry him she will get that and we don't need said tiny man to ruin all her happiness just cause he can't handle a few farts so you will marry her and you will tell her that you love everything she does you will serve her till the end of your sad tiny life. Just to make sure you have some assurance now that both me and all the other girls you've soon will punish you severely. So if you so much as faint do to one of her farts so shut up and get ready to spend the rest of your life with Chise.\" The women finally unclenched her hand as you tried started to rest and get back your breath while also thinking of the horrible future that was laid out in front of you. Still though what could be worse than what you already experienced surely there was nothing this girl could do that Chise will do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just so you don't start thinking that there is nothing that I can do that Chise would do to you consider this. Chise likes you for the most part and gets embarrassed when she inadvertently torments you I will not feel the same way.\" With that the women set you down onto a chair where you assumed you would be dressed for the wedding and sat down on you hard grinding back and forth till you plastered to the seat cackling all the while before finally getting up. Of course not before letting out a massive fart just to prove that she could be worse then Chise and prove it she definitely did. From then on out you decided to bite your tongue at least until the wedding after all there was no way that women or any of the others could do anything to you in a room full of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo some women came by and put you into a tiny suit for the wedding. Still somewhat fearful of the women from earlier or even Chise herself you elected to just go along with this until you found a moment to escape. Soon you were brought to a large banquet hall which had been decorated with all the traditional wedding  pieces it even looked pretty nice. Noticing that all the people at this wedding seemed to be female you took a nervous gulp but still didn't try to escape just yet. After all you were in some woman's hand she could grab you at the slightest chance of you moving. To your surprise though you saw Chise standing there right near the alter. \"Isn't she supposed to be led in while I'm already here\" You thought aloud earning yourself a quick glare from the woman holding you. As luck would have it this was the same woman who gave you that warning in the dressing room. Taking fearful silence you looked onward to Chise who you had to admit looked beautiful. The dress was fantastic and she looked fantastic in it but one thing caught your attention. Where the gown should have covered her backside it did not instead there wasn't anything, no gown, not even any panties just her bare buttocks staring back at you and to the next of it was a stool. This was not just any stool this was the one that Chise had sat (and farted) on you earlier. Putting two and two together you looked up to the woman holding you pleading only with your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffed and quitely said \"How could you expect your wife to stand for the entire ceremony it's simply cruel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were place onto the stool which still happened to have the familiar sent of Chise's rear while the woman holding you made her way to a bench nearby. Chise sauntered over to you with glee in her eyes talking to you at a rather loud volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHH MY GOD HUBBY YOU LOOK SO NICE WHAT ABOUT ME HUH DON'T YOU LOVE THIS A DRESS AND LOOK I EVEN HAD THE TAILORS MAKE A SPECIAL ADJUSTMENT JUST FOR YOU\" Chise said giving you a wink before presenting you with  her hindquarters. Wanting to simply tell her that you didn't want to marry her didn't seem to be in the cards especially after you saw the woman from earlier pulling off another one of her signature glares. So you sucked it up and compliment your bride to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear you look lovely. I would have you......*ahem*\" You were interrupted as the priest (who was also a woman) started to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please not talk until I have informed you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No No he didn't mean it I swear it was my fault.\" The priest suddenly got a worried look and spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Ms. Umenomori if you want to talk you can talk whenever you want after all its simply a formality so if you want and only if you want you can take your seat now.\" The priest said with fright you had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goody get ready hubby you're going be under me for about an hour and a half\" You never heard the last part as she had already sat her bare butt down onto the stool hard. Getting comfortable Chise moved her ass side to side smushing you down hard onto the surface this lasted for about a minute and a half during that time the Priest never spoke and waited until Chise had gotten comfortable. When she did get comfortable you had already been pummelled by two giant cheeks of pain and to top it off the place she got comfortable in made you be right in her crack. The space you inhabited was moist and had the horrible scent of unrelenting gas and you would be trapped here while Chise seemed to get more and more sweaty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five minutes in you had heard  a loud gurgle from above and this rutinly began for another five minutes. You seemed to not be the only person who noticed as you could hear many people ask Chise if she was ok and if you were failing at being her husband already. All of this she shrugged off but it was easy to tell she was in pain or at least trying to hold something back. You knew exactly what was happening and you grew worried especially when you saw that her holding her obvious gas back was making her incredibly sweaty and the stinky liquid was seeping all around your already disgusting prison. Then twenty minutes in she did a loud long fart was released hitting you dead centre. Had you been normal size this would have been an extremely loud fart but with your size it was deafening and had smell that matched it. Nobody even so much as flared there nostrils when it happened except for Chise whose face became redder then a tomato. You counted yourself lucky that it was just one fart and hopefully the smell would be gone shortly however Chise was far from done. The next thirty minutes were full of Chsie letting loose a tremendous amount of farts, which made her sweat and fidget more from embarrassment thus making the situation much worse for you. It simply stunk and even though you could hear Chise silently cursing herself for what she was doing to her husband and on their wedding day no less she didn't move hoping that no one had noticed and you didn't mind. Soon it was too much and you fainted after a particularly nasty SBD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke you found yourself still on the stool but you were not in the banquet hall any more you were in a small hotel room. Looking around you saw that you were tapped down to the stool and couldn't move an inch and to make matters worse the door began to open and out of it came.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The Woman who tormented you in the dressing room come to punish you after Chise was heartbroken to find you had fainted and uses exactly what you hate most to punish you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Chise who decided that the only way for you to be able to still enjoy her ass in your married life is if you spend as much time under her ass so she can prove that she doesn't fart all the time <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.All of the wedding guests who all will punish you for fainting during the Wedding and as luck would have it most of the would was very gas inducing</span></div></div>",

I will allow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnal Vore<br>\r\nButt<br>\r\nFeet<br>\r\nVore<br>\r\nFarting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot Allowed:<br>\r\nMore than one victim (It's just you)<br>\r\nToilet<br>\r\nSpitting<br>\r\nBurping<br>\r\nGay<br>\r\nReal People<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, this is story has a zero tolerance for filler policy. Once you add a girl you will have three weeks to add a chapter WITH SUBSTANCE to the story. No chapters where the girl carries you around and just TALKS about how she's going to do things to you. You CAN write chapters like that as long as you immidietly follow them up with real chapters where the giantess crushes you. If you fail to add to the girl you add within three weeks, your chapter WILL be deleted. NO EXCEPTIONS. Management also reserves the right to delete any chapters it feels are not written up to a respectable standard.</td>",
