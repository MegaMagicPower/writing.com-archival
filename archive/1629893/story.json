You can witness to your horror the thought process as the body is created out of mere electrons and electric-fuel atoms. You can see the cell structure and a sizzle... then the dying light of the lamp provide your first glimpse of the amazing fact: You summoned your character out of nowhere...

You try to focus on him but he seems to blur, before, with a soft whirring noise, he pushes himself upright into a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine his appearance. Pale white skin, average muscle mass, and piercing blue eyes. Well, one piercing blue eye. Where his right eye should be is a metal cube embedded directly into the eye socket, somewhat crudely, a red ball with a solid yellow area serving as his eye, a tiny camera embedded within, thin blue circuitry spreading out from the construct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis right arm had also been replaced by a cybernetic version, a smooth dark plates concealing circuits and microservos. His left leg was replaced in a similar manner, the metal foot bearing no toes, simply being a sloped block of metal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughs loudly, once, twice, before he notices you. \"Citizen! What district are we in? Quickly!\" He barks at you in a thick lower class british accent, leaving you unsure of how to proceed as his face twists into a scowl. \"Are you a moron? What district are we in?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing, you wheel your chair to one side and show him your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck? Alright, I'll look at your little essay then. Huh? <br>\r\nWait a minute, <b>what the shit?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushes you out of your seat, positioning himself so that his cold steel foot can easily stamp down on your neck if he wishes to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better start fucking explaining, you little Jenari bitch!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her name was Verin. I created her as the main protagonist in a vampire novel called <i>Tetra</i>. It was supposed to be an action novel, filled with plenty of suspense and danger. The idea behind it inspired the name. Tetra is an organization of vampire hunters who recruits other vampires to do their dirty work. In the novel, Verin rounds up three other vampires who have their own unique abilities and styles in order to take down Tetra. It doesn't help that the founder and current leader of Tetra...is Verin's father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerin was created by fusing human and vampire DNA using a device called <i>Splice</i>. Verin, as soon as she was created, was raised from a young age, and trained in the art of gunfighting. Unfortunately for the researchers at Tetra, Verin became aware of her situation, and decided that enough was enough. She left the Tetra Research and Development Department as nothing but a smoldering pile of ash. Her age at this point was 22. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerin has long, straight, jet black hair that hangs just over her eyes and stretches down the length of her spine. Normally, she has dark green eyes, but when she gets hungry for some sustenance...they turn a vivid red. Her fangs are hard to see when she's not using her full power, but when she snaps, her fangs are clearly visible. She has ivory skin, slender arms and long legs. She's fast enough to dodge bullets and strong enough to bend steel. She usually wears a skin-tight black combat suit with red lacing and stitching. Over this, she can usually be seen wearing green cut-off jacket with white fox-fur lining, as well as dark blue jeans. A pair black high-heel boots adorn her feet, and she wears on silver earring on her right ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerin is a skilled martial artist and an expert gunslinger. She wields two godly hand cannons appropriately named <i>Devastators</i>. They are modified Automag Vs with extra-large magazines that hold 16 rounds each. Verin uses custom .50 caliber mercury-tipped acidic rounds capable of slicing through most everything and melting anything else. She uses the <i>Devastators</i> with unbelievable accuracy, able to shoot the stem off of an apple from 500 yards away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the training, torture, and degradation at the hands of her father, Verin is still a good-natured person. She does have sadistic tendencies...but what vampire <i>doesn't</i> have sadistic tendencies? She is indeed capable of making friends and leading allies into battle. She's an eloquent speaker and a good listener. She's as fast with her tongue as she is with a trigger, able to say the right thing at the right time in any situation. She is definitely a force to be reckoned with...and now...she's on top of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was, at that moment, writing a sentence. I believe it went, 'Verin licked her lips, quite ready to sink her fangs into anyone who dared cross her.' You can imagine my concern. Verin did indeed attack me shortly after she appeared...but 'attack' is...a strong word. It wasn't much of an attack in all honesty. It was simply...</span></div></div>",

Even if it meant murdering anyone who tries to get in your way.  You look at your creation with joy. You decided to test your creation by having her go and get you a soda from the fridge. It was at this moment that she went right on over and came back with said soda before putting it into your hands. You grin big since you know she will forever be your lovesick puppet.</span></div></div>",

You had infinite possibilities at your fingertips. Therefore, why not do what all people with this much power do and try to take over the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the vampiress sat on your bed, glaring at you, you lick your lips, and turn back to your computer. How exactly could you change her to allow you to take over the world? Obviously, you'd need to secure her complete loyalty, first and foremost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She will never act against the one who created her, and will follow all their commands, unless she believes that following a command may bring harm to her creator.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere we go. Complete loyalty, with some room for independent thought and capacity to point out dangers in your commands and plans. Looking back at the vampiress, you notice that her demeanor has changed. Where before she glared at you, she now seemed eager to serve, a small smile on her face and her eyes broadcasting her sunny attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, you realise something. <br>\r\n\"Hm. You know, I don't think I gave you a name...\"<br>\r\nThe vampire girl shakes her head. <br>\r\n\"No, master, you didn't. Do I need a name, master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling you master? What a good girl. A name would be a suitable reward for recognizing you as her superior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at your computer, you begin to type again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her name is Rosa. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking a bit more, you add on:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rosa receives small amounts pleasure from obeying her creator's orders.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be a good safeguard if she somehow found a loophole in what you'd so far written about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you have to decide just how you want to use her to take control of the world. There was the possibility of nigh-omnipotent psychic powers that cause every other human to see you as their ultimate authority. But there were also other ways, literally anything you could think of. Perhaps you could morph her body into that of an invincible, immortal goddess and conquer countries one by one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many choices!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa? I need your advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss's face lights up, the vampiress bouncing up and down slightly where she sat on your bed. <br>\r\n\"What on, master? I'll give you advice on anything if it helps you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need advice on world domination.\"</span></div></div>",

Due to a birth defect(maybe), she was born with a tail. Her father raised Eve to be gentle to mostly everyone. However, she had a very traumatic life thanks to her babysitter defiling both her body and her mind. She developed her Fury state and almost killed him.  It cannot be seen however, unless you really get her mad. Her dad did give her some therapy, so she is not as bonkers as she was back then. Growing up was hard on her. People bullied her on a daily basis. As such, she was very lonely at ages 5- 11. At age 12 however, Eve made a friend by the name Milly Erson. They became close friends. She has shown but rarely an ability to copy attacks and did not use it for a long time. Eve's body in her early years was considered \"childish\" by many. At age 18 however, puberty hit her with a sledgehammer. Example: she got MANY boys asking her if she had a boyfriend. Everyone was shocked to know that was the girl they bullied in the past. Eve has been seen using her new power willingly. She is still friends<br>\r\nwith Milly to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: She looks beautiful to men and envied by some women. <br>\r\nChest size: C<br>\r\nWaist size: 30<br>\r\nHip size: 24<br>\r\nEye color: gray (yellow if in her Fury state )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest thing about her is both her tail and eyes. If you look at them, you feel safe and conformable if the color is gray. If they are yellow though, RUN! She will calm herself down if this happens. (Unless she doesn't want it to end)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Tomboyish<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVA: Kira Vincent-Davis(ENG), Mai Nakahara(JPN)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you talk to her in her Fury state , she seems cold and sadistic. If you talk to her in her in her Normal state she is very friendly but a little hotheaded. Eve loves goofing off and is very energetic. Surprising enough, she is a AB honor student. She also love messing with people so trying to befriend anyone is difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: Fury state A.K.A Psycho Eve: She is incredibly vicious  makes her ALOT stronger and her tail has been seen growing spikes at the end.<br>\r\nCopy: If she sees an ability she wants, she copies it along with their personality. Think of Emerl from Sonic Battle. She can only copy a person's ability three times.<br>\r\nLiving Weapon: Quite literally, (drills,blades,rods,anything) though she will fight fair if her enemy fights fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yes or no?</span></div></div>",

Well, what does that have to do with anything? It just so happens your at a point in your story where her home was burned to the ground, by humans. Being human yourself, getting close to her at the moment might not be a good idea, at least not until you can get your story revised so this doesn't happen, or something else happens. The last thing you wanted her to do was start singing, you'd have no hope of rewriting her if she even let out a single musical note. You quickly scramble over to your computer and erase at least several day's worth of writing, beginning to completely rewrite the events of the serpent girl. She didn't seem to be stirring at the moment, which was very comforting, it gave you time to think and type faster than you ever have before. After several hours of rapid, frantic typing, you'd revised a plot that had taken you several weeks to compose to this point. You were sweating, your breath still heavy. There was only one thing really bugging you, in the back of your mind, What if the change wouldn't take immediate effect? What if it took some time for her to undergo the change. There's a soft hiss behind you, and your body tenses up. Turning around, you stare straight into the sparkling, amethyst eyes of this girl, Micaela if you can recall her name. She stands up, her lengthy serpent body whipping around her as she quietly sat back on her body, staring at you with a(n) _____ expression.</span></div></div>",

This gives you a chance to really look over the fruits of your labor. Micaela really embodied the qualities of a siren. Her hair was a striking sapphire color, and cascaded down behind her shoulders. The way her body was made, anything sensitive was hidden underneath an organic 'dress' which, in reality, was comprised of smooth skin-like growths. Her voice was soft, silky, just listening to her speak calmed your nerves and made you slightly dizzy. Of course, the best part of her body was her tail. About ten feet long, the far end of her tail was like stained glass, and caught even the dim light of the computer and caused her tail to shimmer and glisten, changing colors whenever it moved. Truly, you'd never laid eyes on anything more beautiful in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnh, why does my head hurt so much!?\" Her frustration caught your attention as you looked back up at her face, seeing the clear distress she was in. Easy now, you though to yourself, don't startle her. Sadly, the minute her eyes focused on you again, she leaped back and yelped in surprise, her voice beginning to stutter, \"Wha, who are you? Where am I!? What's going on, why can't I remember anything?\" Honestly, you felt bad, seeing her like this. She was usually a calm, temperate, and kind lady. Seeing her confused, panicked, and obviously suffering from amnesia, tugged at your heartstrings. \"Relax,\" you cautiously said, hesitantly holding out your hand, \"Your in my home, and I'm just a humble writer. There's nothing to be scared of, just breathe and relax, okay?\" Nothing to be scared of? Maybe not to her, but your heart was pounding at the moment, she was capable of doing all sorts of things, and you seriously hoped she calmed her nerves and regained her usual composure. You kept gently talking to her, slowly easing her nerves as she eventually got a grip and let out a light sigh, her eyes now expressionless and unable to show any trace of what was there just minutes ago. \"Forgive me,\" she started, \"For panicking like that. It's clear that you have no intent to turn me into a trophy, so I suppose you're worth trusting. My name is Micaela.\" As she says this, she quietly bows, she truly was a courteous soul.

You would've carried her to your bed to rest, but she was honestly a heavy creature, and you had nowhere near enough strength to lift that entire body and carry it across the house. Just thinking about it made your entire body sore for a few seconds. Instead, you disappeared out of the room and moved across the darkness of the house, going into your bedroom and opening a closet that had a few extra blankets and pillows, in case you ever had guests (which never happened.) You returned to the office and gently lifted up the serpent's head, moving the pillow under it and lying her back down. You then draped the large blanket over as much of her body as you could. Smiling a little, she gripped a corner of the blanket in her sleep and pulled it against her rather plump breasts, her tail lightly giving the ground a slap, a signal of her enjoyment. Seeing this brought a warm smile to your face, she may be a terrifying, mystical, and at times zealous woman, but she was also very majestic, beautiful, and, at times like this, adorable. You placed your hand atop her head and gently rubbed it in a soothing way, whispering to her, \"Sleep well.\" Before deciding to hit the hay yourself. The few extra hours of revising you just put yourself through had really worked your brain. You saved your work on the laptop and quietly shut it, before tip-toeing out of the room and going to bed, slipping under the covers and quickly dozing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, you had a dream as you rested, one of Micaela. However, unlike the sometimes lovely dreams you had, such as the one that spawned your wondrous creation who was now resting on the other side of the house, this seemed to feel more erotic. The woman was quickly advancing on you, a hungry glimmer in her eyes as she backed you into a corner. Playfully, she giggled as her tail began to slip its way up around your legs, \"There we are, darling,\" She spoke in a sultry voice, her gaze lowering a bit as she placed her hands at your sides and gently rubbed your hips, \"There's no need to run, you know you want this, as badly as I do.\" You could feel your cheeks getting hotter as her face slowly moved within inches of yours, her eyes shimmering like stars as her entire serpent body had coiled itself around you, preventing any kind of escape.

Don't be afraid to switch your blade on me if you have to.\" she says with a rather cocky, overconfident overtone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear... you inadvertently created a demonic and nightmarish monster! Not only does she refuse to serve you, she still wants YOU to serve HER! But... that's not part of the rules of Creation, is it?! You see a second figure slumped down in the corner of the room, with dizzy eyes, Odaxitar just steps over the shadowy figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said 'Do you understand'?!\" Odaxitar asked one more time, \"say 'Yes, my lady.

It's a <i>little</i> too complicated to explain to her in rather thick detail like an <u>human encyclopaedia</u>- and even if you could do this, she'd either not care about this- or she'd turn upon <u>you</u> again! So you know what?! Just simple 'everything else' down for poor her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is <i>currently</i> the year 2014,\" you explain back to her in a rather sotto voice, \"All of that futuristic stuff, holograms, health-potion shops, Virtual Reality Sex-Simulators... they don't even exist yet. Welcome to modern-day Earth.\" You await her own reaction, it should set in 'her mind' after over half an hour, you smirk to yourself, <i>she wasn't really that smart yet...</i> But you freeze as you remember her own unpredictable mind-set, even if the info took forever, she can <u>learn</u> faster in the end. You've <i>made</i> sure of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdaxitar just stared blankly at you for a few seconds... But whether or not that was a good sign or bad remained a mystery. Knowing the kind of girl you've just 'created', it's probably a BAD thing. But on the plus side, maybe she still might be so oblivious, she'll think she's the first person to have travelled back in time or something! It took <u>another</u> few minutes before Odaxitar drew another conclusion, after consulting her own knowledge about prior events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Your confused creation put her <i>very</i> pale hand to her chin, \"So the time and world I once belonged in <u>doesn't even</u> exist.\" She shrugged in another uncharacteristically disappointed fashion, you were again startled, as you can no longer 'read' her actions like you once did... \"All gods have mercy! So I'm stuck here in this worthless, ancient civilization, full of these lousy, primitive Neanderthals?!\" She crossed her arms and cutely pouted, like a queenly yet spoiled princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh <i>why</i> did you have to think up someone with <u>such</u> a <u>bratty, arrogant, and snobbish attitude</u>?! Sure those kind of 'characters' are so <b>fun</b> to mess with in <i>fiction,</i> but in your reality, they're just real assholes you'll soon realise! You fell fast asleep for many hours, until... You hear a shriek of \"Yatta!\" from the kitchen and someone fleeing the kitchen, followed by Odaxitar's angry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">\"Miss Olapen! Just stay out of the kitchen!\"</span> Odaxitar screams, <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">\"I told you I don't like waffles for the four billionth time, I prefer pancakes with au crem\u00e9 blueberry!\"</span> Olapen's terrified shrieks continue out of the kitchen into the streets, followed by the kitchen door flying open off its hinges like something from a Looney Tunes cartoon, it was as if a hurricane blew into the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">\"WELL, WHAT ARE YOU LAZING AROUND FOR, YOU LOWLIFE?!\"</span> Just then, your angry creation's ear-splitting shriek woke you the blooming heck up! You almost had a heart attack right there! Fortunately, the worst you got was an aching (and <i>burst</i>) eardrum the very next morning... You put on your head-phones hurriedly and hobbled rather slowly downstairs the best you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were such a heavy sleeper- that you didn't notice that the kitchen was now aflame with steam, the living room had books strewn hurly-burly all over the place and the fridge's door torn open by the hinges. Odaxitar was now relaxing next to an untouched electrical toaster, comically munching on a toast sandwich... You gape with astounding surprise, <i>There's not much food left!</i> you panic, more concerned about the food than the situation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what?\" you groaned as you rubbed your deaf ear in pain, she walked up and strode to the window facing the park, ripping open these curtains.<br>\r\n\"I'm so bored! I've read all those dusty and useless books in your house in <i>less than a day</i>!\" she announced, \"surely your primitive land has some place of entertainment to go to... Some-place with action, with easy entertainment galore! And blood! I ache for the fight-!\"<br>\r\n\"Well... there's a movie theatre down the street from here, a five minutes drive!\" you suggest rather brightly.<br>\r\n\"A movie theatre, you say?\" she raised an eyebrow, \"you mean one of those- by dictionary definition, <u>'old visual-story projections they used to show against a wall where large groups of people have to sit so scrunched up together to watch in one big room'</u>?\" Oh good, she <i>knows</i> what those are. And fortunately (Or UN-fortunately for you), that confirmation now sparks her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Master! Your first order as my new servant is to take me to your movie theatre,\" She ordered you, \"and it better be a REAL good 'movie' ticket... Or all the primitive plastic-surgery in this world won't ever fix what I'll do next to you!\" she glares back, <i>...IS THAT A REAL THREAT?! IS SHE EVEN ALLOWED TO DO THAT TO YOU?!</i> Nonetheless, you dare not risk her breaking the new rules if you disobey your dear Odaxitar.<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go...\" you mumble, sloppily putting on a coat.<br>\r\n\"*AHEM!*\" she cleared her throat, emphasising that you're still forgetting something from 'her highness' incarnate.<br>\r\n\"What now?\" You manage to roar back.<br>\r\n\"I demand that you carry me there,\" she demanded, \"on your back!\" ON YOUR BACK??!!! Ugh... she was just born a few <u>hours</u> ago and already she's getting on your nerves! You groaned again and leaned down, giving her more room to climb on you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled, strained and walked down the street with Odaxitar riding on you piggyback! She was very heavy and like a boulder... You try to ignore the creepily odd stares you're now getting from whispering neighbours and other passer-bys, but it's kinda tough... You crawl to a stand-still.<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Move faster, Master!\" she ordered as she taunted, \"I cant stand being out in this freezing cold weather any longer!\" SHE cant stand it?! YOU have to endure it while giving HER a piggy-back ride! And you're already weak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J...just a little further,\" you whisper to yourself, \"just a... hah... little further!\" Thankfully it wasn't a long walk before you <i>finally</i> reached the theatre two hours later. \"O-O-Ok! We...we're here!\" You manage to collapse, gasping under her weight. \"Why couldn't we just take a train <u>from the station</u>?!\" You started to regret writing her storyline...<br>\r\n\" 'Bout firking time,\" she muttered as she jumped agilely off you like a jaguar, \"what are we watching now, Steph?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick question: <b>What kind of movie do you think Odaxitar is interested in seeing?</b> Choose carefully. You remember the threat she gave you if she doesn't ever like the movie!</span></div></div>",

I minaged to open the dotor a bit, but... there's a pack of mookies I drapped outside the evelator, LOL. I cnt reeeeeeach it. Firk, key stuck!' Hm, he likes swearing a lot. Just then you spot the very same elevator around the corner. It is slightly open, but you can see a tanned scaled and six-fingered hand try to widen the door. Nearby is a packet of Chestnut cookies just out of reach. Diaglo is groaning to reach it desperately. You noticed his snake-tail slamming around.<br>\r\n\"JIRJIOJRR! Help meh out!\" he exclaims, starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING! 'I fergot, I got lotsa shopping bags from the ol' shops inside with meh. I try 2 rent apartment heeere. fingah tired.' Diaglo comments. Odaxitar sweatdrops. She called Olapen on the mobile, but you have an idea.</span></div></div>",

Diaglo/Daichii seems very grateful that the Master (you) helped out. However... You were surprised at how he reacts when he tastes chestnut-flavoured cookies for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of total ecstasy roams across his face, the Incubus demon starts sniffing in the bag, before stuffing a cookie deep into his mouth. He almost inhales it whole, but his cerulean eyes bulged out when he absorbs the flavours... 'SO YUMMY!' He had a total chibi expression on his fanged mouth that totally transformed his face for a moment, before turning back to normal... Then Odaxitar and you observe him cramming as many cookies into his TAIL as possible, inserting it carefully into the crab-like claw, as well as eating orally. NYUM NOM OM~! He has a look of total bliss... You are startled when he starts acting possesive of the cookies, but as he explained, the food in his story-world tasted synthetic. He never tasted actual food before, so you let him eat the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're gonna be fat if you continue eating like this,\" Odax exclaims, \"I'm your half-sister, so I know best.\". <br>\r\n\"Can't talk. Eating.\" Diaglo exclaims, before looking confused. \"What's 'fat'?\" Odaxitar shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"Fat is a word describing real-world metabolism, which means in a couple of days time, you're gonna be flabby. I'd never tasted real food either, but I tend to restrain from eating... Unless I have ta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like those people on the Biggest Loser program,\" you chime in. Diaglo looks at the last cookie. Then he turns towards you<br>\r\n\"Wace?! I hafta leave for the bathroom! Where's da firking water-based appartus? I gotta...\" He dashed for the closed door. \"What's a toilet??\" You hear a noise similar to a firehose being sprayed on full blast. Odaxitar groans at the idiocy, and rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Oh brother.\" she yells, \"Daichii, I did warn ya!\".

She glares at you, but you motion her inside the movie theatre while clutching the tickets. She seems a bit insulted, but she watches obligingly. Halfway through the movie in the dark movie theater (wow, what tedium!) Odaxitar seems to have lost interest in the movie, or so it seems. Until you can't believe your eyes. Near the backrow sits another 'couple' a guy with dark hair and sunglasses and another girl, their eyes are shaded, but there's something familiar about the two... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the other girl gives a suggestive nod to the other guy, and the muscular guy laughs and puts his arm around her, whilst giggling like school-girls on a night out. A pure wavy shimmering violet, and large kind silvery eyes... You duck and ask Odaxitar to duck as well. You know them well. You should've.<br>\r\n\"Firk! Why are we ducking?\" swears Odaxitar. The other guy looks around and shrugs while digging into the popcorn. You have your mouth open, but you hiss, \"Don't move a muscle.\" Kayo Regalis looks over his shoulder, but he ignores both of you. He's more interested in snogging. Another one of your creations... Here? In the shopping centre?? WHAAAAT?? Past and future selves of the 'same' character? That could mean immediate trouble. And the other girl unlike you-know-who, was extremely naive and kind, unlike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayo, you're so awesome.\" says the Other, \"Just like in University,\" Her voice chimes over the credits. Kayo looks flaunting.<br>\r\n\"Odaxitar, you mustn't see the other girl.\" She is irritable, but she swats away your arm and the other girl shrieks in fear at her irate expression, nervously pressing against Kayo for protection. Kayo immediately goes for the defensive, transforming Terminator style into his cyborg armour and arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" He exclaims in awe at you, before hailing you as a goddess. \"Hail the goddess!\"<br>\r\n\"What... the Firk?\" Odaxitar exclaims, as Olapen cringes... They stare for a few moments...<br>\r\n\"Yatta? Who is she?\" asks youthful Olapen... It's time, you try to drag Odax out of here. But Odax is itching for a fight. On the other hand, 'Opal' has less experience and could get easily beaten up. </span></div></div>",

Despite her imposing appearance, you had made her benevolent in the story you had started to write, so hopefully she wouldn't burn you to a crisp or something. Noticing your worried expression, she kneels and lowers her head to the same level as your, before saying in a soothing voice, \"<i>Do not worry, little one. I mean you no harm.

Thank you...</i>\", and engulfing you in a hug afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grey skin was very warm, and squeaked slightly whenever you moved in her embrace, as her breasts were...large, to say the least.

Strangely, just under there is just a <i>smooth area of skin.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, but not wanting 'Cindy' to freak out about being on the ground when she wakes up, you carefully pick her up and move her to your bed. Gently, you place her down and cover her with your comforter. As you ponder the situation, you turn back to your computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something is up here,' you think as you sit back at your desk. 'How can a girl, or anyone for that matter, have nothing there at all? It's like she never had anything there at all.' A second later, you facepalm at the stupidity of your question. 'Wait, forget that. How the hell did a girl just appear from my computer screen?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you place your hand on the desk, you try to figure out what's going on. Suddenly, you hear a loud snoring. Looking over, you see the girl sleeping soundly, snoring away. Sweatdropping, you turn back to your monitor and notice something. Your hand, when hitting the keyboard, had accidentally hit the Caps Lock button and pressed the Z key (ZZZZ!). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, did she just snore out loud because I typed it?' You wonder to yourself as you deactivate the Caps-Lock. After a few seconds, your eyes light up. Quickly, you scan over what you had written. Sure enough, the girl in your bed matches the description you wrote perfectly. Her hair, her chest, her accent, everything. You then realize that just before the craziness started, you were about to type about the girl's clothing. Since you hadn't typed anything about them, you figure that's why the girl lacked them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder... if I add in some details, would that change her?' You think to yourself. Deciding to give it a shot, you type a detailed description of the girl. Some never pegged you for a wordsmith, but you could write well when the topic was something you cared about. Finishing the details, you hit the Enter key and wait a second or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you walk back over to the girl, who was still sleeping comfortably and quietly. With shaking hands, you pull back the comforter a bit to see...</span></div></div>",

Up until now you had writing a story about team of three super-powered girls, known as the Tempest Trio, who worked together to save the world from an evil organization that operated publicly under the guise of Macrohard, an incredibly popular computer company. The Tempest Trio consisted of Alice Flanders, Jenny Cruz, and their fearless leader Sarah Valentine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was a tomboyish 16 year old girl with short black hair and a fairly athletic physique. Her powers were super strength and super speed. Her main weakness was the fact that, when it all came down to it, she had no way of fighting an opponent that she couldn't land a punch on. This made airborne foes and those who favored long-ranged combat a very difficult match-up for her. She was the group's muscle reserve, and her herculean strength was always useful in a pinch. With enough physical power to lift an entire building off it's foundation, and enough speed to outrun a race car, Alice was incredibly helpful on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was a shy and klutzy 14 year old girl with curly red hair and a petite figure. Her powers allowed her to create up to 10 clones of herself, as well as the ability to fly through the air like a bird. Her main weakness was that she and all of her clones were just ordinary little girls with the ability to fly, and if an enemy managed to single her out to fight one-on-one, she would be fairly helpless. Jenny was the type who preferred to avoid conflict whenever possible, so in a combat situation she tended to let her clones handle the fighting while she herself used her flying ability to stay safely out of her enemies reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, Sarah was a mature 18 year old girl with long blonde hair and a voluptuously curvy figure. She had the ability to control the size of any object with a mere thought, and she could also manipulate matter using telekinesis. Her main weakness was that she couldn't use her size-changing powers on a living being unless they allowed her to, and she was only able to lift up to double her own body weight with her psychic powers. While Alice was hyperactive and reckless, and Jenny was nervous and hesitant, Sarah was always calm and level-headed. She took her role as the team leader very seriously, and always took it upon herself to keep her friends out of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow one of these three girls was beginning to materialize inside your room! As the form of your character started to become more and more complete, you realized that the girl appearing before you was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More in her story later. Let\u2019s just say that for her weakness, only the author can control her, but she is friendly and doesn\u2019t mind being controlled by her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant young girl looks at the tiny person which is you and then she gives out a Godzilla like roar just as she places her hands on her hips. You were in disbelief and in sheer shock. You admitted you always wanted to make a story with a young kaiju in mind, but a young school age girl in a swimsuit Godzilla sized, well it is strange to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hi there, Girlzilla?\u201d You said to her, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoyuki then gets on her knees and looks at you a bit intensely just as she makes her monster noises, and then suddenly she smiles. \u201cHello there master, is there anything you want me to do for you my friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are my master, I will do anything you please.\u201d Koyuki then tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanna continue with Koyukizilla?</span></div></div>",

Your character cannot physically harm those existing in the real world, except their creator(s) and or families. Your character has limits to what they can do, as they can't breach their created powers. Birds and animals can be harmed though - :D Think of <i>Refugee From TVland</i> (TVtropes)<br>\r\n3. No god-mode sues are allowed. If no, add some realistic weaknesses to them<br>\r\n4. Anything is allowed, as long as it's in 'tact'. Shrinking, weight gain, endo, vore and other fairly random events from their fictional world can also occur on a daily basis. ^^ No single sentence chapters!<br>\r\n5. Creators can punish their creations if desired, only if the character misbehaves. Sometimes the law of physics can be ignored. If they wish, fusions can occur rarely<br>\r\n6. Character that created starts out with amnesia and can interact with creators and creations in a 'Truman Show' style. Endosomatophillia is allowed here also xD<br>\r\n7. No famous characters from TV show, games, anime or comics/celebrities allowed. If notified, I'll delete those entries.</i><br>\r\n8. No one-word or one-sentence chapters. Chapters must be detailed and elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would appreciate <span class=\"clred\">any</span> (even if small) additions and if you have any questions please contact me on writing.com and I'll get straight to it.
