The old\r<br>\nman met you at a bus stop and offered you a lemon drop, now you feel as if you\u2019ve\r<br>\nbeen drugged. The man is standing above you now, chanting gibberish and staring\r<br>\ndeeply into your eyes.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I know what you're up to, don't try to pull any of that mind expanding Castaneda stuff on me\r<br>\nwith your hypnotism and drugged candy!\" You exclaim, gasping for breath.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Life is like a journey to Ixtlan, you never know what's going to happen next.\" He replies calmly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey buddy, who you jivin' with that cosmic debris? Your Forrest Gump philosophy won't\r<br>\nwork on me, and I've never even been to Iceland, although I did consider going there once\r<br>\nwhen I was younger.... I used to have a crush on Bjork...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe old man continues to stare at you fixedly, and you feel as if you are falling backwards,\r<br>\nspinning into a long tunnel (like they used to have on that old \"Time Tunnel\" show on TV when\r<br>\nyou were a kid, only not as cheesy.) \r<br>\n</span></div></div>",
