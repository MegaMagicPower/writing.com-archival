They're heavy, likely around C-D range and make you lean forward a bit. You're naked, and shiver as the cool air registers with you. Your skin is tight, and your legs long, hips a bit wide, and waist thin. It's odd, it doesn't feel too odd aside from the major differences, you still have hands, feet, and so forth, but your lack of manhood replaced by tight folds of skin make your legs move in a different way than you're used to.

You slide your arms through it and try to hook it in back but it's so hard with your breasts stretching it quite a bit. Finally you get them in and you try to adjust it. It's hard but you get it sitting right, as the underwire sits under your breasts and push them up a bit, the cups holding them firm and the cleavage is quite nice like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe t-shirt is simple but it's so low cut it shows ample amounts of boob, and the tightness doesn't help. It goes to your midriff but it stops rather short compared to what you're used to. The skirt rests on your wide hips, barely going past your rear and only just going to your upper thigh. How is this meant to cover anything you ponder, holding it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally come the heels, you step into them and wobble off balance! You have to sit on the bed to buckle them and they feel fastened to your feet. You stand, wobbling some. They force your heels up, your pert rear pushing out as you stand in a way you only did on your tip toes but now it's all the time, you can see this hurting rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it's all on, a side panel with a chair pops out.

Everything after that was a blur. Did you walk home? Did you catch a cab? Were you drugged? The simple answer to these questions is that you don't know. What you do know however is that where ever you are it isn't at home, in a hospital or in lockup, though that last choice seems to be the closest resemblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see a single fluorescent light buzzing and flickering. Annoyed you sit up, though there seems to be more weight than usual. You look down, which forces long strands of red hair in front of your eyes, but you still see between the strands your two breasts. Your best guess is that they're either a B or C cup, but then again what do you know, you only care about how they look not their size. Speaking of which these two don't seem all that bad except for one small problem, they're attached to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only do you get a clear look at your breasts but, which you are now feeling up, confirming that they're real, you also see your groin and lack of a penis. No instead you see a slit which you immediately recognize as a vagina. You try to scream but no voice comes to you, just a small wheezing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused you look around at your surroundings, only to find yourself looking at a mirror. This is when you get a good look at your face. You're rather attractive, with green eyes and long, wavy red hair and a nice toned body. The only other things in the room is a toilet and the metal bed you're sitting on.</span></div></div>",
