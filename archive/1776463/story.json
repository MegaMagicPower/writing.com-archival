It took five years to create the Ultimate life. As a result, they succeded and I was created. I am going to appear like I'm 18 for eternity. And the first day of my life, I was trained on how to use my powers. But when I found out that I was just a weapon for world conquest, I destroyed the lab and the ones who created me.

I'm a high school junior now, but I starte my first two year at a human school. But I got kicked out of there so I soon got accepted into Yokai Academy. That's a good thing because I can be myself without living in fear of rejection. You see, I'm different than other people. I have abilities and traits that most people don't, and that had made it difficult for me to fit in. Sometimes my abilities slip out and I have to move away. My mother thought it would be a good idea to go to Yokai because it was filled with people \"just like me,\" but I didn't believe it. But she insisted and I was obligated to go. It wasnt like I had much of a choice. I was out of options for schools. And you may be wondering \"what does your father think you should do?\" Well he's not in the picture. He left when I was really young, I don't know much about him, but I know that he's the reason that I'm different. I hated him for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got further away from home, I noticed how wierd the environment got. It seemed dark and sinister. The bus suddenly halted and I arrive near a cliff with a scarecrow perched near it. I assumed that the school is nearby so I got my stuff and went to get off the bus. \"Hey kid.\" I looked over and the bus driver had finally talked. \"Your a new student at Yokai?\" She said with a creepy voice. \"Yeah\" I answered. \"You better watch  your back, kid. That's one scary-ass school. And be careful who you meet there. Not everything is as it looks.\" He smiled evily while he said this. I thought he was crazy and just trying to scare me. \"Whatever man. Thanks for the ride.\" I said and got off the bus. I looked around and saw a huge building and I concluded that must be the school. It was on the other side of a sketchy-looking forest. I was reluctant, but I decided to walk through the woods. When I looked back, the bus was already gone. \"Creepy\" I said out loud. As I walked through the quiet and creepy forest, I noticed someone was also there...... </span></div></div>",

She was a little I unusual, but then again so am I. She had this long, beautiful sliver hair and gorgeous white skin. Her eyes, though kinda scary,were a beautiful ruby red color and very alluring. Don't even get me started on the rest of her body. Her left side was turned to me so I saw her busty chest practically bulging out of her shirt and large butt which almost peeked out from under her skirt( which was very short). I guess she felt eyes on her and she looked my way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you with something?\" She asked in an almost irritated voice. I was a bit intimidated by her mature but beautiful voice, but I built up the courage to answer her. \" I was wondering where the school was,\" I answered. She looked at me for a second and said\" it's on the other side of the forest. I'm just about to go there myself. Are you new here?\" She asked. \"Yeah, but I'm a junior student. I just transferred here from another school.\" I explained. \"Oh. Well it just so happens that I'm a junior too. I'm Moka.\" \"Im (your name)\" I greeted. We were walking towards the school when I noticed that she was staring at me intently, almost like she is expecting something. Could she know already? No, not possible. We went our seperate ways to her friends and I went up to the headmaster's office. His receptionist, Ruby( who was also pretty cute, but not as beautiful as Moka) let me in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mr.(your name)! Please come in!\" I obliged and took a seat in front of his desk. \"Now, there is something that I need to tell you before you start your year at this academy. This is actually a school for monsters.\" I thought he was joking, but it soon made sense to me with everything I've seen so far. After a talk about keeping a low profile and being careful around any violent students, i walked out of the office and started my day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

Plus, I was kind of antisocial,(much of that had to do with my condition) so I decided to have lunch where there wouldn't be anybody to bother me: the roof. I found a stairway to the roof while wondering throughout the school, so I took that route during my lunch time. When I got to the roof, I was really impressed with the view of the monster world. Even with all the dead trees and blood-red bodies of water, this place looks beautiful. As I was looking for a comfortable place to sit and have lunch, I heard something.

She freezes and turns her head towards me. Her stare kind of intimidated me. \"Sorry, I didn't know anybody was up here. I'll leave you alone.\" I didn't want to give up my spot but the last thing I wanted to do is get into a fight when I just got into a new school, let alone with a girl. She shaes her head and says, \"I don't mind really. Just don't annoy me. I'm not in the mood right now.\" I nodded my head and sat down a couple feet away from her. We sat the next few minutes in complete silence as we both ate our lunches. As I was taking a bite of my sandwich, I couldn't help but ogle at this girl. She was kinda scary, but she was so beautiful. She was sipping a can of tomato juice and my eyes took in all of her beauty. Her ivory skin, her large breasts, her creamy thighs that were showing scandously from her short skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to break the uncomfortable silence. \"So....Moka, is it?\" She turns her head to me with a slightly annoyed expression. \"Yes. What is it?\" She sounded pissed. \"What's wrong? Did something happen today?\"Her eyes zeroed in on me. \"It's none of your business. It would be wise that you don't bring it up again.\" I felt like she threatened me and that made me a little mad. \"Why? What's gonna happen if I do?\" I challenged her. Now she looked pissed. \"I kick your ass until there's nothing left of you. You should never tempt a vampire,\" She warns me with venom in her voice. \"Oh, so you're a vampire?\" She looked more annoyed. \"Yes you idiot.\" That's when I got pissed. \"My name is (name)! And I'm just trying to have a nice conversation and maybe make a new friend but your attitude is really pissing me off! What's wrong with you?\" I screamed at the top of my lungs. Her face turned from livid to straight. \"I've been asking that about myself for a while.\" I was confused by what she said, then the next thing I saw broke my heart. A second after she said that, she started crying. Tears were falling down her face and she was sobbing uncontrolably. For thirty seconds all she did was cry and it hurt me on the inside to see a beautiful girl cry her eyes out, monster or not. I couldn't take aymore so I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her into a warm hug. When I did this, she stopped crying  and looked up at me. Her face was stained with tears and her eyes were redder than usual. The innocent face she made was actually kind of cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, (name)?\" she asked in a shaky voice. \"I'm sorry for what I said. Please don't cry anymore.\" She looked down and said, \"It's not your fault.\" I got curious and asked, \"What hapened? Did someone hurt you?\" She looked like she was going to cry again. \"He chose her over me. My friend Tsukune chose my other friend Kurumu over me. I loved him for so long and he chose that big-boobed bimbo over me! What's wrong with me?!\" She screams as she starts crying again. I hold her tight and comfort her in hopes of stopping her crying. \"Nothing's wrong with you, Moka. He just made a big mistake. He's an idiot for picking someone else over you. You're perfect.\" At this point, I didn't think about what I was saying. \"You're an amazingly eautiful person who looks she  has a great personality.\" She looks up at me, shocked. \" You really think so, (name)?\" she asks in a cute voice. I smiled and answered, \" I'll tell you what,\" I start. \"If I had a choice between you or any other girl, Id pick you in a heartbeat.\" When I heard myself say this, I realized how much I like Moka. No, I was in love with her! I was in love with a vampire, but it felt so right. She blushed when I made this confession and what she did next shocked me to the core. She leaned her face to mine, and pressed her lips against mine. She is kissing me! My first kiss! It felt so good so I submitted and kissed her harder. She moans and kept on kissing me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of making out, we broke apart and just stared at each other, blushing. Moka was the one who broke the silence. \"I'm sorry. ou were just so sweet to me and I couldn't resist. That was my first kiss.\" she said ashamed. I comfort her by putting my arm on her shoulder. \"It's alright Moka. I enjoyed it and I'm honored that I was your first kiss.\" She blushed as I said this and I found it cute. \"So.....does this mean we're a couple?\" she asked, embarrassed. I was embarrassed because I never had a girlfriend before and now I had this goddess in front of me wanting to be my girlfriend. \"Uh, if you want to be.I've never been in a relationship before,\" I confessed. Her eyes lit up and hugged me. God, this girl was strong! \"Thank you for being my first boyfriend, (name)!\" She says with an excited voice. When she realized what she had just done, she quickly pulled away and sat next to me with her head down,embarrassed. \"There's nothing to be embarrassed about, Moka. I thought it was cute.\" She blushed whe I said that. \"Um, I actually have a request.\" she blushed furiously when she said this. I got curious and asked, \"What is it, Moka?\" She looked at me and spoke. \"Can I suck a little bit of your blood? I haven't have any in so long.\" She looked mortified. I was skeptical letting a vampire suck my blood, but this was an incredibly sexy and sweet vampire, so I decided to let her suck my blood. \"Sure thing Moka,\" I said as I exposed the left side of my neck. Her eyes lit up and Moka got a hungry look on her face. She relaxed herself and leaned into my neck. When her fangs made contact with my neck, it hurt a little but after a second, it actually fellt really good. After about ten seconds, she retracted her fangs from my neck and licked my wound. I asked her why she did that and explained that it prevents my neck from bleeding out. I thanked her for that. After that, she told me of all her adventures she's had since she got her, even her battle against the vampire Alucard. I was so facinated with her and how amazing she is. We just stayed in each other's company for a few more minutes until the bell rang. I groaned as I was really enjoying being with Moka. She didn't seem to thrilled of leaving me either. Before we leave, she says to me, \"You want to do something after school?\" I nodded. \"I have a couple of ideas on what we could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do we end up doing?</span></div></div>",

She seemed to like the idea judging by her facial expression. \"We can have it right up here on the roof where no one can bother us.\" I went on. I thought the idea was perfect because no one would want to waste their free time after school going back to school. It was genious to me. \" I like that idea. I'm pretty good at cooking so I can bring food for our picnic,\" she suggests. \"Ok, and I have a bottle of sake that I brought from home. I was going to save until I graduate, but I think now is a more special occasion.\" She sweetly smiles and nods her head. \"Now that we got that planned, we should get ready.\" Moka suggested. I nodded my head and said, \" You're right. I'll pick you up at 8.\" We then left to our respective dorms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost 8 o'clock and I was on my way to Moka's dorm. I was wearing a nice blue v-neck shirt and black dress pants. his was my first date and i wanted to look good for the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. When I got to Moka's room with a bottle of sake in hand, I knocked on her door and waited for her. About 10 seconds later, the door opened. I thought I was standng outside of heaven, because I was staring at an angel. \"Are you ready to go, (name)?\" Moka asks. I took in her beautiful appearance for a moment. Moka was wearing a beautiful yet scandalous black dress that went down to her lower thighs. The dress dipped to her lower chest, revealing a lot of her gorgeous breasts. She was not wearing makeup as she did not need any for her natural beauty. She was however wearing some nice ruby earings. She had her long silver hair tied in a ponytail that made her look even more beautiful. I was so captivated by her looks, I forgot that I was staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? (name), are you alright?\" Moka asked me. I broke out of my trance and laughed nervously. \"Yeah I'm fine. You look really beautiful Moka.\" I said to her. She blushed. \"Thank you (name). Shall we carry on with our date?\" I still wanted to go out wih Moka, but I kinda wanted to stay right here with her. \"Actually, do you just want to stay here for our picnic? There will be more privacy and it's getting cold outside.\" Moka still held a smile on her face. \"I don't care where we go, (name). As long as we have a good time with each other.\" I smiled. I had to make a decision on a we do for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo we stay indoors or go to our specal spot?</span></div></div>",

I'll get the good ready.\" Moka pointed me to a little table in the center of the room. I took my seat and waited for Moka to return. She must be a fantastic cook because the food smelled amazing from where I was. As I was waiting for Moka, I noticed something shiny on the desk near her bed. I went to see what it was and found that it was a silver cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, (name). I hope your hungry because I got....\" Moka called until she saw me looking at the cross. \"Hey, Moka. What's this?\" I asked. She looked a but uncomfortable when I asked that. She was silent for about a minute until she finally spoke. \"Remember when I told you about my other half?\" She asked with depression in her voice. \"Yeah.\" It took me a second to realize. \"So, this is the rosary that kept your personalities separated?\" I asked. She nodded and liked like she was about to cry. \"I kept it as a momento of all the times we had together. And how one of us couldn't live without the other. I really miss her.\" A few tears escaped from her eyes. I pulled we into a hug and tried to comfort her. Her crying soon ceased and she looked up at me. \"We should eat. The food's gonna get cold.\" I told her. She nodded and we say down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka presented the food and my jaw dropped! The food looked so delicious! It was teriyaki steak with white rice on the side. Also there was sweet-smelling herbal tea next to the food. Moka looked uncertain. \"Sorry if its not much.\" She apologized. \"Sorry?! Moka, this looks and smells incredible!\" I exclaimed. Moka blushed and looked down. \"Thank you. So let's eat.\" We grabbed our chopsticks and dug into the food. It was amazing! The meat was so juicy and tender. The rice was so good also. The tea was so refreshing and smooth. I had to tell Moka how good of a cook she was. \"Moka, all of this is amazing! Your a master cook!\" She blushed ten shades if red when she heard this. \"Thank you (name).\" We both looked at each other for a few minutes, saying nothing to each other. Her eyes looked su beautiful tonight. It was like staring into a pair of rubies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess the awkward silence was too much for Moka after five minutes. She got up and headed toward the window. \"I'm gonna open a window. It's a little stuffy in here.\" She said. \"Sure go ahead.\" She began to open the window. \"Oh, I forgot to tell you . It was a bit breezy before I got here so be care-\" all of the sudden the window blew open and a gust of wind filled the room. I didn't mind, until Moka gasped. \"Moka, are you al-\" I stopped mid-sentence and I swear I almost had a nosebleed! Moka shrieked because the wind blew her dress up and her panties were completely visible! They were pure white with a white lace waistband. I also noticed that they were slightly wedged into her amazing butt. Those cheeks were so beautiful and pretty big, not that I minded. She quickly pushed her dress down and I snapped out of my perverted thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head and her face looked like it was as red as it could be and 25% more red. \"Did...did you see?\" She asked embarrassed. I felt like our relationship wouldn't grow if I lied to her so I admitted it. \"Yeah, I did. I'm sorry Moka. I couldn't help it.\" I said with shame in my voice. She looked down blushing. \"It's ok. I guess it was gonna happen sooner or later, you seeing me in my underwear.\" She sounded so fragile so I hugged her again. She liked that and signed in relaxation. \"Thank you, (name). You really are a good boyfriend, albeit perverted.\" She said. I couldn't help but laugh at that. She giggle as well. We finished up dinner and I saw that it was midnight from my watch. \"Thanks for dinner Moka. I really want to do this again sometime. I'll see you tomorrow.\" As I headed towards the door, she grabbed my arm. \"Wait, (name)! Can you stay with me tonight, please?\" She looked so cute. I wanted to stay with her, I really did. It was always my fantasy to share a bed with a beautiful girl, but I was afraid we'd be caught. \"But what if someone finds us?\" I asked, nervously. \"Don't worry, (name). No one will find you here. Now come to bed.\" She ordered. I kinda liked this side of her. I headed toward to the bed and saw Moka getting into the bathroom, I guess to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took of my shirt and pants, now clad in only my boxers. I sat down on her bed and it was really soft. I heard the bathroom door open and I saw Moka. I almost had another nose bleed! Moka removed her dress and replaced it with a silver night gown that went down to her mid-thighs. It revealed a lot of her breasts. She looked so gorgeous! She blushed not only by me looking at her, but from looking at me, in my almost naked state. It was my turn to blush.\"You look great, Moka.\" I blurted out. \"Thank you.\" She said. We both got underneath the covers of the bed and snuggled next to each other. I felt her arms wrap around me wen I had my back turned. It was nice, not to mention that I could feel her breasts press against my back. I could feel myself get hard, so I tried to control myself. \"Goodnight Moka,\" I said. \"Goodnight (name). Sweet dreams.\" After that, we both went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up at around six in the morning, yet I felt more rested than I've been in years. It's probably becaus there was an extremely beautiful woman laying next to me. I turned to see Moka facing toward me still sound asleep. She looked do cute and peaceful like that. For the next few minutes I just stated at her, admiring her beauty. Vampire or not, I don't want to let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka stirred a little an opened her ruby eyes. She smiled and started to get up. \"Good morning, (name).\" She said, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. \"Good morning beautiful.\" I replied as I kissed  her forehead. She blushed and returned the favor by kissing me on the lips. We made out for about a minute before taking a break for air. \"Last night was amazing,\" I commented. Moka nodded her head. \"Yeah it was. We have to do it again some time.\" \"Definately.\" I replied. I noticed that school was going to start soon. \"I should probably get back to my dorm. Class is gonna start soon.\" \"Ok\" Moka reluctantly agrees. I put on my clothes and plant a kiss on Moka's lips. \"I'll see you at school, Moka.\" She smiled and says, \"See you later, handsome.\" With that, I walk out if her room and and head towards mine to get ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be my first full day of school here at Yokai. The first few classes were boring, aside from the part where I got Moka as a classmate in this cat lady's class. That made my day. It was now lunch and I was Looking foreword to it. Moka approached me from behind and said cheerfully, \"Hey, (name)! How was class?\" \"Boring.\" I answered honestly. Moka looked at me and started laughing. \"Come on! It wasn't that bad.\" Usually I'd me mad at someone for laughing at me, but I made an exception to Moka. \"Hey, you wanna meet my friends?\" Moka asked. I was actually eager to meet her friends and other fellow monsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the cafeteria, Moka spotted a table with a teenage boy with brown hair, an extremely busty girl with blue hair and a little girl with a witch hat on. Moka led me to the table. \"Hey guys!\" Moka greeted. The brown haired buy smiled and replied, \"hey Moka! Who's this?\" He gestured to me. They all seemed pretty nice. \"I'm (name). It's nice to meet all of you.\" I shook the boy's hand. \"It's good to meet you to. I'm Tsukune.\" The boy replied. \"I'm Kurumu, Tuskune's girlfriend!\" The blue-haired girl spoke cheerfully. I tried not to stare at her huge boobs in front of Moka. They were huge! I didn't even know they can get that big! Then the little brown-haired girl in the witch hat spoke. \"Hi, (name)! I'm Yukari, and that's Mizore.\" I didn't k is who she was talking about until she pointed to a column near our table and I saw a girl with light purple hair just half hiding behind the column. She was there the whole time?! I was a little creeped out by this chick. She came out and she looked kinda cute. \"Hi there,\" Mizore said in a monotone voice. I smiled and said, \"Hi. Nice to meet you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu walked up to me and observed me for a second. I was a little creeped out. \"So, your the new student I heard about?\" Kurumu asked me. \"Uh, yeah. That's me.\" I replied. I could've sworn her boobs were rubbing up against my chest! Naturally that didn't make Moka very happy. I could feel her anger from where I was. \"Kurumu, if you value your life, you'll get your udders off of my boyfriend!\" Kurumu looked pissed at her breasts being referred to as udders. She was about to counter, until a voice outside of the group shouted, \"BOYFRIEND?!\" We all turned around to see.....</span></div></div>",

She had orange hair ties in two large pigtails and bright green eyes. She was wearing her school uniform, which was a pleated skirt with a red sweater vest. Oddly enough, she had a funny looking bat on her right shoulder. The entire time, she stated at me like she wanted to kill me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this I hear about a boyfriend, big sister,\" the girl said to Moka. Wait, did she say BIG SISTER?! I turned to Moka. \"Wait, she's your sister?\" I asked her. She nodded and sighed. \"Yes, this is my younger sister Kokoa. And yes Kokoa, (name) right here is my boyfriend.\" Moka gestured to me. Kokoa didn't look too pleased. In fact, she looked even more pissed! \"No! I won't allow this lowlife to be your boyfriend! He's not worthy enough.!\" That kinda hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka now shot her an angry glare. \"And just how do you know that he's not worthy to be with me?!\" Moka asked, pissed. \"I can smell him from here and I can already tell that he's not a vampire like us! No one but a vampire can be with a vampire!\" Kokoa retaliated. The bat then flew toward me. \"Well said Miss Kokoa! He doesn't look like anything special. Whee!\" It spoke. I didn't even know bats could talk! Moka swatted the bat away. \"Look Kokoa, you have no business in my personal life. And I don't need your permission to date anybody. Besides, I don't care that (name) isn't a vampire. He cares for me and that's all I care about.\" She smiled at me when she said this and I smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa had a look of disbelief on her face. I got a feeling this is going nowhere good! \"That's it! Ko! Lets show my sister that this creep is too much of a weakling to be a vampire's boyfriend!\" She grabbed the bat and the creature somehow turned into a giant mace with huge spikes! What the hell?! Before I knew it, this crazy girl was charging at me! \"Kokoa, don't!\" Moka yelled. I could tell she was worried about me. Kokoa made a battle cry while swinging the mace at me. Before the mace could make contact with my face and do some serious damage.......</span></div></div>",

I ripped the mace from her hands and threw it at an empty spot in the cafeteria. Once it hit the floor, it turned back into the bat.

I didn't want to answer her that question. \"That's none of your business. And don't ever do something like that again!\" I warned.

I kinda got uncomfortable. I never got praised for doing something like that before.People just look at me like i'm a freak, which technically I am. \"Ah, it was nothing. Really.\" I replied modestly. Then Mizore came up from behind me, creepily. \"Not many people can stand up to one of Kokoa's blows like that. Just what kind of monster are you anyway?\" I really didn't want other people to find out what I was. \"Well, I want to keep that a secret ok?\" The group was confused at my saying, but the nodded in respect of my privacy.

I can tell just by looking at him that he was nothing but a bully. I hate bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey new guy! I bet you think you're all hot shit because you stood up to a little girl, huh?\" The guy says. I have to admit, that made me a little angry, but it did sound kinds stupid now that I think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Moka wasn't amused. \"Beat it, Saizo! You have no right to talk about my boyfriend like that! Or rather, would to like me to show you your place again?\" Moka threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to amuse Saizo. \"What? Your boyfriend can't stand up for himself? What a pussy!\" He taunted. I really didn't like to be called that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, loser.\" I said steadily. Saizo's face was unreadable. I think I hit a nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you just fuckin' say to me, you little shit?!\" Saizo screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept my cool, unlike him. \"I said fuck off. I'm just trying to have a good time with my girlfriend an I'd appreciate it if you stop trying to screw with us.\" I reasoned. Moka smiled at me proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Moka. Lets go.\" I took her arm and turned us around away from the brute. I was an idiot to think it would be that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind me I heard strange sounds. I then felt a large shadow linger over me. I turned around and I saw instea of Saizo, a giant muscular beast thing. I got a little nervous then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the beast spoke. \"No one talks to me that way! I don't care if your girlfriends a vampire! I'm gonna crush you! Maybe then you'll know not to fuck with an Orc!\" The voice wa demonic and intimidating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge Orc then charged at us, planning to pound both of us into the dirt. \"Moka, lokk out!\" I quickly react and push Moka out if the way, and the beast came plummeting down to my position. Luckily me only landed a few inches in front of me, but it sent me flying as a result. I landed 20 feet away from the Orc roughly on my back and rubble flew everywhere from the impact Saizo made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka, who was on the ground a few feet from where I previously was, grew concerned of my well-being. \"(Name)!\" She shouted in concern. That is, until a stray piece of stone struck in the head and she fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka!\" I yelled. My beautiful goddes of a girlfriend lay injured in front of me. Now I was pissed. If this bastard wants a fight, I'll give him a fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the said Orc was laughing in triumph. \"How pathetic! I guess she's gotten soft after all this time!\" No one insults the people I care about, especially my girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks to me and raises his left arm. \"So what're you gonna do about it, ya puss-\" He never got to finish his sentence as I stopped his arm from slamming into me with my right arm. I looked up at him angrily, and said, \"Dont call me that.\" I said this in a low voice with venom in every word. He looked a little scared when I said this to him, as he should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw his arm back and uppercutted his jaw with my left fist. This sen him flying about 20 feet. Before I could think that the fight was over already, he quickly and clumsily got back up. \"What? You think I can't take a hit?\" He said confidently. I cracked my knuckles and readied for round 2. \"You're gonna pay for what you did to Moka.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after I said this, I charged at him with at high speed. He tore a large tree oht of the ground and threw it at me. i managed to dodge it by jumping over it. I game him a swift right punch to the face, stunning him. He tried to attack me with his clawed right hand, but I dodged and countered with a left roundhouse kick. This drive him back a couple of inches. After a few hits, he seemed to be staggering. I gotta admit, he lasted longer than any of my other fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this had to end. I sprinted at Saizo, letting out a battle cry while doing so. I leaned up in front of the brute and gave him a right snap kick straight to the face. He went down in a matter of seconds. I was so glad that the fight was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This fight lasted about 123 seconds! Whee!\" A vice said out of no where. I recognized the voice of Kokoa' bat. I looked around for it but I just shrugged. That was not important right now. What was important was making sure Moka was ok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could walk over to her, I felt a huge hand wrap around my throat. I couldn't breathe. I saw that Saizo had woken up and started to strangle me. He picked me up and pinned me into a tree. He then landed a vicious lunch to my gut. This knocked the wind out of me. He then hit me in the face, bloodying my lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept punching me for a whole minute. My shirt was torn, my torso had bruises all over, I had blood coming out of my mouth, and my right eye was blackened. He let off for a minute and began to strangle me again. \"You think you're so tough huh? I hope you thought about what you want on your tombstone, 'cause that's all that's gonna be left of you!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point I was outmatched. I felt my life ebb away from me more and more. I then look into his eyes and his were filled with shock. I could see in my reflection that my eyes had turned yellow. \"I'm sorry mom,\" I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when I was about to lose control, a foot came crashing into Saizo's head. He flew back toward the cliff and he dropped me. I gasped for air. I looked up and saw that Mona ha awakened, her head a little bloodied an she looked pissed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've signed your death warrant when you hurt him, Saizo! Know your place!\" She shouted in passion. She charged at him and kicked him square in th face, sending him flying off the cliff and into the red ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Moka was finished, she ran toward me. I could feel my eyes returning to normal. She hugged me when she got close enough. \"(Name), are you okay?\" She asked sympathetically. I have her a confused look. \"I should be asking you that! I thought you were seriously hurt! Blood was coming out of your head!\" I said worryingly. She only smiled and hugged me again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes more than that to hurt a vampire.\" She said confidently. This made me a little less worried and I have into her embrace, enjoying her soft touch and sweet smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eyes,\" she started. This grabbed my attention. \"They're not supposed to do that, are they?\" She asked curiously. I got uncomfortable, but I answered,\" not if I can help it.\" She raised an eyebrow at my quote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you some other time, I promise. But right now, we should probably get these words treated.\" She nodded. I wrapped my arm around her shoulder and she helped me up. It hurt a little bit, but It won't be long until we get some medical attention.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLittle did I know, there was someone hiding in the trees, watching the whole thing. Someone with familiar purple hair......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to next?</span></div></div>",

I'm pretty sure that's how it should've been so I'll be doing that from now on.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Moka lending you her shoulder for support, you were both able to walk to her dorm. \"Tell me why you don't want to go to the nurse's office, (Name)?\" Moka asked you concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anyone to find out that I was fighting. I don't want to be kicked out when I just got here.\" You reply, though in a hushed voice. Probably because of your damaged chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fight wasnt your fault.\" Moka retorted. \"And don't worry. He won't be saying anything to anyone if he knows what's good for him.\" You really hit the jackpot. She cares about you greatly an was willing to keep secret for you. Maybe there's a chance you could tell her about your past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No! I can't let anyone know! I'm sorry Moka.' You thought in your head. \"Well, this is a chance to have some more alone time together. And I trust you to take care of me.\" You respond to her previous question. She blushed and nodded her head, proceeding to take you both to her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly fifteen minutes later, you got to her room and Moka laid you down in her bed. \"Just rest here, I'll get the first aid kit.\" Moka said. With that, she disappeared into the bathroom for the medicine and such. While she was away, you were doing some thinking. 'What do I do now? I promise Mom I wouldn't fight anymore, but I had to save Moka! But know she's onto me. I want to tell her. It's killing me inside keeping secrets from her. But will she understand?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted when Moka returned with some first aid supplies. You also discovered that she had changed her clothes into a loose t-shirt and denim shorts. \"I've got the first aid. And I think you'll need it now! You're nose is bleeding.\" You discover that she was right and your nose was slightly bleeding from the sight if her sexiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out a cloth and began wiping your nose. Meanwhile she was sniffing the air and looked mesmerized. Her mouth was hanging open. \"Uh Moka, are you okay?\" You ask. She blushes and asks, \"(Name), I know this isn't the best time but I can't help myself! Can I suck some of your blood, please?\" You looked at her begging and it looked really cute. You decided to comply. \"Sure, go ahead! You are my girlfriend after all,\" you answer. You extended your neck and motioned Moka to take some of your blood. She sunk her fangs into your neck and began to feed. The sensation of your blood leaving your vein was an odd one. It hurt a little when her fangs pierced your flesh but it felt good at the same time. She finished after 30 seconds of feeding. After she licked your puncture wound to seal it and began to treat your wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed some more cloth and some rubbing alcohol. She was about to tend to your wounds, but hesitated. \"Uh (Name)? I'm gonna need you to take your shirt off.\" She said quietly while blushing. You look at her with your eyebrows raised. She quickly responded, \"Because your chest is injured! Not because I want to see your naked chest! Wait! I mean...\" You quickly shushed her with your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to make out until after a few seconds, you broke the kiss and began to unbutton your shirt. \"Moka, it's ok. I knew what you meant.\" You then took your shirt off, leaving your upper body naked. Moka blushed at the sight. That made you feel good about yourself, because you usually had self-confidence issues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put some alcohol on the cloth. \"This might sting a little,\" Moka warned. You shook your head. \"Don't worry, I can take it.\" You assured her. She then pressed the cloth against one if the large bruises on your chest. The alcohol stung your injured skin. \"Ow!\" You exclaimed. \"Sorry, I told you.\" Moka apologized. \"It's alright,\" you said in pain. You calmed down and let Moka continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 30 minutes all of your wounds were cleaned and treated. Your chest wa covered in bandages and your eye had a bandage over it for your black eye. Moka was surprisingly gentle with her work. You wanted her to be your nurse all the time. And you usually hated going to the doctor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, (Name)?\" Moka asked. You grunted and then answered, \"A lot better, thanks to you. What about you?\" She shook her head. \"Don't worry about me. Vampires have amazing healing powers, so my head wound should heal soon if it hasn't already.\" She answered. She then walked to you. We should check to see if the bandages need to be changed.\" She proceeded to take the bandage off of your eye and then gasped. \"What's wrong?\" You asked concerned. \"Your eye's already healed!\" She exclaimed. She was right. You looked in the mirror to find your black eye completely healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! Well that's good.\" You said, trying to play dumb. Moka then looked at you seriously. \"(Name), what aren't you telling me? If something's wrong I can help!\" She offered. You were afraid this would happen and you didn't know how to respond. So you said the first thing that came to your head. \"It's complicated.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka didn't looked impressed with this answer. \"What's so complicated? Is it about your monster form?\" She hit it right on. You only nodded your head in response. \"I promised my mom that I wouldn't go into that form while I'm here. It's too dangerous.\" Moka got more concerned. \"Dangerous for who?\" She asked. \"Everyone.\" You bluntly said. \"Every time I fought in my life, I lost control and turned into my monster form. I hurt people as a result. I constantly had to move schools because of it. I thought I could have a fresh start here. But it looks like trouble follows me everywhere I go. I'm just glad you intervened because if I lost control, I would've destroyed the whole school.\" Moka listened intently as you explained your past. You felt so ashamed with sharing your violent past. She walked up to you and hugged you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, (Name). I'll do my best to help you control your other form. I dot care what you are. I love you and nothing's gonna change that.\" She said comfortingly. You felt like crying with her kind words. \"Oh Moka, I love you too!\" You said before securing your lips onto hers. You passionately kissed her, showing her all of your love. You felt like you could trust her with anything! Someday you will tell her everything, but for now you just wanted to be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings started to get intense, especially when you unconsciously grabbed her breasts! Moka moaned at your touch. They felt so soft in your hands! \"(Name)! Your hands!\" You looked down at your hands and quickly pulled them away! \"I'm sorry Moka!\" She looked like she didn't mind. \"I don't mind, (Name). You're a boy and you have your needs. I have mine too.\" She stared at you with a lustful look. You realized that this might escalate to losing your virginity! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your first argument with a girlfriend. How exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Your are infinitely beautiful! I'm just saying that we just got into a relationship. We shouldn't go right into...that stage just yet.\" This seemed to calm down after that. \"You're right, (Name). Sorry.\" She apologized. You shake your head. \"It's alright.\" You hug her and give her a quick kiss on the cheek. She blushed and then returned the hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out the window and saw that the sun was going down. \"It's gonna be dark out soon. I better get going.\" You say getting up from Moka's bed. She grabs you by the shoulders and sits you back on the bed. \"I don't think so! You just took a serious beating! You're in no condition to walk on your own.\" Moka argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you knew that most if your injuries have healed already. You were about to interject, but Moka raised her hand. \"No buts! You're staying here with me tonight.\" You then realized the real reason why she wanted you to stay. So you merely said, \"Okay,\" and winked at her. She blushed and went to the bathroom to change junto a pink night gown she picked out. After she had changed and you had undressed to only your boxers, you both climbed under her covers and went to sleep in each others arms.</span></div></div>",

After a second, you realized that Moka was not in the bed. You wondered where she could be, then you heard water running. The smell of fresh herbs filled the air. You saw that Mika's clothes were all over the floor. You realized that Moka was bathing. You figured she was gonna be in there for a while, so you went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, you woke up to the sounds of the door opening. Most if your head was under the covers, but saw Moka as she came out of the bathroom. You were close to having a nose bleed as you saw Moka using a towel to dry her hair, naked! All of her creamy alabaster skin was Exposed. Her breasts were even larger than you thought! at least double D's! Her butt however was by far your most favorite part, ad it looked like a large, ripe peach! her glorious cheeks jiggled with each step along woth her amazing breasts.She went over to her drawers, not unaware that you were watching her the while time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens a drawer and takes out a pair of white Cotton panties. You were a little disappointed as you were enjoying the sight of her naked behind. She puts on the panties but then groaned. You saw that the panties were really wedged in between her butt cheeks. Both cheeks were almost completely exposed. She took them off and examined them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder these things have been riding up so bad!\" Moka said to herself. \"They're two sized two small!\" It wasnt a suprise, judging by the huge wedgie she was just sporting. \"I guess I must've had a growth spurt since last year.\" She continues staying to herself. She hesitated but then put the small panties back on, or rather in, her plump behind. She reached behind with her index fingers and attempted to pull out the Cotten from between her cheeks. She only covered about 3/4 of her butt with the whole back of the panty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should go to th school store and see if they have any in a bigger size. I'd hate to continue walking around with a wedgie all day. And I don't think (Name) would find that attractive.\" She reasons, talking to no one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't be more wrong.

She turned around and saw you staring at her with a lecherous look in your eyes. She shrieks and picks up her towel to cover herself. \"Don't look a me, you pervert!\" She yells. You quickly turns around to save her some more embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe composed herself, not turning to face you. \"How long we're you watching?\" She asked calmly. You felt bad and answers honestly. \"Since you came out of the bathroom.\" You couldn't see we face, but you heard weeping. She was crying. \"I'm so embarrassed.\" Moka cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated it when she cried. You went up from behind her and hugged her. Her crying ceased for a second. \"Please don't cry Moka. I'm sorry I was being a perv. But I want you to know that there's nothing to be embarrassed about. Everything about you is beautiful.\" You said in a comforting voice. Now her crying stopped completely and she turned to face you. Her eyes were slightly more red than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"You're a good boyfriend, (Name). Albeit pererted. I mean, who stares at a girl while they have a wedgie?\" She laughed. You laughed with her. \"Me obviously.\" You answered. \"It's kinda been my thing for a long time.\" You confessed with a blush.

You both laughed. It was good to see her laugh and smile again. \"Well I still need to get new underwear today.\" She says, getting up toward the bathroom. \"But for now..\" She starts, right before she hikes up her panties in front of you. She wedged them up her butt on purpose to mess with you. Your nose bled a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some of this?\" She asks seductively, while rubbing her butt in front of you. You nodded your was like a dog wanting a treat. She evily smirked. \"Well you can't! Not until later in our relationship!\" She says before bursting out laughing. You felt deflated. \"Don't mope! You wanted to wait longer. So we will\" you remember your conversation last night and cursed yourself for saying that. \"You should control your little, or should I say BIG friend.\" She said pointing to your crotch. You looked at the huge erection you were sporting and blushed. She laughed and went into the bathroom with a change of cloths to dress for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got ready, she snacked in a little bit of your blood and both of you were ready to start the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to next?</span></div></div>",

She turned to the taller black-haired guy. \"Gin,what are you doing here? I thought you would be peeping up girls' skirts by now?\" She said tauntingly. The guy, Gin, smirked an replied, \"Nah. I thought I would hang out with my fellow club members.\" He turned to you and stretched out his hand. \"I'm Gin. The president if the newspaper club.\" You shook his hand. \"And resident pervert.\" Kurumu added. Gin turned to her and retorted, \"Hey!\" The whole table laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm (Name). I'm new around here.\" You presented yourself.  \"Pleased to meet you,\" Gin responded. \"You know, we're always looking for new member of the newspaper club. Everyone here is member, including Moka.\" You looked around and thought about his offer. It would give you an after school activity with Moka and actually friends so how could you resist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll join,\" you answered. Everyone, especially Moka was happy with your choice. She hugged you instantly. You grunted as she hugged you a little too hard. \"Are you alright, (name)?\" Moka asked, easing off on the hugging. You waved your hand. \"Yeah, just a little sore from yesterday.\" You didn't mean for that to slip out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari interjected. \"That reminds me! Are you alright?\" She asked concerned. Suddenly, everyone's face turned serious. Do they know? \"Yeah. Why would you guys ask that?\" You ask. Kurumu then said, \"We heard about your fight with Saizo yesterday.\" Damn it, they did know, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard that you kicked his butt before he started fighting dirty.\" Yukari chimed in. You looked down, feeling awkward. \"Yeah.\" You replied, wanting to forget that fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you guys find out? Did Saizo decide to mouth off?\" Moka asked. Mizore shook her head. \"I saw the whole thing.\" She answered. \"You were watching us the whole time?!\" You asked her, both creeped out and angry. Moka placed a hand on your leg. \"Don't be mad, (Name). She always does that.\" She reasoned. \"But it won't be happening ever again. Right, Mizore?!\" She threatened. The purple haired girl nodded her head in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGin stepped up. \"I asked her to tail you guys.\" Moka looked pissed. \"Why?\" She asked. Gin took a breath and said,\" Because Saizo was talking about (Name) with his buddies. He said he was gonna show him how things are around here. I got worried.\" Moka calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you really showed him! Mizore said you knocked him down in just a couple of hits.\" Tsukune notes. To started to get more uncomfortable. \"I was only trying to protect Moka. I usually try to avoid fighting.\" You state. He nods in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu chimed in this time. \"I'm just amazed that you were able to take down Saizo in his Orc form. Just what kinda monster are you, anyway?\" She asked curiously. \"Yeah, you can tell us. We won't tell a soul!\" Yukari said with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want others to know yet and said, \"I dint want to talk about it.\" Everyone looked deflated. \"It's best if you don't know.\" Now looks of confusion spread on the faces of the Newspaper club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka places a hand on your shoulder and says to the others, \"(Name) has a very dark past and he doesn't want it brought up. He wants to start fresh so we should all respect if he doesn't want to talk about it.\" You felt touched at her words. Everyone then drew smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Moka,\" Tsukune said. \"You can talk about your past if you feel you're ready for it. Either way, we'll be here for you.\" The others nod in confirmation. You felt like crying right then. \"Thank you guys. I never really had all this before.\" Kurumu raise an eyebrow. \"Respect for privacy?\" She asked. You shook your head. \"Friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked shocked at your confession. \"I've never had any friends growing up and I couldn't talk to anyone but my mom. Thank you guys.\" You say, as a tear escaped your left eye. Everyone smiled and wrapped their arms around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, the rest of the day flew by. Moka offered to tutor you in Math, which was very thoughtful and sweet if her. Sexy, sweet, beautiful, strong, AND smart? You hit the jackpot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also were officially made a member of the Newspaper Club. You were now a part of an activity with actual friends. The more time you spent at Yokai, the further your dark past was and you were fine with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know, your lucky steak was about to take a turn for the worst......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to from here?</span></div></div>",

You were currently sitting in another boring lecture in Miss Nekonome's class. The only thing that was getting you through the day was Moka's smiling face. You stared into her eyes across the room, just as she did into yours. Everything was going great........until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear an explosion occur somewhere on the academy grounds. The entire class was screaming and panicking in fear. You felt nervous too. You could also see slight fear in Moka's eyes. \"Everyone, please calm down! Stay in your seats!\" Miss Nekonome yelled, trying to calm the students. She was unsuccessful as they left their seat and head toward the windows to see what happened. You followed suit and saw a large fire outside and a bunch of other students laying still on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe you saw the bodies, you immediately ran out the door to see if they were alright. \"(Name), wait!\" Moka called out, following you out the door. You ran through the school as fast as you could and made it outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspected the fire. It was massive, but something felt....off about it. You decided to think about it later and check on the students.  Near the giant fire were the bodies of three boys and two girls, all around your age. They lay on the ground, with their clothing burnt and torn, and limbs covered in third-degree burns. You checked the pulses of every one of them, but found nothing. You were horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five of them were dead and there was nothing you can do about it. You kneel down next to their corpses, praying that they are in a better place now. You feel a pair of arms wrap around to and recognize Moka's scent. She comforts you through this horrible sight. Neither of you say anything and take a moment to respect the now dead teenagers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you both sat in silence, a pair of figures observes the fire while staying hidden in the woods. A male  and a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we know for a fact that our message got through. And those pests who nearly discovered us are taken care of,\" the male said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, Moka Akashiya is right there! We can take her right now! She's vulnerable!\" The female insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Keito,\" the male figure scolded. \"Now is not the time. We will burn this school to the ground when the time is right. Just be patient. You'll have your revenge soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female, Keito, fumed, but nodded in understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ither students, including Moka and the others were on edge afterthe explosion. Miss Nekonome decided to give the whole class a study hall, due to the distraction that happened outside. She left shortly after to check with the othe staff about what happened. You knew exactly what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive kids around your age were just killed. Somehow, you thought it wasn't by accident. You thought very hard about the crime scene and recorded evidence, indicating what might have happened. Your thinking was interrupted by the loudspeaker sounding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention students, this is your head master speaking!\" The loudspeaker bellowed. \"I know you are all wondering about what happened. Well I regret to inform you that five of our own students have passed on.\" Gasps filled the whole room. Some students were even crying. \"They were unfortunate enough to have been the victims of an explosion caused by an unstable gas pipeline underneath where they have died.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he said this, you mutter under your breath, \"Bullshit.\" Moka and your othe friends caught you saying that and were about to say something until the headmaster continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be a memorial service for these student next week. Attendance is encouraged but I you do not wish to come, I understand. In the meantime, classes will continue as usual and students are required to stay clear of the explosion location. That is all. Continue your studies and be careful.\" With that, the loudspeaker stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Though they weren't falling for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu leaned in and said, \"You said 'bullshit' when the headmaster was explaining what happened.\" You couldn't keep up this routine forever and came clean. \"There was no gas explosion. There were no gaslines around that area.\" You declare. The others look confused. Tsukune then spoke up. \"How do you know that?\" He asked. You mindlessly said, \"there were no gas fumes coming from around the fire. And there were no pipes or anything coming out of the ground where has would've come from.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were astounded. Yukari got curious. \"How could you tell there were no gas fumes?\" You wince.  You didn't want to blurt that out, as it would give hints to your true form. \"I just have a good nose.\" You answer. That seemed to satisfy Yukari. \"But that's not important. What is important is that the headmaster lied to all of us!\" You say. \"He's trying to cover this all up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shocked the group. \"Do you think he was behind the explosion, (Name)?\" Moka sked you. You shrugged. \"I don't know. I don't think so. But I guarantee he knows more about this then he's telling us.\" Your friends' eyes widened. \"Whoa.\" Mizore stoically said. \"And that's not all.\" You continue. This grabbe their attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was by the fire, I could vaguely see two figures in the forest.\" You explain. \"Two figures?\" Mizore asked. \"Who were they?\" Kurumu asked also. You shook your head. \"I don't know. The forest was too dark to see. But I got a feeling that they had something to do with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is intense.

You came up with a plan. \"We're the newspaper club, right? We look around and try to uncover the facts. If those kids were murdered, then no one will be safe until they're caught. In the meantime, we take the headmaster's advice and be careful.

You couldn't stop thinking about those dead students. They reminded you too much of more kids whose lives ended to early. Flashes came into your head. Students lay dead at your feet, covered in bruises and lacerations. You look at your hands, covered in blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)? Are you okay?\" Asked a voice. You snapped out of your dream. You turned to see Moka with a concerned look on her face. \"Yeah, (Moka). I'm fine.\" You answer. \"I just can't stop thinking about those kids who died today.\" That wasnt a complete lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you had to see that (Name). I'm sure we'll find whoever did it and make them pay for what they've done.\" Moka says confidently. You look down. \"You're right Moka. I just can't shake the feeling that something bad is gonna happen.\" You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think whoever did this is gonna kill again?\" Moka asked. You shrug your shoulders. \"I don't know. Maybe.\" You answer. Moka then stops an puts her hands on your shoulders comfortingly. \"Listen, (Name). I don't know what's in store for us, but whatever haopens, I'll always protect you.\" Moan says bravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"That's brave of you Moka, but you know that I can handle myself.\" You say. \"But you hate fighting! What about your promise?\" Moka reasoned. \"Screw my promise! I've already broken it, and I'm glad I did. I'll do whatever I can to protect the girl I love!\" You declare. Tears welled up in Moka's eyes. \"Oh, (Name)!\" She exclaimed, before crushing her lips onto yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few mintues of making out, you two broke apart and continued to Moka's dorm. \"At least we can finally relax when we get to your place.\" You say to Moka. \"I know.\" She agrees. She says her hips in front of you, clearly intending to edge you on. \"My panties have really been riding up lately.\" She teases. You start to get hard at her actions. You walk behind her in an effort to grab her fine butt. She blocks you with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh! You said to wait further into our relationship.\" Moka teased. You almost lost it. \"Oh come on! How can I control myself with you teasing my like that?!\" You ask insanely. She giggled cutely. \"I don't know. I just do it cause it's fun!\" She answers, sticking her tongue out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you to know, someone was watching you both. Keito was a ways way, behind a tree. \"I don't care what the master says! I'm gettin my revenge now!\" She says angrily in her head. \"It's time to bring Moka Akashiya's perfect little life down hard! Staring with pretty boy there!\" Keito says behind the tree line behind you two. </span></div></div>",

You kept trying to cop a feel, not caring what she says, but she keeps stopping you. \"I don't think so, horny boy!\" She said teasingly. \"Oh come on! Just one touch? You're killin' me here!\" You beg. She laughs. \"I'll tell you what: if you master this math lesson I'm gonna help you with tonight, I'll let you give me a wedgie.\" She offers. That was enough motivation for you. \"I'll become a genius just for a chance at that!\" You say excited. Moka only laughs and shakes her head. \"What am I gonna do with you?\" She asks rhetorically. \"Love me foreve?\" You answer. \"I think that can be arranged.\" Moka says before giving you a big kiss in the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you hear a rustling in the bushes. You both turn to see a girl with long black hair and a kissed expression on her face. She looked like she wanted to kill you both. \"Moka Akashya! I've waited two years for this moment and now I'm going to destroy you!\" She yelled menacingly. You were confused, having never met this girl before. \"Uh Moka? Who the hell is this?\" You ask her. Moka looked pissed. \"Her name is Keito. Her and the School Security Commission had the academy in a tight grip of fear and Hurt countless people. A couple of years ago, she tried to kill me and the others in the Newspaper club because we searched for the truth. I beat the hell out of her, I haven't seen her since.\" Moka explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've stayed away, you bug freak! Now get away from (name) and I before I put you in your place again!\" Moka threatened. Keito smirked. \"And miss out on killing you? Not a chance!\" She retorted. There was something about this girl. Then a familiar scent hit your nose. You haven't smelled this since.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp. Moka turned to you. \"What's wrong?\" She asked. \"Moka, I don't know about this chick, but I can tell she was involved with the death of those students!\" You call out angrily. You recognized her scent as one of the two that were near the explosion location.. Moka's eyes were wide. \"Is that true, Keito?!\" She asks livid. Keito was a little shocked at your accusation. \"How could he know?!\" She asks in her  head. \"Now I have more of a reason to kill them! Master will commend me for this!\" She finishes thinking. \"Enough talk! Time to die!\" She threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Keito's form began to change drastically. You were confused at the sight. Moka then shielded you with her body. \"(Name), get out of here! I'll handle this.\" She said. You didn't move. \"Moka, I'm not going anywhere! We'll fight her together!\" You say bravely. You were filled with confidence......until you saw Keito's monster form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman Keito was Gina and in her place was a hideous spider creature with a hungry look in its eyes. You shake in fear. You absolutely hated spiders. When you were a kid, a spider almost crawled in your ear. You were traumatized by that experience. \"Uh actually, you can take this one.\" You said cowardly.  She liked confused but then drew her attention back to the giant spider in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito smirked Emily with her demonic spider mouth and charged toward Moka. She easily dodged the large creature. \"Is that all you've got? This is gonna be a disappointing fight.\" Moka said cockily. Then in a split second, Keito aim her rear toward her and shot webbing at Moka. It wrapped around her torso and trapping her arms inside.She screamed in pain and agony as the web contacted her skin. \"Moka!\" You shout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito laughed. \"Are you impressed by my acidic webbing? I've been perfecting it for over a year just for you!\" She laughs sadistically. Her only response was more screaming as the web burned her skin viciously. You couldn't stand by and watch this. It was time to face your fears and save the girl you love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka, I'm coming!\" You say as you run toward her to free her. Keito only used one of her long eight legs that were protruding out of her stomach, and knocked you away, sending you flying into a tree. This knocked you unconscious and Moka was still trapped. \"(Name)!\" She shouted in concern for her love. \"Keito you bitch! You're gonna regret that!\" Keito only tightened the webbing, causing Moka to yelp in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not!\" Keito replies. \"Your days are coming to an end, vampire! Your entire world is gonna come crashing down. After I kill you, I'm gonna kill lover boy over there and all of those friends you have at the newspaper club!\" She evily says. Moka's eyes fill with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Keito turns her head toward you. \"You just don't know when to give-\" She didn't finish her sentence as she was rendered speechless as she saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your head to reveal your menacing golden-yellow eyes. The irises and pupils are mutated into a demonic design. You snarled and revealed that you had grown fangs that looked like they could cut through steel like butter. Your hands that have been protrude out in a threatening motion have been now dined with equally sharp claws.  You were also giving off an aura like no other. Moka was shocked at your sudden transformation. \"This must be his monster form.\" She thought. \"Or at least part of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growl at Keito. \"Let me tell you something, Spider-bitch!\" You shout in anger. \"I don't know who you think you are, but no one hurts Moka and gets away with it! Your gonna pay for hurting her and for what you did to those kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keito smirked. \"You think you can take me, little boy?\" She taunted. You positioned yourself to attack. \"I'll crush you like the bug you are!\" You threaten. This set her off. \"I'm an arachnid!\" She defends, now pisse off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then charge at her with almost lightning-like speed. You land your fist right into her gut, sending her flying into the tree line. Having gained reasonable distance from the threat, you turn to your tied-down girlfriend, who was wide-eyed at what she had just seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" You ask Moka, trying to untie the acid webbing. \"Name), behind you!\" She warns. You turn around, and see Keito back for more. She rushed toward you to with the intent to skewer you both. You pick up Moka and jump at least twenty feet in the air and land a considerable distance from the spider woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set Moka down. \"Just stay here and I'll take care of her.\" You say before running at Keito. Moka shot an annoyed look at your back. \"It's not like I can go anywhere!\" She shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you and Keito, you both duke it out, her swinging her sharp eight legs at you while you swipe your claws at her. She managed to land a few cuts on your body and and one across your face, leaving a nice deep and red gash across one cheek to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito smirks at what she had accomplished, but her smile quickly disappeared. You face her and she sees that your cut on your face is slowly healing itself. Within a few seconds your face was completely healed, scarless. Her face turned white and all with of her eyes where wide. You smile and swipe at her midsection with your right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attack left three deep lacerations on her stomach. She cried out in agony as you felt some serious damage that time. You then retract your left hand and swipe at her face. She cried as the right side of her face was given three bloody marks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile  she was in disarray, you really went to work. You began to relentlessly attack her spider legs, breaking all of them and fracturing her human ones. She cried in pain. You then landed several fierce lunches to her chest and stomach, knocking the wind out of her. Meanwhile, Moka whatched as you brutally tore into the foe. \"He's so fierce! I never thought anything but a vampire could fight like this!\" She thought in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Keito was thinking while she was getting the crap beaten out of her. \"I've never encountered such strength before! Even Akashyia wasn't this fierce! What is he?!\" She pondered in her head. A split second later, you grab her by the throat and punched her in the face. You delivered blow after blow to her face. Her eyes started to blacken and her lip began to split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of continuous punches, you tightened your grip around her throat and after her up. Keito was gasping for air as you Stanford her with your left hand. A little more pressure and her head could possibly pop off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" You hear someone shout. You turn to see Moka with a fearful look on her face. \"She's had enough. Don't kill her, you won't be any better than her and her partner.\" She pleaded. You look toward Keito again. \"Don't bother us again.\" You growl. You then launch her far away from you two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then run to Moka, who was still tied up in the painful webbing. You use your claws to cut through the acidic web like it was nothing. You see that most of her clothes had burned away, leaving her undergarments exposed.  Her skin had been badly burned by the corrosive webbing. Moka hissed in pain as she was freed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a stupid question, but are you okay?\" You ask caringly. You soon returned to your human form. \"I'll be fine.\" Moka answers. \"(Name), that was amazing!\" She swoons. You blush. \"Thanks. We should probably get you inside and get your burns taken care of.\" Moka nods. You pick her up bridal style and head toward her dorm nearby.</span></div></div>",

It's some herbal lotion that's safe for vampires.\" Moka explained. \"It's supposed to heal wounds that even vampires can't heal on their own. I never thought I would need it.\" Moka scolded herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head into the bathroom and come out with the green bottle. You kiss her on the forehead. \"It never hurts to come prepared.\" You console. \"And it's not a bad thing to ask for help, either.\" Moka smiles. \"Alright, doctor.\" She teased. \"I'm trusting you to take care of me.\" She puts on a devilish smirk. You wiggle your eyebrows and focus your attention on her almost naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the slight scarring, her body looked gorgeous. The wounds were the worst on her legs, abdomen and upper chest. You could feel yourself blushing as you see Moka in just her underwear. Her white underwear that was covered in dirt and sweat. They were clinging to her body in all the right places.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna help me or are you just gonna ogle my body, you pervert?\" Moka said, slightly annoyed. You quickly snapped out of your perverted trance. \"Sorry Moka.\" You apologized. With that, you squirted some of the lotion into your hand. You put the bottle down and run the lotion into your hands. You slowly inch your hands toward her burned legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your hands made contact with her legs, she yelled in pain. \"Sorry!\" You quickly said. She shakes her head. \"It's alright. Just hurry, please. And be gentle.\" Moka replied. You nod your head and gently rub your hands up and down her legs. Her legs were so soft and smooth, despite her injuries. You run away her acid burns with hreat care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Moka was moaning, but not in pain. Her moans were filled with ecstasy. Her face was even blushing as your hand was brushing against her thigh. \"Oh (name)!\" She slipped out. She quickly shut her mouth and blushed even more red. You silently laught and finish up her legs. After a minute, her legs have been treated and have remarkably healed instantly. \"Well now that your legs have healed, it's time to move onto your stomach.\" You tell the blushing vampire. She nods her head and lays in her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered your hands with some more lotion and took them to her burned belly. The cool lotion caused her to shiver. She then continue to moan to your touch. You took this opportunity to admire how cute she looked. While you were looking, your hands slipped down to her ribs. She bolted up and gasped. \"Moka, what's wrong?\" You ask her in concern. \"Nothing.\" She responds. You think back and remember that she slightly laughed at you touching her ribs. \"Oh what's this? Does the powerful vampire have a ticklish spot?\" You teased. Moka blushed. \"Shut up.\" She says. You laugh and continue to tend to her burns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had finished, you moved into the final part: her chest. The burns weren't that bad, but they had gone from her collar bone all the way down to the tops of her breasts. You blush at the sight of her luscious breats barely contained by her damaged bra. You snap out of your trance and reluctantly go to apply the lotion to her final burn mark. You gently greased your hands against her collar bone and rubbed the burn out of her skin. It was when you got to her breasts when things started to get excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you touched her breasts, she cried out in pleasure. \"Oh!\" She gasped. Her face was as red as it could get and her eyes were filled with lust. You quickly went to work on her wound and get her better. Your massaging led to more of her passion filled moans. When you were finished, you smile and sigh in satisfaction. \"Well now that that's done, we should get you dress-\" you start to say but was interrupted by Moka pinning you down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were filled with list and her face was flushed. She was breathing heavily and stared at you with her beautiful red eyes. \"Uh Moka, what are you doing?\" You ask. She pants. \"(Name), I can't take it anymore! I need you now! I need you to please me! Make me a woman!\" She begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

While passionately kissing, your hands went to work in exploring Moka's body. Your fingertips grazed at her back from top to bottom. When you got to her lower back, she moaned in the kiss. You had just found another one of her sensitive spots. You note that for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your hands went lower, down to Moka's amazing butt. You grasp at her cheeks, your hands taking in as much of her booty as possible, but there was so much to grab. She moans in exstacy as you knead her butt cheeks together. You then went to the waistband of her underwear. Being the pervert you were, you couldn't resist giving into your odd fetish and giving the waistband a slow tug upward, sending her underpants into her butt crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breaks the kiss and moans out loud. \"Did you like that, Moka?\" You ask to be sure of how she felt about wedgies. You didn't want to do anything that made her uncomfortable. Moka blushed at the feeling of the wedgie in her butt. \"Actually, it felt kind of good.\" She admitted. \"My underwear was rubbing against my butt crack and moving into my pussy. You can keep it up if you want.\" She says. You nod and continue to give short tugs to her panties, which caused her to moan. While you were giving Moka a nice sensual wedgie, your hands were also focused on her beautiful rump. You massaged the perfect globes of fat and muscle in your hands. You can tell Moka was loving this, by the sounds she was making, and by the wetness coming from her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of arousal, you had never been more horny than right now. Your erect penis was poking through your pants and touching Moka's leg. She noticed this and got a naughty smirk on her face. \"Oh! It looks like someone wants to play with us.\" She teased. She reached for your belt and brought your pants and underwear down, exposing your boner. She gasped at the sight of it. You started to get nervous. You were always a little insecure about yourself, the main reason why you Never  got a girlfriend before.  \"Is everything alright Moka? I'm sorry if it's not much...\" You start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so big! I'm not even sure if that things gonna fit inside me!\" She gasps. You blush at her compliment. Moka then brought her face near your throbbing cock and gave it a light lick. You groaned at this sensation. She saw your reaction and decided to continue. She kicked the tip of your cock, which was dripping in precum. \"Mm mm! Salty, but tasty. Almost as tasty as your blood.\" She commented. She then went to work on your shaft, sticking the entire thing in her mouth and sucking it up and down. He tongue did its best to wrap itself around your cock as she gave you head. \"This feels so amazing! Her mouth is so warm and wet!\" You screm inside your head. You've always dreamed of getting s blowjob from a girl, but never imagined it being this good! After a few nineties, you couldn't take it anymore and you blew your load inside her mouth. Moka was shocked, but did her best to gulp down every last drop of your seed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wee marveled at how sexy Moka was right now. A little of your cum was dripping from her lips as she got off of your dick. She swiped it with her finger and licked it clean. \"Yummy.\" She simply said. She then reached back to pick her wedgie, knowing it would turn you on. \"Now, I think that's enough foreplay. Now comes the fun part.\" She said. You couldn't agree more, but then a thought popped in your head. \"Wait!\" You said. You went into your pants and reached for your wallet. From j side, you pulled out a couple of condoms. You looked toward Moka who had a smile on her face. \"My mom gave me these as a joke before I left. I never thought I'd need them.\" You said. You opened the condom and slipped it in your re-erected penis. \"Let's get started.\" You say, wrapping your arms around her and kissing her square on lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both were planted on the bed with Moka on top, kissing you passionately. You then broke the kiss to remove Moka's panties. You were both arlused and amazed to be greeted with the sight of her glistening pussy, giving off a tremendous amount of heat and was dripping wet. She blushed at the sight of you staring at her in such a way. \"Sorry, for staring. It's just that you're so beautiful.\" You say. She shakes her head. \"It's alright.\" She responds. She then lowers her exposed womanhood onto your hardened cock and you slip yourself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps in pain. \"Are you okay?\" You ask in concern. She grunts. \"I'm alright. Just take it slow, ok?\" You nod. You the put your  hands on her hips and stared to hump yourself into her womb. Her blushed face was almost too cute to keep going but you still kept your pace until you hit her hymen. You stop to face Moka. \"This is gonna hurt. Are you sure you want to do this?\" You ask. She nods. \"Of course. I love you, (name). And I want to share this moment with you.\" You nod and quickly push yourself in, breaking her hymen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small amount of blood seeped out of her snatch and she was screaming in pain. You stopped out of concern for Moka but she tightened her grip around your body. \"I'm ok. Keep going.\" She begged. You nod and proceeded to move in and out of her wonderful vagina. In no time, the pain disappeared from her face and was replaced with  Ecstacy.  She bounced herself on top of you like a cowgirl. To stimulate her even more, you delivered a few spanks to her bubble butt. She squealed in pleasure. \"Oh yes! Give me more, (name)! I've been such a naughty girl!\" She screamed in pleasure. You couldn't believe how sexy she was. You discovered that she had a bit of a masochistic  side, and you liked that. You kept spanking her as you fucked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, (name)! You're a beast! Give me more! I need more!\" She said in euphoria. More huh? You thought. You the wrapped your arms around her and brought her to the bed, with you on top of her. She gasped in surprise at your boldness. You then ripped  off her burnt bra and exposed her gorgeous breasts. They were even bigger than you thought! Her cute pink little nipples were erect with the excitement Moka was experiencing. You couldn't help but grope her boobs and pinch her nipples. She quelled in pleasure as you played with her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then continued to fuck her as you played with her amazing tits. You kept this process going for a good fifteen minutes. At that point, you couldn't take it anymore and realized your load into the condom while Moka screamed as she achieved her orgasm. Now both tired and sweaty, you collapsed on the bed, breathing heavily. You smiled as each other and pulled the covers over your naked bodies. You kissed Moka in the lips. \"Goodnight my beloved vampire.\" You say romantically. She smiles and blushes. \"Goodnight, my handsome mate.\" With that, you both went to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your clan was the greatest group of warrior the earth had ever seen. You were the strongest member of the clan to ever exist, thanks to your powers of chaos. Even though you were grateful for your powers, you began to wonder if there would ever be a place where you could feel like you belonged. You had swore to avenge your clan\u2019s demise at the hands of the Master and his Ten Terrors, and until that time, you would not return to the Uchiha Clan\u2019s grounds, and you lived the life of a nomad. But one day, your nomadic lifestyle came to an end. As you were walking along the side of the road, a bus pulled up to you and the driver opened the door. <span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cSasuke Uchiha?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah?\u201d</span> you asked in your usual cool and collected tone. \u201c<span class=\"cbrown\">I have been assigned to take you to Youkai Academy.

Soon the man had drove you through a tunnel which you could tell lead to an area protected by some kind of barrier. The driver stopped and said as you got out <span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cWelcome to your new home Sasuke. I should tell you, you are going to be the only human here.\u201d</span> he said as he drove off. You knew he was right, just the feel of this place wasn\u2019t human. You then made your way to the academy using Chaos Control. You saw the building and you went inside, knowing that this is the beginning of your new life. </span></div></div>",

When she got to the location of the light, she saw you standing there with the top part of your outfit hanging down, but it was still on your body, you just took your arms out of the sleeves and let it hang from the back. Moka decided to watch for a moment. In a moment, a large number of leaves fell from the trees. She then noticed that you created some sort of lightning blade in your right hand. You then waved your hand and a large number of needles made of lightning fired towards the leaves, destroying every single one.

But before he could connect his attack, someone showed up and landed a very powerful kick to Blackheart\u2019s stomach, which ended up sending him through many, many trees.

Moka and Ms. Nekonome followed you. Once you came your way to a clearing which you thought would be good enough. You called upon the power of earth. You then sent a massive amount of chakra into your hands, enough that Moka and Ms. Nekonome could see it. You then slammed your hands down onto the ground and in that moment, the energy began to outline into some kind of small castle. Once the outline was complete, the outline turned into an actual small castle. Moka and Ms. Nekonome were amazed at your power. But one it was finished, you fell onto the ground and Moka ran up to you to see if you were alright. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m fine Moka. I just used up a massive amount of chakra.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cMs. Nekonome, I request that Sasuke and I  both stay in this castle.\u201d</span> She thought about it for a moment and looked at you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis place has a barrier over it so Blackheart can\u2019t get in. I will place a similar barrier over the rest of the student dorms the instant I get my strength back.\u201d</span> In the end, she agreed and left the two of you to settle in to your new dorm. <br>\r\nOnce Ms. Nekonome had left, Moka got under your arm and helped you inside. Once there, Moka was surprised at how much was in there. There were multiple weapons on the wall, mainly Kunai and many large shuriken; the Demon Wind Shuriken, otherwise known as the Windmill of Shadows. The mark of the Uchiha clan rested at the top of the stairs. She was impressed with the place, and even more impressed that you had the power to create a place like this. You then told her that there was an herbal bath in the castle as well. You created a small bat out of your chakra and you told her that if she wanted to use the bath, she just needed to follow the bat. You let her have the bath this evening, and she accepted your offer. Later on that night, she saw that you were sleeping against the wall with your sword in hand. She smiled and placed a sheet over you before she got into the bed herself. She fell asleep shortly after that.</span></div></div>",

But then, a massive number of kunai made of lightning came out of nowhere and went right through him. He ended up firing a small blast at Moka.

She saw you standing on the very tip of the tree and holding Moka in your arms. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSasuke.\u201d</span> She noticed that you looked very different. Your hair was silver in color and you had a golden aura around you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, Moka.\u201d</span> Moka just hugged you for being alright.

The amount of chakra that was present made the air seem much heavier. Blackheart was the first to make an attack towards you. You managed to avoid his attack just by moving your head to the side. He continued his attack with a flurry of claw attacks, but you managed to avoid each of them. Blackheart then slammed you with his tail and you were sent towards the ground. You landed on your hands and feet and looked at Blackheart who fired a massive number of energy blasts at you. You managed to avoid them by flipping backwards.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cSasuke\u2026he his avoiding Blackheart with minimal effort.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cIs that good?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHe Hasn\u2019t even begun to show us his power.

You avoided this by ducking at the very last second causing Blackheart\u2019s hand to get stuck in the wall. You then focused your chakra into your hands and hit him with your gentle fist attacks. It temporarily messed up his chakra network. But his rage fixed that problem as he sent a powerful blast into the wall, destroying it and the instant he turned around, he was hit by a much more powerful version of you Chidori Senbon. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s the way Sasuke!\u201d</span> <b><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYou fools, this changes nothing!\u201d</span></b> he said as he was getting ready to heal.

You then called on a massive amount of chakra. You then yelled as you thrusted both of your hands forward <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cChaos Blast</span>!\u201d And in that moment, a massive blast of energy came from your hands and ended up shredding the shirt and cloak on your back. The two blasts collided and the force from the two was incredible, enough to pull some of the trees from their roots. The two of you were in a dead heat and Moka knew she had to do something. She made a mad dash towards you and grabbed onto your shoulders. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMoka!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou are not doing this alone!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThis battle is between Blackheart and myself.

You remember seeing a beautiful woman with red eyes and silver hair in the vision. She also had amazing speed and power. All you knew was that you need to find this woman. You walked through the forest for hours and found nothing. Soon you ened up finding a tunnel. Just as you got to the tunnel, a bus pulled up and the driver said to you \"Are you Sasuke Uchiha?\" You nodded. \"Get in. I am here to take you to Youkai Acadamy.\" he said. You knew that the woman you were looking for had to be there. So you got in the bus and he drove you through the tunnel.As he was driving, he said \"That is an interesting armor you are wearing. You make that yourself?\" You just nodded. \"I see you have something on your mind. Maybe I can help.\" You looked at the driver and told him about the vision you had.\"I see\" he said. \"Looks like you have a certain someone who has eyes for you. And the way you described her, I'd say she is a....\" he gets cut off by you saying <span class=\"cblue\">\"Vampire?\" </span>He was surprised at your knowledge, but soon you arrived at the bus stop near Youkai Acadamy. You got off and continued your search. You soon found yourself at a small pond in the middle of the forest. You just enjoyed the scenery for a while until you heard someone speak to you<span class=\"cred\">.\"At last we meet. You must be Sasukue Uchiha.\" </span>You turned and saw the woman from the vision. You looked at her and said <span class=\"cblue\">\"I need to confirm that you have the speed and power from my dream. You ok with that?\" </span>The woman looked at you and nodded. You then made a swipe with your arm while yelling <span class=\"cblue\">\"CHAOS SPEAR!\" </span>A large number of energy spear came at the woman and she dodged them with lightning speed. You lost track with your eyes, but you used your ears to listen for her next move. Just then you heard something move towards you. You put your arm up and blocked a very powerful kick. You never lost your footing, but you did slide a little bit. You then turned to the woman and said. <span class=\"cblue\">\"So you are the one from my vision. I'm pleased to meet you.\" </span>She walked over to you and said <span class=\"cred\">\"The feeling is mutual. My name is Moka Akashiya.\" </span>You smiled and then she....</span></div></div>",

How do you have this blood?\" </span>You looked at her. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I was born with the power of the chaos emeralds. Their power runs through my blood, giving it the taste you love.\" </span>You then took a walk with her to the acadamy. Along the way, you and Moka-san had a nice little talk. You had no idea at how much you meant to Moka-san. Soon, you both arrived at the acadamy. The two of you were in the same classes and you were pleased. The first class was P.E. You and Moka-san went down to the gym. You wore your armor and she wore her gym clothes. Today was dodgeball. It was going to be a normal match until you said to the teacher <span class=\"cblue\">\"I wish for all of them to be against me. I need a challenge.\"</span> Moka-san and the teacher were surprised at first, but in the end you got your wish. So everyone but you went to one side of the room and all got in a position to attack. You just stood there keeping your cool and the game began. They began to throw every single dodgeball at you and you dodged all of them with no trouble. You then picked one up and jumped high into the air. You threw the ball and it began to hit every single person on the other side of the gym. Then it hit the wall and was headed for Moka-san. You used your incredible speed to get in front of the ball and catch it with one hand. Moka-san was very impressed.

The teacher broke the silence. <span class=\"cbrown\">\u201cOkay then. Why don\u2019t you have a seat in front of Ms. Akashiya?\u201d</span> You remains silent and walked over to the open desk in front of a girl reading some sort of martial arts book. You took your seat and listened to each rule. The one that caught your attention was the one where if a human enters the school, that human would be killed on the spot. Even though you could fool them with the second state transformation, you needed to be on your guard around here. Once class was done, the rest of the day was just being introduced to the other teacher. But the entire time, you knew someone was observing you carefully. For the time being you let it go. Once the day was done, you decided to go to the roof and get a view of the place.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t take you more than five seconds to catch up to them. You decided to keep pace with them so you wouldn\u2019t humiliate them. Just when you were coming at the final stretch, you increased your speed and won the race. After that, it was a game of dodge ball. You, Tsukune, Kurumu, Mizore, Yukari and the two Moka\u2019s were on the same team. But you were facing a team that was ruthless. Mizore didn\u2019t give too much effort due to the fact she could melt. Kurumu and Yukari\u2019s constant bickering got them out. Tsukune put up a good effort, but he got hit as well. <i>\u201cAlright guys, I say we take out the vampires!\u201d</i> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cBring it on.\u201d</span> <i>\u201cAs you wish!\u201d </i>he said as he threw a couple of dodge balls at them with a large amount of power behind them. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d</span> you said as you caught both of them. <i>\u201cWhat the? Take him out!\u201d</i> The rest of the team threw the dodge balls at you as hard as they could and you blocked them all with the balls in your hand.

You are here as an exchange student.  Your father is the foremost expert on folklore and occult matters at a large university in Japan.  He is a well connected person.  You didn't know how well connected until he informed you that a good friend of his, the head of a special school wanted to start an exchange program.  He then went on to explain that the school was for monsters.  You didn't quite believe him, but you did know that your dad has been involved with so strange stuff.  After thinking about it you decided that going to a school for monsters might be a once in a life time experience, so you let your father make all the arrangements.  You had the weirdest bus ride there.  The bus driver was really creepy.  You were having second thoughts about it, but when you arrived you were greeted by your fathers friend, the Headmaster.  He explained not to let on to the other students and teachers that you were human.  Only he and his hot assistant Ruby would know you weren't a monster.  After headmaster finishes giving you the guidelines and rules he leaves you alone in the office with Ruby.  You can't help but look her up and down.  She catches you doing so and smiles.  You look into her eyes and turn beat red.  This makes her smile bigger.  She then says.  <span class=\"clred\">\"So, later on would you like me to introduce you to some of your classmates?\"  </span><span class=\"cblue\">\"Um sure. That would be cool.\"</span>  You reply, glad she broke the awkward silence.  <span class=\"clred\">\"Good,  meet at the bell tower in about an hour.

You go to a water fountain to get yourself a drink.  As you raise your head from the fountain you catch a glimpse at the most beautiful girl you have ever seen.  She has bluish hair and her massive breasts are stretching her yellow sweater to the point of almost ripping.  She looks over at you staring at her chest and you look up and lock eyes.  You both blush.  <span class=\"cblue\">\"Crap not again!\"  </span>Thinking to yourself, worried you're going to get a reputation as a pervert.  You continue to stare at each other then you hear a voice say. <span class=\"cyellow\">\"Come on Kurumu, we are going to be late.\"</span>  It's a little girl in a brown witch hat who is tugging at her arm.

Then another thought crosses your mind.  <span class=\"cblue\">\"Wait, if she's a student here then that means she is a monster. I wonder what her true form looks like?\"  </span>You try to picture in your mind what kind of monster she is,  but you can't imagine such a beautiful girl being any kind of horrible monster.  As you walk you also try to picture what the true forms of the various other students you observe around you are.  You know that one of the biggest school rules is to maintain a human appearance.  You're lucky it's a rule or you might be eaten or worse since you can only look like yourself, a human.  You sit on a bench across from the bell tower and wait for Ruby.   You don't have to wait very long when you see the sultry goddess walking up the sidewalk. She waves at you and you wave back.  As she approaches you look her up and down again.  She notices this and locks eyes with you again and has a knowing grin on her face.  You blush and turn your head to look the other way.  This makes her giggle.  <span class=\"cblue\">\"Crap why do I keep doing that and getting caught?\" </span> You think to yourself.  Ruby stops in front of you and says. <span class=\"clred\">\"Ready?\"</span>  You look back at her.  <span class=\"cblue\">\"Sure, lets go.\"  </span>You reply.  The two of you walk back across campus to a small building that looks a little rundown.  As you walk into the building and the main room you see four girls sitting around a table.  One of the girls is the beautiful girl you saw earlier and another is her friend in the brown witch hat.  Actually all four of the girls are gorgeous. Ruby starts by introducing you to your four classmates.  <span class=\"clred\">\"Everyone this is (Name).

You are surprised you can speak at all.  <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Is he a new member of the News Paper Club?\" </span>Kokoa asks as she sits down next to Mizore and leans back putting her feet on the table.

You never really had a foot fetish or anything like that before but you start staring at Kokoa shoes that she has up on the table.

No..nothing.\"</span>  <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Liar, you were trying to look up my skirt!\"</span>  Before you and blink Kokoa has leaped onto the table.  At lightning speed she kicks you in the face sending you flying backwards into the wall behind you.  You feel like your nose is broken as well as your head.  It isn't, but it sure feels that way.  As you start to sit up,  Kokoa is standing over you.  She reaches down and grabs you ruffly by the collar.  The others are out of their chairs too.  As she pulls you up closer to her she see your nose is bleeding and there is blood on your mouth.  She sniffs the air.  <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Hey!  You're no monster you're human!\"  </span>The other girls gasp.  <span class=\"cteal\">\"You mean like Tsukune?\"  </span>Kurumu asks.  <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Exactly.

The other three girls are still shocked that you are human and don't really take in what Kokoa is doing.  Meanwhile Kokoa leans in and puts her mouth to your neck.  She opens wide and then sinks her sharp fangs into your throat.  A sense of pleasure and pain run through you.  You start to get another erection.  You gasp as she starts sucking the blood from your neck.  The other three girls finally realize what Kokoa is doing and grab on to her trying to pull her off of you.  However with fresh human blood flowing into her, she doesn't even seem to notice the girls attempt to separate her from her prey.  You notice that you are getting weaker as she drinks.  You raise your hands to try and push her back.  You hands run up the sides of her legs and up under her short skirt.  You don't mean to but you touch the front of her panties.  You don't even realize what you are doing.  You just want her off of you.  As your hands roam under her skirt Kokoa's eyes grow wide.  She is trapped by her desire to drink your sweet human blood and to push you back.  Being a young vampire not accustomed to being touched in this manner she removes her fangs from your neck and pushes you back against the wall very hard.  The impact and blood donation take their toll and you pass out on the floor at her feet.  <span class=\"cdorange\">\"What the hell!  Did you see that!

Jerking her arms away from the other girls who were still trying to pull her off.  <span class=\"cteal\">\"I really think he was trying to push you off before you killed him.\"</span>  Kurumu says.

He probably couldn't help himself.  You are quite pretty you know.\" </span> Yukari pipes in.  Kokoa gives her a dirty look not knowing if she should take that as a compliment from the young witch who seems to have bi tendencies.  She then turns her nose up into the air licks the blood off her lips and stomps out the door with her little pet bat following close behind her.  She yells back to them.  <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Just keep your pervert friend away from me or I'll do worse than drink his blood!\"</span>  The door slams and the girls gather around you to see if you are all right. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your face is buried between Kurumu's two large breasts as she strokes your hair.  She is strong and you feel helpless to pull away.  <span class=\"cyellow\">\"Look!\"</span>  Exclaims Yukari.  <span class=\"cyellow\">\"He's got a hard-on!\"</span>  She starts giggling.  She reaches down and grabs it through your pants.  Your cock swells even more and this makes Yurkari giggle.  Mizore pushes her out of the way and says. <span class=\"cviolet\"> \"Stop that you little perv.\"</span>  She then grabs your hard-on trough your pants.

She then says to Kurumu.  <span class=\"clred\">\"Do you think you can let him have some air?\" </span> Kurumu finally realizes that you can't breath too well and pulls back so you can have some air.  Ruby looks at you worried.  <span class=\"clred\">\"Are you OK (Name)?\"</span>  She asks.  <span class=\"cblue\">\"Just a little weak, but I think I'll be OK.  Maybe just need a little rest is all.\"</span>  You weakly answer.  <span class=\"clred\">\"Here let me help you up</span>.\"  Ruby says as she puts her right hand under your shoulder.  She is a lot stronger than she looks, as she lifts you up almost by herself.  You then notice Moka walking over to you.

Ruby said that she would come back in the morning, and so you knew it would only be a matter of time until someone noticed you were missing from your room. Strangely, the more you continued to pack, the less afraid of Kokoa you became. Although she wasn't a succubus, Kokoa had you eating out of the palm of her hand and you were powerless to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Hey! Hurry up and get over here!\"</span> Kokoa whispered hoarsely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to Kokoa, bag in hand, with a blank expression on your face. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Wh... Why are we going out the window? Can't we go through the door?\"</span> you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Because, idiot, I don't want to meet anyone on the way out and explain why you're with me!\"</span> Kokoa sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the thought of calling for help entered your mind, but it was quickly pushed away by Kokoa's powerful aura. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Okay...\"</span> you said submissively as Kokoa wrapped her arms around your body, causing your eyes to widen. <span class=\"cblue\">\"What are you doing?\"</span> you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa sighed once more. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"I\u2019m carrying you to my dorm room, so you\u2019d better hold on tight!\"</span> she ordered as you gulped, unsure of your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, help had arrived, in the form of Kurumu, who had her yellow sweater still hugging her chest tightly, and Ruby, with her usual attire which left nothing to the imagination. <span class=\"cteal\">\"(name)? Are you awake?\"</span> Kurumu called out before noticing you with Kokoa. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Kokoa, what the hell are you doing with (name)?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Damn it...\"</span> Kokoa muttered, turning to Kurumu and Ruby. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"That\u2019s none of your business! Now, if you\u2019ll excuse us...\"</span> Kokoa trailed off, turning back to the window and lifting you up before jumping out with you in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Ah! Help me!\"</span> you screamed, now free of whatever mental hold Kokoa had over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa landed firmly on the pavement outside the boy\u2019s dorms like it was nothing. As for you, you were shaking like crazy and would\u2019ve fallen over had Kokoa not been holding on to you. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Will you be quiet?\"</span> Kokoa asked. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"I\u2019m the only reason you\u2019re not bleeding out on the pavement or being hunted down by the rest of the -\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa stopped as a giant shadow loomed over the both of you. Looking up, you both saw Kurumu, only this time she had a pair of bat-like wings protruding out of her back and long claw-like nails. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Is this Kurumu\u2019s monster form?\"</span> you thought. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Kokoa! Let (name) go now!\"</span> Kurumu ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Like hell I will!\"</span> Kokoa screamed back at her. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"(name)\u2019s blood is mine!\"</span> Kokoa tightened her grip on your body, making you let out a quiet yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"We mean it, Kokoa!\"</span> you heard a sweet little voice behind you shout. You fidgeted slightly in Kokoa\u2019s grip as both turned to see Yukari with a wand in her hand. <span class=\"cyellow\">\"Don\u2019t bother running anywhere! Tsukune and the others are on their way here as well!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa\u2019s eyes turned blood-red once more as her white fangs glistened in the light of the moon, making you feel uneasy. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"If that\u2019s the case... I might not get another chance...\"</span> Kokoa smirked as she grabbed your head roughly in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"(name)! Get away from her, quick!\"</span> Kurumu shouted as she quickly began flying towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa pressed her open mouth against your neck as her fangs stabbed into your throat. You screamed out in a mixture of pain and ecstasy that was too difficult to describe in any other way. You felt yourself getting dizzy as you let out little grunts and your eyelids rolled to the back of your head. You knew you wouldn\u2019t be alive for much longer if Kokoa was able to have her way with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you could no longer feel Kokoa\u2019s grip on you. Instead you felt yourself smothered whilst being tightly held as all you could hear were the flapping of wings and a faint heartbeat. Your view came back into focus and you realized that your face was tightly pressed against Kurumu\u2019s chest. You let out a couple of whimpers, still dazed from Kokoa having sucked your blood. <span class=\"cteal\">\"It\u2019s okay, (name). I\u2019ve got you. Tsukune and the others will take care of Kokoa.\"</span> Kurumu cooed as you blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrapped your arms around Kurumu\u2019s back as best you could while not trying to get in the way of her wings. Soon enough, your consciousness faded as you were whisked away in the arms of your savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because that WAS how you felt! You didn't feel any sort of attraction towards Kokoa!

He\u2019s actually a good friend of my father. They were the ones who organized me coming here.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cThank goodness!\u201d</span> sighed Moka. <span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cBut how does he know your father?\u201d</span> Moka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI think they went to Senior High School together, but I\u2019m really not sure. Anyway, he wants to see me now?\u201d</span> you asked, turning to Ruby. She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cThe rest of you will need to go to class right away.\u201d</span> Ruby informed. Kurumu, Mizore and Yukari looked they were about to protest, probably wanting to accompany you to the Headmaster\u2019s office, but the look that Ruby gave them kept them quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cFine\u2026\u201d</span> Kurumu mumbled, smiling weakly at you. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cTake care, (name)!\u201d</span>  And with that, Tsukune and the girls headed out of the room and went to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the infirmary, going directly to the Headmaster\u2019s office just as you did when you first arrived at Y\u014dkai Academy. The door was shut, so you knocked twice and then opened the door until it was a little bit ajar. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou wanted to see me, s-sir?\u201d</span> you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cAh! (name)! Please have a seat.\u201d</span> The Headmaster gestured to the seat opposite him at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</span> you nodded slightly, shutting the door behind you and taking the seat opposite him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Headmaster opened up a drawer and pulled out a bandaid, giving it to you as you opened the seal and put it over where you had been bitten. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI must apologize for everything that happened last night. Ruby has informed me of everything that has happened. What Ms. Shuzen did was completely out of line.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI appreciate that you were worried for my safety, sir. But it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</span> you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with your father on the phone. We realize now that we may have rushed into everything without thinking it all through. If you feel your safety\u2019s a risk, you\u2019re free to leave.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cLeave Y\u014dkai Academy?\u201d</span> you asked. The Headmaster nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cWe never did tell you\u2026 that the reason for your enrolment\u2026 was to see if we could trial run a human peacefully existing with monsters. You may not know this, but a couple years back, another human student, Tsukune Aono, was discovered to be human and\u2026 It didn\u2019t really go down well with the School\u2019s Security Enforcement Committee. Some of the corrupt members tried to have him killed. That entire situation was rather unfortunate. Of course, at that time, we didn\u2019t have any proper channels for human enrolment at a school for monsters, which is why you were asked if you would like to enrol here.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Headmaster had said hit you like a ton of bricks. You knew about the proposed exchange program, and you knew not to tell any of the other students that you were a human, but you didn\u2019t know that the reason for not telling anyone that you were human was because you\u2019d be killed if you were found out. Maybe if you had\u2019ve been told that little tidbit of information, you wouldn\u2019t have enrolled here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSo you didn\u2019t tell me any of this?!\u201d</span> you snapped, getting up out of your seat. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cAnd my father knew?!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Headmaster nodded. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI understand your concern-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBULL-FUCKING-SHIT!\u201d</span> you shouted, almost at the top of your lungs. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou might find it petty to be freaked out by a prepubescent Vampire, and you might think I should\u2019ve been more prepared from listening to my dad\u2019s lectures at the University when he had to stay late, and maybe I should\u2019ve been more prepared, but I wasn\u2019t. If this place is supposed to be an educational facility for monsters to learn how to live with humans, why the Hell is it condoning acts of violence against humans?!\u201d</span> A few seconds of silence passed until you realized that you had just cursed off the Headmaster. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir\u2026\u201d</span> you muttered. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine, (name).\u201d</span> The Headmaster sighed. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cYou must understand though that it\u2019s a small minority of monsters who think poorly of humans. A lot of the students here have come from human schools all across Japan, and a lot of them peacefully coexist with humans. You know this for a fact. The members of the Newspaper Club don\u2019t care that you\u2019re human. Ruby told me that Kurumu was very concerned for your safety. I\u2019m sure that she and the other members of the Newspaper Club would be more than willing to look out for you. And you won\u2019t need to worry about Ms. Shuzen anymore. Your homeroom teacher, Ms. Nekonome is punishing her accordingly for her actions.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201c(name), if you want to leave Y\u014dkai Academy, I won\u2019t stop you. You can head back to your room to collect your things. The next bus arrives at the bus stop in fifteen minutes. We won\u2019t make an issue of it. Just tell me if you\u2019d like to stay, or go.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought it over. On one hand, staying at Y\u014dkai Academy could be potentially life-threatening for you, especially if Kokoa decides to pay you another \u2018visit\u2019 in the night, or even worse, tells another student that you\u2019re a human. But on the other hand, you had made a great group of friends on your first day. Friends who you knew would do anything and everything in their power to keep you safe. But when it got right down to it, what the Headmaster had told you only made you more hesitant to stay. If you yourself didn\u2019t feel safe, you wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on your schoolwork, and you\u2019d end up failing, completely defeating the purpose of your enrolment at Y\u014dkai Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot of things you had to think about, but eventually, you cleared your throat and told the Headmaster your choice:<br>\r\n</div></div>",

(name) you're the best!<br>\r\nKurumu squealed with joy. She jumped on you planting your face right smack dab on her boobs. She hugged you tight pressing her boobs against your face.

Get your tits off of (name) right now you love sick cow! <br>\r\n Kurumu: Mind your own business Ms. Washboard! Besides (name) loves my boobs so there! (sticks out tongue)<br>\r\n Mizore: If's its boobs he likes mine are the most sensitive. <br>\r\nThen all three started fighting again and unfortunately you in the middle.<br>\r\nTskune: Oh brother. Don't they ever stop? <br>\r\nThen my arm went limp trying to get some air.<br>\r\nMoka: (screams) (name)'s dead!!<br>\r\nEveryone looked at your  unconscious body. You wasn't really dead.

You shaking is making it worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after you woke up and after everyone calmed down, you went back your room to get some rest after a crazy day of surprises. As you were laying down you thought about what you said to the headmaster. <br>\r\n(name): I hope I'm not making a mistake<br>\r\nThen you thought about Tskune, Moka and the others.<br>\r\n(name) I'm o.k. Besides I've got great friends. and they love me for who I am.<br>\r\nThen you thought about Kurumu. You don't know why, but something about her just drives you crazy. Especially her boobs. All the fantasizing makes you get a hard on. Then you snap out of you fantasy and slapped your cheeks.<br>\r\n(name) No! Stop it! If you keep thinking about Kurumu like that she'll think you're a pervert! <br>\r\nThen you heard a voice.<br>\r\nVoice: Who would you think is a pervert?<br>\r\n You look around your room, but there was no one there.<br>\r\n(name) Who said that?<br>\r\nVoice: I did.<br>\r\nThe voice came from the window.

You take your lips off of hers and start lifting up her shirt, revealing her massive and beautiful breasts, concealed in a white lacy bra. You take off the bra and stare at the naked flesh. You couldn't resist groping those beautiful mounds of flesh. They were so soft, like grabbing two big mounds of wool. She moans in pleasure as you knead them like dough. Oh, (name)! It feels so good! Your making me so horny!\" she gasps. You start to get more turned on as she screams like that. You look down to her legs and find them tightened together.She squirms like a cat in heat. It was time to move on to the next phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumu, the rest have to go too.\" you tell her, pointing down toward her skirt. She nods her head and gets up on the bed on all fours facing away feom you, but her beautiful ass in front of your face. You were so excited to play with it. You see her white lacy panties barely covering her bubble butt. Her white butt cheeks were peeking out of those tiny tight panties, they looked so cute. You reach for her skirt and panties and gently pull them down, Kurumu shiers in pleasure. As you toss her underwear and skirt aside, you gaze upon her naked lower body. Her beautiful pussy is already dripping with excitement, the sight of it just made you even more excited. You then looked toward her butt, two large mounds of flesh that made you just want to play with them. You couldn't resist and grabbed those suckers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH!\" Kurumu exclaims in pleasure. Her butt cheeks were so soft and fun to play wih. You knead them around and shake them in your hands. You then got a naughty thought in your head: you could spank her. Why not? You have her tush in your hands and it's your secret fetish. You then stop thinking and raise your right hand and smack it against her right butt cheek. \"Ouch!\" Kurumu yelps in pain. You then retract your hand and feel nervous that you've hurt Kurumu. \"Oh, my! Have I been naughty, (name)?\" she asks with her seductive voice. You look back at her and realize that you've stuck gold! You have a spanking fetish and are with a girl who loves to be spanked! \"Oh yes Miss Kurono! You've been very naughty! You need to be punished.\" you say as you bring down your hand once again. \"OH! Yes! Give me more! I've been so naughty!\" You spank her again, harder this time. She moans even louder. You spank  for a solid five minutes. Both of you start to get even more aroused. When you stopped the intense spanking, her butt was bright red and she was panting in ecstasy.  You couldn't take it anymore, so you slipped the condom on and entered her dripping pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu yells in pain as you enter her. You pause for a moment to let her catch her breath. Kurumu breathes heavily and says, \"I'm ok (name).\" You nod your had and continue to go further inside of her. Your erection reaches her hymen and you stop. \"Kurumu, this is gonna hurt.\" Kurumu turns to you and nods her head. \"It's ok. Break it. just be gentle with me ok?\" You nod your head and puch into her. She shouts in pain as her hymen breaks. You start to see a litle bit of blood seep out of her snatch. You pause for a minute to let her rest. When her breathing steadied, she turned back and nodded her head. \"Go. Make me a woman.\" she says desperately. You do as instructed and push back into her. You pump into her pussy again and again, while both of you experience the pleasure of a lifetime. \"Oh!Oh! Yes, (name)! Give it to me harder!\" You gladly oblige and go faster. The pleasure you were feeling was amazing and you only wanted more and for it to never end. The whole room echoed with the moans and yelps of pleasure that came from the both of you. Unfortuneatly, all good things must come to an end. You felt your orgasm approaching.  \"Kurumu, I'm gonna come!\" you shout. \"Me too, (name)! I'm gonna-OH!\" She couldn't speak anymore as her orgasm hit her like a rock. Her vagina exploded with her juices around your throbbing cock. You didn't last too long after her as you exploded into the condom, your semen dripping out of the oppening, but none entering her. You both collapse from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoon next to Kurumu as you try to catch your breath. \"That.....was.....amazing, Kurumu.\" You say, out of breath. \"(name), this was the best night of my life.\" She turns to face you. \"I love you,\" she says. \"You smile and reply, \"I love you too, Kurumu.\" You lean into Kurumu and start kissing her tenderly. You two just lay on the bed, naked and tired, while making out lovingly. Should you two continue the romance, or rest for a new day?</span></div></div>",

You were feeling really naughty and opened up her butt cheeks, revealing her beautiful pink anus. \"(Name), what are you doing?\" she asked suspiciously. She got her answer soon enough when you stuck your tongue in her secondary hole! \"Oh!\" She gasps. Another one of your fantasies was lickig a girl's butt hole and now you were doing it. The taste wasnt that bad, but the kindliness of the action was what made it pleasurable for the both of you. \"Oh my god, (name)! You're amazing! And so kinky!\" Kurumu barely speaks as she is lost in pleasure. You then pull out to examine her freshly lubed butt hole. You decide that it's time for the next part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get in your knees and position yourself and your erection toward her anus. You grab her butt cheeks and push in. \"OH!

You pump in and out continuously for almost a half an hour. The both of you were in nirvana with the pleasure you wre getting. To add a bit more pleasure to Kurumu, you grasps her huge breasts, teasing her hardened nipples. She gasped at this action. The feeling was incredible for the both of you. Unfortunately it had to end sooner or later and much to your annoyance, it was sooner. You yelled out as you had your orgasm and sent your seed deep into Kurumu's ass. Her bowels were flooded with your cum and she was relishing every millisecond of it. She couldn't take it anymore and came as well, her pussy gushing out her own juices. You both then collapsed speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" You said. \"Yeah, wow,\" Kurumu responded. She turned to face you. \"(Name), that was the most amazing feeling of my life.

By the way good morning my love.\", you kissed her gently on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I could wake up to that every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't mind that at all. So what does this lovely monster want that will satisfy her desires?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind giving me some of your body heat for my breasts? They're naked and it's drafty in here. Or maybe we can resume last night's activities. \", she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to do it again with her so badly that you may as well, but then again just resting with her like this is enough. </span></div></div>",

I'm ready for you!\" She eagerly gets on her hands and knees ready for you. The sight of her beautiful butt cheeks was overwhelming to you. You wanted to take her right there and then, but you had a different idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I kinda wanted to clean off today. We both kinda smell like sex.\" You add lightly sniffing the air. \"Oh\" Kurumu slightly lowered her head in disappointment. \"I didn't say I didn't want to have sex\" you playfully say. Kurumu got a little confused for a second, but then finally got it. \"Ooooooohhhh! You really are kinky are you?\" She teases. You grin at her and give a hard smack to her bottom, leaving a red handprint. \"OH!\" Kurumu gasps in pain and pleasure. You then point to the bathroom. \"March young lady, or I'll give you the spanking of your life!\" You playfully threaten. She shivers in excitement and puts out her rear even more. \"Oh please, (name)! Please don't spank me! I'll be a good girl!\" She begs, wiggling her butt. \"Then meet me in the shower.\" You command. You let her go first and she slowly walks toward the shower, her perfect butt jiggling with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both got into the shower you turned on the hot water and then it really got hot in there! You bent Kurumu over,placing her hands on the shower wall, and filled her soaking pussy with your hardened cock. She creams in absolute pleasure as you two make love in such a provocative way. The steam from the shower only stimulates you more and makes it more pleasurable for the both of you. You pump in and out for a good ten minutes. The busty succubus only yelped in ecstasy as you pump into her, her glorious cleavage bouncing around. After five more minutes, you felt your orgasm coming and quickly realized that you aren't wearing a condom. You suddenly pull out and spray your semen all over her back. Kurumu soon has her orgasm and looks back at you. \"Why'd you pull out?\" You answer, \" I didn't have a condom on.\" She understands. \"It's ok (name). Well be more careful next time.\" You start to feel a little better. You both decide to actually wash before the water got too cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your shower, you both got out of the bathroom with towels around you. \"Kurumu, what are you gonna do for clothes?\" You ask, using another towel to dry your hair. \"Oh, I packed some with me, but I could use some help choosing which underwear I'm gonna wear today.\" She winks at you while blushing. You start to get really horny  again. She gets the rest of her clothes on besides her panties and pulls out a couple of options for you to choose. She olaces them in your bed and lifts up her skirt, mooning you. Your nose starts to bleed a little bit. Kurumu looksat you with a sexy smile on her face. \"So what pair of undies would fit this cute little tushy today?\" She sexily asked. You look at the selection and couldn't decide.</span></div></div>",

As soon as you noticed it you began thinking about would be like to touch her giant boobs. Then you began to have another hard on again, but you snap back to reality and slap your cheeks again.<br>\r\n(name) No, no, no, no, no! Stop it! I know I like her, but i just can't think like that! <br>\r\nYou decide to leave the room (without waking Kurumu) to try to get your mind off of things. As soon as you step outside a certain snow yokai was waiting for you.<br>\r\n(name) Mizore! What are you doing here?<br>\r\nMizore: Well... I felt that the whole thing was my fault. So I thought that'd come to apologise.<br>\r\n(name) Mizore it was accident you....<br>\r\nMizore: It doesn't matter! You and Kurumu got hurt because of me. If I hadn't started that fight Kurumu wouldn't have gotten hurt. and.......and...... <br>\r\nShe began to cry and you were quite surprised. Who would've thought under that cold skin of  snow yokai she could cry like a normal human being and she cared deeply for Kurumu even though she and her were rivals. You gave her a gentle hug.<br>\r\n(name) It's okay Mizore. Don't cry. It wasn't your fault.and don't worry Kurumu's gonna be fine so don't worry. <br>\r\nMizore wipes away her tears and smiles.<br>\r\nMizore: Thank you (name) for being so understanding.<br>\r\n(name) If you still feel bad you should apologise after Kurumu wakes up o.k? <br>\r\nMizore: O.k. I will.<br>\r\n(name) You better get going otherwise the teachers will get up in our faces for being late. I'll stay a little longer to rest.<br>\r\nMizore: O.k. Bye! Feel better (name).<br>\r\nAfter Mizore left you went back to the infirmery to check on Kurumu. She was still fast asleep. <br>\r\n(name) I better let her rest and get to class. After all if I'm gonna be Kurumu's boyfriend I gotta have good grades right?<br>\r\nThen you heard a voice; a voice that for some reason gave you chills.<br>\r\n(voice) Do you honesty think you can have a relationship with a succubis?<br>\r\nYou look around but there was no one there.<br>\r\n(name) Who's there?

You begin to panic now as your nervous level soars to the roof.<br>\r\n Kurumu sweatdrops and peeks throught the bathroom and sees how worried you are. She giggles and pulls out a condom from her pocket.<br>\r\nKurumu: Looking for this?<br>\r\nYou sweatdrop and you blush even more.<br>\r\n(name) I'm sorry it's.....<br>\r\nKurumu puts a finger over your lips to shush you and smiles.<br>\r\nKurumu: I know. It's my first time too.<br>\r\nKurumu: I know. It's my first time too. <br>\r\nShe gently takes your hand and leads you to the bed.<br>\r\nKurumu: Just let your instinct take over and I'm sure you be fine.<br>\r\n(name) OK and dont worry you won't get me preggo. Trust me. <br>\r\nThe two of you inch closer until your lips touched and you both began making out. Kurumu's tongue entered your mouth and thethe kiss deed. Kurumu hugged you tight and you hugged her back Then your hand slowy slides on her back  dowuntil your hand is on her butt. You give her ber butt a gentle but firm squeeze causing her to yelp in surprise.<br>\r\n(name) I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?<br>\r\nKurumu Yes, but I'm fine. I liked it. Keep going.<br>\r\nYou both continue to kiss, but this time your hands kneaded on Kurumu's butt to make the kiss more pleasurable for her. After that you and Kurumu take off your clothes until were both naked. When you saw Kurumu you stared at her with wonder. You knew she was beautiful before but you have never seen her like this. <br>\r\n(name) oh my gosh. Kurumu..... you're so beautiful! <br>\r\nKurumu blushed a deep shade of crimson and smiled.<br>\r\nKurumu: Thank you. You're handsome too. <br>\r\nThen she took your hands and placed them on her boobs. You squeezed and massage them causing Kurumu to mew little moans. They felt like two pairs off pillows only way better. You realise you couldn't take it anymore and remember what Kurumu said about letting instinct taking over. You finally decide to let that instinct take over. You dove into her boobs sucking and licking them as you massage them. Kurumu's moans got a little louder and through her boobs you hear her heart beating fast. She gripped the sheet as the pleasure coursed through her body like a lightning bolt. Then she stops you and you both look at each other with hungry eyes. Eyes that hungered for more.<br>\r\nKurumu: (name) finish me! Make into a woman! <br>\r\n(name) OK. Just so you know I'll go easy. <br>\r\nYou put on the condom and Kurumu lies on the bed spreading her womanhood so you enter. At first you were nervous because you were going to lose your viginity, but it was going to be someone you love so it was ok.<br>\r\n(name) OK..... here I go. Are you sure Kurumu? <br>\r\nKurumu nods her head and you nod too meaning its go time. Then slowly you slides youself inside her, feeling the walls of her sex part as you slide inside of her. Kurumu grits her teeth in pain and grabs a fistfull of sheets. <br>\r\n(name) Kurumu are you ok?<br>\r\nKurumu: I'm fine. It hurt a litte, but i'm ok<br>\r\n(name) I'm going to move now, but i'm gonna go slowly. Tell me to stop or go faster ok?<br>\r\nKurumu: OK.....<br>\r\nThen very slowly you pull back, Kurumu not really feeling much of anything other than pain as you pull back, and then slowly pushes inside her again. Feeling his member penetrate her and part her Kurumu keeps her teeth clenched, forcing herself to bear the pain. Then as yiou slowly make love to her, Kurumu's body slowly began getting accustomed to you as you thrust into her. The sounds of her pussy squelching as you thrusts into her low in the otherwise quiet room. After five minutes the pain begins to subside, and pleasure begins to replace it. You can feel her begin to slowly enjoy what you're doing, releasing her hold on the blankets, and wrapping her legs around you, she looks up at you, her eyes no longer filled with pain and hurting.<br>\r\nKurumu: (name) you can go faster now.<br>\r\n(name) Are you sure Kurumu?<br>\r\nNodding Kurumu wraps her arms around your neck, pulling herself up to you.<br>\r\nKurumu: Yes (name). Make me yours!<br>\r\nSmiling you go faster, slowly driving yourself into her harder and harder. Kurumu moans in pleasure as you drive your body into hers, your cock hitting her sweet spot, sending waves of euphoria through her body. Then she forces you on the bottom and she begins doing cowboy style.You grip the sherts as you begin thrusting upward deep into Kurumu's womanhood. Feeling you pound your cock inside of her Kurumu can feel her pleasure building. You can feel yours building too as you reach your fastest speed of thrusts.<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu! I'm.......gonna.....<br>\r\nKurumu: Do it (name)! Let it out! Let it all out inside me! <br>\r\nHearing that you can't hold youself back anymore. Driving it deep inside her one final time your cock explodes with cum filling up the condom. Kurumu's back bulged and her wings erupted forth as she let out a pleasured scream. Then both of you lie in bed together breathing hard. Kurumu looks at you in the eyes, her entire body glowing with happiness, you smiled back at her, you own breathing light as you hold her.<br>\r\n(name) So....how....did I....do?<br>\r\nKurumu hugs you and kisses you on the cheek. <br>\r\nKurumu: You were amazing. Just....,amazing. <br>\r\nYou smile and you hug her back then you both slowly drift to sleep happily in each others arms.</span></div></div>",

After Tskune and Moka had left and after you and Kurumu get dressed you kissed her goodbye and went to the headmaster's office.<br>\r\nHeadmaster: (name)! How have you been?<br>\r\n(name) I'm great headmaster. Thank You.<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Now I know these past few days have been crazy for you so I wanted to apologise for all that's happened.<br>\r\n(name) That's ok sir.<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Now I know Keito tried to expose your secret and I know you'll probably want to transfer schools so I'll understand if you want to leave.<br>\r\n(name) (laugh) You don't need to do that sir. I'm fine where I'm at because I made lots of new friends here at Yokai acadamy and i've even got the best girlfriend a guy could ask for. You see i've learned a lot of things, but the most important thing was that whenever your a human or a monster there's always room for friendship. And if I'm in trouble I can always count on my friends to back me up. Plus I really hope that one day humans and monsters can come to learn to love one another and be friends. So my answer to you is you're stuck with me whenever you like it or not.<br>\r\nThe Headmaster said nothing then he laughed.<br>\r\nHeadmaster: (name) A good answer. You have exceeded my expectations your father would be proud.<br>\r\n(name) Thank you sir.<br>\r\nThen the bell began to ring.<br>\r\n(name) Oh there's the school bell I better go! See you later sir. I'm gonna be late!<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Farewell (name) and good luck.<br>\r\nAfter you left the room the Headmaster chuckled and his eyes twinkled<br>\r\nHeadmaster: That boy has guts as well as a pure heart. His father must really be placing his hopes for the future on this boy. A future where monsters and humans live together in peace and harmony, and the place that teaches this is Yokai Acamemy. </span></div></div>",

But only if you carry me back here to my room when were done.\", Kurumu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK I may not be the strongest but I'll try to impress.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took Kurumu to the bust stop where you bribed the driver to take you to the human world and wait until you both came back. The drive wasnt bad since you held her close by your arm as she snuggled up toward your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear your heartbeat elevating with her so close to you.

You adjusted the water just the right temperature and step into the shower. As the water soaked your entire body you begin thinking about everything that happened.

Two days from now it'll be graduation. meet us at the tunnel outside the school boundary. It'll be our little secret. Oh and by the way if you ever tell anyone or get a sudden burst of courge.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fired a flame arrow at you barely scraping your right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuyo: I'll slaughter your friends and everything else in sight.

You think about his request and then you think about Kurumu and your friends. You felt lucky having good friends like them who'll have your back no matter what. Then you made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Right. I have to face Kuyo alone. I can't put my friends in danger anymore. I may be a human, but there's no way I'm gonna let them get hurt because of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dressed and you were ready to go. Before you walk out the door you look at the sleeping Kurumu. You walk over to Kurumu and kiss her without waking her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm sorry. Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you left heading for the northern tunnel outside Yokai Academy. You walked outside the school and was just about to  go through the front gates when you heard a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) And where are you going whee?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and there on your shoulder was Ko. Kokoa's bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Ko! What are you doing here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: I'm just flapping around whee. What I wanna know is what are you doing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm going to face Kuyo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: What are you crazy?!? That guy's a S class monster just like Ms. Kokoa and Moka!

Not exactly a way to go on graduation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Ko flew away. As for you: you pass through the front gates and walk through the forest. You recall the first time you came to this academy. How you met Kurumu Tskune and the others. You also remember your first kiss with Kurumu. So much has happened since you came here. You didn't think you were going to have friends when you came to this school, but now you do and you were going to protect them no matter what. Soon you arrive at the tunnel where you and Kuyo were supposed to meet. You look but didn't  see any sign of Kuyo anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kuyo! Where are you?!? I know you're here! Come on out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a giant flame appeared at the entrance to the tunnel and out stepped Kuyo. He wasn't alone he had a gang of monsters with him including Keito. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuyo: So..... I guess you had guts showing up after all. I commend you on your courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Of course I did. I can't just stand idly by while you hurt my friends! This is between you and me got it? And I wont let you hurt them anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuyo:Heh. intriguing. So have you made a decision? Will you join us and get power? Or will you stand against us and be killed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you were against odds and Kuyo was way more powerful the answer was obvious.</span></div></div>",

Need I say it again? Renouce your love for that sucubis and I'll spare you and her miserable life. Although I'd much rather rape her just for spite. She's watsed on a boy like you. After all your a lowly human who can't even fight back and your nothing, more but the scum on my shoe just like that slut of a sucubis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Kuyo's  gang laughed loudly. The laughter echoed in your ears and you processed what Kuyo just said. Then you completely lost your temper. You charged at Kuyo trying to punch him, but every punch you threw Kuyo dodged. Then Kuyo gave you a hard punch in the gut, knocking the wind out of you. Then he gave you a powerful kick to face. You were sent flying and you crashed right into a rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuyo: Heh too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (laughs) Well done great leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters cheer and Kuyo raised up his right hand for victory.

You struggle to your feet coughing up blood as you used all your strength to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I.............(cough) won't let.....you hurt my.....frirends.......(cough)........especially....Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuyo: You're still alive are you?

(name) please!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Please.....No......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu stared at your body in horror then she screamed with horror/despair so loud that it echoed throughout the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: DAMN YOU KUYO!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka screamed too and in a explosion of raw power she transformed to her true vampire form without Tskune removing her rosary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: You bastard! I kill you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka and charged at Kuyo hungry for revenge. Moka gave Kuyo a hard and devastating punch that sent Kuyo flying, but he regained his composure and landed safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuyo: Oh. I guess I made you mad huh? Don't worry you'll join your pathetic friend soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kurumu and Tskune were still trying to wake you up, but to no avail. Just then Yukari, Kokoa, and Mizore arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hey everyone! We're here to help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: We finally took care of Kuyo's goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they see you. Yukari screams for horror, Mizore covers her mouth in horror and Kokoa stands there shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What the hell happened!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Kuyo somehow found and ambushed us and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu was crying like crazy and hugging your seemingly lifeless body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: He....(hic) sacificed himself to save me......(sob). He saved my life. And now he's dead....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa was shrouded with a purple aura and she was pissed. Then she entered the fray<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: That bastard's gonna pay! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuyo: Get mad all you want it's too late. Your human friend is gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked hopeless for you, but then......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hey look at that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looks at where Yukari was pointing. She was pointing to your finger. It was twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: If his finger is twitching then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name)'s still alive!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune felt your arm and his face brightened with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I've got a pulse! (name)'s still alive, but just barely. We have to do something and fast,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: But what do we do Tskune? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: i can only think of one way to save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Please tell us Tskune!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Tskune's idea?</span></div></div>",

But you still were calm about it despite the circumstances. You knew how drastic your life would change, but it meant that you and Kurumu were now one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blood was coursing through your veins and now you were part of her race now.

I placed you in Yokai academy for a reason. To help you understand that as long as you have a bond you can do anything. Besides you do have a special power and humans and monsters can live together in harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What? I do? but if I have powers why didn't I.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(your dad) I had your power sealed away so the human's wouldn't suspect. I wish I could tell you more, but there's no time. You have to hurry! Your friends need you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your dad began to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Dad! Wait! Don't leave!

You've never known what it's like to have friends or being in love. Humans and monsters can understand one another and be friends maybe even fall in love. But all you know is anger, hatred, and your nothing, but a souless bastard of a yokai! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuyo: You little bitch! Who gives a damn about this friends and love shit! Humans and monsters are natural born enemies and always will be! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began charging his energy and made a giant fireball! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Look out!

You walked up to the band secretly asked them a request. Surprisingly the band was more than happy to oblige. A few minutes later you and Kurumu were in the lake with you rowing. It was a beautiful night and the water was calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh (name) I'm was looking forward to this for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Me too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: By the way I wanted to thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) For what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: For saving me from Kuyo.

How did you that anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well when I was unconscious I saw my dad. He told me to believe in my bonds of friendship and love. And my power will come when I need it. Next thing I know I transformed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Wow. That's incredible you saw your dad. Can you transform again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I think it was a one time deal. Because I've been trying to transform since then and nothings happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry powers or no powers I'm still human. I'm just happy I got to protect and meet such great friends and most of all: I got the most beautiful girl in the entire world. I'm the happiest man alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug Kurumu and she blushes bright pink and hugs you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I love you Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I love you too (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you paddled further into a lagoon and Kurumu began to get a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Is something wrong Kurumu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: It's just..... I've never done this before and I.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sush Kurumu by placing a finger on her lips and you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It's ok I'm nervous too.

It's so romantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) (laughs) Isn't it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartway through the song (right at the part \"It don't take a word\") Kurumu tried to kiss you, but you stop her by placing two fingers on her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) ah ah ah. Not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey why'd you stop me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a pouty face that you thought was irresistibly cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry. I think there'll be kissing after I show you something. It's a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you rowed the boat to the deepest part of the lagoon surrounded by the trees. Fireflies flew all  around you and Kurumu and the moon reflection shone brightly where you and Kurumu were floating. Kurumu was absolutely blown away by this terrific sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name)!

There was this one spot that was so high up you could almost touch the sky. It was going to be a full moon and you wanted to make the night truly special by the time you got up there. After this you planned on finally letting all of the sexual tension aside ounce and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held Kurumu's hand through the park as she placed her head close to your chest listening to your heartbeat. Each and every beat she heard it was pure music to her ears. It made her feel like nothing would go wrong and everything would be fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroked her hair gently with the lightest touch and sensitivity. It made Kurumu's spine tingle with excitment, and a bit of pleasure. Midnight drew near and the moment you were planning was about to come upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had something in your coat pocket that you kept checking frequently but she never noticed since she only stared at your face, as you did hers. \"Oh (Name)  can't you just tell me what were doing? I really want us to head back. I want tonight to be special for the both of us\", she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight will be special but not the way you think right now. That's for late in the morning, and by then I think youu'll feel even better by then.\", you hinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I don't want to be kept waiting.\", Kurumu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry the wait will be worth it I promse.\", you said as you kissed her lips passionatley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two then made it to the hilltop around 11:55. The timeing now would be perfect ounce you let the scenery set in and the mood would feel just right, your heart was pounding but you felt like you were absolutly certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kurumu set her sights at the sky and then at the city fom above the setting stunned her in awe. She saw how lovley the whole city was from up here and the sky was gorgeous in the moonlight. Her hair shinned even brighter than earlier and she looked like an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2- Plays while this happens)<br>\r\nAt that moment it was now or never, you took her hand and said, \"Kurumu I have been wanting to say something for a while but you have to understand. After we beat Kuyo I saw how much you would risk everything for me and I would for you. I knew then that I had to say this to you, I love you more than life itself Kurumu and...\", you then knelt down on one knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu's heart was pounding at mach 10 when she saw what you were doing. \"(Name) your really going to...\", she couldn't even finish as she saw you reach in your coat pocket knowing full well wha you were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumu will you marry me?\", you asked placing the ring on her finger. She then grabbed you and tears began flowing like waterfalls. She couldn't contain her happiness and held you as if she was never going to let you go EVER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will! You are the most handsome, caring, and romantic person I have ever met. Why wouldn't I?! I love you (Name), whetherit be worlds apart or a mere inch I will never let anything break us apart.\", Kurumu said in a poetic fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock struk midnight and the fullmoon shined on you two from the hill top. It was a true love bond that you both were planning on sharing for the rest of your lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two then ran back to your room to enjoy what just happened, and by god were you two going to enjoy it.</span></div></div>",

So you did and when you did you could see why Kurumu was at a loss for words. There on Tskune's bed was Moka and Tskune and they were completely stark naked and doing it. When you saw them you began to get a hard on and you looked at Kurumu she was getting turned on too. You looked at each other and you both began to kiss. In the heat of the moment you grab Kurumu's butt which makes Kurumu yelp in surprise and pleasure. Unfortunately Tskune and Moka heard her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Tskune I think someone's there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this you and Kurumu race back to your room thinking and hoping you Kurumu wouldn't be caught. You both make it to your room and you breathe a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Whew. That was too close. Good thing we didn't get caught eh Kurumu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice Kurumu was breathing heavily and her face was redder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu are you ok? I 'm sorry if I grabbed you. It was on the spurr of the moment I.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I'm fine, but......

Maybe you have a fever or.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu did something that made your heart and your body go crazy. Kurumu took your hand and pressed it against her left boob. Her boob felt soft and you feel her heart beating like a jack hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) K-K-Kurumu what are you......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Please (name). Give it to me. My body's gonna go nuts if we don't do it. Besides I promised you my virginity didn't I? It's ok. You can do whatever you want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK!

You knew she was beautiful before, but this was whole new level of beauty. Then you look at Kurumu's breasts. You've seen a lot of breasts in your life, but Kurumu's: they were humongous!!!! They streched at her bra just waiting to be released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu what size are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: About a G cup why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Because these are the most beautiful and biggest pair of breasts i\"ve ever seen!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu (blushing): Th-thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Um.... I don't suppose if I could......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu then pulled up her bra and breasts burst free from their lacey prison. She then held out her arms like she was about to hug you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: They're all yours (name). My entire body belongs to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon she said these words you buried your face in Kurumu's breasts. They were super soft it was like your were feeling two pairs of clouds. Kurumu's breathing got heavy while you fondled her breasts and she grew even hornier. Then you see Kurumu's nipples they were rosey pink and hard and erect. You poked one and Kurumu yelped in pleasure. You smile mischievously and you began to suck and play with her right nipple and rubbed and massaged her left. Kurumu mewed little moans and gripped the covers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu you're so cute. You sound like a cute kitten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu(blushing and giggling): Stop it! You're embarrassing me you naughty boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you decide to turn it up a little and sucked on both her nipples at the same time. Kurumu moaned with pleasure and hugged your head pressing your head deeper in her breasts. You also grabbed Kurumu's butt kneading gently as your continued to suck. Kurumu's moans grew louder and she gripped the sheets tighter as the all the pleasure hit her like electricity flowing through a wire. Then she lifted your head and gave you another kiss. Then you two pausee to take a breath and Kurumu had a look that she wanted more. She took off her panties revealing her womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name) please! I can't wait anymore! Give me your thick rod! Make me a woman! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out your manhood from your boxers and put on the condom. Kurumu stared at your manhood looking shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu are you okay? I'm sorry if it's not much to look at, but....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: It's huge! It's the bigest rod I've ever seen!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name blushing) Now who's embarrassing who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu then pushed you down on the bed and got on top of you and positioned your rod and prepared it to enter inside you. Then Kurumu entered your rod inside her making gasp in a mixture of pleasure and pain. You got a little worried<br>\r\nbecause Kurumu's womanhood oozed a little blood. Then you notice Kurumu was crying a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu why are you crying? Is it because of the pain? We can stop if it hurts too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No It's just...(sniffle) I'm so happy. I gave my first time to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and you wipe away Kurumu's tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Me too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu slowy bounced up and down on top of you. You can feel Kurumu's insides squeezing your manhood making you grip the sheets. After she got used to having you inside her the pain went awy and Kurumu picked up the pace. she bounced faster causing her breasts to bounce. Kurumu moaned with every thrust she gave. Then you gripped Kurumu\"s breasts causing her to moan even louder. You massaged her breasts as you thrusted in time with Kurumu's thrusting.<br>\r\nIt felt so good to you that you decide to kick it to overdrive. You sit up and kiss Kurumu passionately and you swap positions making you on top. You thrust hard in Kurumu causing Kurumu to moan louder. She wraps her legs around you and her insides tighten around you making you thrust harder and harder. Kurumu moans in pleasure as you drive your body into hers, your cock hitting her sweet spot, sending waves of pleasure through her body. You thrust faster and faster until you begin to feel the pleasure build more and more. Kurumu was feeling the same way gripping the sheets tighter and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu! I'm.......gonna.....I think I'm......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Me too! Let it out! Make me come! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach your maximum speed thrusting Kurumu like crazy. Then you give one big and final thrust and shove your entire rod inside Kurumu. Your rod explodes with cum filling up the condom and Kurumu lets out a scream of pleasure as her orgasm rocked her like a thunderbolt. You two rested while in each others arms. You looked at each other and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That was awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: You said it. (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu nuzzled on your chest and sighed happily as she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I love you so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Kurumu and shes fast asleep. You chuckle as you kiss her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I love you too. My little sucubis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen slowly you fell asleep feeling the luckiest guy in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you two wake up.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wonder how she ended up in your bed, then you remember. You did it with Kurumu! You remember how Kurumu's breasts felt and how good it felt when you were inside her. This cause you to get a nosebleed, but you quickly stop yourself. You look at Kurumu again and you smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Thank you Kurumu. You made me the happiest man alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently run a finger through Kurumu's hair. She stirred a little and nuzzled her face in her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Mmmbbbmmm. (name)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hehehe How cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you decide you better take a shower. You wanted Kurumu to wake up with you smelling good. You step into the bathroom and got undressed. You turned on the water and adjusted the water to the temperature of your liking, and stepped in the shower. Your muscles relaxed as the warm water washed over your body. As you washed your body you hummed a little tune (Je' taime from Rosario Vampire). You were feeling very happy and who could blame you? Who just did it with the hottest girl in the entire world. Also you helped defeat Kuyo and stopped his evil ambitions. Then you remember you seeing your dad and remember you transforming. You begin to wonder how you transformed like that and wonder if you're even human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hmmmm. I wonder if I'm half monster just like Tskune? Maybe the Headmaster knows something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to put out of you head and decide to worry about it later. As you wash your face you blindly reach for your towel, but you feel nothing but air. Then you feel something soft and bouncy. At first you didn't know what it was so squeeze it again. Then you hear a little moan and a familiar voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) -giggle- And a good morning to you too my hubby wubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and there next to you was Kurumu in a towel and your hand was on Kurumu's right breast. You yelped in surprise and you jumped back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Eeep! I'm so sorry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: It's ok (name) I don't mind at all. In fact I need your help with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off her towel revealing her entire naked body which causes you to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) -gulp- Wh-what is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I was hoping you could help me wash my back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) -gulp- O.....ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a sponge ready and covered it with soap and gently began scrubbing Kurumu's back. You didn't know why, but your heart was beating like crazy. You were in the bathroom stark naked with a girl and you were washing her back! As you were scrubbing you notice how white Kurumu's skin is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wow Kurumu! You're skin's so white It's like beautiful snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Why thank you. Aside from my breasts it's my pride and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when you finished scrubbing you and Kurumu dried off and you see Kurumu in the mirror. Her breasts and her body were as big and curvy as ever. Then you stare at Kurumu\"s breasts. You began to get a sudden urge. Then you couldn't resist anymore. You snuck up behind Kurumu and grabbed her breasts. Kurumu yelped in a mixture of surprise and pleasure  as you began to massage her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm sorry Kurumu! I just can't help myself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (giggles) You naughty boy. You sure love my breasts do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh as you massage her breasts more. Then your fingers brush on Kurumu's stomach. She yelped and began to squirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey! (giggles) Not there. I'm ticklish in that spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh are you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flash a mischievous smile and you began to tickle Kurumu in the stomach. Kurumu exploded with laughter and she squirmed even more. She struggled to get away, but it didn't go as planned. She accidentally makes you trip and you both fall and crash through the bathroom door and onto the floor. Luckily you were both ok. You both look at each other and you both burst laughing. Then you hear familiar voices<br>\r\n<br>\r\nvoice: (name)? Kurumu? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nvoice: What are you two doing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kurumu look up to find standing above you.....</span></div></div>",

Tskune and Moka were playing volly ball with Rubi and Koaka while Mizore and Kurumu splashed around in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou on the other hand laid in the shade just relaxing. It's not like you hated the beach but you weren't getting the right motivation to get in on the fun. Thankfully thats where Kurumu came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed you by the arm and then tossed you into the water. You rose up thinking it was ice cold, and you shivvered yourself till you were like a maracha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed something pass your leg, it felt weird like it was climbing your leg then just stopped. Then again until this time it teased your member, thats when you knew it was Kurumu messing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK that's it you sneaky, hot and attractive girl. Where are you?\", you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu then rose her head halfway and swam near a secluded spot of what seemed to be a small cave. You followed her without question and wanted to know what she was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you saw the cave it was very beautiful, the water reflecting all the crystals inside shining brightly like it was a party. Then you saw Kurumu slowly raising her body, the more you saw her the more how gorgeous she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the water was only up to your waists you saw her in her bikkini and you thought to yourself, \"She is drop dead hot in that!\", she was that good looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this spot the last time I came here and I thought maybe we could have it to ourselves for just a bit. Will you stay with me (Name), for just a little bit?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd stay with you forever my love.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two pressed your bodies against eacj other and madeout for about ten minutes. It was heaven for you two and just the love you made together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rejoined back with everyone and they didn't seem to notice your small diappearance, except Moka. You all then started to dance to some music that got everyone todo their own unique styles of dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone went freestyle when they heard the classic, \"Monster Mash\", song on the radio. Tskune laughed so hard when Mizore acted like a mummy when she seemed to act almost dead herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun started to set everyone took a break and cooled offon the sand. Moka and Tskune went on a walk together while you and Kurumu laid on the blanket side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curled up next to you resting her head over your heart. \"Hmm you think soon we'll just live somewhere just the two of us?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a strong feeling tat we will. But now I like how it is now, people who you know and trust, and peoople you love. And love more, and love even more, and love so much you just wanna take them and-\", you started tickling Kurumu and talked nonsense to get her to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahhahahhahahahaaaaa!!!! Stop it! Your heeeeheeeehaaaahahahhaaaaaa going to make me peeeeeeheeeeheeee myself!\" she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped thinking you had your fun, \"OK but watch out for the tickle monster cuz he likes you. And I'm not sure I can control him all the time.\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off (Name). Your too cute for your own good. I'd get back at you except I love you too much, but I'll get back at you later. Don't think I'll go easy on you.\", she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want it any other way my darling. Hmm your just so beautifull I can't help it. I love you Kurumu and nothing, NOTHING is going to change that.\", you swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And nothing will change the fact that I will love you until the day I die. Nothing will make me thonk otherwise even if I live passed you. You'll always be in my heart.\", she swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I can top that now can I?\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu laughed at that remark and hugged you tightly. \"No but I trust that you'd love me the same way.\", Kurumu said planting another kiss on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect, nothing could make it any better for the both of you.</span></div></div>",

I never thought you'd take it a step farther.\", Tskune said in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love her that much man. She's the one.

Later you all made it back to the school where you decided to spend the night with your fiancee. You then walked with her to her room where you two would maybe play around but no sex. Now's too early for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed you swore you saw Tskune with Moka earlier leaving for Moka's room but we know what happened last time so you paid it no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), I was wondering if you could help get this bikkini off me? I can't reach the strap.\", Kurumu said clearly trying to tease you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou of course did it and it showed off her ampple breasts. They seemed tto look more appealing each time they were in their full glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steady now Kurumu were waiting till that honeymoon comes by. Then we can have all the time in the world to get kinky in bed.\", you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah lets save up those urges for one night that'll be the best night of our lives. But for now, can you check to see if there is a cut on my lips?\", she asked with those puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I see this large scrape covering not JUST your lips but theres a cut on your tounge. Perhaps this calls for a long and overnight housecall wouldn't you agree?\", you said playing along with Kurumu's little lie trying to get you to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it needs a full day's check? Would you have the time?\", she asked knowing full well of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you I'd make time for a whole year.\", you answered kissing her passionatly on the mouth. This kiss lased for over 5 minutes. And afterwards you both kept on going until you each needed air. Eventually you both started to grow tired and slept throught the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just so happy that you and Kurumu were together. It made everything else meaningless as long as you two could still be together. Alone for a half hour would make your hearts ache with anticipation until you were holding eachother in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove was real between you two...</span></div></div>",

You lovely finnancee was waiting and she was the prettiest woman you would ever lay your eyes on. And even with all that...you were scarred beyond all reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on a chair just shaking worried that something would ruin it or if you could even go along with it. Well that last one wasn't really your concern but it was still very terrifying for you. You wondered if Kurumu was feeling any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually was feeling worse! Moka and Yukari tried to calm her down but she was feeling so frantic. She was pacing all over the room having a panic attack seeing how this was the moment she had waited for for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there! You'll be fine.\", Moka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine but I'm just scared that he might leave me at the alter, or what if things don't work out, what if WHAT IF?!\", Kurumu couldn't contain her fear of it all however Moka finally calmed her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen! He'll be waiting for you, it will all work out perfectly, and there is no what if! There is only YOU and HIM MARRIED TODAY. That's it, so trust yourself and in (Name) that it will work out.\", that was all Kurumu needed to settle down and finally cool off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged Moka thanking her for cheerring her up and getting her to her senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeaanwhile it was time for you to get to the alter where Kurumu was waiting to meet you up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood on that alter standing perfectly still waiting to see her. A minuet passed and you started worrying, but as luck would have it there she was. In her white gown, holding her bouquet of flowers, having thatcute smile and the sweetest puppy dog eyes she ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe met you up in the alter looking deeply into your eyes with both of your hearts racing. The priest said his piece and it was time to say your vows to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu began with hers,\"(Name) when I look at you, everything all makes sense to me. We had our share of moments of love but none of them will ever top this moment right here. Today is when we finally are two parts of a whole. And that whole I know without a doubt is our love. I see the passion the care and the comitment just by looking at you right now, and I know that you are my destined one. But now it's exceded that term, now your are part of my heart.\", she said crying at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your absolute best to try not to cry just yet but it was the hardest thing you ever had to do. Now it was your turn to say your ows to her, \"Kurumu, there are many thing about you I admire. Your loyalty, your bravery, but above all else you love. Never have I met anyone so speacial to me than that girl I saw look at me. Just from that I had this feeling we'd be together, but I couldn't know that we'd be here today about to make this bond right here. I don't know where we we be after this or what we will have to face. But I only know one thing that will never change. Kurumu today now and forever you are the my one and only love in this world to me. And as you said, you are the other half of my heart.\", you said tearfully happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest pronounced you man and wife and you both grabbed each other and kissed like nithing else before. You both left the church and ran to the limo where it was there that all that was left was the honeymoon.</span></div></div>",

Huuuhhhh they were so romantic.

Not at all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: (name) you sly fox. Didn't know you had it in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Tskune! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yes I know. (name) is a sly fox and he's the hunkiest guy I've ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu! Not in front of Tskune! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Anyway (name). I have a message from the Headmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Huh? The Headmaster? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Yes he wants to speak with you in private. You're not in trouble, but it's important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK. I'll go see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Oh and...... make sure you're well....... you know. (giggles)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at yourself you realise you had nothing, but boxers on. You blushed bright red and you use your shirt to cover yourself. After Rubi left you and Kurumu got dressed and walked to the Headmaster's office. On the way you met Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Good morning everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Morning Moka what's up? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I'm fine. Where are you all going? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: We were just heading for the Headmaster's office because he wants to see (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh no! I hope you're not in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry Moka. I'm not in trouble. Rubi said so herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh whew. For a minute I thought you were in trouble because you did it with Kurumu last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kurumu blushed a deep red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) B-b-b-B.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: How did you know that!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh um well.... you see.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: We kinda saw you in the doorway we we were doing it. So we.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: We wanted to know why you were spying on us and then we saw you doing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Don't worry about it. Besides we all saw each other doing it so that pretty much makes us even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: By the way (name) congrats on losing your virginity You lucky dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: You two Kurumu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed even more, but Kurumu was only blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Thank you. I mean it's only natural since (name)'s my boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Come on (name) Don't be so modest. It's true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed then you laughed too. Soon you arrived at the Headmaster's office. You were a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Well good luck (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah. (hugs) Be careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: If you need us we'll be right here..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Thanks guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked in the Headmaster was sitting at his desk waiting for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Ah (name) Good to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You wanted to see me sir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Yes. Regarding all the incidents that happened. I know everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) -gulp- Everything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Everything. As far as you fighting Kuyo and Keito bullying you and your friends. Rubi told me all the details about what happened between you and Kuyo including the part about almost dying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Let me be the first to say I'm sorry for all that's happened. Kuyo is being dealt with as well as Keito. Also I want to thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) For what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Fpr protecting this school and defeating Kuyo_ <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh no. It wasn't just me Tskune and the oters helped me even Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: I see, but just so you know this will remain strictly confidential and no one must know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: And there's something you should know. First let me ask: did you feel like you transformed when you beat Kuyo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well.... at the time I felt really strong and I didn't notice at the time, but Yukari told me the details. She told me that my left eye turned red and my hair turned silver. Do you know why sir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Yes I do, but before I tell you I should warn you. What I'm about tell you may shock you. Are you sure you want to know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about this for a moment then you decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes sir I need to know. It may shock me, but I can take it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Very well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused dramatically. Then he spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: First let me get to the point.

You're part human part monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Headmaster said these words you felt the world just froze in place. You stood there processing what the Headmaster just said.

How do you know this? How long have you known and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Headmaster raised his hand to silence me. Then he spoke in a serious tone. Gentle, but serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Do you remember what I told you before? Back when you first came here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(flashback) (credit goes to 2dayIsUrDay) <br>\r\nHeadmaster: \u201cWe never did tell you\u2026 that the reason for your enrolment\u2026 was to see if we could trial run a human peacefully existing with monsters. You may not know this, but a couple years back, another human student, Tsukune Aono, was discovered to be human and\u2026 It didn\u2019t really go down well with the School\u2019s Security Enforcement Committee. Some of the corrupt members tried to have him killed. That entire situation was rather unfortunate. Of course, at that time, we didn\u2019t have any proper channels for human enrolment at a school for monsters, which is why you were asked if you would like to enrol here.\u201d \u201cYou must understand though that it\u2019s a small minority of monsters who think poorly of humans. A lot of the students here have come from human schools all across Japan, and a lot of them peacefully coexist with humans.<br>\r\n(flashback ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes you told me I was a test to see if I could come to love this school and make friends right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Yes, but there's more to it. It was to protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But.... why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Well to start let me begin with your mother. How much do you know about her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well..... not much. My dad didn't tell me much about her really. Why? Did you know her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Yes. I knew her very well. She was one of the most powerful and brightest girls I've ever known back in Youkai Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wait. If you knew and if she was at Youkai Academy  then...... my mom was.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Yes she was a pure monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) N-no way! Why didn't my dad tell me this?!? I mean...... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt angry and upset, but the Headmaster calmed you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Calm down (name). He didn't tell because he as well as your mother wanted to protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) From what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Let start by telling you how they first met. You see back when I was your age: your mother like I said was one of the most powerful monsters here in Youkai Academy. She was the envy of all girls and the boys loved her. The reason for her being well known was not only for her beauty and her power, but her monster identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Do you know kind of monster she was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: No. No one knew what monster she was. Not even me and I was her closest friend. Anyway, back then your mother had the eye of every boy in the school, but she was unhappy. She wanted to love someone who loved her the way she was, not for beauty and power. So she and I decided to venture to the human world to find her true love and to make new friends. Eventually we ran into trouble with a couple of thugs and we couldn't do anything because we couldn't expose our monster forms in the human world. Then when we were about to reveal our monster forms, from nowhere a man leapt out and fended them off with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) And let me guess it was my dad wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Yes. Though he was human he was far from being an ordinary one. Then at that moment the thugs came to and hurt your father from behind and hit me in the eyes. At that moment your mother transformed into her monster form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Did you see what she looked like? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Unfortunately not. I was still blinded from the attack, but whatever she turned into it was enough to frighten the thugs away, but one man saw it. Your father. At first she and I thought he would run away in fear, but he didn't. He showed kindness and healed me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(flashback)<br>\r\nYour father: Are you alright friend? (putting on gauze)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Yes, but why aren't you scared of us? Were monsters. Human and monsters shouldn't be friends. You humans fear us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father: That may be so, but you monsters saved my life. and it doesn't matter if your human or a monster. What matters is the bond and the love you share. That makes you two friends in my book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Hearing these words your mother fell in love. She finally found the person she was looking for. The three of us became best friends and in due time nature took it's course and your mother was delivered a baby boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) And it was me wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Correct. However certain people opposed the match. Especially their parents. When they found out hey decided they had separated. Your father returned with you to human world while your mother stayed behind in the monster world never to see her husband or her son again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But i don't understand. Why did my parents' parents oppose them being together so much? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Because most monsters will always think humans are their enemies and vise versa. Thats why from now on you have to be careful because now that you know that you're a half human half monster, if anyone were to find out, you're enemies will surely come after you maybe even kill you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp nervously.<br>\r\n(name): Yes sir I will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: And make sure your friends don't tell either. It would be bad if certain enemies were to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry sir. Besides my friends I won't tell a soul. And if anything happens I'll always have friends backing me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Very good. You are dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bowed and you walked out of the office. Then you sighed and plopped down on a chair. You were completely overwhelmed about what the Headmaster told you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Man. As if things weren't crazy enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you got up and walked back to your room.

You look like there's something on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what the Headmaster said that it was okay to tell your friends, but you didn't want to spread drama around and decide to pick a place to go to get your mind off of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow where to? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot springs or the beach?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took a couple minutes but you broke the webbing and fell off. You fell flat on your back but weren't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled over near an axe where you attempted to get yourself free from the cocoon of silk. A few seconds later you got out and ran for a way out. Then you heard Keito speaking to somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me have at that succumbus my mistress.

From the sound of things Keito knew you had escaped. So you tried wandering in a darker area in hopes of hiding from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wandered looking for a way out but nothing seemed to show an opening. You heard spider noises that were coming from the walls and ceiling. And they sounded close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hmm what a clever little meal. Broke free of my silk and tried to escape, how very impressive. Ohhh but now your trapped and you only have to come back to me. But then again whoever said it had to be unpleasant?\", Keito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what she was hinting at she seemed to want to try and seduce you to her way of thinking so you were ready for any kind of tricks but hoped you would resist it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then crawled down and was right in your face only upside down. She then starded into your eyes and used her charm on you. You were ready for it this time so you looked away immediatly and tried to grab her and pin her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she hid back in the shadows after you got out of her little trap. \"Aww you don't want to look at me? Too bad I was thinking about replacing your girlfriend.\", she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try your games all you like!

So the more you see me with my irresistable charm the quicker you'll change your mind.\", she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it I WILL still have my own free will.\", you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then webbed you arms together and hung you up facing her, \"Who said we wanted to control your mind.

Keito coughed up some blood and looked at your new form with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: what the hell just happened? He's completely different now His eyes are filled with bloodlust and he's got a powerful monster energy within him. Where the hell did this power come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then let out a powerful and demonic roar that echoed throughout the town reaching the inn. When Tskune and the others heard this they gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: What the hell was that!?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I don't know.

Then a green flame appeared before you and was about to strike you but you dodged it by jumping out of the way. Then a woman with a powerful staff and a crow appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Mistress Tsubaki! You've come to save me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: So you're the boy I've heard about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Mistress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Shush Keito! It was your fault for provoking this boy.

You threw a powerful punch, but it was too late. Keito and the woman called Tsubaki disappeared. You roared with rage by letting them get away. Then you looked at the blood on your hands.

She's fine, but she's suffered multiple wounds from Keito. What scares me is Keito was strong enough to take down a S class monster like Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I know. After Kokoa told us what happened when she fought Keito, I've been getting a bad feeling.

It would seem you still have a lot to learn boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared in front of you and touched your forehead.

Only a few were able to control their monster side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) And my mom was one of those few right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Yes. She was the most talented. In any case remember many have tried and failed with the exception of your mother. Do you still want to go through with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You need to ask? Bring it! If my mom could do it then so can I! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's my (name)! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: You've got guts.

Here we go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her arm and you were all transported to a dimension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK Let's take a break!

Think for a moment, if we fight then you will be gone forever, never to return, but take my offer and allow yourself to survive and have your power known throughout the world.

HAHHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you woke up feeling very pleased with yourself and who could blame you? You mastered your powers and you got to make peace with your darker side. Then you remembered Kurumu looking sick the day before and you couldn't help but worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I hope Kurumu's OK. She seemed kinda sick. I'd better look for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got dressed and looked around the academy for Kurumu, but she was no where to be seen.

I was just looking for Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: You did good on training boy, but you picked a difficult path. Making your dark side join forces with you was unthinkable, but i have confidence that you'll be fine. Your mother did the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) She did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Yes. If that doesn't make you her son I don't know what will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Thank you old woman. I'll see you later I gotta find Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you left to find Kurumu the old woman's expression changed. She was now worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: He may have mastered his powers, but that doesn't change the fact that he's and his friends are still in danger. Tsubaki hasn't even attacked yet and I bet she want's revenge for what I did her to her years ago. If I wasn't under this curse I could tell him who I am, but the only way to be rid of the curse is that Tsubaki herself must be destroyed. But for now all I can do is watch over you and look out for you. Just be careful.......my son<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept looking for Kurumu, but you still couldn't find her. Then you saw Moka. if anyone knew where she was she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey Moka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh hey (name) what's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Have you seen Kurumu anywhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: well.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered what Kurumu said. She blushed and she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Who me I don't know..... hahahh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): are you sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Moka could answer a voice called out to you two. You both turned around and there was a young woman who looked like a teacher at Yokai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Excuse me if your looking for the girl she was heading for the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Got it thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka was glad that you went away, because she didn't want to tell you what Kurumu told you at least no yet. Then she noticed something the woman that was just talking to you disappeared. Moka was puzzled. One minute she was there and the next she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: That's strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka's rosary began to glow and the Inner Moka's voice came out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Hey! Be on guard. I'm sense a big monster energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What? Where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: I don't know, but you better check on Kurumu on (name). I have a feeling they're in danger. Hurry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Wait! What's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rosary fell silent. Now Moka was worried and she raced off to find Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in room where the newspaper club meetings were held, Kurumu was still feeling sick. She was pale and her stomach felt like it had a tornado. Yuakri and Mizore were trying to comfort her and feel better, but no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu? Don't you think you should go see a nurse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes. You look a little pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Don't worry. I'm fine. Just ate something bad.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rubi came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Hey wht's wrong Kurumu? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Geez..... I'm fine don't worry....ugh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: You know I have something that might help you feel better. Could you come with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu; I guess. I have nothing else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rubi and Kurumu left Yuakri and Mizore were trying to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I'm starting to smell something funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah Kurumu was way to sick to have an upset stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Something's gotta be going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Moka burst in panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yukari! Mizore! Where's Kurumu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuakri: Moka! What's wrong you look like you seen a ghost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Did something happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: My rosary spoke to me! It said there was a powerful monster energy here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuakri: Are you sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka; Yes! That's why I have to make sure that (name) and Kurumu are okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu just went with Rubi to get something to fix her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: By the way Moka, do you know why Kurumu's been acting sick and weird lately?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka blushed a little; flustered by the question. She tried to deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Um....uh no reason. Just ate something bad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuakri: Now I know something's fishy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: You DO know what's going on do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Um uh hi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka was about to freak out when Tskune and Rubi came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hey guys what's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuakri: Tskune! Moka's got a secret and she won't tell us about it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: No! It's not like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Anyway Rubi how's Kurumu? Did she take a medicine or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Huh? What are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Don't play dumb. You just left with Kurumu to give her something to ease her stomach problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: No I didn't. I was with Tskune the whole time. I swear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was long silence. Then the old woman burst through the door. She was worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Where is the boy? I can't sense him anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence then they all heard a scream down the hall and everyone knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: That sounded like Kurumu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: and it came from the classroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone raced to the classroom and barged through the door. Everyone gasped for the person standing there was Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Keito! I should've known you'd be here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: aww don't get a hi Moka? It has been a while though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Where's Kurumu? You jerk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hehehe you want her? Here she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped aside and there lying on the floor unconscious was Kurumu. Everyone gasped in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune; Kurumu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Oh no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hehehe my work here is done. Farewell losers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Keito disappeared. Everyone rushed to Kurumu's side and tried to wake her up, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Kurumu please wake up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Its no good. She out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: You don't think she's.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman stepped forward and felt Kurumu's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Don't worry. She's under a spell a powerful spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: If its a spell I can break it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: No. It's a powerful one. It can't be broken that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Do you know how to break it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Unfortunately I don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What'll we do?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Tsubaki had begun to make her move. If she targeted this girl she'll be after the boy next. Does anyone know where she went?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: He was heading for a cottage looking for Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: No! We must get to him before its too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you headed for the cottage where the young woman told you to go. At first you just wanted to find Kurumu, but then you had a bad feeling. You walked into the cottage and it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hello? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than you said those words you were suddenly ganged up on by a bunch of demons and they tied you up and cuffed you and gagged you. You tried to break free, but for some reason your power wouldn't activate. Then you saw Tsubaki. She chuckled and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: well this certainly is a surprised. You've grown so much boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to say something back to her, but you couldn't because you had your mouth stuffed with cloth and then you were blind folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Now. Away with him -but gently my pets, gently. I have plans for our guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while due to lack of oxygen and you were gagged you feel unconscious.

We're not gonna get anywhere by crying. We have to hurry and find (name) before its too late. I understand you care for the girl, but we must hurry. There may be a way to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at her as soon as they heard these words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Are you serious?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Tell us how!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: I can't tell you why, but (name) may be the only way to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Why is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the woman could answer Rubi flew through the window and landed in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Rubi. Did you find (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi looked very solemn as she held out a piece of you're clothing.

The forbidden castle is not only Tsubaki's strong hold, but it's a dangerous place. Everyone that has gone there has never come back alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I'm still going! (name)'s in danger as well as Kurumu. I want tosave both of them because they're my friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: If you're going then I am too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: That's makes three of us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Count me in too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Yes. I will go as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Are you sure? There's a possibility that you could all die! Tsubaki is ruthless and she wouldn't hesitate for a second to kill you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: We're still going! (name) and Kurumu are our friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: and we'll do whatever it takes to save them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman stayed silent and then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: OK If you're going to save them you'll need a guide. I'll take you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: You do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Yes. I know that place very well. I'll take you there, but i can't protect you so I can't guarantee your safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: We're still going. Besides if what you say is true...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name) may be the only one to save Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: We want them to be safe more than anything because they're our friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Very well. Let's go save my son!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Um huh.... nothing ahem. I meant let's go save the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the gang arrived at the castle. It was ominous and spooky looking. There were demon's everywhere, but the gang managed to sneak past them. There many more in the throne room, they were dancing around a bonfire celelbrating their victory. Tsubaki was siting on her throne petting her crow with Keito by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: A glorious day for victory right mistress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Yes,but what a pity (name) isn't here to enjoy the celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Yes. Too bad. He must be sad in that dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: I'm going to cheer him up. Stay here to..... enjoy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Yes mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsubaki went to the dungeon where you were being held with the gang following her close behind. Meanwhile you sat in the dungeon chained and sad. You struggled to get free, but for some reason you couldn't. Then the door opened and in stepped in Tsubaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Don't bother. Those chains have a spell on them that prevents you from using your powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What do you want? and what did you do to Kurumu?!? and what do you intend to do with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Oh come now (name). Why so glum and angry? A glorious future lies before you - you, the destined hero of a charming fairy tale come true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand on her staff and a picture of Yokai Academy appeared on the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Behold - Yokai Academy. And in yonder classroom, the succubis Kurumu sleeps in an ageless sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a picture of Kurumu appeared. She was still in asleep in the spell<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Yes. Indeed for a monster like her she is indeed, most wondrous fair. Her hair, blue like the ever blue sky, lips that shame the pink rose. In ageless sleep, she finds repose. The years roll by, but a hundred years to a steadfast heart, are but a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a picture of you coming out of the dungeon appeared, but you were different. You were old and weak and you looked like you were 60.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: And now, the gates of a dungeon part, and our prince is free to go his way. Off he rides, on his noble steed, a valiant figure, straight and tall! To wake his love, with a kiss from a boy bearing the burdens or both monsters and humans. And prove that monsters and humans can co-exist! Hahahaha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you knew what she wanted to do with you. She was going to keep you were for a long time until you were old and ruin the relationship you had with Kurumu. You sturggled with your chains trying to get to her so you could kick her ass, but to no avail the chains held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Why you....!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: I've had my amusement for today. I'll leave you with these.....happy thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Tsubaki left leaving you angry and struggling with your chains. After that Tsubaki went to her chambers to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: For the first time in years, I shall sleep well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you still couldn't get free. You tried calling to your dark self,but he wasn't answering either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) The chains must be blocking him too. Damn what am I gonna do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings looked very bleak for a moment, but then you heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Giving up already? That's not like you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see......</span></div></div>",

You heard a rattling sound but you knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be me but you must have a crush on me if you want me alone with you so much Keito. But your notgoing to have me eating our of your hand. Kurumu is alive, and you can't harm her anymore.\", you gloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not her.

But seriously don't do this! Because I'm really getting mad and you don't want me to get mad. You might bring out the worst in me.\", you warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One kiss and hate will be turned into love. Oh (Name) just lower your guard down and seal your fate...with a kiss.\", as she finished she grabbed your head and pulled you in for a long passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the toxin burning through your throat and your blood. It felt like it was on fire and your body was fired up like it was cooking your insides. Then as she stuck her tongue in you it was the most pleasurable yet repulsive taste you ever felt. Now the toxin made the pain even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to break free, and you were in constant agony from the poison. Your other more bestial side was coming out and he was furious. Keito believed the pleasure overtook the pain but she was dead wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Music as you turn into your monster form: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0E6WSOrK4A\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0E6WSOrK...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes turned red and you bit into Keito's lip forcing her to break away. She backed off and saw you break the chains dangling you over. You walked toward her slowly as your body morphed in to a terrifying beast. Keito knew now you had to do quickly so she shot out sharp spikes of her silk from her mouth laced with that same poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still kept on walking as the pain didn't even bother anymore and you fully turned into your true monster form. You ran toward her clawing her belly where her legs were connected and slashed a few off in one swipe. You slammed her against the walls over and over an had her against it and wanted to rip out her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you! F&amp;^%$ing monster....\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to kill her but even through all the pain she forced upon you...you couldn't kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes I'm a monster...but I'm human too! And no matter how much I want to...YOU WILL NOT MAKE ME KILL YOU!! I'm nothing like you or that crazy bitch! Besides the pleasure of killing deserves to be given to somebody else.\", you then broke both her legs and removed all of her spider ones. You walked away to leave her in her pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! What's going to finish me? The old witch?\", Keito taunted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen a shadow loomed over her, with a ponytail. \"Keito...this is for trying to kill (Name), seduce him, and kill me...\", said Kurumu beating Keito bluntly with a crowbar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this last one is for doing the worst deed of your existence...almost MURDERING MY VERY UNBORN CHILD!\", she yelled smashing Keito's head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran up to join the other where they vanquished the guards and taken most of the castle. \"Where is Ruby and Tskune?\", you asked the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\", Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a boasting voice echoed through the highest tower. ( Transform Music: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rdspri0BEM\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rdspri0B...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of you pathetic fools prepare to face oblivion!\", Tsubaki yelled throwing Moka and Ruby and Tskune on to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed all three with your monster body and saw her cast lightning to the sky. The tower exploded and the fire became alive comprising into a dragon body as well as Tsubaki turning into a dragon herself. The fire grafted on to her skin and after it was over she let out a monstrous cry that echoed through the whole monster world.</span></div></div>",

Are you gonna put me to sleep too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hahahaha Do you know what this is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) A spell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: hahaha Not just that..... it's an aphrodisiac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart stopped for you knew what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Are you sick?!? As if I'd do it with a 8 legged bitch like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: You'll be singing a different tune when I inject this in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got closer and prepared to inject the spell in you. You struggled and struggled, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No! Stay the hell away from me!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito wasn't listening she grabbed a hold of your arm and got ready to inject the spell in you. You closed your eyes and looked away. You silently screamed from someone to help you, but you knew that no one was coming. A single tear dripped from your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu......I'm so sorry....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hehehehe Now your'e mine.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when all hope seemed lost: a washtub appeared out of nowhere and hit Keito on the head knocking her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I know that trick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and there in front of you were the old woman, Tskune, Moka and the rest of the gang. You were about yelp in surprise, but the old woman stopped you by covering your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Shhh. Quiet. There's no time. Hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Mizore broke the chains of setting you free. Then Tskune and Moka brought you up to speed about what was going on. (not the part of kurumu being pregnant yet)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) So where's Kurumu now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: She's back that the academy, but we have to hurry there's not much time. Kurumu's life force is dwindling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: OK, but be careful we have to sneak out of here before we're caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you guys sneaked out of the dungeon and all was going well as we made your way to get out of the castle until......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattle with the forces of evil<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWsdd3ZgFxc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWsdd3Zg...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki's crow appeared and as soon as it saw you all it started cawing up a storm and flew away around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubii: Oh crap! That crow was Tsubaki's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) This way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI point down a hallway and raced down to it with the others close behind you. Next you all went down a flight of stairs. Then halfway down the stairs, came trouble. You all saw Tsubaki's crow again this time it had buddies. Demon buddies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Oh no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Run!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe raced back up the flights of stairs with the demons hot on our heels. We tried to find an exit, but every exit we went to was blocked by more demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Damn! Should we fight them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: No! We have no time to deal with them! We must get to Yokai!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: But we can't keep running forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I see a window. It was a perfect escape, but it was a long way down. I cooked up an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore! Can you make a ice slide out this window?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'm way ahead of you (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped out the window and made an ice slide while she was falling with all of you  following close behind. As soon as you all make it to the ground safely the demons followed, but Mizore had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I don't think so!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punched the ice slide and it turned into a snake of spikes knocking every demon that dared cross it. Then we kept running then.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: (name) look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere on the upper wall was a whole army of demons firing arrows with fire. It was like a swarm of meteors. Then Yukari stepped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Don't worry guys We got this one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her wand and turned the arrows into flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Good job Yukari!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the crow appeared again, this time it knew it was in trouble, so there was only one thing the crow can do: get Tsubaki. It flew off in the direction of Tsubaki's tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka; Oh no! If that crow gets to Tsubaki it's all over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nold woman: Leave it to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) old woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: I may look old to you, but i got a trick or two up my sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up her hands like she was holding an arrow and a flame arrow appeared in her hands. She pulled back and released the arrow the crow barely landed on the perch where Tsubaki was and the arrow hit it! The crow was in flames and then it turned to stone. You all stood there dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Nice shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: How did you...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Come on! We have to hurry! Tsubaki's bound to be awake by all that commotion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Name) Right! Let's move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all continue to run and you all ran and ran until you all run out of the castle. Meanwhile Tsubaki woke up to all the racket and going to tell the demons to simmer down. Then she saw the crow in stone and then she saw you guys running out side the gate escaping the castle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: No! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you and your friends knew Tsubaki was awake and she was not gonna let you all of that easy. Using her staff she fired endless thunderbolts at you all, but you all dodge them all. Yokai Academy grew closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Oh great! Now's she's shooting lightning bolts at us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Just keep running Tskune! We're almost there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(thinking): Don't worry Kurumu were coming for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsubaki raised her staff and began a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Send these fools straight to their doom. With thorns made to be their tomb! Now round Yokai and cast my spell, Go now my curse serve me well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a black cloud appeared over Yokai academy and rained. Then a forest of thorns erupted from the grpund and surround Yokai Academy and blocked your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What the..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: What is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Tsubaki's most powerful spell. Almost nothing can get past these thorns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: We'll see about that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired a couple of icicles, but they bounced off the thorns like they were nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Not even Mizore's ice can break past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: How are we supposed to get to Kurumu now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff the distance I could hear Tsubaki laughing. Laughing with triumph because she won. You racked your brain to figure out what to do. Then the old woman spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: I know a way to break through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Only a powerful person with a strong monster energy can break through these thorns. and he's standing front of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you with grim and worried eys. Right there she knew she was reffering to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What? (name)? Why......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: (name) is the only one who can cut through those thorns. Because he as the power to do so. Only if he awakens the power inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: But what if he goes berserk again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Yes. He could kill us and be just what Tsubaki wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wracked your mind trying to figure out what to do. Then you'll take a deep breath and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'll do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: (name) are you crazy? You could go bererk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I know, but I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing this for the future of human's and monsters to coexist in peace. Most of all I'm doing this for all of you. All this time I've been protected by you guys. Now it's my turn to protect you. Especially Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: (name).......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: You are just.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was inspired by your speech. The old woman smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Well spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I do have one request though. I would......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?</span></div></div>",

I'm coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your body exploded in an aura, but the aura was different. Instead of a red aura it was orange. Then a flame sword appeared on your right hand and a sheild on your left. You had a cape of flames and your aura turned into armor (making it look like this but red imagine ok? <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/art/Red-Eyes-Black-Joey-217076170\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.deviantart.com/art/Red-Eyes-B...</a>) and both of your eyes turned slitted and gold. Everyone was amazed. Then using your sword you slashed your way through the thorns. You thought you slashed through a whole mile, then you saw Yokai Academy up ahead and the path was clear. You toward the academy determined to save Kurumu. Meanwhile Tsubaki saw the whole thing and she was furious!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: NO! I won't let this happen!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her staff and turned into a bolt of lightning and was headed straight for you. She flew right past the rest of the gang making them alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: That was Tsubaki!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: She was headed straight for (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: We have to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: No! There's nothing more we can do. All we can do is pray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka looks at the old woman and she can see that she was worried about you as much they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Why is she so worried about him? She's acting just like his mom. Wait.....could she be......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you headed straight for Yokai Academy. At first you thought it was gonna be smooth sailing from here, but then a lighning bolt struck in front of you and Tsubaki appeared in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Tsubaki! Get out of my way! You've lost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: You've done well to make it this far boy......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises her staff, you brace yourself and stay on gaurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: but know you deal with me....and all the power of MY HATRED!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed her staff down and she exploded in flames. You look up in shock as the flame grew bigger and bigger until a dragon emerged from the flames. It wasn't just me that was in shock, the gang saw the dragon from where they were standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What....what is that thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: That must be.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Tsubaki's true form<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes the dragon was big, but you didn't back down. You let out a battle cry and charged at Tsubaki. Then Tsubaki fired a blast of fire from her mouth. You managed to block it with your sheild, but just barely. The force from the blast was so strong it knocks you flat on your back. Then she fired another blast again. She was gonna try to take you out while you were down. Luckily you rolled out of the way just in time. You then took a giant jump and hid the forest of thorns and waited. Then you saw Tsubaki's dragon head slowly come toward you. She doesn't see you so you wait till she was close then you struck! Using your sword of flames you slash Tsubaki over and over managing to cut her place a little. Then you hide in the forest trying to do another sneak attack, but then Tsubaki fired a blast of flames not at you, but the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Damn! She's trying to smoke me out! I have to get to higher ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your strength you leap from the burning forest and lannded a rock, but Tsubaki was hot on your heels as she snapped her jaws trying to kill. You fought back slashing your flame sword at her to repel her attacks or you being killed. Then you tried to fly away, but Tsubaki uses her claw to slash at your wing severely cutting it. It didn't hurt, but you couldn't fly anymore. Then when you took a step backwards you felt nothing, but air you almost fall and you realize that you were trapped. You had no where you run and you couldn't get away, but you stood you're ground. Then distaster strikes; Tsubaki blasted another blast, but this time the force was so strong that it knocks your sheild away. You lost your only defence and know the only thing you had left was your sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Damn it! Now what do I do?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki got ready to finish you off as she charged her firebreath one more time. You screamed at yourself the same question over and over again in your head. what do I do? Then you have an idea. You remembered your dark side and its power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I could use my dark sides power for help and end it, but then again I could just use my sword  and end it that way so I won't have to go berserk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You put your hands you with your flame sword in one hand and it grew bigger as you prepared to aim. Tsubaki saw what was going on and fired her biggest dragonbreath of all. As soon as she did......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) This is the end! Flame sword from my body! Make this evil fall! End this battle once and for all!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you fired your flame arrow with all your might and it flies straight at Tsubaki. It cuts through her flame and pierces her straight at the heart. The dragon roars in pain echoing through out the land even reaching where Moka and the others. The dragon staggers and then she falls straight toward you with her mouth open. It was obvious she was trying to take you with her, but you dodge her attack just in time,The dragon falls over the cliff and with a defining boom. You look over the cliff and see nothing else but a pile of ashes and your flame sword. You breathe a sigh of relief for you knew the battle was over. The thorns slowly disappeared along with the flames. You turned toward Yokai Academy and clenched your fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hold on Kurumu. I'm coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran toward the academy and ran through the halls looking for your love. Then as soon as you opened the next room to the infirmary there was Kurumu. She looked lifeless as you approached her quietly. You touched her skin which was very cold. That's when you realize you were too late. Tears begin streaming down her face as you hugged her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No.......please.......Kurumu.....I'm so sorry. Even if I have all this power I failed......I failed......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with great care you kissed her passionately and you lie face at the foot of your bed and cried. As you were crying all the color returned to Kurumu's face and she slowly opened her eyes. When she saw you crying she was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey. (name) Why are you crying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Because...sniff.... you're dead Kurumu.......sniff.....wait....WHAT!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and you see Kurumu sitting up looking at you like you were crazy. When you saw this you cried tears of joy and hugged and cried Kurumu like crazy. Everyone else showed up in the room and when they saw you hugging and crying Kurumu they can only smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) WAAAAAAHHHHH! You're OK! You're OK! I can't believe you're OK! WAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Geez! (name) What're you crying for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Thank goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you all explained what happened to Kurumu and she was shocked at first, but when she heard you defeated Tsubaki and saved her. She hugged you like mad and was screaming how proud she was for being your lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name) You are the best boyfriend in the whole world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Thank you. Id.....do.. anything for.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen due to weakness, exhaustion, and stress on the body you faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the next morning you wake up and Kurumu and the gang as well as the old woman were by your bedside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: You fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hey (name) you always faint under pressure or are you always wishy washy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughs while you blush with embarrassment. Then the old woman and Kurumu have serious looks on their faces. Then they both speak at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name) there's something I need to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld woman: Boy. there's something I need to tell you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Whoa one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which you do you want to listen to first?</span></div></div>",

I'm trying to make up for all thosse years of abandonment!\", she slipped in her rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abandonment? Wait...you can't be...\", you said unable to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she exposed her identity she then transformed from an old woman into a young adult woman.

The mixed feelings came rushing through your mind, anger, love, resentment, sadness, but in one single act you did one thing. You hugged your mother tightly as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW?! How have you been hiding this whole time?!\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everywhere...listen (Name) I wanted to be there for you but I couldn't. The headmaster help clear some of the facts by now?\", she asked so she wouldn't be repeating what you already knew. You nodded to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was forced to leave you it tore me apart. I fell into a long depression after that. Spent a long time alone for a while.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks later it was the biggest day of yours and Kurumu's lives. The day of your wedding. Everyone you and the gang knew was going to be coming including the headmaster. You and Kurumu were in separate rooms getting ready. Although there was a little trouble. On the girls side......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap,oh crap! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup Kurumu was panicking. Frantic actually. She was running around all over making sure she was perfect and freaking out if she'll threw up (due to the fact that she's pregnant by three weeks), and she was worried that you'd ditch her at the altar. Moka and the girls tried to calm her down, but Kurumu kept panicking. Moka had no choice, but to grab her shoulders and shake her (not to hard) to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Kurumu! You have to calm down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah you're turning into a nervous wreck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: More like a nervous breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I can't help it! What if he leaves me standing in the alter?!? What if.....WHAT IF......?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) That's quite enough Kurumu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turns around and there standing in the doorway ws your mother Akane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Ms Akane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane: Hello everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane: Getting the wedding jitters Kurumu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Please don't tease me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was adjusting her hair in the mirror and trying to fix it. Then Akane calmly walked behind Kurumu and began fixing her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane: Here. Let me help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu stopped being frantic and finally relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane: If it helps any I understand how you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane: Yes. I was the same way when I was marrying my husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Really? You?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuakri: A monster as powerful as you are?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane: Yes. I was in the same state as you are right now Kurumu. Hahaha I was a nervous wreck. But then I realized my husband loved me for who I was and I loved him back. And that's why you should believe that too Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Thank you Ms. Akane...I mean mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane: No problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her a hug and Kurumu felt better. Then she began thinking about how you were doing. Actually you were just as worried as she was. You were shaking like a leaf and you were thinking of the exact same thing as Kurumu was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What if she doesn't like me anymore?!? What if she leaves me hanging?!? WHAT IF SHE DOESN\"T THINK I\"M WORTHY!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: (NAME) GET IT TOGETHER!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes you stand straight like a solder at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: You listen here! Kurumu loves you no matter what! Why do you think she stood by you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: No buts! Do you love her!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: You want to be a good husband?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Do you want to be with Kurumu forever!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Good! Now get your butt out there and show her what a man you really are!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Sir yes Sir!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou salute and you march out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3grMB5wBFhs\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3grMB5wB...</a> (We are one Lion King 2)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater you stood at the alter waiting for Kurumu you were a lot calmer, but you were still nervous. A few minutes passed and then as soon as the clock struck 11 there was Kurumu. She was wearing a white gown and had a red rose bouquet. Her eyes twinkled like a pair of stars and her smile was so dazzling you would have to get a pair of sunglasses. When you saw her she looked so beautiful you thought you jump out and kiss her like crazy, but you kept your lust in check. You gulp and told yourself to focus. She met you up in the alter looking deeply into your eyes with both of your hearts racing. The priest said his piece and it was time to say your vows to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name) You've done so much for me. You loved me, you protected, me and you've been there for me and I've been truly grateful. There were times when I thought when we'd be separated and I felt you'd dump me, but now I realize that you love me with all your heart and you've showed me more than one occasion. And I see that you love me with all your heart and I only have one request......please take good care of me and......(sniff) I love you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of her speech she was in tears, but they weren't tears of sadness. They were tears of joy. You did your best not to cry, but the tears streamed down your face. Now it was your turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu. When I first came to Yokai I never would've thought I'd be going on a wild a crazy adventure. And I never would've guessed that I would run into an amazing girl like you. Sometimes I feel like  I'm not worthy to be the husband of a girl so pretty. You cared for me, you cried for me, and what's more you protected me with your life. Also you helped me find my real mom and now I feel like the luckiest guy in the world. I have a mom again, great friends, and most of all, I have the greatest girl the whole world. I don't know what the future lies in store for us, but I'm sure of one thing: We'll always be together and I'll always love you now and forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of your speech tears of joy streamed down your face. Tskune and the other in the crowd were crying a little as well. Especially your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane: (sob) That's my son...sniff....what a man my son tuned out to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: There, there, there, Ms Akane....sniff.....I'm happy for him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriest: (name) do you take Kurumu as your lawfully wedded wife?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriest: Kurumu do you take (name) To be your lawfully wedded husband?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriest: Then by the power vested in me: I now pronounce you man and wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted Kurumu up bridal style and you both gave each other a long and tender kiss. Everyone cheered and Kurumu threw the bouquet in the crowd and surprisingly Moka caught it. One thing's for sure this wedding was the best wedding you and Kurumu ever had.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks after the wedding, you all celebrated with a party. You then told everyone the good news about Kurumu being pregnant. At first everyone was shocked, but then they were happy because they would soon be uncles and aunts (more or less). Then you realized that you and Kurumu didn't exactly find a place to live yet so your mother had Kurumu live with you until they could find a place. Your father was in a surprise when he saw you with Kurumu. You forgot your father didn't know you and Kurumu were married, so you were a little worried that he'd be mad. Not to  mention that you got Kurumu pregnant. But he smiled and was very happy. He was proud that not only did you get a girl, but he was also gonna have a grandchild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months later Moka and Tskune and gang decided to check on you and Kurumu so they decided to pay you a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Man It's been a while since we've seen (name) and Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuakri: I know. It's practically almost been a year since we've seen them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I wonder how they're doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: I've heard things have been going great. (name)'s parents got back together and are spending a lot of time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Have you heard from (name) and Kurumu Rubi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Well It has been almost a year now. I'm pretty sure they're fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the gang reached your house. It was technically your father's and mother's place, but they went away on a trip recently so you and Kurumu were by yourselves. So you called your friends over to your place so you could pay you and Kurumu a visit. Moka rang the doorbell and you opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey! Glad you could make it guys come on in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou led everyone to the living room and prepared some tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: So (name) how are things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Just great Moka! My parents are happy and so are me and Kurumu. And you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Just fine actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: So hows Kurumu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) She's fine. She just went to get dressed. She'll join us pretty soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you all heard a familiar voice. The gang saw who it was, but they couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hello everyone. Looks like the gangs all here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey Kurumu. How are you feeling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I'm fine just a little tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kurmu, but was completely different. Her belly was huge! She was about nine months pregnant and she was wearing a blue maternity dress. When the gang saw this they just stared her blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey what's wrong everyone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah you look like you seen a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Can you blame us?!? Kurumu! You're huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuakri: Not to mention your tits are even bigger than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hahahaha well duh That's what's supposed to happen when you're pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hahahaha Yukari that comment was a little perverted dontcha think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blushes and bows<br>\r\nYuakri: I'm sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu sits down on the couch next to you.<br>\r\nKurumu: Hahaha It's okay. You have nothing to be sorry for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's just kinda shocking seeing you.......well....pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hahaha I know. I mean who would've thought right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: So how many months are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I'm about 9 months. The final trimester actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasps when she says this comment, then the girls squeal with joy and surrounded Kurumu. They were completely excited and began asking Kurumu a whole bunch of questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: That means the baby's gonna be born soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuakri: Do you know what it is yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Is it gonna be a monster or a human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Well since (name)'s Half human half monster and I'm a full monster I guess that probably makes the baby 3/4 of a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Easy everyone don't overwhelm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Can you blame them? (name) you lucky dog! You're gonna be a father soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I know. I can hardly believe it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu? Can I touch your belly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hahaha sure. Go right ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari gently placed her hand on Kurumu's belly and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Wow. It's hard to believe there's a baby inside of you Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hahaha. I know. I still can't believe it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I wanna feel too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mizore place her hand on her belly too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Wow Mizore. I expected your hands to be cold, but it's surprisingly warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I may be a snow witch, but I can control my temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka wanted to feel too, but she hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Moka what's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I've seen this on TV. Every time someone rubs the belly that causes the person to go into labor! I don't wanna be the cause of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all stared and then you all laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Moka. You've been watching too many dramas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Besides it's just a myth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: It's okay it's not gonna bite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one of Moka's hands and placed it on her belly. Moka at first was nervous, but then she relaxed a little. Then she felt something in her belly move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Hey! I think I felt a kick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: No way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hahaha see? The baby likes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen later everyone settled down and you decide to talk to Tskune alone. You told him a little about your parents getting back together and you and Kurumu thinking of names for the baby if it was a boy and a girl. Then you and Tskune stared into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: (name) You're lucky. You're married, you're gonna have a daughter or a son soon. Man. I'm a little jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha Don't worry Tskune. Soon you'll be married to Moka and be having kids before you know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Heh thanks. I wonder what my kids will look like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer Mizore bursts through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: What is it Mizore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Mizore say?</span></div></div>",

You had little experience of driving but didn't care. You drove through several 4 way intersections, went passed a one way street, and nearly got in ten car accidents on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow you managed to get to the hospital in one piece is a miracle in of itself but you carried Kurumu to the emergency office as the doctors huddled around her. \"She's going into labor!\", you yelled. The doctors took her to a room so she can be taken care of properly. You wanted to go with her but they suggested you to sit and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm her husband dammit let me in!\", you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't we need to prep her and keep her from losing the baby wait here.\", said one of the nurses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agony of the patience took one hell of a tool on you since you shook in your seat like it was sub zero. You stared at the clock hoping it to go by fast, but not too soon. Too soon would mean something bad, while too late would mean something bad. You noticed whatever the case you were terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA calm hand over your shoulder tapped you and you instantly panicked for a moment. It was only Tskune and the others who made it a few minutes later. \"Excuse me? Who brought the young lady in?\", a doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose up and answered him, \"I did sir. She is my wife. Is she..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is fine, the babies are fine.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babies?\", Moka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had twins the whole time. Both girls, you can all come in and see her now.\", the doc said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka, Tskune come with me.\", you asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked with you and you entered the room seeing Kurumu with your children. Kurumu smiled as you three came in. \"Come meet your daughters (Name).\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are perfect...just like their mother...\", you kissed Kurumu on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka, Tskune, we were thinking it for a while and we want the both of you to be their god parents. If there is any other couple we'd trust with them..it's you two.\", Kurumu told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumu, were....honored to say the least...\", Moka said crying. Tskune hugged Moka seeing the two newborns wrapped in their blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyou.\", Tskune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held one of your daughters in your arms and thought of a name for her. \"Who do you want her name to be?\", Moka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For her...Jin. As gentle, and soft as her mother and caring as her dad.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other, we'll name Ty Lee. Calm as her father in times of pressure and beautiful as her mom.\", Kurumu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are lovely names. Can..I..\", Moka wanted to hold one of them in her arms, to which Kurumu lent Ty lee over to Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww...you are just the most adorable little thing. So much love in your family. You'll have a great life little one.\", Moka told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the others entered to see the kids and they did what you'd naturally expect them to react. The night passed and the twins were in perfect care. You were by Kurumu's side throughout the whole night and dreamed how the girls would one day turn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried tears of joy in your sleep to which Moka saw when she checked on the both of you and wiped them off without waking you almost as if she were doing it for her own child. Around that night Moka knew from them that she wanted a baby with Tskune but time would tell for it to be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Kurumu slept on through the night, the newest chapter in your lives began from that point on.</span></div></div>",

I just want to make you proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course were proud of you Ty Lee. Your doing what YOU want to do and it's all we want you to become. We may not have the same interests but you and me always stuck together when Jin or Mom got on your nerves when they teased you. Your not the love sick puppy your mom was in her highschool years, but you do have her heart and brains. And theres nobody else in the world who would be any better a sibling to Jin except maybe you. You two bikker time to time but you'll both be around to take a bullet for each other without thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Im sorry for what I said about you and mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know baby. But trust me when I say your mom's pride and joy and mine too. And no matter what it will NEVER change.\", you swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy hugged you and you returned her hug. \"Ah dad, you always know what to say for these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a talent, like your knowlege of monsters and things I would fail in if it was on a test.\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, daaaad. Your, just the best.\", Ty said as you let her be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee wraped the fang around her neck and it made her feel like she was connected to herself more than ever. She seemed to accept her Succubi half and that it will bloom when it's ready as she is. She found comfort in having her father understanding her as well as his trust with such a personal gift given to his mother. To Ty Lee this was her most cherished possesion ever given to her father, and she would take care of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it go with Ty?\", Kurumu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's better. I wonder...are we..not doing enough for them? Like are we not being there for the both of them equally?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I do know were not being terrible parents. I know you and I are doing our best for our children. And I know we'll find a way to put it right.\", Kurumu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Kurumu. I can't ever imagine any part of my life without you in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and your the best of my my life, but not better than Jin or Ty Lee. They'll always take higher priority over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little harsh huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My children mean more to me than anything else like a mom should. But you mean alot as well and I'd be just become destroyed if anything bad happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know my love, but don't worry. Life is good here and our lives are peacful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your right...I just worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take relife that if anything happens, they should know not to mess with me. Come here you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed Kurumu and tried to tackle her, she struglled and got out of your grip and tried to run but you dove into her and playfully rolled around the living room. You stopped to look at each other and slowly you both smiled. You kissed passionatly on the lips together and gently bumped your foreheads together as sign of your love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll always be together right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jin and Ty Lee saw you two together in the back watching you. Jin spoke up and asked, \"And we'll all be together right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\", Kurumu answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls let me tell you something that my mother told me. 'No matter what is shown in front of you, just remember that your heart will always be the best thing to guide you. And so your loved ones.\", she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all huddled in for a group hug and embraced eachother like a family.</span></div></div>",

Jin became one of the most popular girls in the entire school. She was also great at sports. In fact she was even better than the boys. Ty Lee however stayed focused on her studies. She was focused on researching on her heritage on her powers and she loved every bit of information that she could find. She soon became well known as the smartest girl in school that rivaled Yukari Sendo. Later that day, Jin, Ty Lee and Yuki were now all having their lunch period together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Mmmmmm!! (stretching). Man! What a day! Being one of the best girls in sports can sure be tiring. The boys are no challenge at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki: That's because they're either gawking at you or trying to get you to go out with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Why me? Why am I cursed to being so beautiful and having all the boys in school fall at my feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki: (sweatdrop). I think you may be stretching the truth a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yuki looked over at Ty Lee. She was in her own little world reading a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki: Hey Ty Lee. Whatcha reading? A dating book?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Very funny. No, just a book on dragons. I'm trying to see what powers and abilities they have and see if I have those abilities and powers. I want to be as strong as my dad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki: Oh come on Ty, you should be trying to find your mate. After all, you are part succubi and part dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Like I said before I don't have time for love. It's scarce and I don't want any part in it. Besides boys are in it for the looks and I'm not that good looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Oh come on sis, you're putting yourself down girl! You're really good looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki: Yeah! You have a very pretty face and you got nice eyes and ooh! you have a nice butt and a big pair of....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: OK let's not go there Yuki. Look I don't want to fall in love right now the only thing I'm focused on right now is finding out my abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ty Lee returned to her book and Yuki and Jin shrugged their shoulders and went back to talking about boys. As Ty Lee read her book, she thought about what Jin and Yuki had been saying about finding her mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee (thinking): Yeah right. Me? Getting a mate? Not gonna happen besides I don't even know if I'm strong or good enough to get a mate. Now if you don't mind, I have to keep trying to figure out my powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered the necklace that you gave her last night. She looked at it and glistened in the sunshine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: I wonder if this necklace dad gave has some sort of secret? Maybe it can help me with my powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to see if the ruby had some kind of secret, but it looked like a plain ruby dragon fang. Then.....</span></div></div>",

You heard of the ancient dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, suppose I can explain.  Nope there's too much let me sum up, the mighty dragon Sozin nearly burned down a great city. The only way to stop him was sacrificing myself in exchange the gods smite it from creation. So now I have spent the last 1000 years in this book. So naturally I'm an expert in dragons. But your name escapes me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn the page to 24601.\", she did so revealing the eyes of Ronin himself. \"I see that the gods blessed me with a most lovely figure. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been trapped for 1000 years? Is there a way to free you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But doing so would resurect Sozin. However, I imagine that there's a way to free me without revivng the dragon now that magic and science has evolved no doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy to free you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me by my other name, Inigo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal!  You are THE Inigo Ronin! The master of 4 elements and the dragon lord?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last part wasn't my intended name for my legacy but yes. Now I need you to keep me a secret from your friends and family. If I am not mistaken your father is half dragon. And his mother is too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,  most half dragons view me as a dark magic weilder. But I use dark magic for peace not conquest. I'm misunderstood, like you Ty lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, \"Your secret is safe with me.\"</span></div></div>",

So not only your father is half human and half dragon, but your mother is succubi as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Hahaha. Yeah. More or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Amazing. That would make you one fourth human, one fourth dragon, and half succubi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Well....yeah. Pretty much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Incredible. That would explain why you're so beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: (blushing) Th-thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: And you also have a twin sister named Jin right?

She can be stuck up, over confident, and she thinks about nothing, but finding her destined to be. It's so annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: She seems the perfectionist type of girl. Aside from the over confident and stuck up parts isn't it natural for a succubi to find her destined to be? You and your sister are succubi after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: I know, but there is such a thing as restraint. Besides I'm not really interested in finding a boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Well because.....I don't think anyone would be interested in me. I'm not like my sister. She's the one with the good looks in the family. I mean she's got every single boy at her feet. Me? All I ever do is read my books. I don't think I deserve to meet my destined one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: That's not true. You're a very beautiful girl. And personally I think you deserve to meet your destined to be. You should be more confident in yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee (blushing): R-really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Really. And if I may venture in opinion, you read to find out more about your powers and your heritage right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Yes. More than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: I can teach you some things if you wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Really? You can?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Yes. I can teach you everything there is to know about dragons. After all, I am an expert on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: And........you think I'll become strong enough to get you out of that book?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: I can't promise anything, but I can guarantee that you will understand your potential and your powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Thank you. Um.....Ronin? Can I ask you something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Of course. Ask me anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Well....do you think I'm....weird?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Why would you ask that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Well.....I.......I'm not like other succubi.....I'm a bookworm and all I do is read. Doesn't that......make me strange?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Strange? Weird? Hahahaha. Certainly not. Ty Lee, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me in a thousand years. Yes, people like us are sometimes misunderstood about our craving of knowledge, but I feel that I can understand you when I talk to you and that is my most sincere feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Yeah. Me too. I feel the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ty Lee let a short yawn and she covered her mouth with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Oops sorry.

It's late and you should sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: OK, but will you still be here when I wake up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a page came up from the book and turned into a paper rose bookmarking the place where Ronin's page was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: I promise.

I've learned everything from the most powerful spells to the most advanced bending techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: No way!

The instinctivly talked to the first person they saw. \"Excuse me, can you tell me what's going on?\", asked Jin. It turned out to be Ronin when he was not in the book.\"Ronin? Hey what's happening? Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jin it's a memory, no one can see or hear us.\", Ty Lee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin saw a body being taken to a morgue when someone called his name. \"Inigo! Come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sozin, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not wise to wander at this late hour Inigo. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to see if the rumors were true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid they are Inigo,  they are true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the the castle as well?

Would you reconsider your decsision then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something you wish to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Sozin, nothing. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, goodnight Inigo. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee and Jin saw Ronin leave and followed him growing curious as to Inigo's shady nature with Sozin. Ronin went deep in the old castle's catacombs and caught someone in a secret room. \"Evening Takagi. I know you meant well, I don't think you meant it to kill anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You don't understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The least I can do is see the thing that murdered that woman is slaughtered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't him, Caro never killed no one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand aside, Takagi! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ceysamatherium!\", a white blast of light lite the cave revealing the beast. It was a dragon! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee reached out calling Ronin's name but her and Jin were being pulled back out of the memory. Soon the book flung open and Jin and Ty Lee landed on the floor to Ronin's relief. \"Holy shit.\", the twins both said seeing what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ronin, what was that? With the dragon? What were you persuading with Sozin about? And why is it me asking all the questions and not Ty Lee? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inigo.....why didn't you tell me? Caro.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Ty? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dragon is our ancient ancestor. Of dad's mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin gasped and starred at Ronin. He lowered his head in shame, \"It wasn't my fault I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Caro was a peacful dragon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Sozin!  Listen,  it's complicated but there's a reason why I was hesitant about being revealed to your parents. I was partly to blame for Caro's death. I mistakenly assumed he murdered one of Sozin's subjects but I learned the beast that did it was one only Sozin could control.  Sozin discovered what I found out and that started the battle between me and him. We were argueing over who would be the one to be the one to help raise Caro's next and final son. But the newborn couldn't leave it's nest until it was at least a year old. Castle was it's nest, and since Caro was blamed for the murder Sozin prepared to burry the dragon egg. Unless Caro was found there was a risk his kin would be just as dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you allied with Caro to kill Sozin while Takagi cared for the dragon baby. \", Jin pieced together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takagi was Caro's nurturer. He saved Caro's son before Caro passed away due to both the injuries both I and Sozin inflicted upon him. I'm so sorry for keeping it from you Ty Lee. \"</span></div></div>",

For one thing, you took part in killing my ancestor, but you didn't know the truth back then. Also, let me ask. Do you regret for what you did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Yes. I did. I almost single handedly killed your bloodline. I've been trying to make amends ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Then it's OK. Sozin was the real bad guy here, not you. You made up for it by helping Caro. If you hadn't done that, the generations after that would never have been born including me and sis.

You greeted Kurumu at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu honey! I'm home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hi honey. How was work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You know same as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Well I'm glad you're home honey. Come on in and you can tell me your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to walk in your house, but then you sensed danger. You felt an energy that made your hair stand on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name). What's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a giant boulder came flying out of nowhere and came crashing at your front door. There was nothing, but smoke. When the smoke pulled clear, you were holding Kurumu in your arms safe and sound. Your hands and feet had turned into dragon claws and your wings shielded you and Kurumu from the debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kurumu? Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (cough) I'm fine. But that the heck was that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I don't know, but get inside. You'll be in danger out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: But (name)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Go! Hurry! Make sure our daughters are safe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu hesitated at first because she was worried about your safety, but then she understood and rushed inside. Now you could focus on the fight without <br>\r\nworrying about Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on out! I know you're there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence. Then Saizo stepped out and camly walked toward you. You attacked him with your fire sword, but Sozin calmly stepped out of the way and then he water bended two swords from his hands. You two engaged in a sword fight and you tried to tail smack him with your tail, but he grabbed the tail and gave you a rock fisted punch in the face and sent you flying to a car. Then you quickly got up and unleashed a breath attack of fire. Saizo countered by taking a big breath and unleashed a giant breath of air. The collision of attack caused a mighty explosion. Smoke billowed everywhere. You took advantage of the smoke to attack Saizo using your senses. Saizo sensed you coming and earth bended a wall to protect himself. That didn't stop you. You crashed straight through with kick and gave Saizo a powerful punch in the gut. Saizo was sent flying to a tree and hit it with a mighty crack. Then Saizo got up and brushed off the dust like the attack was nothing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Impressive. I'd expect nothing less from you (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the hell do you want Saizo? You got some nerve attacking me in broad daylight like that! And when the heck did you learn how to bend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSozin: None of your business and Just to make sure I got your attention. After all you are a powerful dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) How do you....?? Just answer my question! What the hell do you want?!? Answer me right now! Otherwise your gonna get a royal beat down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Now, now. Don't be so hasty. You know as well as I do that we were to fight here, many innocent lives would be in danger. And you don't want that now do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you hated to admit it, you knew Saizo was right. If you and him started fighting, many lives would get caught in the crossfire, especially Kurumu and your daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Fine. What do you want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You know what I want. The location of the Crimson Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What? The Crimson Fang? How do you know about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: I did my research. Legend has it that the crimson fang was from Caro before she died. They say she passed some of her power into that fang to protect so that the power wouldn't be used for evil. So the fang was passed on from generation to generation and over time the fang accumulated power from all the dragons that received the fang. Also let me ask you, do you know about the four elements in the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes. Water, fire, earth, and air? So what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo. Based on my research, I've learned that Caro and the dragons that came after her son were masters of one of these elements. Over time those who inherited the fang had a piece of their power implanted into that fang. In other words whoever wears that fang will have the power to control those elements and have the power to kill a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Say what?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: That's right. Ever since I learned this truth, I've made it my mission to find the fang. If I had this power, I'd be able to destroy every thing and everyone in my path! I've scoured the world looking for dragons that might have had it and I got nothing. Which lead me to one more dragon. You.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me? What the hell are you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You ancestor was Caro after so you must have received the dragon fang so I know you have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Even if I knew where it was I still wouldn't tell you! I'm not gonna give you something that can kill my own race!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: I see. So you can't be reasoned with. Very well. I shall leave for today, but I get the feeling you'll give me what I want whenever you like it or not. Because if you don't your family will suffer for it starting with your daughter Ty Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard the mention of Ty Lee's name your face went pale. Then your face turned red with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What did you say!?!? What did you do to my daughter Saizo!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSozin: My, my. How scary. Don't worry. She's safe for now, but if you don't bring me the fang. She may be.....well I'll let you think about it for while. Later loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged toward Sozin in a rage. Your hand became a giant dragon fist and punched at Saizo with all your strength making the whole ground shake. Sadly the Saizo you punched was nothing more, but a mud clone. Then you heard his voice echo in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Bring me the fang (name). Or your daughter pays with her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sank to your knees and punched the ground and you screamed with a deafening roar of despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): DAMN YOU SAIZO YOU BASTARD!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen tears slowly trickled down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No. Ty Lee's gone. And it's all my fault. She's in danger because of <br>\r\n<br>\r\nme. Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with....</span></div></div>",

Ty Lee releaseed her succubus wings and tail to enhance her allure. Tamera starred in awe of her hidden beauty and her power subsided. Now Tamera was the one under control. \"Good girl Tamera. Now help me escape.\", Ty Lee ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamera obeyed and took Ty Lee down into the water where they swam outside through an under water passage. With the sky in view Ty Lee left a mental command to leave for Tamera. \"You will tell Saizo I escaped on my own.

You swiped your claw and took out a few dozen golems. The golems retaliated by using bending skills. Those who used earth bending and fired giant boulders at you. Those who used water bending froze the water into ice spears and fired them at you. The boulders were big and the spears were cold, but they didn't do a thing to your hard scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Please! Did you think those pebbles would hurt me? Don't make me laugh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a mighty swipe of your tail and you took out about even more golems. The golems kept firing boulders and ice spears at you, but they still had no effect. You kept slashing with your claws and swiping with you tail and took out golem after golem until the golems were beginning to diminish. Meanwhile, hidden from the battlefield Saizo kept himself out of sight so you couldn't see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: That's it you fool. Just keep tiring yourself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on Saizo! Is this all you got?!? Come out and face me you coward! Your army is just about done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: That's what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo then made a couple of hand signs and cast a spell. Then from where you were fighting, more golems began to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the.... There's more? Oh well. Guess I'll have to keep beating them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on the attack again, destroying every golem that came in your way. Destroying the golems was easy enough for you. The problem was that every time that you destroyed a couple, more kept popping up. You were beginning to get overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Damn it! This is starting to get annoying! How about this?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and unleashed a power burst of flame from your mouth. The flame incinerated every golem that made contact with it. Smoke and flames billowed everywhere. When the smoke pulled clear, there was nothing left but ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Looks like I won. Whew. Man that was tiring. I don't know how much longer I can keep fighting. Even in my dragon form, I'm getting tired. I guess I wasn't as strong as I used to be. In any, I have to find Saizo and defeat him before anything else happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than you said those words, you felt something rumbling in the ground. Then more golems began coming out of the ground. Only this time there was ten times more of them than before. You couldn't even count how many there were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No way! You gotta be kidding me! There's even more of them than before! But I can't give up now! I have to keep fighting! I have to protect them no matter what! Even if it means having to fight till I die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attacked one more time slashing with your claws and slashing your tail, but now your attacks were starting to lose their power. You took out golems, but they kept coming back for more. Every time you took out a dozen, few dozen more took it's place. Then things grew worse, one of the golems launched an boulder in the shape of a spear and hit you square in the eye. You roared in pain and recoiled from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Arrggghhh!! Damn it! My eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were holding your eye in pain, the golems used water bending on the ground and made an ice floor. When you stepped on it, you slipped and you lost your balance and you fell flat on your back with a giant boom! The ground thundered and shook. While you were dazed from your fall Saizo finally came out of hiding and looked upon your fallen body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now my warriors! Make sure he doesn't escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golems obeyed. The golems that used earth bending make tall stalagmite like braces on your limbs and tail immobilizing you. The ones that used water bending got the water on your body and turned it into ice freezing you to make sure that you wouldn't break free. You snapped out of your daze in time to see that you were up to your neck in ice. You couldn't move and you couldn't attack. All you could was roar in frustration. Then Saizo stepped out from the army and looked you square in your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Heh. How the mighty have fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Saizo you bastard! Let me go so I can rip you in half!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: I'd rather not. You see you're gonna be a problem if I let you roam around free. So I'm gonna make sure you don't get in my way. Golems. Make sure he doesn't follow us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo turned around and head toward your house where Ty Lee and the others were. You tried to break free, but the ice and stone held you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): NO! Get back here! Saizo when I get out of this......!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish, the golems finished encasing you in ice and stone. Now you were frozen solid and unable to move. Saizo laughed in triumph as he walked toward your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Now that fool is out of the way, I can get the crimson fang from that little brat. She may have escaped me once, but now there's no where to hide. HAHAHA!!!!</span></div></div>",

Do you guys hear that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: It's that same sound again. The sound of footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Oh no. They're still coming! We need more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Damn it. Now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kurumu sprouted her wings and tail and her claws extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Keep going! I can buy you more time! Just stay focused on the ritual Ty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Mom! Wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Not you too! At least let me go with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: It's okay! I'll be fine! Just hurry with that ritual! Jin. I'm sorry, but you stay here. Don't worry. I'll be okay. Besides I know what I'm doing. But.....just in case if I don't make it, I just want to say that.....I love you both and I wish you happiness. Ronin, take of my daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Of course Ms. Kurumu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu flew out the window and headed toward the golems. All Jin and Ty Lee could do was watch their mother fly away to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Mom......be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Focus Ty Lee. I understand you're worried, but we must hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Man. This sucks! I wish there was something I could do! I feel so useless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ty Lee went back to the ritual. Meanwhile Saizo and his team were marching towards the house. Things were going smoothly, but then something swooped past him and sliced a lot of golems to bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: What the....!! Who did that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Up here ugly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo looked up and there a few feet above him was Kurumu. She swooped down again and landed in front of Saizo and his golems blocking their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Well, well, well. Kurumu Kurono. How delightful to see you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Wish I could say the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Heh. Still the feisty one I see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Where's (name)? What did you do with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Oh he was heating things up around here, so I decided that he needed to chill out. Hahahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Grrr! Damn you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hahahaha. Hey you know what? I have an idea. Why don't you forget about that loser (name) and join me? If you do, I'll see to it that you're treated like a queen and I'll even let you keep your daughters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Forget it sicko! (name)'s the only man for me! I won't let you get to my daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: What a pity. You've would have made a fine queen. But now I have no choice, but to kill you! Get her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army of golems charged and began the attack. Kurumu remained unfazed prepared to fight, but then.....</span></div></div>",

Then ice spikes began coming out of the ground and destroying more golems, and in the crowd some golems began flying out of the into the air and came crashing to the ground. Soon Saizo's army of golems was no more and Saizo was all alone. Saizo seeing this was a little shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Wha.... What the hell is going on here?!? Who's doing this?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu seeing what was going on smiled. She knew exactly what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey Saizo! You can't win! You better give up while you still can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: What the hell are you talking about?!? I don't know who made those attacks, but you're still done for! I can take you on all by my self. Besides there's only one of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a giant ice pillar appeared behind Kurumu. Then a certain someone who made that ice pillar jumped down and landed right next to Kurumu. She looked just she did before, but her hair was much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Make that two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: The snow witch?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a giant card flew from behind Saizo and another person jumped down from the card and landed next to Kurumu. She was a lot taller than she was before, but was still the cutesy witch that everyone loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Three!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: The little witch too?!? Wait. Hold on. If those girls are here.....don't tell me that.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(girl's voice): That's right Saizo. We're here too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(boy's voice): Guess that makes four and five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen from behind Kurumu came out the last two. A girl and a boy. The boy was pretty much the same except his eyes were a red color. The girl standing next to him was the same as she always was. Tall, long gray hair and eyes as red as the boy's were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Moka Akashiya. Tsukune Aono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Sorry we're a little late. We'd had a little trouble getting here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: You should be thanking us that we came here to save your sorry butt. After all that's what we're here for right? My big titied rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Still going on with that eh? Heh. Reminds me of the good old days<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: You know you sound like an old lady when you say that right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Watch it snow skank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore (looks at Saizo): So I see Saizo hasn't changed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah. He looks just as ugly as I remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah, but don't underestimate him. He's gotten a lot stronger the last time you saw him. In fact, he was strong enough to stop (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Speaking of (name) where is he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I don't know, but I'm worried. I hope he's OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Don't worry. I got someone looking for him as we speak. Until then, we're gonna have to deal with Saizo first. Kurumu? How strong is he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I'd say about as strong as Kuyo, maybe even more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Interesting. If he's as strong as you say he is, I'm looking forward to making him know his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: (laugh) You called these losers here? They can't save you! Don't think you can beat me just because you brought your friends here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hey Saizo! I'd watch yourself if I was you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! If you mess with our friends, you mess with us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: And if you mess with us, then you're gonna get hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Ooh I'm so scared. I've had enough of all this crap. It's time to finish you all. Oh and Kurumu, don't worry about your little girls. Once I'm done with you and your friends they're next. I'll be sure to send you all to the depths of hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I've had enough of your crap Saizo! As far as I'm concerned, you made two mistakes! The first was messing with me and no one threatens my daughters!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I've heard that sister! Let's do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's time to cool them off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: You ready Moka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Always Tsukune.

I can feel it! Keep going!\", Ronin reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper arms began falling off him then down to his lower body. Soon his upper body was all that remained. \"Now Ty! You must do it now! Say the final words!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then used all of her succubus power to finish the ritual, her wings and tail grew out with her eyes glowed in pink. \"With the love of this succubus the pages now, hold no longer this dragon trapped in thou, part human, succubus, and dragon grants thee, this wizard's freedom FOR ALL ETERNITY!\" Then Ronin's face fell apart and for a moment nothing. Then all of the pages and scraps that made up Ronin's body circled around the book and Ty Lee and Jin. Then a beam of light shot out of the book. In a blinding flash out came a man. A man of pale white skin and blue saphire eyes, his mouth covered by a mask and cloths mixed of knight armor and robes. He opened his eyes and for the first time in ages felt the fresh air in his lungs, and smell of the room from his nose. Ronin at last escaped the book. Ty Lee and Jin lowered their arms after the light dimmed allowing them to see the man in the pages. But he was no older than either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN! Ty, forget what I said about you finding a hot guy for your mate, this guy is sexier than moms best description of dad in his youth.\", Jin reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Jin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, it's feels great to have a body again that isn't made of paper and ink. Flattery aside we got a job to do. Ty, rest until your stregnth returns, doing that ritual took much out of you. Jin come with me, were going to help your mother and father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOYAW! I'll go stomp my foot right in that lizard guy's tail and swing him around like a lasso.\", Jin ran out to go help but Ronin stopped Ty Lee from coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to help mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did phenomenally already Ty. Now let me worry about the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Saizo- UMPH!\", unexpectedly Ronin kissed Ty Lee through his mask refusing to lower it but was in a terrible rush to start contributing to the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waited so long to do that. I can't explain how lovely you looked when your wings and tail sprouted out. Summarizing it would take just as long so just stay here and I'll sum up later after we deal with Saizo.\", Ronin ran to help with Ty Lee blushing and smiling like a school girl. She was so dumbfounded she passed out to her side from it.</span></div></div>",

Everyone charged at him at once thinking about using the numbers game strategy against him, but Saizo proved to be an even match. Everyone scattered and attacked. Mizore was on Saizo's left and Yukari was on the right. Yukari waved her wand and magic cards appeared all around her and then she fired them at Saizo. Mizore unleashed her chilling aura making almost everything around her turn to ice. She waved her hands and unleashed a powerful blizzard attack. The two attacks were strong, but Saizo gave a powerful stomp and made a wall protecting himself from the attacks.Then Kurumu swooped in and tried her luck. She slashed and clawed at Saizo hoping to land a blow, but again Saizo dodged the attack. Then Saizo was backed to a tree, Kurumu seized the opportunity to attack, but all she did was slice the tree like it was butter. Then Saizo countered attacked Kurumu by using earth bending to lift boulders and fired them at Kurumu. Kurumu retaliated by using her nails to slice through the boulders. Saizo used that to his advantage by slipping through the boulders and giving Kurumu a powerful punch in the gut sending her flying in the air. Luckily Kurumu regained her composure and used her wings as parachutes and landed safely on the ground. Moka and Tsukune attacked him last using their close combat skills and their brute strength. They kicked and punched with all their strength, but Saizo parried every blow and knocked them back. Tsukune swung hard and gave Saizo a powerful punch, but Saizo stopped it with ease and unleashed a powerful current of air using his fist. Tsukune tried to stand his ground, but he was sent flying through the air. Just when he was about to hit the ground Yukari used her magic to make a chair appear making Tsukune stand in the chair with a soft plop. Moka retaliated with a flurry of kicks and topped it off with one of her signature roundhouse kicks and hit Saizo square in the face hard. Tsukune and others cheered for Moka scoring a hit, but to their shock Saizo was unfazed by the kick. He didn't even flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Is that all you got? Let me show you what a real kick looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Saizo gave Moka a powerful kick in the gut that almost went straight through her. Moka was sent flying and crashing straight into a line of cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Moka no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing but smoke and metal rubble. Then Moka stepped out from the rubble. She had a line of blood on her face from a cut on her forehead. Her clothes were torn and she had a lot of cuts and scrapes, but she was alive. Kurumu and the others rushed to her side to make sure that she was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Moka. Are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: I'm fine. But I must admit, Saizo's powerful. More powerful than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: He's stopping every attack we throw at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Even when Moka kicked Saizo, she still didn't hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Oh no? You might want to take a look on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Saizo to find that Moka was right. There on the side of Saizo's mouth was a thin line of blood. Saizo wiped the blood and looked at it on his hand. When he saw it, his eyes gave off a different look. Then he spoke in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You....actually drew blood from me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What's wrong Saizo? Realized that you're not as tough as you figured?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the air turned tense like something had changed in the air. Saizo was now giving off a menacing air and had an angry look in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Big mistake. You now have made me very angry. I will make you pay for that. And know just the way to do it. I'll crush you with my full power! Prepare for something from your nightmares that will make even the strongest vampire tremble in fear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Typical. Does every bad guy have a final form? I mean come on Saizo, we all know that your form is an orc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Heh. Think again brat. You may be aware that my form is an orc, but in truth........I have another transformation that's even more powerful than that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka, Tsukune, Kurumu, Mizore, and Yukari: What?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You should feel honored. You'll be the first to see my new monster form. First you will see it, and then you will die!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Saizo began a undergoing a transformation. First his eyes glowed in an eerie color. Then he started to grow in size. Ten feet, fifteenth feet, twenty feet and he was still growing. His hands and his feet bulged and transformed into giant black claws. His muscles rippled and began to expand in size. His skin hardened and turned into brown scales and spread throughout his body like an infection. From his butt a giant tail sprouted and slammed the ground. His face stretched and became a reptilian like snout. His teeth grew long and sharp like daggers. Finally to top it off, his eyes glowed an eerie gold and he let out a ferocious roar. Saizo had transformed into a giant lizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Holy crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: He's.......he's gigantic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I hate to admit it, I know that I said that it's an old cliche of what Saizo did, but that's a pretty effective one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: His monster's energy is off the charts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Damn it......I think we're in toruble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo laughed in a voice that sounded way different than before and looked down at the fighters at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Yes! Time to die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Saizo attacked. Meanwhile.....</span></div></div>",

Saizo on the other hand had hardly a scratch on him and he was loving every minute hurting Moka and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hehehe. How pathetic. You guys can hardly lay a scratch on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Damn.......it.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: He.......he's just too strong......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Come on. I'm just getting warmed up. Entertain me more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: That......jerk......he's just toying with us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: He's not even using his full strength yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Come on you guys, we can't give up! We have to keep fighting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Aww. How cute. Little Kurumu's trying to be positive. Hehehe. What foolishness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Shut up you monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Why thank you. I'll take it as a compliment. You know what? Since you're being so you're being so sweet to me, I'll give you a deal Kurumu. If you all beg for your life and ask for my forgiveness, I'll spare you and your friends. Also, if you get down on your knees and swear to give up on your wimpy boyfriend I'll even let your daughters live.....as my concubines!! Then at least you'll have some of your family together. Hahahaha!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Kurumu began shaking with anger and her eyes were burning with rage. This time Saizo had gone too far. Her monster energy soared and her hair was standing on end. She was definitely not going to let that comment slide. Her wings extended and her nails sharpened and she gunned straight at Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: You bastard........HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT MY DAUGHTERS AND MY (NAME) THAT WAY!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: No Kurumu! Don't charge at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: That idiot! She's gonna get herself killed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: SAIZO, YOU BASTARD!!!!! I'LL KILL YOU!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu was so blinded b rage, that she didn't care that Saizo was stronger than her. All she cared about was making Saizo pay for what he said about her daughters. Unfortunately Saizo simply swatted her away like a fly using his tail. Kurumu was sent crashing into the ground hard. Saizo then slowly walked towards her, like a tiger stalking his prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Kurumu! Get out of there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Fly away! Do something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I......I can't.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune and the others tried to get up to help Kurumu, but they were still feeling weak after being beaten before. Kurumu couldn't even move herself. She struggled as she tried to get up, but she was still feeling dazed from getting hit. Suddenly a giant shadow cast over her. She looked up to see Saizo's giant lizard foot hovering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Now then, I'll squash you like the puny insect you are! Any last words?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Leave her alone Saizo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah, you big bully! If you hurt her, you'll be sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Ooh, I'm so scared. Now then Kurumu, where was I? Oh yes. I was about to stomp you into oblivion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu shut her eyes and waited for the end. Then a ferocious roar echoed throughout the the battlefield making everyone freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: What the....?!? What was that? No......it couldn't be......!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a large tail whipped around and smacked Saizo square in the face, sending him reeling and crashing into a building. Then someone picked up Kurumu and quickly flew her to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No one threatens my wife and gets away with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Is that......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: And Jin too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Well its about time we got some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kurumu opened her eyes and saw that Jin was carrying her, she was surprised and happy to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name)! You're alive! And Jin! What in the world are you doing here!? You shouldn't be.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Complain about me being here later Mom! We need your help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): She's right Kurumu. In fact, we need everyone's help in this. Ty Lee and Ronin have got a plan to beat Saizo, but they need Kurumu and Moka to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: But why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: And who's Ronin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'll explain later. Moka and Kurumu, Jin will take you to you both to Ty Lee and she'll explain the rest. The rest of us have to hold off Saizo until Ty Lee gives the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What?!? Are you serious?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name). In case you haven't noticed, we don't stand a chance against Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know, but don't worry. All we have to do is stall time. Besides, I'm fighting with you guys this time. Now go! Saizo is gonna up any second and this is about to get ugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was silent, but then Kurumu spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: OK. We understand. Be careful (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: You too Tsukune. We'll be back soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Don't worry Moka. We'll be OK. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Don't worry! We'll be back Dad! We promise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with Jin leading them, Moka and Kurumu went with her to meet Ty Lee. Saizo was back on his feet. When he saw you, he couldn't believe his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: What?!? (name)?!? Impossible! How are you here?!? I froze you solid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sorry to disappoint you Saizo, but it's gonna take a lot more than ice to bring me down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Heh. It doesn't matter anyway! It just means I can take you down in front of your girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Just you try it! You're gonna pay for hurting my wife and endangering my daughters you bastard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a ferocious roar and charged at Saizo and Saizo did the same and then the battle began!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both giant lizards charged at each other and collided with a loud boom! Saizo scratched at you with his claws. You countered with a massive headbutt sending Saizo reeling. Then you swung with your tail and whipped Saizo square in the face again. This time Saizo took the hit, but then he snapped his jaws and bit you on the neck. You roared in pain and slashed Saizo on his side trying to make him release his grip, but then Mizore came flying from the sky and fired her icicles at Saizo's face making him let you go in surprise. You took that opportunity to unleash your fiery breath at him. Saizo roared as your flames made his even his scales burn. Then Tsukune came from behind Saizo and using his vampire abilities gave Saizo a mighty kick on his leg to try to knock him off balance. Saizo wasn't fazed. He attempted to squash Tsukune with his foot, but Tsukune leaped out of the way just in time. Then Saizo swung his tail to try and hit Tsukune again, but Yukari swooped in while flying on her giant tarot card and got Tsukune out of there just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Tsukune! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. I'm fine, but at this rate we'll never be able to hold out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): We have to! We must hold out until Ty Lee and the others come!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: But (name), can you still fight? You're hurt pretty bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm fine. We dragons are a lot tougher than you think. Now then, let's keep going! We have to keep fighting so if you got time to talk, then you got time to fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you charged at Saizo again with Tsukune, Mizore, and Yukari backing you up. Meanwhile Kurumu, Jin, and Moka were flying in sky (Kurumu and Jin carrying Moka of course) in search of Ty Lee and Ronin. It wasn't long till they saw Ty Lee and Ronin. They were busy setting up a magic circle for their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Jin! You found Mom and Aunt Moka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Ty Lee! My daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Ty Lee, Kurumu flew immediately toward her daughter and gave her a tremendous hug. She had completely forgotten that she was helping Jin carry Moka.<br>\r\nLuckily Jin was able to let down Moka without dropping her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh my baby! I'm so glad you're safe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Mom! You're squishing me! Besides, this isn't the time for this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Well I can't say I blame her, but she could at least have been a little more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Please Ms. Kurumu, I know that you were worried, but we don't have much time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oops. Sorry. Hehehe. I guess I got carried away. Anyway, (name) told us you have a plan Ty Lee. What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Yes. He told us that you needed both me and Kurumu to pull off your plan. What is this plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: OK. Here's what I have in mind. Since Saizo is almost stronger than any of us, me and Ronin thought that we imprison him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Imprison him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Yes. Saizo has obviously grown too powerful for all of us, including your father. So we have no choice but to imprison him for good. Ty Lee and I have been working on a spell. It will open a portal to an alternate dimension to and once Saizo gets in it, he won't be coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Interesting plan, but how are gonna get him inside the portal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: That's where you, Jin, and Mom come in Aunt Moka. All of us succubi and you will use our allure at once to lure Saizo down this way and have him go into the portal banishing him forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Wait, Moka has an allure ability like us? I didn't know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Is that true Aunt Moka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Yes. You haven't seen me use it because I never really had to, but I have an allure ability like you succubi. Anyway, will this plan of yours work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Yes. But we're not finished with the spell yet. We just need a little more......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they heard a roar in the distance. It was a roar filled with pain and agony and Kurumu knew who made that roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: From the sound of things, it sounds like (name) and the others won't be able to hold on much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: What can we do? We have to help them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Hold on Ms. Kurumu! I understand that you want to help your husband, but we have to stick to the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: He's right Mom! Besides, you didn't stand a chance against Saizo by yourself! He could kill you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: But we can't just stand by while Saizo beats the crap out of (name) and the others! We have to do something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence.

Ty I know you can do this.\", she nodded. \"Miss Moka here's what you need to do exactly. The three ladies will supply the \"eye candy\" as it were to make Saizo come over to you four. But you need to grab his attention. Your allure will make him interested and then when he sees everyone else he'll come crawling over to you. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the spell?\", Moka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon as he gets close enough the spell will activate and he'll be long gone. Soon as he starts coming right for you without hesitation you should back away from the area. It might engulf you guys if your not careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry Ronin, we know just how much a man can get a closer look.\", Kurumu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooooom. Your so embarrassing.\", Ty Lee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\", Ronin flew off and fired a barrage of fireballs at Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! You!\", Saizo roared. As Saizo tried to bite Ronin you bite right into Saizo's neck. Saizo ferociously struggled free and used his tail to jab at your eye. You released your grip due to the pain and shock. Saizo body slammed into you pinning you on your back. Ronin used a spell to cast lightning at Saizo electrocuting him, and you slightly. You breathed fire at Saizo and kicked him off you. Saizo rubbed his eyes after the fire nearly burned them to a crisp, but he saw you about to chew into his neck. Saizo back away but you grabbed him with your claws and pierced into his neck. Saizo was bleeding loads of blood from the neck but still had some fight left.\"Gonna kill you!\", he said ruffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't have been this strong after all these years.\", you called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I see it now! Sozin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This monster is being granted some of Sozin's power from his spirit from inside the book!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your just another lapdog Saizo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo's throat healed enough for him to talk better,\"I get the crimson fang and free him, in return I prove that trying to be all peaceful with humans is never going to last and become stronger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you charged at Saizo Ronin placed a barrier in front of you forcing you to stop. He flew right in front of Saizo confidently to Saizo's own confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something then Saizo, I heard you tried to kidnap Ty Lee with a mermaid to seduce her.\", Ronin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tamera? She was just another hottie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there is no way you'll be able to fight against what's coming next. Ty Lee now!\", Ronin signaled. From their position the trio of Succubi with the vampire's powerful allure sent a large pulse of energy that covered the city. The first wave hit you, Ronin, and Saizo causing you all to stare afar at where it came from. Ronin then placed a shield around you and him knowing it would lure you two into the trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't look!\", Ronin knew his affection for Ty would lead him into his own trap as would your own love for Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo then saw what looked like paradise, four sexy hot women all wanting him. Each one lacked some appropriate attire revealing their desirable flesh. Kurumu<br>\r\ns battle damaged clothing was easy to utilize, Jin danced in a sexy fashion making hand gestures saying \"come here\", Moka gave him the old cutesy innocent look she always gave to Tskune, but Ty had shown in detail she was a pure succubus. She tantalizingly stripped with her monster form exposed, her tongue sticking out, her cleavage almost fully exposed, and her panties showing off from a convenient breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo was getting closer to the display beginning to be entranced by the overwhelming display of lust and desire.</span></div></div>",

Now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee, Kurumu, Jin, and Moka all scattered leaving Saizo looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hey! Come on! Where did the babes go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Saizo! This is the end! Take this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then waved her hand and activated the spell and then a doorway opened right in front of Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: What the heck?!? What is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Way to go sis! You did it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Now everyone! Push Saizo towards the portal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then began firing everything they had at Saizo. Saizo was reeling from the attack, but he wasn't going into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Now I get it! You're trying to imprison me or something! If you think you can get me into that portal, you got another thing coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dug his claws into the dirt and fought back. He whipped his tail and knocked down Kurumu, Jin and Yukari while they were in the air. Then Moka and Tsukune and Mizore came sailing in to attack, but Saizo sent them flying with a swat of his claw. You came at Saizo using your fire breath, but your flame had gotten weaker from the fighting. Saizo pushed through the flame and rammed you hard with his head,. You staggered back and then Saizo gave you a mighty tail swipe. He hit you so hard that you transformed back into your human state and fell sprawling into the crowd. Everyone was down except for Ty Lee and Ronin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Did you really think that you could defeat me brat? You thought that you and your boyfriend can imprison me forever? Too bad! Now I think it's time that I crush you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee was prepared to fight, but Ronin stepped in between the two them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: I won't let you hurt her Saizo! You have to get by me first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin charged at Saizo ready to fight for Ty Lee, but then Saizo raised his claw and an energy ball hit Ronin. Then chains appeared around Ronin and wrapped around him. He began losing altitude and then he fell to the ground. He tried to break free, but he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Oh no! Ronin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Rgghh!! What is this magic?!? I can't move or break free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Sorry, but I can't let you get in my way. And you can thank the book from my master. That spell will prevent you from interfering and using your magic. Now then, it's just you and me brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo came towards Ty Lee. Ty Lee stood her ground, but she was getting a little scared. There was no one else to help her. She was all on her own. She wracked her mind trying to figure out what to do, but Saizo was getting closer and closer. Then she had an idea. There was only one thing that she can do to make Saizo go into the portal. But it was going to be very difficult and very embarrassing for her. Thankfully, most of the gang was either feeling dazed or knocked out so no one else will see her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Ronin! Listen! I want to close your eyes and no matter what, don't look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: What? Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Just do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin did so. Then Ty Lee looked at Saizo bravely and prepared herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Huh. What's wrong? Don't want your boyfriend to see me kill you? Tell you what. If you hand over the crimson fang, I'll make your death swift and painless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee thinking: This is gonna be super embarrassing, but it's the only way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Hey! Saizo! How about instead, get a load of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Ty Lee took off her clothes and was now wearing a pink string bikini. Her wings sprouted and her tail poked it's way out of her bottoms. She also unleashed her most powerful allure that could make even more stronger than Jin and Kurumu's combined. As soon as Saizo saw Ty Lee in her new attire, his eyes went wide and bloodshot. He began thumping his right hind leg like a rabbit and began howling and panting like a wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Helloooooooo nurse!!!!! No wait! You won't trick me! It's a trap, but she's sooooo sexy!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of things, Ty Lee's allure wouldn't last much longer, She was extremely embarrassed about wearing a skimpy bikini, but she had to keep going. All she had to do was use her succubus powers to get Saizo into the portal and it would be over. She swallowed her embarrassment and put on a seductive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Hey there big boy. You like what you see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Yes! Yes! I do! I mean.....you think that you can get me with the same trick twice? You won't trick me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Awww. Come on Saizo. I'll can show you more if you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee pressed her breasts together and show off her cleavage. Saizo seeing this had a nosebleed, but he was still trying to resist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Really?!?! You can?!?! No! I can't! Show me! Show me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Sure. I'll show more if you do me a tiny favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Anything for you....... No damn it! I will.....do anything you ask babe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Good boy. Now could you please enter that portal please? If you do that then I'll show you all you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ty Lee gave Saizo a seductive wink. Saizo now had hearts in his eyes and began walking towards the portal. Ty Lee was using everything she had to control Saizo, but her control was slipping. Saizo was acting like he was at war with an alternative personality, but it was working. He was slowly but surely going towards the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: No I won't! Yes! No! No Yes! Yes! I WON\"T GO INTO THE PORT-!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were Saizo's last words as he stepped one claw into the portal. He upper body was sucked in and he had no way of escaping. He tried to get out, but it was already too late. With a loud boom and a giant pulse of energy, Saizo's body disappeared into the portal. The portal disappeared and then there was utter silence. Saizo was defeated. Everyone else got up and ran toward Ty Lee and Ronin's location and cheered. The chains from Ronin disappeared and he was able to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: All right! The wicked Saizo's finally dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Technically he was imprisoned, but you got the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Ty Lee! You clever girl! You did it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's my baby girl! Saving the world and meeting the man of her dreams just like her mom did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yep. Not just her, but Jin helped out too. I couldn't more proud of both you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Thanks Dad, but Ty Lee did all the work. She's the one who cast the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Hahaha. It was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Yes. It was. You stood your ground and were brave. You stopped an opponent that not even I could defeat. You got guts just like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. Way to go Ty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aunt Moka. Uncle Tsukune. You're embarrassing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ronin stepped forward and Ty Lee and Ronin locked eyes. Ty Lee was about to walk towards him, but she stopped and looked at you, Kurumu, and Jin. You smiled and mouthed the words \"Go on.\" Ty Lee smiled and went toward Ronin and they wrapped each other with a loving embrace. You and the rest of the gang watched as Ty Lee and Ronin had their moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Aww. They look so cute together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Makes me feel a little jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin: Yeah me too. Hey Dad? Mom? Will I ever find a boy like Ty Lee did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Of course you will Jin. After all you're the daughter of a good looking guy and a smoking hot girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No! (name) you're embarrassing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Just keep an eye out  for the right guy and be yourself. And who knows? Maybe your guy will come sooner than you think. Right Moka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: I guess so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Ty Lee and Ronin......<br>\r\nRonin: Ty Lee. You did it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: No. We did it. If it wasn't for your teachings, I never would have gotten to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Well I owe you for resurrecting me. So I guess we're even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: I guess we are. So......what are you gonna do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Well since I'm alive again, I want to learn everything there is to know in this world. I want to see how much things have changed since I've been imprisoned in the book. And.....I was hoping that a certain someone could show me around and let me live with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: Really?!? You mean it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Yes I do. Ty Lee. Will you do me the honor of being how they say, \"my girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee squealed with joy. She jumped up and gave Ronin a big kiss. Ty Lee now felt like the happiest girl in the world. She felt like there was nothing in the world that could stop this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: By the way Ty Lee.....I do have one question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: What's that Ronin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin: Do girls normally wear skimpy clothing like yours?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ty Lee realized that she was still wearing the bikini she used to seduce Saizo. Like a thermometer her face glowed in a deep crimson red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonin looked on with confusion as Ty Lee defensively crouched down to cover herself. Everyone else who now noticed this too reacted in their own different ways. Kurumu and Moka covered both you and Tsukune's eyes and Mizore, Yukari, and Jin blushed in surprise and shock. Looks like Ty Lee's first step in her relationship with Ronin is off to a rocky start.</span></div></div>",

Ronin and Ty Lee started off to be a very loving couple despite the aftermath. As Ronin saw how the world changed he was both fascinated and confused all at ounce. With everything that happened Jin decided to enhance her own Succubus powers after seeing her twin surpass her. She was even more determined to find her destined one and fall in love. And as for the old couple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm......beautiful night outside isn't it?\", you said to Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The view right next to me is better. At least I can cuddle up warmly with you.\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too handsome. Sigh.......seemed like so long ago we started this adventure huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I saw you out of nowhere and we just hit it off and we've been together ever since. Now we have two very strong and very beautiful girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time I saw them I couldn't believe I had just gave birth to them. I watched them cry for the first time and then they reached out for me and calmed down. Then they were even happier when they saw you. They knew who they're daddy was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumu, I've loved you since the moment I laid eyes on you. And now that Ty Lee and Jin are growing up, what's that mean for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, hope they have as happy lives as we did and when they need us we'll be right there. But I know one thing, you get to have at this sexy body for the rest of your life.\", she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumu! Stop it.\", she began to undress to your half-discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't deny your feelings, no matter what I'll always love you and I'm yours. You gave me true love, a family, and a good life. The best I could ask for. And now were going to watch it end here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want it to end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I. But let's make it last huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here you.\", she made out with you and lovingly felt up you body slowly savoring the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEpilogue:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin eventually found her destined one and became one of the most beautiful and seductive succubi in history alongside Ty Lee. They were so powerful and legendary it was debated over who was the stronger monster. Ty Lee and Ronin married 3 years after the battle with Saizo and Ty Lee became a teacher at Yokai. However many of the male students constantly sexually harassed her so she made her classes female only. But she was so attractive that she even needed precautions for some of her own female students. Jin was a more wild spirit and set out around the world looking for her destined one until she found a unique boy who knew of the monster world yet had absolutely no monster blood in him. Tskune and Moka's family lived on happily as did Mizore and Yukari. As for Kurumu and yourself, you enjoyed the remainder of your long and happy lives with your daughters and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is my final addition to Rosario Vampire and it has been fun working on this for the last two years. Been a great ride.)</span></div></div>",

But Ty kept a level head since she had no crush on Alucard. (Yet) But as for Alucard himself to him he was in the presence of the two gorgeous women he'd ever laid eyes on. Jin looked like the shy but fun kind of hot and Ty looked like the sexy librarian type, of course in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well um how do you like our home?\", Jin asked wanting to start up the conversation with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's peaceful. I like it. And I just have to put it out there...you both look drop dead hot.\", Alucard said rather bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin thought it as the sweetest thing she'd been told by any other boy. Ty thought he was out of his mind and had mental issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwww thanks. No other guy ever went to just admitting how we look.\", Jin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they droll at us so much that it's hard for them to even form a sentence.\", Ty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say that I'd blame them. But you'll pardon my rudeness if I came off as direct. I just can't help but point out something obvious.\", Alucard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your at least honest I'll give you that. I like you, but not in the crush sorta way.\" Ty said specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I go at Yokai so perhaps we could see each other around school.\", Alucard suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I mean...sure certainly...Alucard\", Jin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlucard noticed Jin's shyness towards him and it came off as flattering to him. He was hoping she liked him but from what he could tell it was clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlucard left with his parents and the rest of your old gang left soon after. The day ended and things started to get interesting.</span></div></div>",

Falling in love with a human ha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you really pissed off. You charged at Keito with your fists raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Shut up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw a powerful punch at Keito, but she blocked it with one arm. The ground shook when your punch connected. You were shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Well, well, well, looks like a struck a nerve, but is that all you got?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to move your arm, but Keito kept a firm hold on your fist not letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: If that's all you got you're pathetic. Now it's time to show you how strong I've become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw you up and gave you a powerful kick in the gut that sent you flying to a wall then Keito grabbed you by the neck ran your face through a wall and threw you again. This time you crashed through a window, rolled onto the ground and landed on your face. You been pretty much beaten up and you couldn't move. Keito stood above you and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hehehe How do you like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped on your back hard which made scream in pain. Out of all the pain you went through this was by far the worst. Keito repeatedly stepped on your back and was enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: More! More! More! Let me hear your screams!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help, but scream. It was way too painful. Then Keito stopped and began to walk away laughing evily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hehehe I'm getting bored now. It's obvious to me that you're too weak to stop me or my mistress. He. Maybe I should go kill someone else. Oh I know! Maybe I should kill your friends? Starting with your little girlfriend the succubis? That should be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard this your eyes snapped open with horror, You struggled to get up and you coughed up some blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No.....you.....can't.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I don't think you're in a position to tell me anything. Besides you're weak just like your pathetic mother That's probably why she left you in the human world because of your weakness. Now if you excuse me I must be going, but don't worry I'll be right back: with your girlfriends head that is. hehehe HAHAHAHA!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you heard these words something inside you snapped. It was bad enough Keito was insulting your mother, but when she said she was going to kill Kurumu you lost your shit! A giant red aura erupted from your body and you got up and let out a scream so inhuman and so loud that it echoed throughout the town. The aura transformed your right arm into some kind of a red claw and your left eye became slitted and you're teeth became fangs. When Keito saw this transformation she was shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: What the hell!?! His monster energy is tremendous!! and his eyes. They're filled with anger and bloodlust. Interesting. Take this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw a punch at you, but you were totally unaffected. You grabbed her hand and squeezed hard. Keito screamed in pain and then you gave her a devastating punch in her gut using your claw and she went flying into the wall, When she slammed into the wall she coughed up some blood and as she was falling you grabbed her and slammed her into the wall 5 times, dragged her face on the ground and threw her into the air and for the finishing blow you gave her  a powerful kick slamming her into the ground, As you landed onto the ground Keito sat up and looked at you with a twinge of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: What....(cough) what the hell happened? He's completely different now. He attacks without any mercy and took my attack like it was nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you walked toward Keito with your claw raised. When you spoke your voice didn't even sound human.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n(name) Now you're gonna get it Keito! Die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: No! Please! Help me mistress!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged at Keito and you were just about to hit her when a huge lightning bolt hit between you and Keito and a demonic looking woman with a crow and a staff appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Keito. Why are you fooling around here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Mistress! I was.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Save you're excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Who are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Ah. The boy. You've grown so much. I remember when I saw you as a baby,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Grrrr what the hell are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Come on mistress! Let's Kill him and his girlfriend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Not just yet Keito. Besides I have plans for his girlfriend and him later. For now let's get you back home and heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Y-yes mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey don't you run away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Don't fret boy. Our paths will cross again. And when we do I will have my revenge. On you and your mother. Oh where are my manners? Before I leave let me give you my name. I'm Maleficent. Remember that name. hahahaha <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned into a flame and disappeared. Keito entered the flame as well and before she disappeared she turned toward me and glared bloody and mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: The next time me meet! It will be your last! And by the way I wonder how your girlfriend will react when she sees you like that? Hahaha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she disappeared. You stood there alone. You possessed what just happened and then you were enraged because you let them get away. You let out another yell that didn't sound human. Then you heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) (name)? Is that you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around nervously and you saw.........</span></div></div>",

You look away and cover up Kurumu with her blanket. <br>\r\n(name) Damn it all! Can't you stay down whenever I look at Kurumu! Geez! <br>\r\nThen Kurumu started to murmur in her sleep.

The bus driver increased his speed, the bus getting ever closer to the tunnel back to the human world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu was getting desperate. She couldn't lose you! Increasing her speed, Kurumu flew around to one of the side windows and charged through it, pinning you to the floor of the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Kurumu?!

How the hell could you even think about leaving us?! Leaving me?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted uncomfortably beneath Kurumu's well-endowed body. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Kurumu, I'm sorry, but this school just isn't for me. I've been here less than a week and I've already been bitten by a bloodthirsty vampire. But not only that, I put you in danger.

She hadn't even realized that she'd enslaved you with her kiss, your body now nothing more than an instrument for Kurumu to satisfy her whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu broke the kiss, smiling down at you, before realizing what she done, seeing your eyes almost devoid of life. <span class=\"cteal\">\"(name)\u2026\"</span> she whispered, quickly turning to the bus driver. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Stop the bus!\"</span> She yelled, cradling you in her arms.</span></div></div>",

But you wouldn\u2019t respond, not unless Kurumu told you to. <span class=\"clred\">\u201c(Name)?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cAnswer her, (name)\u2026!\u201d</span> Kurumu pleaded with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI can hear you\u2026\u201d</span> you replied, but your voice was slow and inflectionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cMizore told us you were planning to leave, (name). I\u2019m glad you changed your mind.\u201d</span> Tsukune smiled, getting up from his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cHe didn\u2019t change his mind, Tsukune! Kurumu changed it for him! Look at him!\u201d</span> Ruby snapped. <span class=\"clred\">\u201cShe turned him into her <i>slave</i>!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cHer slave?\u201d</span> Tsukune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026!\u201d</span> Kurumu insisted. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI panicked, a-and before I even knew what I was doing, I just\u2026\u201d</span> Kurumu shook her head. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to leave!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cWell we can\u2019t let him go back now, not like this!\u201d</span> Ruby sighed, cupping your face in her hands and looking you over. <span class=\"clred\">\u201cYou\u2019ve really done it\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune shifted his hands into his pockets. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cI don\u2019t think this is as big a deal as you think it is, Ruby. I mean, Kurumu charmed me back in our first year. All we have to do is wait for it to wear off-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cIt\u2019s not <i>going</i> to wear off, Tsukune! Kurumu kissed him! Can\u2019t you see that?! This is different. If a succubus kisses someone they\u2019ve charmed, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2026\u201d</span> Ruby trailed off, removing her hands from your face and retreating her arms to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\u201cYou mean\u2026 this could be permanent?\u201d</span> He asked. Ruby nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka\u2019s hands hovered over rosary, shaking, hearing her inner self speak to her. <span class=\"cpgreen\">\u201cThat\u2019s what Kurumu had planned to do to Tsukune during our first year here\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cIs there anything we can do\u2026?\u201d</span> Moka whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpgreen\">\u201cNo\u2026\u201d</span> came the voice, echoing inside Moka\u2019s head. <span class=\"cpgreen\">\u201cWe just have to hope that Kukumu\u2019s enslavement will wear off eventually, but there\u2019s a strong possibility it never will.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m really sorry!\u201d</span> Kurumu blubbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cDon\u2019t bother apologizing to <i>me</i>! Apologize to The Headmaster, to (name)\u2019s <i>parents</i>! You know, this whole arrangement, (name) enrolling here officially, was to prove that monsters and humans can coexist! (name) getting bitten by Kokoa is one thing, but getting enslaved by you?! You\u2019re supposed to be his friend! What does that\u2026 what does that\u2026?\u201d</span> Ruby was shaking, absolutely speechless. <span class=\"clred\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</span> She said quickly. <span class=\"clred\">\u201cThe Headmaster needs to know what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</span> Ruby quickly started gathering up her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cThe Headmaster?\u201d</span> Kurumu asked, shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cThat\u2019s right.

Yet there was no bus. You continue to walk towards the sign. and it wasn't till you could see the bus sign clearly that you saw Ruby. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing\"<span class=\"cmaroon\"></span> Rubi asked in the sweetest of voices<br>\r\n\"This school is just not for me don't you see, and besides I could ask you the samething, What are you doing here\" <span class=\"cnavy\"></span>you quickly asked<br>\r\n\"We are here to stop you from going\"<span class=\"cmaroon\"></span> Rubi said <br>\r\n\"Huh... there is just you though\"<span class=\"cnavy\"></span><br>\r\nUn benonced to you, you feel more people coming over to were you are. And you look around and see that it was Moka (excluding the little witch). <br>\r\n\"what are you doing?\"<span class=\"cnavy\"></span> <br>\r\n\" We are here to stop you, and convince you not to leave the acadomey.\"<span class=\"chotpink\"></span> Moka said in a nice way.\" <br>\r\nYou start to back away slowly and state \"Don't you understand that this school is just not for me so...\" You then relised that you back into something. So you slowly start to turn around and you see Kurumu. She looked so sad and asked \"Why (name), WHY are you leaving us. Didn't you have fun hanging with us.\"<span class=\"cteal\"></span> <br>\r\nYou then started to back away from Kurumu slowly and the started to make a run for it towards the woods. You head straight there, until you couldn't move your right leg. You then looked down and noticed that your right foot was frozen solid. \"I can't lose another friend, so will have to stay.\" You then heard the familiar voice and see Mizore. <br>\r\nYou then broke the ice before it could freeze you completely. And though to yourself \"Man what is with these girls they bearly knew me for one day, but they think of me as a friend. Well I can see that this is not going anywhere fast, so the only way I would be able to leave is if I start being mean to them so that it will sever our ties with each other.\" <br>\r\nYou are just standing there now about to say something when the girls start to move in. You said \" WHY ON EARTH WOULD I NEED FRIENDS THAT ARE MONSTERS!!\"<span class=\"cnavy\"></span><b></b><br>\r\nThis startled the girls for a bit and the out of no where Kurumu starts to cry and screams, in her monster form \"You idiot.\"<span class=\"cteal\"></span> <br>\r\nYou see her coming towards you with all of her speed and narrowed your eyes and dodge her at the last second. You start to grin, becuase your plan is working. The other girls see this and try to calm down Kurumu. You then acted on this moment to start to run towards the bus sign. The other newspaper club members were to busy on calming down Kurumu, that they didn't see you make a run for it. You then make it to the sign and you sigh a sigh of relief. You then looked and saw the bus was heading over to the sign. You then felt happy that it was almost here, til you felt a presences behind you and noticed it was Rubi and asked her \"how did you make it here so fast, and why won't you just leave me alone\"<span class=\"cnavy\"></span> <br>\r\n\"(name) don't you know that friends do not give up on there friends.\"<span class=\"cmaroon\"></span> <br>\r\n\"There it is again I am not a friend to you just leave me alone!! Besides why do you monsters care so much for a human, I thought you were soppose to hate humans.\"<span class=\"cnavy\"></span><br>\r\n(name) The reason why I care so much is, becuase I dream of a future existance in where human and monsters can live together in solidarity. And the only way we can reach that is if you stay here. So I sorry but I am going to force you to stay here for the greater good.\"<span class=\"cmaroon\"></span><br>\r\n\"haha for the greater good you say, don't make me laugh you are just a witch that is evil in the eyes of humanity.\"<span class=\"cnavy\"></span> <br>\r\nRubi has kept calm and cool head for right know so it may take a bit more to crush our bond with each other. Suddenly Rubi begins to start to cry, but it is only one tear drop. Out of no where Moka comes out to comfort Rubi, becuase she heard what I said. Around the same time Kurumu calmed down and ran towards me, ready to slap me. She does slap and say \"(name) why did you say that to Rubi, don't u think she feels bad enough knowing what she did to the....<span class=\"cteal\"></span>\" <br>\r\n\"That is enough Kurumu, he does need to know\"<span class=\"cmaroon\"></span><br>\r\n\"But\" <span class=\"cteal\"></span><br>\r\n\"no buts about it.\"<span class=\"cmaroon\"></span><br>\r\nI got back up on my feet and stated \"Oh and I do hope you relise that I do not like being slap or like being bossed around.\"<span class=\"cnavy\"></span> So I start to head for the bus, but then quickly decided to run and hit Rubi. I wanted to leave but they wanted me to stay only way out fight. I continued to through punch after punch towards Rubi, it felt like I was fighting in someone elses body. The Girls saw this and tried to stop me. Mizure froze me so that I wouldn't excape. I realised what I did and imedeatly felt bad and told them I must leave right now.<span class=\"cnavy\"></span> We are sorry but we can't just let you leave.<span class=\"cblack\"></span><br>\r\nThen out of no where tskune came and asked if he could talk to me. He then told me that he knows exactly how I feel, becuase he felt the same way on his first day.<span class=\"cgreen\"></span><br>\r\nI than told him that what I feeland what you felt on your first day are not the same. the reason I want to leave is to protect y'all so that no one gets hurt. Headmaster already told me what happened between you and the acadomey police. And I can't just let that happen to people I care about. So that is why I need to leave.<span class=\"cnavy\"></span><br>\r\n(name) don't you think we can protect you and care for you here<span class=\"cindigo\"></span><br>\r\nI told you I don't want people to take care of me and you better learn that quickly.<span class=\"cnavy\"></span><br>\r\nwith that said I was able to break out of the ice. Since tskune was right next to me he got hurt a bit and flew towards Moka a riped the Rosario and she transformed. She told me to actualy consider staying here<span class=\"clgrey\"></span> <br>\r\nI told her that \"I won't listen to you\"<span class=\"cnavy\"></span><br>\r\nshe then told me to learn my place and was about to kick me, but at the last second tskune jumped in between me and her, and recieved the kick instead. Moka acted like tskune deserved it for bringing her out on a human. the bus was waiting for me, but after what I saw in Tskunne how could I leave him like this, so I started to run towards him and begged for forgiveness from the girls especially Rubi and Kurumu. Since Tskune was injuried I decided to first take him to the nurse then I will make my decession tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The most recent sensation you had since Kokoa sunk her fangs into you before falling asleep in Kurumu\u2019s arms was the feeling of lukewarm water running down from the top of your head and across the side of your face. You opened your eyes, but as soon as you did, water fell into them. You slowly brought one of hands up from under what felt like a bed sheet, reached up and felt around your face, noticing that there was a damp flannel covering your eyes, which was probably the source of the water. You slowly pulled the flannel off of your face as your eyes adjusted to the new surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight streamed in from the window and across your face, causing your eyes to water slightly. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHow long have I been out for?\u201d</span> you thought, glancing down at your body, which was indeed covered by a white bed sheet. It was at that point you realized you were in a bed that was propped up against the wall in a similar fashion to how the bed in your dorm-room was set up. Without moving your head, you cautiously looked around the room in the hopes that you would be able to indentify an object that would tell you whose room you were in. You were too focused in trying to figure out whose room you were in that you ignored the most obvious answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to continue your observations, you were forced to turn your head. It was then that your eyes met that of a young, blue-haired girl\u2019s who was sitting in front of you, watching you with a look of both concern and relief on her face. You could tell by her expression that she was glad that you were now awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cKurumu...\u201d</span> you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cShhhhhh.\u201d</span> Kurumu hushed you as she caressed your cheek. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cSave your strength.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied, turning back and facing the ceiling, smiling weakly as Kurumu continued to brush your check with her hand. Both you and Kurumu remained silent for a while, the only sound was the sound of your breathing, which slowed itself to mimic the rhythm of Kurumu\u2019s fondling of your cheek. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThanks for rescuing me.\u201d</span> you eventually spoke up, although now the thought occurred to you: <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Kurumu take me to the infirmary?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cNot a problem, (name), but if you\u2019re wondering why I didn\u2019t take you to the infirmary,\u201d</span> Kurumu began, causing your eyes to widen <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIs she psychic too?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cteal\"> \u201cI was going to take you to the infirmary, but seeing as I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay there all night and I was worried that Kokoa might come back for you, I took you here instead.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing Kokoa\u2019s name seemed to send shivers down your spine, as your breathing became more erratic. It was as she had left you in a state of constant fear for your life. You knew that if Kokoa told anyone at this school you were a human, even the teachers, then your life would be in danger. Beads of sweat trickled down your body. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry, (name). Kokoa won\u2019t get you. I promise.\u201d</span> Kurumu said, using the flannel to wipe up your sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you didn\u2019t say anything else for quite some time, as you were focused on how content Kurumu seemed with looking after you. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI have to let her know that I appreciate this.\u201d</span> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSeriously Kurumu, thank you so much for protecting me and looking after me like this. You don\u2019t know how much it means to me that I was able to meet someone as kind and beautiful as you on my first day here.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201c(name)...\u201d</span> Kurumu blushed at your compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI know it sounds sappy, but I mean it.\u201d</span> you smiled. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBoth times when Kokoa bit me, I thought I was a goner. But both times, you saved me. To tell you the truth, I was afraid of coming here. I thought that if anyone found out I was human, I\u2019d be hunted down and killed simply because of that reason. But you and the others accepted me regardless.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWhether you're a monster or a human, there's no difference in the value of someone's life. The fact that you\u2019re a human doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</span> Kurumu stated matter-of-factly as she began to run her fingers through your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were deeply touched by Kurumu\u2019s statement, and you were overcome by the sudden urge to be close to her. You both stared into each other\u2019s eyes silently, before you began to lean closer to her, ignoring the pain in your neck. Just as your lips were about to touch hers, she pulled away. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry...\u201d</span> you muttered. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI just thought that-\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cIt\u2019s not you, (name). If I kiss you, then you\u2019ll become my slave.\u201d</span> Kurumu explained. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI don\u2019t want that to happen. I can\u2019t let that happen. You\u2019re my...\u201d</span> Kurumu trailed off, her voice now wavering. To you, it seemed as though she was close to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m your what?\u201d</span> you asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kurumu was about to answer you, a knock at the door caused her to silently stand up and walk over to the door. Kurumu shot you a glance as if to say <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cLie down and don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d</span> You did as Kurumu\u2019s look suggested as she turned the doorknob and opened it slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho\u2019s there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more importantly, what do they want?</span></div></div>",

Maybe some tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That would be nice. Thank you [name]-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\", you said with a smile of your face. Glad that the Headmaster had saved you from Kokoa's clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Shuzen-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!! Why did you called me like that? It's not like we're strangers, you know?\", she said with an angry and annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we ARE strangers. I met you today. And I don't know anything about you, other than you are Moka-san's sister and that you have an obsession with my blood.\", you said with a calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!!! Fine, whatever!!!\", she said, getting angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, do you want tea or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. Give that tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start preparing the tea, the Headmaster begins to explain, to Kokoa and you, why you're here. You didn't knew why you were here either. The only thing you knew was that he had begun an exchange program and that your old man and him were friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Ms. Shuzen, what [name]-kun said about the exchange program and about my friendship with his father is true. I'm planning to make it so that the Yokai Academy becomes a shcool for both, humans AND monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\", you and Kokoa shout, in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you do that?! Most monsters don't like humans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right, sir. If this school were to become a school for humans and monsters, it could be disastrous, to both sides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But I believe that, despite the risks of creating conflict, this situation could also create harmony between monsters and humans. To proof my theory, look at Aono Tsukune. He has befriended two vampires, actually three vampires, given that Akashia Moka is two persons in one body, a succubus, two witches, a werewolf and a yuki-onna. And so have you, right, [name]-kun]? Except for two of the three vampires and the werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember your meeting with Kurumu and the others and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir. I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Both, your and Tsukune's cases renwewd my hope. I can't say for sure if I will make the school accept both species yet, tough. I'll be watching and monitoring how you relationship with Tsukune and the others goes and I'll inform you and the others of my decision by the end of the school year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The others already know this?\", you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they do. And they have agreed. Well then, I'll take my leave, and you Ms. Shuzen, come with me. We have to discuss you punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-punishment?! For what?!\", she says, fear evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, for trying to, harm and enslave another student. And two, because you know well that girls aren't allowed in the boys dorm and that boys aren't allowed in the girls dorm, unless they are a couple. Like boyfriend and girlfriend. Have a good night [name]-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night to you Headmaster. For you too, Shuzen-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The decision ultimately wasn't up to you. You weren't the Headmaster of the academy and you didn't really know what the Headmaster was thinking. Sure, you were worried about your safety, as well as the possible problems that could arise from Y\u014dkai Academy becoming a true coeducational school, but it wasn't really your place to speak up. You thought it would just be best to let the Headmaster deal with everything and just have you focus on trying to fit in to Y\u014dkai Academy and maintain friendships with the wonderful people whom you had met on your first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, in spite of the batshit insane day you had just been a part of, you were able to relax and fall asleep. You felt your consciousness drift as you found yourself floating in the middle of the ocean, facing up towards the sky. Not a cloud could be seen as a gentle breeze pushed you along the water. The warm temperatures served to ease your mind and calm your soul as you became one with your surroundings. You were alone in the vast unbroken blue, but you didn't care. You closed your eyes once more and let the sounds of the ocean drown out all the fears and worries you still had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relaxation in the water was brought to an end when you felt a light dab on your forehead. You screwed your nose a little and paid no heed to the feeling as you tried to return to your state of tranquility, unfortunately to no avail. Every so often you would feel a light touch of water on your face, arms, legs, hands or feet. Without opening your eyes, you brought your hands up and wiped away the liquid\u2026 the slightly sticky\u2026 slightly salty liquid\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes just as more liquid dripped down into your eyes. You frantically wiped the rainwater out of your eyes as you were taken aback by its color and texture. Either there was red food coloring in the rain, or it was raining blood! You looked around and saw that the uninhabited ocean was now swimming with human corpses, the water now a murky black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did what anyone in this bizarre situation would do. You turned onto your stomach and began to swim as fast as you could, away from the floating mounds of rotting human flesh. The rain was pounding on you now, running down your body and mixing with the dark murky waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stone cold hand grabbed your arm and you fought back the urge to scream as you pulled your arm away from whatever was grabbing it. The horrible nightmare ended as you turned to see your dad \u2013 a terrifying zombified version of your dad, complete with maggots and worms moving in and out his open eye sockets \u2013 giving off a low pitched moan as he once again latched on to your arm and dragged you deep under water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke with a start, drenched in a cold sweat. Despite knowing that it was dream, you were the most frightened you had ever been in your entire life. Your chest felt a little bare. You looked down, and sure enough, the academy uniform that you had gone to sleep in was now slashed and torn, although you yourself were completely unharmed. It couldn't have been Kokoa. Kokoa wouldn't slash your shirt so neatly, so fine\u2026 so\u2026 <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIs that someone\u2019s initials?\u201d</span> you asked yourself as you realized that \u2018FT\u2019 was engraved into your shirt. Okay\u2026 this DEFINITELY wasn't Kokoa! She would just drink your blood and go on her way. Something in the back of your mind was telling you that there was someone more sinister out there, and for whatever reason, they didn't like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting bitten by a Vampire was one thing! But you weren't expecting to be mind raped until at least the end of the week. There was no way in Hell that you were gonna just brush this off and go back to sleep. You\u2019d had bad dreams before, but this was something else entirely! You needed help! But you weren't sure where you\u2019d be able to get help from, especially at this ungodly hour! Well\u2026 you DID\u2026 but you weren't sure you\u2019d be able to. After all, you couldn't rely on the Headmaster to bail you out of every situation you got yourself into. At the same time though, this was something you knew you couldn't face on your own. You needed answers, so you knew what you had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidying yourself up, you made a mad dash out of your room and went to find\u2026</span></div></div>",

Now I want any and all leads reported back to me of any activity that will expose any dirty secrets in this school so get to work and trust your instincts whatever they may be. Dismissed!\", ordered Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a powerful speech in a way but you needed to tell her that Kurumu knew about your secret so to not cause for concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh pardon me maam but I think theres been a minor complication.\", you told Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told Kurumu about...the thing that I can't let anyone know about me.\", you vaugly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby got very concerned but kept a level head,\"Do you trust her?\", she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats the reason why I told her.

The team with the best story get's to lead the club for the rest of the year!\", Ruby called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone went all nuts and worked faster to find an interesting topic but Kurumu took her time, mostly cuz of you being there distracting her.</span></div></div>",

Okuto called all the male students together. The girls went into the wading pool to watch the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkuto: Listen up! All boys get ready for the swimming obstacle course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name): A swimming obstacle course eh? This is the perfect opportunity! This'll get that girl's attention for sure! I show em I'm a real man!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joined all the boys who gathered for the obstacle course. Okuto explained how it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkuto: OK then! This course is for testing your reflexes! First you have dive into the pool. Then you swim till you reach the first obstacle. To pass the first obstacle, you have to walk across the ledge. Then you move onto the second obstacle. You must swing through this hoop and successfully move on to the next course. You must run across the bridge and onto the finish line to complete the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name) thinking: That doesn't sound so bad. I can do this! If I pass this thing, I'll finally get that girl to notice me! </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkuto: All righty then! Who's gonna go first? Step up if you think you got the guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said a word. Then you spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name): I'll go first! Bring it on!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone heard you speak, they all looked at you like you where crazy. Even the girls were whispering about your declaration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl1: Is that guy out of his mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy1: He's either has guts or just plain crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy2: Why would he want to take on Okuto's course anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl2: Probably has a death wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Yukari: Did you hear that Kurumu? That guy you have your eye on is gonna take on the course!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">Kurumu: Really?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Yukari: Haha! He won't last two minutes on that course!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a young girl with pink hair sat next to Yukari. She was Moka Akashiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">Moka: Now Yukari, be nice. You shouldn't talk that way about someone.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Yukari: Sorry Moka, but still there is no way that guy will make it.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name) thinking: Why that snot nosed brat! I'll show her! I'll show what I can do! And I'll show Kurumu what I can do!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkuto: Well, well. You got some guts. Very well then. Take your place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your place at the starting line and got ready to run the course. Then you looked at Kurumu and she looked at you. When you saw her she waved at you making your heart skip a beat. You waved at her back admiring how pretty she was, but then Okuto's voice snapped you back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkuto: Mr. (name)! Mr. (name)! Are you ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name): Oh um...yes! I'm good to go!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkuto: OK! On your mark! Get set....! (blows whistle)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you heard the whistle you took off. You bolted from the starting line and jumped into the pool with a beautiful dive. Then you briskly swam towards the first obstacle. You climbed up the ladder and made your way to the ledge. You carefully walked across the ledge using the handles on the wall for support. You were doing well and you were halfway across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: This is way to easy! I'll get through this in no time! I don't know why everyone was so worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would soon find out why. Suddenly something popped out of the wall and narrowly missed your face. The whole class gasped and Kurumu looked on with worry. This made you temporarily lose your balance, but luckily you got it back and were able to grab on to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name): What the....!!! What the hell was that?!?!?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw what almost punched you. The whole had little boxing punching gloves coming out of it. Before you had a chance to react, a boxing glove gave you a nasty punch on the thigh and then in the gut making some of the students cringe. You felt the wind get knocked out of you, but you bravely held on and kept on getting across the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">Moka: Oh dear that must've hurt. Poor guy.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Yukari: Yeah. I'm impressed he didn't fall in. Right Kurumu?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu said nothing. She looked on with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name) thinking: Damn it that hurt! No one told me this course was booby trapped!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boxing gloves kept coming as you made your way across the wall. Soon you made it across the wall and moved on to the second course. As you to grab the rope and start swinging, you were in for another nasty surprise. The ring you were supposed to swing through lit of fire making the whole class gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name): WHAT THE FRICK?!?!? WHY THE HELL IS THE RING ON FIRE?!?!?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl1: Oh boy! Okuto's really pushed it this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy2: There's no way that guy will make it through! He'll be burned to a crisp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name) thinking: This is nuts! I can't do this! I'll be cooked alive!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to tremble with fear and you hesitated. Then you saw Kurumu. You saw her watching you and you gained your confidence back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name): No way! I can't give up now! Kurumu's watching me and I'm not gonna let her down!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so with a crazy Tarzan yell, jumped off using the rope and swung through the hoop. Everything seemed to go in slow motion. You went through the hoop and landed safety on the platform. Everyone gasped with their jaws dropping and hands over their mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name) thinking: All right! That wasn't so bad. And I didn't even get hurt. Everyone is staring at my bodacity! </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly you were wrong. The reason why everyone was gasping was because the seat of  your trunks was on fire. You didn't notice till after you smelled your burning shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name): YEEEOOOOWWWW!!!!! HOT!!! HOT!!!!! HOT!!!!!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou patted your butt like crazy until the flames had died down. Then you moved onto the next course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy2: No way. This guy's been bruised and burned and he's still going! This dude's crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl1: Either that or he's got guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">Moka: I don't believe it. He's still going even though he's hurt.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">Yukari: I guess I underestimated this guy. I'm impressed. Looks like you were right about this guy being unique. Eh Kurumu?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Kurumu said nothing. She looked on with interest and worry. As for you, you staggered onto the third and final part of the course which was walking across a bridge. As you cautiously walked across, you looked around for any booby traps, but you couldn't see any. Just when you thought you were safe, three canons popped out from each side of you and before you had a chance to react they began to fire giant rubber balls at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">(name): OH COME ON!!!! YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!!!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ducked and you dodged ball as they zipped past your head. You looked like an action hero dodging bullets. The class cheered as you kept dodging the balls. Then just you were doing good, a ball hit you square in the face making the class say oooooooo! It really hurt, but you pressed on. Then another ball hit you square in the back. Then the leg and then the arm. Now the pain was ringing throughout your body as the balls pelted you all over your body. You were getting a little dizzy, and you were beginning to black out. At first you saw nothingness, but then you heard a voice call out to you. Your vision was blurry for a moment, but then it adjusted and you saw who was calling to you. It was Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">Kurumu: Come on! Don't give up! You got this!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wasn't the only one who was cheering. All the other students were cheering for you too. This made you motivated and you as you got up. Then a ball came straight at you, but you were able to catch it. Then you used it as a shield and bounced back every ball that came at you. The finish grew closer and closer until you crossed it. As soon as you did the entire class cheered especially Kurumu who was cheering the loudest of all. You felt like you were the king of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">(name) BOOYAH!!!! IN YOUR FACE OBSTACLE COURSE!!!! YOU GOT SERVED!!!!!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so excited that you threw the ball you caught like a football. Then flew from where you bounced and it bounced off wall to wall and object to object like a pinball. It kept bouncing and bouncing until it headed for it's true target. You. And then with a mighty smack, the ball hit right smack dab in the last place you wanted to be hit. The netheregions. The class cringed from the impact. You were motionless for a moment. Then let out a high pitched scream that would have made a window break. The pain was so overwhelming that you couldn't take it. You fell over unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

That didn't matter to you. All you cared was that you finally got Kurumu to talk to you and you made friends with Moka and Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew. What a day yesterday. Sure I went through hell going through that obstacle course, but it was worth it! Because I got to talk with...(sigh) Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you said her name, you fantasized about Kurumu and how pretty she was. Her sky blue hair, her violet eyes, and her curvacious body. The thought of her made you completely obvious to your surroundings. You looked like a complete perv. Then you heard a voice calling you and the sound of snapping fingers making you come back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: (name)? (name)? You OK? Hello? Yokai calling (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh! (shakes head) Rubi! Excuse me. How are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: I'm fine. I'm more worried about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. I'm fine. What you talking about? I'm perfectly OK. Hahaha. Why do you ask? hehehe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Well for one thing, you're kinda look like a perv right now. {(name) sweatdrop} And second I heard about you and your little stunt at Okuto's obstacle course. You hurt got hurt pretty bad and I'm worried it may have caused some damage to your body. Especially in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahahaha. Don't worry I'm fine. You don't have to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: You need to be more careful. Need I remind you that you're a human? If you do something that dangerous again you could get into some serious trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know I know. I'm sorry, I'll try to be more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: As long as you understand. I gotta go. I have to run a couple of errands. Remember, be discreet about being human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK you got it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rubi had left, you headed to your first class. You excited and hoping that Kurumu was there so you could talk to her some more. Soon you arrived at the door of your first class. You heart was beating and you were a little nervous about your second encounter with Kurumu, but you weren't worried. You gave yourself a slap on the cheeks to psych yourself up and you walked in the classroom. When you did the whole class looked at you at once. There was a long silence. Then you heard a girl scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl1: Oh my gosh! It's him! That's the guy who took on Okuto's course and survived! (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy1: He's a hometown Yokai hero!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the whole class cheered and then you were surrounded by girls. Needless to say, you were completely surprised by this sudden predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the.....hey! Take it easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy1: Hey (name)! Will you join the karate club? We could use a gutsy guy like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um well I.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl2: No way! He should join the swimming club! He was an awesome swimmer back at the course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well maybe.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl3: (name)! Can you sign my notebook?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy2: Dude! Can I have your autograph?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy3: Join the judo club! We need a guy with guts like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl4: Will you go out with me?

Hey! Take it easy people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly your words fell on deaf ears. No one could hear what you were trying to say. Not to mention the girls were using their monster strength.

You felt someone rubbing against your back. \"Guess who?\", said the obvious suspect. You turned to see Kurumu again looking as stunning as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumu! What's with the playfullness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never got away with being so touchy with Tskune so I'm sending all my moves on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? With Tskune? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and me competed for Tskune's affection and always got between me and him.\", Moka explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't even bother thinking about it. It left me heartbroken but I came back more passionate and lively than before.\", Kurumu stated. \"Oh hey Moka since we make a cute pair why not we double date later?\", Kurumu suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's up to (Name) if you ask me.\" , Moka replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that is a given!  You want to join with me on a date right? What's the matter, too much to handle?\", she said by seducing you with her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh sure I mean why not? Hanging out with some friends won't do any harm.\", you submitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yahoo yahoo! Don't worry on picking me up we'll all meet up by the usual hangout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the usual hangout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's fine I'll find you later and we'll go together you and me.\", Kurumu flirted. </span></div></div>",

I can't believe it! I'm going to go out with the hottest girl in Yokai! It may be a double date, but at least get to hang out with her. (sighs lovingly) She is just so awesome. I can't wait to see her. Not mention I can get to know Tsukune and Moka too. This is gonna be awesome. Now what should I wear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a hard time deciding what to wear for the double date. After all you wanted to make a good impression on Kurumu if you wanted to have a chance with her. You thought about dressing fancy, but you didn't wanna go overboard. Then you decided to dress a punker, but that didn't work either. So you decided to just dress casually and set off for your double date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now where am I supposed to go? Kurumu never said where to meet. Now think (name). Where would be a good meeting place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of places to hang out at Yokai Academy and there was only one place you could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know! The bus stop! That's a good place. Maybe they'll be there. I better get going. I don't wanna be late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you set off to the bus stop to meet your buddies while carefully being careful not to attract attention from the students. You didn't want to have a repeat of what happened yesterday after your fans almost tore you apart. Soon you made it to the bus stop, but there was no one to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh man. I hope I got the right place. In fact, this is the only meeting place I can think of. I don't really know this school very well yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood by the bus sign and waited for your friends. It was about 9:59 am and counting.

Moka was resting her head on Tskune' s shoulder. Kurumu was happy seeing her so happy with Tskune and it nearly brought her to tears. \"Your crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just happy for Moka is all. I've never seen her so happy before. Shes so alive and free, like a different person. You never saw her the first year, she was comftorable only around Tskune but now she's like that with every one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune and Moka came by ready to have a good time. \"Well guys it's a nice day to soak in the nice weather so I'm thinking we hit the park in the rural area in Japan. Heard they sell great food there.\", Tskune suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem oddly prepared for this, was this originally meant for a Tskune and Moka exclusive date?\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was kind enough to let you guys in on our plans so don't worry about being a buzzkill. Were all here to get to know each other. Except mostly you (Name).\", Moka replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus arrived and went to take you back to the world of humans which was a bit refreshing. Moka and Tskune sat together and you sat next with Kurumu with her chest rubbing against your arm. The four of you chatted during the ride and got some good laughs in on how you all thought of the driver and if he had a shady background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen on the walk to the park Kurumu held onto your arm with you trying to keep a straight face since her chest was distracting. She purposfully was flaunting them your way to see how you'd handle it. It was one of her tests she subtley gave you during the date. Soon you all made it to the park and bought hotdogs for yourselves. You treated everyone to the food seeing it as a courtesy for Tskune. After you all finished you sat by a hill laying on the grass looking up at the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telling you that it looks like three dogs barking. \", Moka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's a hydra. A kid can see that clear as day.\", Kurumu replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kid would know what a hydra even is?\", you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The smart imaginative kind.\", Tskune replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your just taking sides Tskune. Always with Moka. Even when you disagree you just let her be right about every thing.\", you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's because he's so sweet and he loves me.\", Moka retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a room you two.\", you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already have. \", Moka answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if Tskune loves you so much what about you (Name)? Don't you love me?\", Kurumu asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh I don't know how to answer that.\", you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't an answer. Yes or no do you love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just after half a date?\", you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't mean for real dude. She's just yanking your chain. But you still have to answer her though I'd speed up with the answer. \", Tskune said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then...Kurumu I love you.\", you said thinking it was just her teasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gasp! Oh you are just sooooooo sweet. Mwah\", Kurumu pulled you to her and kissed your cheek. You r cheeks looked like a pair of radishes and you froze in place. \"Hahaha your so cute when your like that.\", she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tease him Kurumu,  he'll be chasing after you now with that little gift. \", Moka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your aggressive and your always on the gas but never on the breaks with these dates. If it were up to you he'd have submitted his v-card to you in ten minutes.\", Moka teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha , Moka I'm dying of laughter.\", Kurumu replied sarcasticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez I'll say it again if it gets me another. \", you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, I'm not letting it go easy for you. You still have to earn the right to get a smooch from these lips again. Even harder for them hitting your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your best has been doing good so far.\"</span></div></div>",

Kurumu really seemed to give off the impression she liked you and it would be soon before all you had to do was tell her how you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid on your bed and began to get some sleep but the peace ended when you heard something. A sound that sounded like a spider of all things. You shrugged it off at first but got the sense it was a student since your in a school of monsters.

She climbed over the other side of the building and entered through the window across your room. Then she knocked on your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hello there can I help you?\", you asked when you saw who was knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just minding my own business.

You wondered why but anytime alone with Kurumu was never a bad thing. Soon as you got on the roof she was waiting for you and greeted you with a hug.

So what....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her kept on talking for a half hour and it was very seriouse whenever you talked about anything deep. But you became more lighthearted when you were just talking about other stuff. She was a beauty in looks for sure, but her personality was almost exactly as you invisoned it might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you both checked the time and knew you both had to get going. \"Seeya (Name), talk to you later.\", she hugged you again and flew to the womens dorms.

She was honest and she didn't try to force herself to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two broke away and starred at each other for a moment. Then you two kissed again only more passionately, but Keito stopped before she got into it and whispered, \"My room 229, tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and she left. You weren't being controlled, you were just in the heat of the moment and after a fit of anger. What were you doing? By the time you went back to your room and before you could go visit Keito, you tried thinking back on what happened and what was. Kurumu certainly seemed like she was manipulating you while Keito was looking out for you. You might be rushing right now with Keito but that kiss was only on the spur of the moment. You knew you needed to straighten it out with her the second you walked in her room later.</span></div></div>",

I saw you in the hallway and I'll admit your kinda cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken off guard. She spoke exactly what happened and flirted with you so matter of factly! You didn't know how to respond and you blushed in sheer embearesment. She noticed the blush and giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is (Name) lol redundant. And I like your hair.\", you replied. \"I did not just reply what I just said right now.\", you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw thanks,  my hair is a natural blue and I keep it in this style since nobody wears theirs like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She respondes with an answer that didn't make me look stupid!\", you thought. \"Oh that's nice. Which by the way, it won't come alive and strangle me right?  I know we can't reveal what monsters we are but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha,  no my hair isn't alive. That's a first for people first guessing what I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always have a method for leaving an impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your next class? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh just this club I'm assigned to. Newspaper they said. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding that's my next class and I'm among the leading members. Wanna walk me there after class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\", you answered a bit shyly.</span></div></div>",

Soon, you made your way to a pond in the middle of the forest. You then saw the girl and walked over to her. Once you got next to her, she pressed her breats against your chest and you instanly knew what kind of monster she was. For now you ust played along and acted all shy and embarrased. Then, she tried to use her charm ability to hypnotise you. But when she did this you said <span class=\"cblue\">\"Nice try. I knew what you were trying to do all along I was just acting this entire time. Your succubus charm doesn't work on me.\"</span> The girl stepped back and saw the serious look on your face. She smiled and said <span class=\"cteal\">\"I love a man who doesn't fall for my charms so easily. But a man who can resist my charm completely is even more attractive. My name is Kurumu Kurono.

You were about to cross under a tunnel when it became all warped and flashy like a rave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sir what is going on out there?\", you asked the driver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going into uncharted territory for you.\", he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you passed the tunnel and the bus stopped. You walked out to see a very disgusting landscape. The water on the edge was red and the trees were dead. \"Is this the right stop?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mistake. Just follow the path and you'll reach the school. \", the driver closed the door and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrific you thought,  stranded in a dead forest. You walked to the path hoping the school wasn't too far. Soon enough you found it but it looked very different from any other school.  It was more like a castle and it was dark in color. You made your way to the main office to check with your counseler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you passed some of the students they were talking about monster forms and other fantasy related stuff. For you it seemed like your kinda people.  You always loved that stuff so making friends should be a breeze.

She had dark hair a sexy outfit and looked sweet yet had something concealed behind her appearance. \"(Name) is it?\", as soon as she saw you she herself was a bit flustered. Her cheeks grew a small shade of red but she hid it with her paperwork. \"Come into my office,  we have some things to discuss.\"</span></div></div>",

Well give your mistress your paw.\", she deliberatly forced you to touch her breast which made you blush like an apple. \"Naughty naughty.  Mistress won't give you a treat if you don't behave. Say your sorry and you'll be a good boy. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just went along hoping it would end.\"I'm sorry I'll be a good boy now please let me go!\", you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.  Here's your treat. \", she kissed you on the cheek , making you blush even further. She handed you your schedule and released you. \"See you around (Name) hope it's soon. Mwah\", she blew you a kiss as you left her office. You tried to grasp what happened but knew she wasn't kidding. You were in a monster school. And you were human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to class hoping to let the last couple minutes be forgotten and just tried to get on with your day.</span></div></div>",

Your best friend Aria Lillian, whom you met back in 1st grade, is actually a doppelganger. You found out about her true identity soon after meeting her for the first time, when you witnessed her transforming into the form of your teacher Mrs. Stevenson, and that secret being shared between the two of you set the stage for a friendship that lasted for your entire life so far. Being friends with a doppelganger meant that you were made aware of an entire world of monsters that remained hidden from most humans, but you always loved the excitement this added to your otherwise dull life. Ever since the transition to high school, however, you hadn't seen Aria very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had transferred to Yokai Academy, a school specifically designed for monsters like her, and you were unable to go with her for obvious reasons. However, near the end of your freshman year, Aria called you and told you that a human student by the name of Tsukune Aono was discovered to have been enrolled in her school. She told you of how she had taken on the form of his closest friend, Moka Akashiya, in order to learn more about him. She didn't learn much before her cover was blown, but she soon became close friends with Tsukune and his friends, including Moka herself. After they became friends, Tsukune was more than willing to tell Aria all about himself. She then told you the full story of his time at the academy and encouraged you to follow his footsteps and enroll as well during your sophomore year, which you readily agreed to in order to be back with your childhood friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month had passed since that time, and you were just getting ready to head to your first day at the same monster school as Aria. As you ran toward the front gates of the school, you were greeted by an excited tackle-hug from Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"[name]! It's so good to see you again! You have no idea how lonely I've been without you around!\" </span>She said as she rubbed her face into your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Jeez Aria, calm down! I'm glad to see you too, but don't you think that a greeting like this is a little too intense for the first day of school?!\"</span> You said while laughing at your friend's display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Awww, but [name]... I missed you so much!\" </span>she says, letting go of you and putting on a pouty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I missed you too, Aria. But didn't you tell me that you got a boyfriend while you were here?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh yeah! That reminds me! I have to introduce you to my friends! Come on, I'll show you the way!\"</span> Aria said as she grabbed your arm and dragged you into the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply laughed to yourself the whole time. Aria hadn't changed a bit since junior high. Before you knew what had happened, you found yourself standing in a clubroom with two other boys and six different girls. Aria proceeded to introduce you to them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"[name], I'd like you to meet my new friends. The girls are Moka Akashiya, her little sister Kokoa Shuzen, Yukari Sendo, Kurumu Kurono, Ruby Tojo, and Mizore Shirayuki. This is my boyfriend Ginei Morioka, and the plain looking guy over there is the one I told you about, Tsukune Aono.\"</span> she said, pointing to each of the people as she said their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei stepped up to you first. He reached out to shake hands with you, and you accepted the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"So you're the childhood friend that Aria was telling us all about. Nice to meet ya! The name's Ginei Morioka, but you can just call me Gin. So, I've been curious about this since Aria told me about you... What kind of monster are you?\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Ummm, I'm not a monster... I'm a human.\"</span> you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room (other than Aria) gasps in shock. You and Aria simply look around confused before Aria speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"What, didn't I tell you? [name] here is a human, just like Tsukune!\" </span>she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\"Wow! I never expected that! Why didn't you tell us sooner, Aria?\"</span> Yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I could have sworn I told you guys before...\" </span>Aria responded, sounding somewhat embarrassed that she forgot to bring up an important detail like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"It's no big deal, Aria... But wow, I can't believe that we've got another human at the academy! Isn't this great, Tsukune?\"</span> Kurumu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Yeah, I'll say! But [name], are you sure you know what you're getting into here? I almost got killed when the school found out that I was a human...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Don't worry about it. Aria told me all about what happened with you, so I think I know what to expect if my secret gets blown. If anyone asks, I'm a wizard who never learned to use any magic. That should work as an excuse, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I suppose, but even the most talentless witches and wizards should be able to use at least basic level magic... You'd probably get made fun of by any of the others at the academy.\"</span> Ruby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yeah, well I'll be fine as long as a few insults are all that they throw at me. Aria wasn't exactly the most popular girl back in the human world, so I was already made fun of for being friends with her.\"</span> you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGin started laughing as he heard this, and Aria began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"[name]!!! Why did you have to say something like that! You're totally embarrassing me in front of my friends!\"</span> she pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Hehehe, sorry about that Aria... I was just-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Kokoa let out a loud groan and interrupted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Ugh! I am so bored with this! Why do I have to be here with you losers anyway?! And seriously, the last thing we need at this school is <i>another</i> worthless human cluttering up the halls!\"</span> the young vampire girl complained before storming out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Kokoa, wait! You shouldn't say such rude things! Come back!\"</span> Moka yelled as she chased after her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply looked over at Aria in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"What's her problem?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"*sigh* Oh, don't take it personally. Kokoa always acts like that. She's really pretty nice once you get to know her, though.\"</span> Aria answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, if you say so... Hey, Mizore was it?\"</span> you turn your attention to the purple haired girl who was standing in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore immediately looks up at you and begins to blush. Little did you know it, but she had thought you were pretty cute when she first saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Y-yes? What is it?\"</span> She asks nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Um, I was just wondering why you hadn't said anything yet. Are you shy around new people or something?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"N-no, it's just that... I, um...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can even respond, the bell rang to signal that you had to go to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh, look at the time! Gotta go!\"</span> she says as she runs out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else looked at eachother in confusion, having never seen Mizore act like this before. She herself was sure of it by now; she had fallen in love with you at first sight. As you and the others head to class together...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking down, you see that there is a large shadowy tentacle wrapping around you. You normally would have freaked out, but this wasn't the first time this had happened, and you knew exactly what was going on. In an instant the tentacle pulls you away from the group and back into the clubroom. The door then shuts behind you, and you look up to see Aria in her true monster form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, being a doppelganger, she didn't really have a true form. She would usually just take the form of your ideal woman, but her \"monster\" appearance was simply a shadowy version of that feminine figure. This form had no color to it; its skin, hair, and clothing were all pitch black, with the only thing that stood out being her glowing red eyes. Her shadow form served as the in-between for her transformations, and it was in this form that she could manipulate her body into any shape she wanted to. As the tentacle released you, it morphed back into Aria's right arm. Without saying a word, you walk up to her and bop her on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Dang it Aria, how many times have I told you not to do that?! If you wanted to talk to me in private, then you could have just tapped me on the shoulder and asked me! What if someone say you do that?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria simply giggled before speaking, her cheerful voice echoing a bit in her shadow form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Are you forgetting already [name]? We're in Yokai Academy now! Everything you used to keep me from doing in the human world is perfectly fine here!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Oh yeah, sorry... I guess I for-Wait a minute! Didn't you say that there was a rule about not revealing your true form on the school grounds?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"*giggle* Yeah, but nobody ever bothers to follow that rule. Didn't I tell you about how many times students would use their real forms to attack Tsukune and Moka before?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Ummm... I think I remember something like that. To be honest, most of the stuff you tell me just goes in one ear and out the other. Hehehe...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"[name]! You're so mean!\"</span> Aria says while lightly hitting your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I'm just kidding, Aria. You know I always listen to you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria simply turns her back to you and makes a pouty expression again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hmph, well you're still not forgiven for being so rude!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yeah, whatever Aria. So do you intend to tell me what you dragged me in here for? Emphasis on 'dragged'...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria immediately turns around and looks at you again, her brilliant red eyes staring deep into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"That's right! I had something important to tell you about this school before class starts!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Really?

You look down to see that your feet have already been frozen in place, but before you could call out to the others, another icy hand covers your mouth and freezes your lips shut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this point you were beginning to panic, and the ice covering your feet was slowly creeping up your legs. In almost no time at all, your entire body is frozen from the neck down. It is at this point that your attacker makes herself known. Stepping out from behind you is Mizore, whose hair and hands have transformed into formations of ice. Standing in front of you and placing her frosty hand on your cheek, she begins to blush. She then melts the ice off of your mouth before speaking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hello there, [name]. I'm sorry I had to do the so drastically, but I couldn't think of any other way to get you alone.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"It's okay Mizore, but what did you want?

Every time, secretly hoping that one day, I would find proof that magic exists. For 15 years, I waited and hoped, constantly seeking for the supernatural, but 3 years ago, today... I finally found it, though I had no idea at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the beginning of autumn, the end of summer break, and after yet another move, I found myself having to adjust to yet another new environment. New people... New places... New school...<br>\r\nI'd been through it several times before, so I'd grown used to it, but also tired of it. My parents, that morning told me they'd finally gotten me signed up for a new school, but it was a private school with a dorm. This excited me, as I had never lived in a dorm before and I was eager to try something new. The catch to this was, I'd have to leave that afternoon to move into the dorm. Fortunately, most of my stuff was still in boxes, so it didn't take much to get everything ready. They had spoken with the staff at the school and it was agreed I would take just a few suitcases with me at first and the rest would be shipped later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stop I was supposed to wait at, was a bit far, but I didn't have to wait long before it arrived. I deposited my things in the bus' storage compartment and hopped on. I thought it odd that I was the only one on, and the bus driver gave me some weird vibes, but I didn't care overly much. The trip was a little long and it was just after entering a tunnel that I noticed something was off. I was looking out the window and noticed that, instead of pitch black, as I'd expected, I saw a view similar to the warp tunnels in various movies. It freaked me out, but it excited me in a way. <br>\r\nI had finally found the magic I'd been searching so long for. I watched in awe for what seemed like forever before the view changed and I saw a haunted looking forest. The bus driver bid me farewell with an odd grin once I had pulled everything out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest seemed to go on for quite a ways, but the school building was clearly visible, even from where I stood. So I started forward, eager to see what else awaited me in this new life. However, my journey was brought to a quick halt when...</span></div></div>",

I could literally feel the huge sweat drop falling down the back of my head. I heard someone shout \"LOOK OUT!!!\" just before being launched out of the way. I hit the ground just as the ice hit the ground. The area shook with the force of the impact and I reached up to cover my face (I'd landed on my back), only to feel something soft and hear a gasp. Another sweat drop fell down my head as I quickly let go of what I'd just touched and kept my eyes closed. \"Uummm... Sorry... Bout that... but could you maybe get off? So I can see?\" I managed to say.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yeah... Sorry bout that.\" She replied, or at least, it sounded like a she. I opened my eyes to see a girl shifting off me and sit to the side. I groaned in pain as I attempted to get up. \"Aw, man, that hurt... You ok?\" I looked over to see the girl looked rather unharmed and a bit ashamed. <br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm alright... You aren't hurt bad, are you?\" She replied in a quiet, reserved voice. \"I'll be ok. I've had worse. Although I should thank you. It not every day one nearly gets crushed by a giant block of ice.\" I answered, jokingly. <br>\r\nShe cringed at that. \"Sorry. I came out here to practice some techniques and I didn't think anyone would be around here.\" <br>\r\nMy eyes bulged. \"That was you? Oh! Wow! That was awesome! I wish I could do something like that. Most I've ever made was a snow fort, which isn't really ice.\"<br>\r\nShe laughed at that. \"Well, I'm glad you weren't hurt. Oh! We haven't introduced ourselves, have we? My name is Mizore. I'm a snow woman.\" She smiled. I was starting to like those.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm Riku. I just got here a few minutes ago...\" I paused, remembering my suitcases. \"OH CRAP!!! MY STUFF!!!\" I ran over to where I had been and saw that, while not crushed under the ice, the suitcases had been torn in some places and covered in dirt and rocks. \"Well, at least they didn't get crushed...\" <br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry about that.\" Mizore said as she walked up. <br>\r\n\"It all looks mostly intact. I'll probably need to wash my clothes, but otherwise, I don't think anything is too bad.\" I said, reassuringly, as I began gathering everything together. <br>\r\n\"Well, so long as everything is ok, I'll take my leave then.\" Mizore said, bowing before turning away. <br>\r\n\"I'll see you later then.\" I waved as I made my way to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote from the author: I appreciate, and would like to encourage others to add to my story. I find it fun and challenging to work off of someone else's chapters, as well as my own. Feel free to add something you think would be appropriate, or just throw a wrench in there for kicks.

I take back my question</span>.\u201d she said with a giggle. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBut you\u2019ve already revealed to me that you\u2019re a vampire.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of the rule back then.\u201d</span> she said with a blush. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like one.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cOnly right now. But look at this.\u201d</span> You noticed a rosary around her neck. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cYes, the rosary on my chest. Once this rosary is taken off, I\u2019ll turn into a terrifying true vampire.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTrue?\u201d</span> you thought. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cThat\u2019s why this is a protective seal. I can\u2019t even take this off myself.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Even if you are a little scary...Moka is still Moka.\u201d</span> Moka then jumped up and hugged you again. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cThank goodness! You\u2019re my first friend Sasuke!\u201d </span>She then let you go a little and looked you in the eyes. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cAlso, one more thing\u2026you\u2019re my first love.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cFirst?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cUntil today, I\u2019ve only imbibed tomato juice and blood transfusion packets, so.... sucking real blood like that...Sasuke is...That sweetness, fragrance...that feeling... I cannot forget them!\u201d</span> she said as she embraced you. You then sensed something from inside the rosary. You quickly backed off and Moka asked what was wrong. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I got to go!\u201d</span> you said running down the steps. Soon, you made your way down to the gates of the academy and Moka was right behind you. She then asked what you were doing and you told her that you might be better off going to a human school. But Moka begged you not to go, because she hated humans. They tormented her when they found out she was a vampire and teased her constantly. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cIf I was one of those humans, would you still accept me?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMoka, even though I was born with special abilities, I am a human.\u201d</span> Moka backed away for a second. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cN-No way\u2026\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span> you said running off. Moka then came to the conclusion that human or monster, she would accept you no matter what. So she ran off after you. But on the way, Moka was attacked by Saizo again. You heard her scream and you knew what you had to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kurumu didn\u2019t have any malicious intentions.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cBecause, she doesn\u2019t look in the least like a bad girl. We can definitely get along. Like I do with you and the other Moka.\u201d</span> Kurumu began to cry an you and Moka looked at her. Moka then walked up to you and grabbed the rosary . <span class=\"cred\">\u201cDon\u2019t be so serious.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cred\">\u201cSasuke Uchiha, you\u2019ve misunderstood.

Unlike that other, sentimental Moka.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span> She then put the rosary back on and she changed back. You caught her as she fell. The next day, as you and Moka were walking to school, she told you the rosary spoke you her and told her where you were in your time of danger. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThe rosary did that?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cThat\u2019s strange\u2026could the seal be weakening?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cSeal\u2026\u201d </span>you thought to yourself. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cTo me, Moka is still my friend, no matter which one. So giving a little blood for you is no big deal.\u201d</span> Moka gasped just a little and you both stared at each other again. But then, Kurumu came from behind and surprised you both. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cGood morning Sasuke-kun! I baked some cute cookies for you. If you want we can eat them together.\u201d</span> <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cWhy me?\u201d</span> <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cSeriously, didn\u2019t I mention that I was looking for my Destined One?\u201d</span> <b>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</b> <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWell, I\u2019ve decided it to be Sasuke!\u201d</span> <b>\u201cEH?!\u201d</b> <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you risk your life to protect me Sasuke?

Try my cookies.\u201d </span>Moka and Kurumu began to have a little tug of war over you. <span class=\"cpink\">\u201cNo, Sasuke is mine!\u201d</span> she said as she pulled you in and bit your neck again. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cOh not this again!\u201d </span>you said as you knew there is now a battle for your heart going on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A moment ago they were going nuts for me!\u201d</span> <span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAre you alright, Sasuke?\u201d</span> Mizore just kind of poked your face. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. A little sore, but fine.\u201d</span> You said getting up. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cHere. A little gift for each of you.\u201d</span> you said calling upon the power of ice.

You gave it to her when you had the opportunity and you all went off to your homeroom, which you all shared the same one. And with that, the new year was ready to begin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But before a conflict between the two could begin again, the bat showed up an gave away your location.  Kokoa jumped in through the window and told the bat to come to her while her hand was in the air. It turned out that the bat is able to chage its shape and size. He became some kind of hammer and you and the others got out of there fast. You and Moka thought you were safe, but the bat gave away your hiding spot again. As he transformed into some kind of spiked bat, before she could attack, Kurumu and Yukari distracted her. Mizore tried to help, but they ended up getting hit. <span class=\"corange\">\"Now for you, sister.\"</span> she said turning around. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I don't think so! Chaos Control!\"</span> In that moment, a huge flash of light came from where you were standing and when it faded, Kokoa saw that you and the others were gone.

As she did this, Koka was about to kill her but didn't. Moka asked why and you gae the answer you thought was correct, but boy were you wrong!

Most of the day was like this, but when Tsurara and Ageha looked at each other, it's like a long lost rivalry was up and running again. So for most of the day, Kurumu and Mizore obeyed their mothers orders on how to make you theirs. Mizore even froze you at once point. But when it was luch time, things got really chaotic. The two of the mothers began to fight each other and trashed most of the school. They then talked about how the other was the ause as to why neither of them got the man they loved when they attended this school.

In one of the chairs sat a plain-looking young man with short brown hair and black eyes, wearing a brown coat, blue pants and black boots. \"Well hello there (name) it's so nice to see you again.\" Said the mysterious man. \"Hello Outsider, it's been awhile since I seen you.\" You replied back. The Outsider motioned his hand to the seat next to him. \"Would you like to sit down?\" Asked the outsider simply. \"Alright.\" You answered as you walked to the chair and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) do you remember how you met Corvo and me?\" The outsider asked. You looked at the outsider seemly unemotional\u200b face. You only seen the Outsider express a few other emotions but that was a rare sighting to see. \"Yeah I remember.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Flashback time* <br>\r\nA few years back you were just became a teen. Funny thing was you were a normal teen until you meet the Outsider and Corvo. You meet them during the summer, while you were exploring a seemly abandoned building with an old fashion design. When you walked in you see decaying\u200b floors, broken walls and a stairway. After deciding to move on you slowly made your way to a hall which had three rooms, one completely destroyed and caved in. The second one empty and covered in dust. While the last one had it's door closed and blocked. You tried to remove the boards nails onto the door to no avail. You then remembered the stairway and decided to see if you can find something to help remove the boards. You walked back to the stairs and walked up unfortunately there was a gaping hole in the floor. Your turned good when you noticed the hole lead to the room! You slowly jumped down and found a room with a werid altar with a mysterious vibe. You walked to the altar and looked at it with interest. Suddenly out of instinct you moved to touch something floating on the altar... Some sort of charm... You touched and a dark void consumed your vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End flashback* <br>\r\n\"You were quite the curious\u200b teen (name)\" outsider said amused. \"I always liked super natural things.\" You explain to the outsider. \"That will be all for now we will continue next time.\" The Outsider told you. \"Why did you ask me about how I met you and Corvo?\" You asked. \"I'll tell you next time we meet and Corvo will be here as well.\" The Outsider answered. The Outsider waved you a simple goodbye as your vision begins to fade.</span></div></div>",

You sit in the back planning to catch a few z's when your cellphone ring opening it you see the caller is your mother. \"Hello Matty how's the ride.\" she says not hiding she has a grin on. \"Oh it's fine mom but why did you call.\" you say trying to mask your sarcasm she giggles. \"well I just want to tell you an old friend of mines daughter will meet you thier but don't worry she'll just be doing her job.\" she ether hung up or you dropped the call because you enter a tunnel as the bus passes through you feel as if this is the point of no return for you but after a few minutes you see light and are now out of the dark passage way you and Tsukune and you get off the bus to see where you are and see a weird sight first a set of cliff that suround a lake of blood red water a large building and a large forest also a scarecrow sign saying 'yokai private academy' Tsukune talks to the bus driver quick but you run a head only to get lost in the forest you stop to catch your breath. \"I need more practice but what's going on here.\" you say to your self as you pull out your cellphone to contact your parents but notice their is no reseption. \"Crap this can't get worst.\" oh how the fates love to screw with people because just as you say this a girl with long purple hair and wearing a black uniform shows up right behind her arms crossed and a smile on her face. \"hey kid.\" you turn around. \"your name is Matthew kazame right.\" she asks in a less then polite tone but you brush it off. \"ya I'm Matthew kazame. Hey howed you know my name?\" yo ask she smile but it changes as he body seems to change her teeth seem to have shifted into fangs her eyes seem different and she lifts up her shirt to the point you can see her stomach and six long spider legs come out your thinking two thing ether run or stand your ground you chose.</span></div></div>",

Ketio looked and thought of the whole idea before saku interrupted. \"Besides this was thought up ages ago an arranged marriage often has it's problems but they work them selves out.\" saku smilled as Ketio just sat their the whole challenge was a test of Matthew's courage but still the other members of the security squad didn't know nether did Matthew ether but still saku was proud she was join to yokai clan and that's all she thought about though she did tell them a head of time he was human but it didn't matter to her only peace. \"okay I have to get back to my husband before he starts to worry hope you and Matt get along~~.\" and with that saku vanished Ketio returned to writeing the notes knowing she probably hit him hard enought to keep him out for a while and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the school---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetio had sent the notes to all of your teacher but you woke up a few seconds after 3 period holding your head and looking in a mirror you saw the blood had dried you start to clean it off the cut you find is small so you hide it with you hair and go onto your third class you hope Tsukune is in you class as you enter you see....</span></div></div>",

You explained to them that your powers are what got you there in the first place. One day, the temperature was at a height of 100 degrees. You then decided that it was time to make a visit to the school pool. Once you changed into your trunks, you sat in the shallow end of the pool to relax in the heat. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cThat feels nice.\u201d</span> you said as you closed your eyes. You then heard the slightest splash. You opened your eyes and quickly jumped into the air. Just then, something came out of the water from behind and tackled you, sending you into the pool with it. Thanks to the power of water, you could breath underwater. You searched for the creature that did this to you. You were then struck from behind and you turned to find nothing. You were struck again and again with the same result. But the odd part of this was that the strikes didn\u2019t hurt. It was like someone was just pushing you around playfully. And then, you felt something from behind and you turned your head and saw a woman with beautiful green eyes and ocean blue hair. You then noticed the lower half of her body was that of a fish and you knew what she was, a mermaid. You knew this was bad. She could easily bite and suck the life energy from you. But to your surprise, she started to rub her hands all over you in a sensual manner. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cMy, you are quite handsome. You seem to be very well built. I think you and I should get to know each other a little better. My name is Tamao Ichinose.\u201d</span> She said as she slowly swam in front of you while keeping eye contact. All you could do is watch, because for some odd reason you couldn\u2019t move at all. And once she was in front of you, before you knew it, she kissed you full on the lips! You were extremely surprised by this, so much so that you could move again and you called upon the power of wind to push her back a little and shoot yourself out of the pool. Even though you had a slight blush on your face, you used the power of fire to dry off and walk away. <span class=\"cblue\">\u201cMan, what is up with that chick?\u201d</span> you said to yourself. Once you changed, you had to get past the pool. You then jumped to the other side of it with such speed, not even Tamao could keep up. As you walked away, Tamao rose to the surface and said to herself while waving her tail playfully in the air <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat was Sasuke Uchiha. I plan to have a lot of fun with him.\u201d</span> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You will be know as (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a boy named (name). A typical nineteen year old boy. You went to school, got good grades, and did your best to be the good student you were expected to be. You were going to be a second year high school student, well at least that was the plan. You see back when you were in your previous school you got into a fight. You saw a bunch of bullies picking another boy and beating him up. You couldn't stand by while that was happening, so what did you do? You ended up getting into a fight with all of the bullies and beat the ever living snot out of them. By the time the teachers got on the scene you were covered in bruises and blood. You looked like you committed a murder. The teachers took you in and they thought you were the one that caused the fight so sadly you were held back a grade. To make matters worse, all students in your school were scared of you when they found out the news. When you were in the room in class you could hear them talking about how you were covered in blood and how you enjoyed beating them up and were given the nickname \"The Bloody Warrior\". Because of that you never spoke to anyone or made friends. Then after you completed your first year, your parents decided to send you to a private school so you could have a fresh clean start. And so you were on a bus on route to a private school called Yokai Academy. As the bus drove through your town, you gazed out the window looking at the passing buildings and cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Man. What a drag. Those teachers just had to hold me back a grade. Not mention everyone thinks I'm the scariest thing on the planet. Oh well. At least I can have a fresh start. Who knows? Maybe I'll be able to make some friends, if my reputation doesn't catch up with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bus driver spoke to you in a throaty voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBus Driver: Hey boy. You a new student at Yokai Academy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes. I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBus Driver: Then you'd better be wary boy. That school can be a scary ass place if you're not careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't worry. I think I'll be OK. It's just a private school right? How scary can it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you looked out the window. You were shocked to see a change of scenery. You were welcomed to the sight of a red ocean and the endless forest of trees. The bus stopped and you departed still blown away by the sudden change of scenery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whoa. Where the heck am I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBus Driver: Remember boy. Watch your back and don't get eaten alive now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the bus driver drove away back into the tunnel and disappeared. You looked around and saw nothing, but the ocean and the trees. Then in the distance you saw a building that looked like a castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I wonder if that's the school? If it is I better get going. I wouldn't wanna be late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you walked through the forest of dead trees in search of the dorms. The trees were tall and were filled with crows and bats. You couldn't help, but feel a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. This is getting a little scary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs scary as it was you pressed on trying to ignore the crows and the bats. Then you heard a squeaking sound. It was a quiet sound at first, but you could hear the squeaking get closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the.... Am I.....being followed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little more scared you walked a little faster. The squeaking sound got closer and closer. Now you were sure that something was following you. You quickly turn around and looked. There was nothing there. Then you saw something swoop by your head. It was a little bat. You let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew. It was just a bat. For a minute there I thought I something was.....DAAAAH!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly from out of nowhere, a young girl with orange pair with pigtails riding a bike (AKA Kokoa) came crashing straight at you, sending the two of you flying. When you regained your senses after that crash, you got up. As you were your right hand felt something soft and you heard a moan. When you opened your eyes you saw that you were right on top of the girl who crashed into you and were grabbing her chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look at her face. When you two locked eyes you thought she was the cutest girl you ever laid eyes on. Her white skin and her emerald green eyes totally blew you away. Then the moment was ruined by the girl's sharp tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey! Watch where you're touching creep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she gave you a mighty kick sending you off of her and slamming into a rock. Needless to say you were a little pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! What the hell's your problem?!? I said I was sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Pervert! You felt me up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Not on purpose! Besides you didn't have to kick me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a sharp pain on your cheek. You felt it and there was a little blood on your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aw great! Now look what you....Dah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped in surprise for now the girl was now close to you face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh wow! I believe I'm saying this, but you smell really good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I what?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything else the girl leaned in and gently licked your wound making you blush heavily in embarrassment. Then when the girl realized what she was doing she gave you another kick. This time in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OW!! Damn it! What the hell was that for?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You were gonna grope me again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): As if I would! Why would I want to grope a little kid like you anyway?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Excuse me?!?!? For your information I'm eighteen years old you bastard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You sure could've fooled me you little brat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What'd you say?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You heard me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two stared each other growling like a pair of dogs, but then the girl suddenly remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh crap! I don't have time for this! I gotta get back to the school and meet big sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Get back here you brat! I'm not finished with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: We'll settle this later! I don't have time to deal with you so drop dead you pervert!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What's you say?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could stop her the girl raced off down the road, leaving you alone and pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the hell is that girls deal?!? First she kicks me, then she licks me on the cheek, and then she kicks me again! Damn it! Now I'm in a bad mood! Oh well. I can't worry about that now. I gotta get to the Yokai before I'm late. Hopefully I won't run into that little brat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you thought about Kokoa licking your cheek the thought of it made you blush again. Then you decided to put it out of your mind for a while and you set off toward Yokai Academy</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure but you knew that something would spark a fight this year one way or another. Class ended but that girl from this morning walked by and you were pissed. \"Hey you!\", you yelled. \"I bet you think your funny with kicking me around this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look here buddy let me give you a good piece of advice,  back off.\", she replied in a cold threatning tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let it slide, not without either an apology or I stomp your face in with my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how you would treat a sweet girl like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your many things but sweet isn't one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you suffered brain damage,  because everyone knows fighting me is a deathwish. Must have kicked you so hard that thick skull of yours cracked like an egg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NOW YOUR ASKING FOR IT!\", you swung at her but then you felt like you were blown across the entire hallway. She shoved you so hard you went flying. You slid on the floor slowing down your momentum and got back up. \"What the hell just happend?\", you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't over when she tackled and wrestled you getting you into a full nelson. \"Had enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close! \", but you grew to eat those words when she threw you over the staircase. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\", you landed on your back over the wall. Thank god she didn't throw you in the center otherwise you'd be dead. Instead she threw you across from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok how's it your so damn strong? You don't have any muscle on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, I'm an S class monster. And now I'm done toying with you!\", before she could lunge her sister Moka intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokoa enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He started it! He was being fresh with me this morning and groped me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your crazy!  What do you mean fresh? ! You knocked me over with your bike and kicked me twice in the head! And you licked me for no reason! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokoa is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah because he felt my chest! Besides he got in my way while I rode my bike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok clearly your both at fault so I'm brining an end to it. Both of you shake and move on from that incident. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way sister I'm-\", Moka death glared Kokoa and got her to change her mind, \"totally going to do as you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that girl gave Kokoa goosebumps then you better follow her lead. You and Kokoa agreed to put the incident behind you and start fresh. But neither of you weren't liking the idea. \"Hey if I come around and drinking your blood, that's just me getting some food ok. I'm not trying to kill you.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a vampire? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, it's a school for monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it made sense, her unbelivable strength, the castle for a school look,  and all the work from class , made sense now.

Not to mention she licked my cheek because she wanted my blood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Kokoa licking your cheek suddenly snapped you out of your rage.

Why would I think a girl like that is cute?!? Especially since she kicked me in the face twice and she called me a pervert! I don't care if she is a S class monster or whatever! I'm gonna kick that girls ass just you wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you went to sleep. Meanwhile as for Kokoa.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Why that stupid perverted bastard! Who does he think he is talking to me like that! That stupid little pervert! Not only did he get in my he also grabbed my chest! The little perv.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa began remembering how you were grabbing her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: His hand. It......was so...... DAH! What the hell am I thinking!?!? That little perv grabbed my chest and no one grabs my tits and gets away with it! Not while my name Kokoa Shuzen! Just you wait you little brat! I'll show you why you should fear a S class vampire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem that the both of you were in each others thoughts, but not in a good way.

I'm Shizuca Nekonome and I'll be your teacher. To start with as you're all aware, Yokai is a unique school that is for monsters. Currently the planet is under the control of monsters so in order for monsters like you and me to survive, we must learn how to coexist with them.

What a bunch of boring rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Nekonome: Hmmm. Let's see. (looking through roll call) Ah! Saizo Komiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: If I do see a human why not just eat it? That's what I would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Saizo's tongue eerily snaked out of his mouth and licked his lips making you cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Nekonome: Now Saizo. There's no chance of that happening because everybody at this school is a monster including the teachers, so no exceptions K? You see the school is surrounded by a secret barrier, so there's no chance of a human getting in. And even if a human were to go through it somehow and made it here. they would be killed immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard Ms. Nekonome make that statement, you felt your heart leap and you gulped. This made Saizo give you an odd look as if he heard you, but you pretended not to pay attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Whatever you say teach, but I've been smelling human this whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Nekonome: In any case, just make sure you follow these two rules. Got it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass: Yes.<br>\r\n(flashback ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then you've been on edge, thinking about what your teacher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. This sucks.I guess my teacher was serious about this school being for monsters. What the hell have I gotten myself into? Not only is this school filled with monsters that hate humans, but if someone finds out I'm a human, I'm as good as dead! I can't let anyone find out. Especially that stupid jerk Kokoa. If she found out she'd totally kick my ass. Well, at least it;s not that bad. As long as I don't reveal I'm a human I'll be OK. All I have to do is keep a low profile and I should at least survive right? How hard could it be? And If all else fails......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were thinking about your predicament, you bumped into someone hard. Unfortunately, that one person turned out to be Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hey! Watch where ya going punk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ow! Sorry. I wasn't watching were I was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to walk away Saizo blocked your route and he didn't look very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hey. You think you can just bump into me say your sorry and walk away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What's your problem? I said I was sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Sorry's not gonna cut it pal. You owe me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What do you want from me? A freakin trophy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: I want you to get on your knees and beg for your forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to deal with this crap, but then again you didn't want to get into a fight with Saizo. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

I don't know what your problem is, but if you don't mind, I got somewhere to be so leave me alone would ya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you walked past Saizo and you expected him to leave you alone after that, but then a giant shadow cast over you. You looked behind you and you practically almost had a heart attack. Saizo was now standing behind you in his monster form. An orc. He charged straight at you in a giant fit of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the freakin hell?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You little shit! No one talks to me like that and gets away with you little shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tskune, Moka, and the gang had just gotten off of class and were sharing news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Whew. I'm glad that's over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh come on Tskune. Class was a breeze today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Probably because that you've been asleep half the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Shut it brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: So, I heard that parents day is coming soon. Are any of your parents gonna be here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yup. You can definitely count on my mom being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: And mom too. She especially can't wait to be there to see you Tskune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I'm...sure.....(sweatdrop)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Don't worry Tskune. If Kurumu's and Mizore's moms cause trouble again, my parents will back you up K?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Um.....thanks.....what about you Moka? Same as usual?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka was lost in thought for some reason. She was still thinking about you and Kokoa fighting the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey Moka. You OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Yeah. You look like you're thinking about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: No don't worry I'm fine. I'm just thinking about Kokoa that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Why would you be worried about that little brat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Well you see she's been acting strange ever since she got into a fight with a boy the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Acting strange?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: In what way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka explained how she found you and Kokoa fighting the other the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: So that's it huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: That is a bit strange. Considering how it's Kokoa. You know maybe she's got a crush on him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Are you serious Yukari? Come on. This is Kokoa we're talking about here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. She's not exactly the type of person who falls in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Oh come on guys. It could happen. Even a person like Kokoa can fall in love if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: By the way Moka, did you ever get the guy who fought Kokoa's name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: No. I never really got the chance to. I was hoping I'd ask her when I go see her for parents day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kokoa from out of nowhere and kicked Tsukune square in the face sending him flying to a bunch of desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Tsukune! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (holding cheek) Owww.....don't worry I'm fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I don't need your charity! Don't even think about coming to my classroom otherwise you'll meet the end of my foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What the hell is your problem?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh shut up! Just being with you guys just pisses me off! Oh by the way shrimp, I don't like that stupid pervert got it?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Eep! You heard that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: She's a stalker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Shut up! Like you're one to talk! Anyway the day I like that stupid pervert is that day that I get hit by lighting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you went flying from the window and crashed right into Kokoa. Both of you went flying and crashed straight into the wall. Kokoa regained conscious, she opened her eyes to see you lying on top of her. To make matters worse your hand in a face that if shouldn't have been. Kokoa's thigh under her skirt. When she saw this, Kokoa turned as red as her hair. Needless to day, she wasn't the only one who was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: WH-WH-WH-WH-WHAAAAA?!?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Where the heck did he come from?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: It's him! That's the boy who was fighting with Kokoa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: And look where his hand is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Oh wow! how scandalous! and so bold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Mizore, wipe that weird grin off your face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ouch! Why that little....! Now he's pissed me off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely oblivious that you were on top off Kokoa and your surroundings. The only thing that you cared about was kicking Saizo's ass. You got off of Kokoa and jumped out from the window and gunned for Saizo. Tsukune and the others watched as you went back to fighting Saizo. Kokoa however was seething with anger after what just happened. Not only did you grab her in the chest, but now you had practically grabbed her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: That......little......prick.........!!! He's......a dead man!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back to you and your fight with Saizo, you were trying at least get a hit on him. Sadly you weren't having much luck. Saizo was too strong and you were bruised and your body was screaming in pain. Whenever you tried to get a hit on Saizo, he would dodge and then hit you back. All you could do was dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Come on. This fight's getting boring. If you're gonna fight me, at least transform to your monster form first. That way I'll at least have some fun beating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: That'll be hard to do because I'm human. Damn. I have to figure out a way to beat him, but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked all over Saizo and thought of a way to beat him. Then you had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Maybe I just need to catch him off guard and then when I at least stun him I'll escape. And I know just the way to do it. (aloud) Hey ugly! Don't flatter yourself! I don't need to transform to beat you! You're not even worth the trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: What did you say?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You heard me! Or do you need to get your ears checked?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: This guy's either brave or crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I'd have to go with crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Why you little....!! Now you're gonna pay! Prepare to die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: All I have to do is get him while he's flying into a rage. When he attacks I'll get in the stomach and stun him. Then I'll get the heck out of here<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo gunned straight at you and was ready to kill you, but you stood his ground and readied yourself for his attack. Then Saizo attacked, but you were able to dodge and then you threw your right fist with everything you had at Saizo, but then.....</span></div></div>",

What the......!!! Hey! It's you again Koko! What the hell was that for?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You're the one that started it you punk! Who do you think you are pulling a sneak attack like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Bullshit! I was busy fighting this bozo until you showed up! (points at Saizo) I was gonna kick his ass until you came in and kicked me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You? Fighting that guy? Hah! How pathetic! I knew that you were weak before, but if you can't even beat this guy you must be so weak that you couldn't even fight out a paper bag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): SAY WHAT?!? You wanna start something you little brat?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Bring it on you perverted maggot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sissy vampire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa:Whiny dickwad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Kokoa continued your little game of insults everyone looked on in complete and utter shock. Even Saizo flabber was gasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What the hell...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I don't know which shocks me more. The fact that they're fighting over something stupid or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: The fact that they are completely oblivious as to what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: No kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Um excuse me. Would you two cut the crap already and stop acting like a married couple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) and Kokoa: We're not a couple and butt out ugly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka, Tskune, Mizore, Kurumu, and Yukari: Perfect sync!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Stop coping me you pigtailed jerk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You're the one coping me you horny toad moron!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you went at it yelling at each other. Now Saizo felt completely dissed after being ignored. He charged straight at both you and Kokoa in a raging fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: I'm not gonna sit and be ignored! Now I'll kill both of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Oh no! If they don't stop arguing Saizo's gonna get them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Kokoa! (name)! Look out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Moka, you and Kokoa looked and saw Saizo coming toward you. Then you both drew your fists and both punched Saizo in the face at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) and Kokoa: WE TOLD YOU TO BUTT OUT ALREADY!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both punched Saizo so hard, he went flying into the sky until he was nothing more, but a sparkle in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka, Tskune, Mizore, Kurumu, and Yukari: Perfect sync again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Stop coping me I said!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You stop coping me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Kokoa had a growling and intense stare down. Then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: OK! That's it! KO!!! Get over here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a little bat flew from the sky and landed on Kokoa's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: You called Miss Kokoa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Holy crap! A talking bat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I need your help! Hurry and transform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Right away Miss Kokoa whee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa grabbed a hold of Ko and then Ko transformed into a giant mace!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh crap! I think Kokoa's taking this seriously now!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: She's gonna totally mop the floor with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Kokoa! Please stop this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! That's no fair! You can't just wield a weapon like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Shut up! Like I care about playing fair! Just hurry up and die already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa swung her mace like crazy trying to score a hit while you kept dodging trying to stay alive. Unfortunately the fight with Saizo has left you weary and you couldn't dodge her attacks forever. You had to think of something and fast. Then you had an idea. You stopped running and took a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Oh man! I think he's gonna fight Kokoa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: He can't! Kokoa's too strong for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: If he fights her, he's got a one way tickets of being sent to a grave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hah. So you're finally gonna stop running huh? Then I guess you've made your peace and decided to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Not really girlie! I stopped because I decided to stop playing around. It's time for me to get serious! It's time to unleash my trump card! The all powerful (name) secret technique!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa, Tsukune, Moka, Kurumu, Mizore and Yukari: The (name) secret technique?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's right! Now get ready because now you're going down! Prepare yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged at  Kokoa with your fist raised and Kokoa readied her weapon and brought it down to hit you, but at the last moment you dodged it and then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Charge your opponent (crouch down) face away from the opponent and.......RUN AWAY!!!! (races off)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence as you raced away. Everyone had a look of complete and utter shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: That was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: the all powerful......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore, Kurumu, and Mizore: (name) secret technique?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa was dazed and confused for a moment, but then she exploded in anger and chased after you in hot pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!? GET BACK HERE YOU COWARD!!! COME BACK HERE SO I COULD KILL YOU!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as for you, you ran and ran until you made it to the one place that you could at least get some rest. Your room in the boys dorm. When you got into your room, you lied on the bed and let out a deep sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew. I can't believe I managed to get away. If I hadn't run away, I would've gotten my ass beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a twang of pain of your right arm. You looked and you saw a little bit of blood coming from a gash on your right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Shit! I guess I must've gotten it when I was fighting. Ow that hurts, but I feel so weak I can hardly move. Damn not now! Not when I've got a maniac after me. I need to.....go and....treat this...wound.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you try to get up, you vision began to get blurry. Your eye lids grew heavier and heavier until you fell unconscious. Then a few hours later you wake up....</span></div></div>",

After all, Kurumu did say that the photo belonged to Moka. She was also one of the the first people that you met when you first came here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I wonder. Could Moka be my secret crush?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(fantasy)<br>\r\n(name): Hey Moka. Can I talk to you for a minute?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka seeing you blushed and then tried to run away, but you stopped her by grabbing her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name); Wait. Why are you running away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Because.......I know why you're here......you're gonna ask me about the love letter you received right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-yes. How'd you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Because.....I.....I......I was the one who wrote that letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yes. It was me. I was the one who wrote that letter. I couldn't tell you right away because you were fighting with Kokoa. And back when you were fighting Saizo, you were so gallant and brave. Ever since then I've been in love with you. I love you so much that......that.....I want you to be my boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) blushing: Are you serious?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yes. So will you.....um......will you please be my boyfriend and hopefully in the future have babies?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) takes Moka's hands: Yes. Of course I will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka hugs (name): Oh thank you (name)! I promise you won't regret it! Let's have 30 babies together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes my darling Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Moka were both carrying babies in your arms and they looked like Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh (name). You've made me so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) And that's ditto for me honey bun.<br>\r\n(fantasy end)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you were completely red in the face and steam was coming out from your head like a teapot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What in the freaking hell made me dream that up?!?!? And why do our kids look like Kurumu?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt someone tap your shoulder you turn around and you see Moka right behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Um, excuse me. Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): DAH!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh! You're the boy that was fighting with Kokoa the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....yeah....hehehehe.....I didn't formally introduce myself before. My name is (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Moka Akashiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know. You're pretty well known around here. Wow. You're that same scary girl from the other day? You seem so......nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Hahaha. Well....that's because that's the other me you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Other you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yes. The other me was my true self. You see because of this rosary I keep on my chest, it keeps my monster energy under control. If my rosary would ever be taken off, I would become what you just saw. A powerful and terrifying vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That makes sense. You were so scary the other day it's no wonder Kokoa got scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Speaking of there's something I need to talk to you about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heart skipped a beat. And then you began to get nervous. You knew what what coming. (or at least what you think is coming)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh crap! This is it! She's gonna come clean! What do I do?!? Should I turn her down or accept her?!? Oh my gosh I'm not good at these situations!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long and awkward silence then you and Moka spoke at the same time trying to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I'm sorry for Kokoa's behavior!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK! I'll do it just go easy on me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pause and then you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Pardon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I said I want to apologize for Kokoa's behavior. I know she's a bit mean, but she's my sister. She's a sweet girl once you get to know her. So try to get along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that Moka was wrong, but you decided to be respectful listen to her. Especially since she's the sister of another vampire and you didn't want to feel the wrath of two vampires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's OK Moka. Don't worry about it. I'll try to get along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Thank you. I appreciate it. By the way, didn't you say something before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) blushing: Um.....nope! I didn't say nothing! You're just imagining things! Hahah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: OK.....anyway, if you need anything just let me know and I'll do whatever I can to help. I gotta go. I have to meet Tsukune for a study session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Is Tsukune a friend of yours?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh yes. He's one of my best friends in the world. I'll introduce you sometime. Gotta go. Bye (name). It was nice meeting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You too Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Moka began to walk away, you suddenly remembered that you were going to ask her about the photo. You were about to call her back when you felt a sudden chill go down your spine. Then you began to get the feeling that you were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the....? Someone's watching me, but where are they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and then you see someone hiding behind a pillar down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Come out of there!

Later you were walking to class ready to start the day. When you entered the classroom, you were greeted by a surprise attack courtesy of Kurumu. She pounced on you, pressing her breasts on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hello (name)y!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mmmph!!! Kurumu! Nice to see you too....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kinda suffocating and at the same time you were happy too. You gently moved Kurumu off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Kurumu, could you take it easy with the lover dovey stuff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Why? You have a problem with my affection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um...no. It's just that it's gonna attract unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Just take a look. (points to the class)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu looked and she could see why. Everyone in the class was staring at the scene you two were making. The girls were whispering about how Kurumu and you looked so cute together while the boys looked on with jealously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh OK. I'll try to keep it down a notch, but that doesn't mean I'll stop showing the world how much I love you. K stud muffin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu gave you a peck on the cheek. The moment she did all the boys seethed with anger and were even more jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy1: Why the little punk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy2: It's not fair! How come he gets to play with those fun bags?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy3: That guy is the enemy of all man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a few minutes later class began. During class the boys continued to stare at you and gave you jealous remarks, but you didn't care. You stayed on task and paid attention to the teacher. Then when class was over you and Kurumu met with Tsukune and walked out from class with Kurumu clinging to your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu. How long are you gonna cling to (name) like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. You're being a little clingy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Like you care. All I care about is being with my (name)y.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: You OK (name)? You seem a little tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well you would be too if you had to through what I've been through. Whew. Sometimes I feel like I need to take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Maybe we could all go somewhere to relax for a while. That way we can get rid of some tension<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Here's an idea. We can go to my hometown. It has a great hometown and a skiing resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A skiing resort huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the shadows Kokoa was listening in while in a air duct above them with Ko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Miss Kokoa. I don't know if we should be doing this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Shut it Ko. I'm trying to listen in so I can find out where they're going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Miss Kokoa, why would you want to know where they are going anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa; Why else? I'm gonna follow them so I can get back at that pervert. I'll follow them to the resort and then when he's alone, I'll bash his brains out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: But Miss Kokoa. I thought Moka told you and (name) to get along?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: As if I listen to that fake! The only person I listen to is my real big sister! There are only one thing that matter to me that's and getting back at that pervert!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at your conversation....<br>\r\nKurumu: Really? You think we'll be able to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah. We'll make it a school trip for the newspaper club and have (name) as an honored guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: It sounds like a lot of fun. It's been a while since we've been to Mizore's hometown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! I say let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What do you think (name)? Sound fun?</span></div></div>",

You couldn't even throttle Kurumu if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was shocked and in their heads they were saying daaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn! That was the last straw for you and you just straight up tackled her. Kurumu and Moka tried to break your fight up but to no avail. \"I'll tear your head off when I bit your fragile little neck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just stab you with a twig before you can even try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Kurumu and Moka finally got in between the both of you and stopped it. \"Kokoa what's the matter with you?!

So why should I have to listen to anything you say?\", Kokoa ran off to Moka's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go Moka she needs time.\", Yukari comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) _I told you to not fight with Kokoa anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just let her get away saying shit like that.

I'm sorry Kurumu. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe an extra kiss will raise up your spirits.\", Kurumu planted a light kiss on your lips hoping to get you out of your funck. It worked and you felt much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou packed up your things and rode to Mizore's hometown and went to the resort.</span></div></div>",

You were glad to find it all empty leaving you to it all by yourself. Or so it seemed. You got in the hot water and relaxed just letting all the stress go. But then you felt something move up your leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the water and found Kurumu swiming underwater. She rose up to take a breath and ambushed you with her now topless breasts! \"Mmmmmmmph!\", you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww am I too woman for you? Don't be afraid. \", Kurumu said. She let you go and to your relief nobody was here still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumu why aren't you wearing something over your chest?! Someone might come over and see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not possible. I used my love charm on all the guys and gals here. I asked them to leave it for just us. So nobody is coming in baby. Did I neglect to bring up I'm not wearing anything at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned redder than a radish and just stood still. \"Don't you think were rushing things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not asking you to have sex yet. All you get is to only see and feel. Nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think that's a bit much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just enjoy the moment (name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held Kurumu close and tried not to stare anywhere except her face. She kinda was glad you showed so much restraint because now she knew how much of a gentleman you were. At least around her. \"Your a really nice person (Name). I like you, a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I like you a lot too Kurumu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trembled a bit until she got up closer to your face and started making out with you. This time you were able to return her affection and gently felt her body. She broke it ounce you came up to her chest. But instead of stopping you she let you feel them as much as you wanted. She kissed you again and you returned it passionatly. Soon the both of you got out and dried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Kurumu put her cloths back on and walked with you to the room you were staying in. She clinged on to your arm and blushed about letting you see her like that. You didn't know what to think about it but one thing for sure was she was very direct but you knew you had to really try to improve your behavior since she really wanted it to work between you two.</span></div></div>",

Then for some reason you felt a strong breeze of cold air emanating from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls: Welcome! We hope you enjoy the ski jump!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) and Kurumu: Holy crap that's cold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mizore came up. She was wearing a white kimono with nothing on the bottom except for her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hey (name). Hey Kurumu. Glad you two could join us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the heck?!? Mizore what the heck are you wearing?!? Aren't you super cold?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Don't worry. I'm used to it. I'm a snow woman after all. In fact I was raised right here in this village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait a sec. Does that mean that these girls are snow women too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear a voice that made get shills down your spine. A feeling you felt before when you first met Mizore. You look and there's a young woman standing behind you. She was Tsurara Shiryayuki, Mizore's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsurara: Yes. That's why this village is known as Snow Woman Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Eeep!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey! Don't sneak up on us like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Mother. It's good to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh man. That's Mizore's mom huh? That explains the stalker vibe. Like Mother like daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsurara: I just would like to remind you that you're free to ski wherever you want, but as long as it's on the course OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. You got it Ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Come on (name). Let's go have some fun skiing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with Kurumu dragging your arm, you followed her to the ski jump. Meanwhile a certain orange pig-tailed vampire was walking in the snow heading toward to where you and the rest of the gang were. She was wearing her normal clothes and the only thing keeping her warm was a pair of earmuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hah....hah,,,,,almost there.....just a little more......just you wait you pervert......you're gonna.......get what's coming to you....hah...hah....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Hey Mistress Kokoa! Over here whee! I appear to have stumbled upon a shortcut whee! (points to a path with an arrow that said shortcut)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: All right! Good work Ko buddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they both headed down the path. Back the ski jump you were having a good time with Kurumu and the gang learning how to ski. It took a few minutes, but you eventually got the hang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So how am I doing? Am I doing it right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah. You look like a pro!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Well done (name). You're getting better by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. I think you're ready for the big guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What do you mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: He's taking about the ski jump. (pointsto the ski jump)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait....I don't know about....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Come on (name). It's safe and it's a lot of fun. You should try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But I....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Pretty please (name)? I'd love to see you jump. Plus if you do it I'll give you another kiss and some more time to fondle my fun bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. OK. Aside from the bribery I'll do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were on the very top of the ski jump with Tsurara and Mizore ready to slide down with Kurumu and the others watching from the sidelines, but you were a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Are you nervous (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah...a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: You'll be fine. Just slide down and land with both feet so you can make a soft landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK....here goes.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and you were off. You were zooming like a rocket and then you were launched into the air. Then using your feet like Mizore said you landed safely on the ground. Everyone clapped and cheered, especially Kurumu. You waved and did a v for victory. Then there was a problem. You suddenly realized that you couldn't stop. You zipped straight past Kurumu and the gang and accidentally zipped off the into the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh wow! (name)'s so cool! Look at him showing off how cool he is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Um Kurumu...I don't think he's showing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kokoa was walking up a hill. She kept climbing and climbing until at last she made it to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: At last! I made it! The ski runs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard a voice which turned out to be you. You were still zooming and were headed straight for Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): LOOK OUT!!! I CAN\"T STOP!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. Before Kokoa could react, you crashed straight into her and both of you were sent flying and crashing into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ow. That really hurt. What the heck did I.....DAAHH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up the first thing you saw was a pair of panties with a bat on them and the first thing that Kokoa saw was your crotch. Both of you screamed with embarrassment and got off of each other immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You little shit! What the hell was that for?!? You're sneak attacking me again?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) As if you little twerp! It was an accident OK?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah right you pervert! You did that on purpose because you saw my panties!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): As if! Besides who are you to talk?!? You face was right smack dab on my crotch! So that makes you just as guilty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: WHAT?!? You must really want to die if you think you can talk to me like that you perverted piss-ass bastard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh yeah?!? I could say that the exact same thing to you to you, you sissy red neck vampire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you both were locked in a growling stare down. Then you remembered what Moka and Kurumu said about getting along with Kokoa. You stopped with your stare down with Kokoa and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey! Are you walking away from me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Of course I am. I was told that I'm supposed to get along with you. Alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh no you don't! You're not gonna get away that easily! Come here so I can kick your ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Look if you really want to settle the score that's fine with me. Just not today. If you don't mind I gotta get back to my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hold on! I'm not done with you! Get back here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid no attention. You kept on walking away while Kokoa was throwing a fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: HEY! Get back here!!! Are you underestimating me?!? You better not be because I'm the sister of Moka Akyashiya! So get down on your knees and bow to the great Kokoa!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa's yell echoed throughout the scenery and then there was a deep rumbling sound. You and Kokoa looked and see a giant blanket of snow coming straight toward you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): AVALANCHE!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa ran for your lives, but you two couldn't outrun the snow. The snow swamped you and Kokoa and both you were swept away by the snow. Then....</span></div></div>",

After all he did save you life whee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Shut it Ko! Don't you think I know that? I just don't freakin know why that this is so hard! OK.

So why waste time and just go ahead with being steady? I'll come out and say it, I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too. But maybe were rushing it, at least I feel like we are. Maybe for you it's fine but can we slowmit down. I don't know if we'll feel like this forever. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were too shy to express how you really felt.

You two grew close and then you kissed. French kissed that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Oh (name).....I love you so much,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice snapped her out of her thoughts. It was Ko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Miss Kokoa. Miss Kokoa. What are you doing to your pillow whee?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Huh? DAH! Um Ko! I uh..... I was just.....uh.....just practicing sucking blood! Yeah that's it! Just practicing sucking blood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she bit on the pillow to prove her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Well....whatever you say Miss Kokoa. I'm gonna go to sleep. Night Miss Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Um......yeah, Night Ko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ko flew to the ceiling and hung over the fireplace and went to sleep.

But then you ran into Kurumu,  \"Oh (Name) I found you! Look I'm sorry for the way I acted last night. It wasn't fair of me to put you in that spot.\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh listen Kurumu,  I need to be somewhere right now so can we talk later please.\", you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh sure.\", you thanked her and left to find Kokoa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured she'd be with Moka so you asked Tskune where she was. \"Hey Tskune,  have you seen Moka? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's with Kokoa in the courtyard.\", he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly made your way to it where finally you saw Kokoa.

See you sister. \", Moka said leaving you and Kokoa alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo about the kiss.\", Kokoa started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I have been in love with you since we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd way of expressing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't know what those feelings were and what to do. I thought it was making me weak but it was just simply making me feel nervous because well you stole my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when did you figure it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you saved me and I wasn't able to get mad I felt the feeling I had when I was around you. And when we kept eachother warm it was even stronger. And it made me realize I liked you a lot. So.....I have to ask do you feel the same way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to say. But you tried giving an answer. \"Well, when we weren't at our throats I did think you were cute I'll admit. But I'm with Kurumu at least I think. And I really like her, she's made me feel like a better person and I owe her so much. But if I wasn't with her....I'd consider going out with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what are you gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk to Kurumu and see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait before you go can I know one thing? Did you like it when I kissed you?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All awkwardness aside I thought it wasn't that bad. It was sweet. \", you replied.

You were like a robot who was having a malfunction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Um....(name)? What's wrong? Just come out and say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Duh......I......uh.......I......can't say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Why not? Are you rejecting me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): NO! It's not that! It's just.....I can't give you an answer. Can you give me time? I promise! I'll tell you tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa was silent for a moment, but then she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: OK. I'll wait till tomorrow. Just make sure you tell me tomorrow.<br>\r\n`<br>\r\n(name): OK. Thank you for being so understanding Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You're welcome. I'll.....see you tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. Later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kokoa left you sighed with exasperation and sat on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh man. Why the heck didn't I tell her? Is it because I'm weak? Because a guy like me doesn't deserve to have a girl like Kokoa? I wouldn't put it past her. I am a human and she's one of the most powerful monsters in the academy. Not to mention she's got a big sister who's just as powerful as she is. Will she really accept me even though I'm a human? (sigh).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought and you thought about what you should say to Kokoa. Then you made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. I'll tell her how I feel for now. I'll tell her I'm human another time. Now I better get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you went to sleep. Meanwhile in a classroom filled with nothing but giant cutouts of Moka and the others, The Cute Girl Fan Club Coalition were busy trying to think about your punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Man! We have to get that guy no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosabura: Yeah! I say we give him the beat down he'll never forget! I wanna make him pay for what he did to my beloved Kurumu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Easy Bosabura. Don't you worry. We'll make sure he pays!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski: Sorry to question you boss, but how do we do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Uhhhh.......I don't have a clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them sigh at a loss of what to do, then they heard the door open. There in the doorway were three other boys. The one in the middle was the class president Tadashi Wanibuchi and the other two were his lackys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Mr. Wanibuchi! What brings you here sir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadachi: I couldn't help, but overhear your predicament and me and my boys want to help you get this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadachi: Yes. We have a reliable witness that personally told us that he has broken a few school rules and we have to make sure that he's punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTubaski: Wait, I don't wanna sound rude or nothing, but why should we let you help us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadachi: I understand that it sounds a little hard to believe, but in return we'll let your have all your lovers to yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: What?!? You mean you'll help me get my sweet Moka?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTubaski: And my darling Yukari?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosabura: And Kurumu too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadachi: Yes. So what do you say? (holds out hand)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo took Tadachi's hand and shook it like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Yes! You got yourself a deal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosabura: I'm gonna get with my beloved Kurumu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTubaski: Yukari! You'll soon be mine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Oh Moka!

I'll show you who's the boss around Yokai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: So now that we're working together, do you have a plan to get that guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTacdachi: Yes.

You were at a complete loss and you were nervous like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Man! This sucks! Why can't this be easier when I told Kurumu I loved her? I just wish telling her how I feel wasn't so hard. Not to mention when Tsukune and the others find out I chose Kokoa over Kurumu, they'll never forgive me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tskune, Moka, Mizore and Yukari came up to you. They all looked a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey guys. What's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Listen (name), we need to ask you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Listen, has something happened between you and Kurumu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard Tsukune's question you felt your heart skip a beat. You didn't want to bring anymore drama and you didn't want your friends to get mad at you. So you decided to play dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....uh....nothing. What makes you say that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Don't play dumb. We know something's wrong. Kurumu seemed really depressed yesterday and she keeps telling us that she wants to be alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! She didn't even make some smart aleck comment about my breasts and she does that almost everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: And also I think Kokoa's got something to do with it too. She's been acting really strange too, Ever since she kicked you she's been calling herself a moron and saying how could she have been so stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Not to mention that fan club coalition or whatever said that you did something to Kurumu. Is that true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh come on Tsukune, there's nothing going on. Besides those guys were bunch of crazy fan boys anyway. Everything's fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsukune looked at you with deep and serious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Come on (name). We know something happened, so fess up already. Look. We know that it's none of our business, but were friends aren't we? We can't just stand idly by while our friends are miserable. We want to help. So please, if there's anything wrong, we're all here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silent at Tsukune's words. Then.....</span></div></div>",

It was hard, but you felt better getting it off your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: So that's why Kurumu's been by herself lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: And that's what those fan boys were talking about before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. I'm guessing they must've saw everything that happened when I was with Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I just can't believe that you turned down Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! Any normal guy would fall head over heels for that bimbo. I'm surprised you broke up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Listen guys.....I'm so sorry. I feel really bad about it. I know it looks like I was leading her on and stuff, but I did love her. I just felt like she wasn't the one for me. I feel like crap about this whole thing. Kurumu's been down because of me and I feel like I'm killing her and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish Moka put her hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: It's OK (name). You don't have to feel guilty about anything. I did tell Kurumu that she was rushing things a bit. It's OK to feel a little unsure about love every know and again. Just take your time finding the person you like and I know that you'll find that special someone. And Kurumu's a strong girl. SO don't worry about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: And don't worry about feeling guilty. I would've done the same thing. I'm just surprised that things didn't work out with you and Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. Usually when a guy sees her, he immediately falls head over heels for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't get me wrong. Kurumu was pretty and hot in all, but she wasn't the one. I just hope she isn't mad at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the bell began to ring. You all rushed into class so you wouldn't be late. When you got to the classroom you found that a certain someone was by the front door of your classroom. It was Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kurumu.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I came to check on you. Are you feeling OK? Cause if it's about yesterday I.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No...I'm fine. I just needed some time to get my act together and what I wanna do in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I've decided to move on in life and focus on the present and I've got plenty of time to figure out who is my destined to be so I'm gonna live life to the fullest and I'm gonna take my time. And I hope that you and I will be good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah! Of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Also if you plan to get with Kokoa, just make sure you take care of her alright? I know she can be a pain, but she's can be a good person. Alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You got it. I promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kurumu exchanged smiles and headed of to class. A little later after class you felt a lot better after speaking to Kurumu and you felt more confident so you decided to look for Kokoa and tell her how you felt. You were leaving the classroom so you can go find Kokoa, but then you bump into.....</span></div></div>",

Can I help you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudent: I have a letter for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A letter for me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student handed to you an envelope and then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Huh. I wonder who would send me a letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you read the letter. It said; Dear (name), I'm afraid I cannot take it anymore. I can't stop thinking about you. I love you too much. I want you to be my boy and hopefully have a happy life together. I want to tell you in person so I'll be waiting for you at the lake behind Yokai. I'll see you soon, Your favorite secret admirer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the heck? Another crazy love letter? Who's it from this time? Well, it's definitely not Kurumu. And there's no way it could any one else. Wait.....what if.....what if it's from Kokoa?!? It could be....I mean who else could it be? She could be trying to get me alone with her to try to get me to her my feelings. Hmmm. OK! The only way I know for sure is to go there myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you set off toward the lake. On the way, you ran into Moka and Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hey (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Whatcha doin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. I was just looking for Kokoa. I got another letter and I think it's from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Really? No way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes. It says that she loves me and she wants to tell to meet her by the lake so I could tell her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Wait a sec. Are you sure that it's from Kokoa? That doesn't sound something Kokoa would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well, now that you mention it there was no signature on it, but who else could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Well.....it could be Mizore or Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: No way Tsukune. Those two would never send a letter to (name). It's not Kurumu either so who could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well as much as I like to play guess that girl I gotta go. I'll find out when I get there K? See you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: (name) wait....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Moka could ask why you were looking for Kokoa, but you ran off before she could answer. Meanwhile while you weren't looking Kokoa was walking in the halls looking for you with Ko on her shoulder. She was looking a little fidgety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa thinking: Damn it. I know that I wanted him to tell me his feelings tomorrow, but now I'm not feeling so sure. I'm so nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Ms. Kokoa are you feeling OK whee? You look really nervous whee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I'm fine Ko! I'm just feeling unsure OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: About what Ms. Kokoa. About (name) telling you that he loves you whee?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa blushing: WHAT?!? You shut up! It's nothing like that! I'm just.....I mean...what if he....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Ms. Kokoa. I don't know if this helps whee, but you gotta just go for it whee. I'm sure that (name) likes you whee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa was tell unsure and nervous, but now she felt a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Thanks Ko. I feel a little less nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka and Tsukune came up to Kokoa. When they saw her, they were surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Kokoa? What are you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Aren't you at the lake? I thought you'd be at the lake already since you sent that letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What are you talking about? I just left class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: You what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Kokoa. Are you sure that you didn't send (name) that letter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. Why would I send (name) a letter when he was just gonna talk to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune and Moka looked at each other with worry and shock and Kokoa getting worried too. Meanwhile back with you, you managed to get to the lake without any problems. You looked all around, but you didn't see anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I wonder where Kokoa is. It shouldn't be taking her this long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard footsteps coming toward you. You checked yourself and made sure you looked good and were ready to tell Kokoa how you felt.

And what I want is to punish you for breaking school rules. And I hate rule breakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Rule breaker?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacky 1: That's right. Word on the street is you beat up another student on school grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacky 2: Yeah. You've gone and made our president angry because of that and now you're gonna get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That has nothing to do with you so butt out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Oh but it does.

Kozo turned into an umbrella monster, Bosabura a faceless blob monster, Kubaski's neck stretched like a snake's, and Tadachi and his men transformed into lizardmen. You were now completely surrounded by six monsters. You took a fighting stance and stood in the middle ready to fight, but you were slightly trembling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh damn it! Stop it! This isn't the time to be scared!

You've got guts I'll give you that, but that's gonna change pretty quickly. Get em boys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Destroy him! In the name of our loves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone attacked you at once, but you were ready for them. Kozo spun his umbrella head and weird globs of water came straight at you. You dodged them and gave him a swift kick knocking him flat on his back. Kubaski extended his neck and attempted to trap you, but you managed to slip out of his grip and gave him a swift punch in gut knocking the wind out of him. Then you attacked Bosabura by punching him, but the attack did nothing except make your hand slimy and stuck. You punched him again with your other hand, but that only ended up getting your other hand stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ewww! What is this gunk!?!?

Then one of Tadashi's lackys came at you from behind attempted to slash you with his claws. You dodged and grabbed him by the hand and performed a judo throw slamming him into the ground. Then Tadashi's other lacky attempted to slash you, but you countered by using a leg sweep making him go flying. Tadashi swept in while you were defenseless and slashed you in the face. The attack scraped your cheek, but there wasn't much damage. You ducked out of the way and then you kicked Tadashi on the back sending him flat on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Whoa. He's pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Damn it! I must admit, you're pretty skilled kid. But now you're starting to get on my nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this fighting was making you a little breathless. You may have been able to hold them off, but they were pure monsters and you were nothing more, but a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Damn it all! At this rate, I won't last much longer! I gotta think of something quick, otherwise I'm gonna die here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was racing trying to figure out what to do. Just then....</span></div></div>",

Then you saw the only person capable of this and she was racing straight toward you with her magic wand waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hey! You leave (name) alone right now you big bullies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yukari?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski: It's my dear sweet Yukari! Only could she could do that washtub trick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Grrr. It's that little brat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yukari, what the heck are you doing here?!? It's dangerous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Moka and Tsukune told me to find you. They told me about you going to see Kokoa and they thought it was a trap, so they had us go looking for you all over the campus. We were afraid that you might be in trouble! Don't worry! I'm here to help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No Yukari! Get back! It's too dangerous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Don't worry! I'll be OK! I'm not scared of these wimps of monsters! Magic wand, magic wand, magic.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari began chanting a spell, but before she could finish Tadashi suddenly appeared and swatted Yukari's wand away. Without that wand she couldn't use her magic. She was nothing more, but a human being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Nice try brat, but we're not falling for that again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Nice work Tadashi! Now Kubaski!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kubaski wrapped his long neck around Yukari's body and she was caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No! Yukari!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski: Oh Yukari my love! I've always dreamed of doing this! Wrapping myself around a smoking hot body like yours is a dream come true! You're like a ripe fruit ready to blossom and I want a taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Let go of me you creepo! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hang on Yukari! I'm coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to go save Yukari, but Kozo, Bosabura, Tadashi and his lackys blocked your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Not so fast kid! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: We're not done with you yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Get out of my way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were gonna fight your way to get to Yukari, but then you saw Kubaski squeeze Yukari hard making her scream. This made you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski: Careful. If you come any closer, I might just squeeze my darling Yukari so hard, she might suffocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why you......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Don't even think about moving! Or else this little girl's gonna pay for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you hated it, you had no choice. You couldn't let Yukari get hurt. You didn't move a single muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacky 1: Good boy. Now stay still OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi's first lacky rushed toward and punched you in the stomach knocking the wind out of you. You reeled back for a couple steps from the impact. Then Kozo spun his umbrella sending a large gust of wind coming your way. The wind sent you flying and tumbling to the ground. As you struggled to get up Tadashi's second lacky slashed on the back making you scream in agony. Tadashi slashed you in the chest ripping your shirt and then hit you with a mighty swipe of his tail sending you sprawling face first to the ground. You struggled to get up, but the guys weren't gonna let you do that. To top it off Bosabura came flying from the sky and body slammed you on your back. The impact made you scream even louder as Bosabura's weight made your bones creak. Yukari couldn't stand to watch you getting beaten up like this. She tried to break free, but Kubaski had a firm hold on her. Bosabura got of you, Tadashi stepped on your head grinding your face in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Stop it! Leave him alone! He can't even defend himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski: Hush now my darling. That evil bastard will soon be no more. With him out of the way all three of us in the fan club coalition will be free to be with our loves forever and ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Heh. How pathetic. He may have been a tough guy, but when push comes to shove he's still a weakling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: He's not even in his monster form yet. I'm surprised he hasn't shown it off yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Come on (name)! Please get up. Transform to your monster form and do something@<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Believe me Yukari. I want to. But I can't. I'm nothing more, but a human. I can't even move my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacky 1: Heh. Looks like it's over. Hey boss. What do you say we finish it by eating him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacky 2: It has been a while since we had a decent meal. Besides no one's gonna know. We're far enough away from the school so no one can see us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Yeah. That sounds like a good idea. All that fighting did make me work up an appetite. Let's do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: No! Stop it! Leave him alone! Please! Leave him! Alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski: It's OK Yukari. That bad man is almost gone now. Soon you'll be safe. Man! I'm the happiest guy in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: The only reason your are is because you're with Yukari. I'd much rather be with Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosabura: And for me, I'd rather be with Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski: Oh come on, you guys. Yukari is just as good as Moka and Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: And how is that?<br>\r\nKubaski: For one thing there's this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski then grabbed Yukari's skirt and exposed her panties. Yukari screamed with embarrassment as Kozo and Bosabura looked on drooling and with pervy looks in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Wow! That's some sexy underwear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosabura: Yeah! I heard that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: HEY! STOP LOOKING YOU PERVERTS!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard Yukari screaming you looked up and you saw what was going on. You saw the Tadashi and his men were advancing toward you and in the background you saw what Kubaski was doing to Yukari. When you saw what was going on you tried to get up, but the injures you has suffered prevented you. You couldn't do anything, but watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn! I can't move my body! And Yukari's in trouble! Am I just gonna sit here and die while she gets treated like this?!? Move! MOVE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you began to get a flash back of your past. You were seeing yourself back at your own school when you saw that kid being picked on by the bullies. You remembered how mad it made you. You couldn't stand seeing that kid being picked on.Yukari reminded you of that kid and you had to do something. Then you body began to feel hot and you felt adrenaline pumping through your veins. Meanwhile Tadashi and his goons were right on top of you and were ready to feast on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: So kid, got any last words?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing. Tadashi opened his mouth and prepared to the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: (name).....NOOOO!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

Then you somehow jumped up and land right behind Tadashi and his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: What the....!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacky1: He's still alive huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosabura: No blobbing way! I thought my weight would totally crush this guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: He shouldn't be able to move after all those injures!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! Get em (name)! Kick all of their butts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing. You were silent for a moment, but when you looked up you looked completely different. Your face was filled with rage and you were emitting a terrifying aura. When Tadashi, his lackys, and the fan club saw this, they were a little spooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosabura: Wh-wh-what's going on? He's completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Y-y-yeah! He's got a scary aura coming out of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Heh. Whatever. He's a weakling. He doesn't stand a chance against us. Get him boys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacky1: Yeah! DInner is now served!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacky2: Get ready to die punk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth lackys charged at you and slashed at you with their claws, but all they slashed was the dirt from where you were standing. Then you appeared behind them and grabbed their heads and bashed them together hard. The impact made the lackys recoil in pain. You appeared in front of lacky1 and gave him a powerful uppercut on the chin then punched him several other times in the face making his face lumpy and bloody and then you finished him off by giving him and powerful punch in the stomach sending him sprawling to the ground. Lacky2 attempted to attack you from behind, but you grabbed him by the arm and bent it backwards making it emit a shrieking crack. Lacky2 howled in pain you bent his arm in the wrong directions. Then you gave him a wicked punch in the snout sending him flying to a tree. Tadashi, The Fan Club Coalition, and even Yukari could not believe what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: What the hell happened? How did he suddenly get so powerful?!? A moment ago he was nothing more, but a weakling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked Tadashi and the fan club coalition. Your eyes were filled with rage and blood lust. Seeing this Tadashi as well as the Fan Club Coalition began trembling just from seeing your stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKozo: Th-th-this guys crazy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosabura: I-i-is this his true monster form?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski: I-i-i-i don't know, but I'm getting out of here! I wanna stay alive today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKubaski then let Yukari go and he along with the rest of The Fan Coalition ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Hey! Come back here you cowards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were already out of sight. Tadashi was now all alone. You walked toward him completely calm, but filled with rage and killing intent. Tadashi slowly backed up trying to think of a way out of this situation. Then he saw Yukari. She was trying to fix her dress after Kubaski pulled it up. Then he had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi thinking: I got it.I'll just capture that brat and I'll blackmail this kid to stop. Then I'll get him when his guard his down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi raced toward Yukari ready to execute the plan, but sadly that plan would fail. For you appeared between him and Yukari and then gave him a punch in the gut sending him flying to the ground. Tadashi coughed trying to catch his breath. As he tried to get up he looked up to find that you were standing over him. He then began to try to talk his way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi: Whoa! Hey man! Take it easy! I-i-i was just trying to teach you discipline and I didn't mean to hurt you. Hey! I'll tell you what. You let me go, I'll forget this whole thing happened! And I'll won't mess with you again and I'll try to be nicer. Wh-what do you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silent. Then you said only one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you grabbed Tadashi's tail and swung him around and slammed him to the ground. Then you got on top of him and began punching him hard in the face until blood came spewing out from his head. Yukari watched this scene going on before her and she was getting scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: How cruel! I've never seen (name) act this way! If he keeps this up, he's gonna kill him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTadashi's face was now a bloody pulp. His teeth were broken and both of his eyes were black. His face was filled with lumps and his nose was broken. You were ready to finish him off. You put both of your hands into a smashing fist and raised up for a final smash, but then you heard a voice that stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: (NAME) STOP!!!!! I know he's a bad guy, but that's enough! You don't have to take it this far! Please! This isn't like you at all! Please don't do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Yukari with placid eyes, but you ignored her. Just then you were about to deliver the finishing blow......</span></div></div>",

You were struggling to break free from Moka's grip. Your skin was slightly covered in blood and your eyes were filled with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yukari, what the heck happened here?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I found (name) fighting these goons here and I tried to help, but I ended up getting caught.

Stop this right now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still out of it so you weren't responding to her. You struggled to break free, but luckily Moka was a lot stronger than you because you were a human. Kokoa looked at you in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What's with (name)? I've never seen him like this before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I don't know, but we have to stop him. I'll freeze him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: No don't! You do that and I'll beat you up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah Mizore! It's not his fault! He was just trying to protect me! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: We have to stop him somehow! Moka can't hold him off forever, and if he does break free, he'll probably fight Moka next and Moka will mop the floor with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa looked at you and saw you in your enraged state. She was trying to figure out what should could do to help you bring you to your senses. Not to mention she had to do it before Moka and if you started fighting  with Moka, she knew that Moka would win. Then you managed to break free from Moka's hold and landed on your feet. You and Moka were having a stare down and were ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Moka hold on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Tsukune I probably don't have a choice!

Let me try and stop (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: And why should I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Because maybe I can reach him. Please just give me a chance.

She was only a few feet away and it seemed that she was gonna do something, but then it happened. You were covered in blood so it was only natural, but Kokoa caught a full whiff full of blood. Because of that she could help, but get intoxicated by the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Ohhhh. That smells so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you struck. You flung a punch toward Kokoa, but she dodged it.

What the hell are you doing?!? Get off me would you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled Kokoa off of you and you held your neck trying stop the bleeding.

You don't remember anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to remember what you did and what transpired, but you couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Nope. Nothing.

What do you mean? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt your vision get blurry and you were staggering. You had lost too much blood when you were fighting.

On the way, they ran into Mizore, Kurumu, and Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hey Tsukune. Hey Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Oh. Hey guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Where are you headed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: We were going to pay (name) a visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: He's still hurt huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. He was in pretty rough shape. Even though we took him to the infirmary, the nurse said that he should rest for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: So we thought that we could pay him a visit to cheer him up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey. Mind if I come with you? I want to see if he's OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Sure. Of course you can. You coming too, Yukari?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka saw Yukari. She had a troubled expression on her face. Everyone else noticed this too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yukari? Is something wrong? You look sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. That's not like you at all. What's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Well, it's just that.....I don't think I should go see (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Why not? If you're worried about making me jealous, don't worry about it. The only person you have to worry about is Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I don't mean that! I mean.... I don't think I should see him because it's my fault that he's hurt in the first place. If I hadn't gotten involved in the fight I never would have gotten captured and he would never had.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari began to tear up and she was about to cry, but Moka gently gave Yukari a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yukari. It's OK. It's not your fault. (name) won't blame you for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: But.....(sniff)....but I......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Besides you saved his life. If you hadn't stepped in (name) would be in worse shape than he is right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah. And you were pretty brave back there going against those guys all by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Really? You think so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. So don't worry about it. I'm sure (name) doesn't blame you for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah. Thanks guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Speaking of those guys what happened to Tadashi and the others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I've heard they were taken to the infirmary and were punished for causing a disturbance. I've heard the Fan Club Coalition was involved, but I haven't heard what was going to happen to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What I find surprising was that (name) was able to take them on all by himself. He must be one powerful monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. He didn't even need to use his monster form to beat them. Unless he's a vampire like Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I don't know about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What do you mean Yukari?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had a serious expression on her face. Then she spoke in a quiet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: It's funny how I never realized it before, but (name) never once showed his monster form even once. In fact, he should have transformed when he was in danger and when I was being eye raped by those goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Maybe....he's committed to following the school rules?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Maybe....maybe not. Maybe it's something else. Maybe he didn't transform......because he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Wait a minute. Yukari....are you saying that.....(name).......could possibly be......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yes. It's possible. but I'm starting to think that (name).....is a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasped at this sudden revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yukari! That's crazy! There's no way a human could get in to Yokai!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Oh yeah? (points to Tsukune) Need I remind you that this human got into Yokai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh. Well.....there's no way a human could get into Yokai.....again! Besides we don't know that for sure! He probably has his own reasons, Calling him a human is just crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Crazy as it is Kurumu, it does make some kind of sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: And that would explain why Kokoa acted weird when she smelled (name)'s blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Well...there's only one way we can find out for sure. Ask (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Wait! We can't just ask him right out of the blue! He'll flip out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Don't worry. I'll talk to him. Just let me talk to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Are you sure Tsukune?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: I'm sure. Now let's go see him. Be sure not to say anything about what we talked about OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, but Tsukune: Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they all set of to your room. Unbeknownst to them, someone was watching in the shadows. Whoever was watching them, they had heard every detail from the conversation. The firgure watched Tsukune and the girls walk to your room and then the figure disappeared. Meanwhile you were resting in your room on the bed. Kokoa had just left to get back into class so you were by yourself. As you were lying down on the bed, you were thinking about Kokoa and your feeling for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. Why the heck is it so hard to tell her how I feel? Is it because I'm scared to tell her because I'm a human? Damn it! Why am I so scared to tell her?!? I mean...what if she doesn't like me because I'm a human? But then again, I do remember what she told me just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback) -credit goes to kevkane101<br>\r\nKokoa: (Name) whatever you do, promise me that no matter what, never change a thing about yourself for me. Because it was all those things that made me fall for you in the first place once I got to know you.<br>\r\n(flashback ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Maybe...she loves me for who I am. Yeah! It doesn't matter if I'm a human. I'm gonna tell her how I feel! But.....how should I do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you began to come up with crazy ideas as to how you were going to tell Kokoa how you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name):  Mademoiselle Kokoa. Will you do me the honor for accepting my feelings and be mon amour? Nah. Too frenchy. Kokoa, Be my love please? (sigh) Too whiny. Be my love for else?!?  No, too demanding. Man, this is hard! Oh I know! Kokoa, I.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish and when you turned around.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then one by one everyone began to laugh except you. You blushed beet red for being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hahaha. (name) what the heck are you doing? You look so silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You don't need to laugh you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: We're sorry, but we're glad that you're feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: So how are you feeling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well, I feel a lot better. My scars still hurt a little, but I'll be OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIzore: So were you doing? Before we rudely interrupted you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: From the looks of things, it looked like you were practicing saying I love you to Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Name) blushing: Dah! Well.....I......I....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Heh. Looks like you hit the nail on the head Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Hold on. You haven't told Kokoa your feelings yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Name): I.....I.....(sigh) Yes. I haven't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune and the gang were surprised at your sudden confession. Especially since you and Kokoa had been together for a while and it was obvious that you two loved each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I don't get it (name)! If you like her so much, why haven't you told her that you love her yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kurumu, it's that simple. You see I......well....let's just say that I'm scared OK? I'm scared that she won't accept me for who I am. Especially since.....you know, when I went berserk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: That wasn't your fault. Besides Kokoa doesn't care. She likes you for who you are. I just know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah. In fact, you changed Kokoa's life. Ever since she met you, she's grown nicer and for the first time ever she cares about another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah. Even though you were dating me at some point, I could see that you and Kokoa had a real connection. It was obvious that you and Kokoa were meant to be together and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Guys.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! So be a man and just go for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But Yukari.....I don't even know where to begin. How do I being it up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Well, what I would do when I try to tell someone how I feel. I would stalk them everyday and then I freeze them from head to toe and then I have my way with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Mizore and sweatdropped at her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Um.....Mizore. I'm pretty sure that's what you would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Besides if I did that Kokoa, I would just make her pissed off at me. Any other ideas?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Well....how about you take Kokoa out on a date or something? That way you two could spend some time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: That's a great idea Tsukune!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Not a bad idea, but where should I take her? I don't even know the first thing when it comes to dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Take a look at this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari reached in her cape and pulled out a book. The cover said; \"Dating for Dummies. How to set up a good date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A book about dating? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah. This book gives you tips like where a good meeting spot is, where to go to have fun and lots of other things too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hm. Interesting. OK then. I'll give this book a try. Hopefully it'll give me some pointers. Thanks guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Don't mention it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: And if you ever need some advice on Kokoa, don't be afraid to ask me or any of us OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Well guys I guess we better go. It's getting a little late I could use a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah me too. See you (name). Good luck with Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. Break a leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um. Yeah. Thanks again guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Moka and the girls left leaving you and Tsukune alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Tsukune? What's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name). I need to talk to you about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden Tsukune was now serious with a hint of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK....what is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Listen. You know that this is a school for monsters and by monsters right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well...yeah. Of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: And you also know that if a human is found in Yokai, they'll be immediately put to death right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes. So?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Listen. I heard from Yukari that during your fight with Tadashi, you didn't change to your monster form even once. Not even when Yukari was in danger. Why didn't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at Tsukune's question. You quickly came up with a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um.....well.....I.....didn't want to break the rules. Yeah. I wanted to obey the rules that's all. Hehehe. Besides I couldn't transform because I was not feeling well. Hehehe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune looked at you with a \"you really expect me to believe that\" face making you sweat a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (Name). Listen. I just want you to be honest with me. I can tell you're lying. Any monster would transform to save a friend, even if it means breaking the rules. I'm starting to get that you didn't transform because you wanted to follow the rules, but it was because you couldn't. Which brings me to my question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heart was now beating like a jack hammer and your body broke into a sweat. Then Tsukune asked you the question that you were dreading to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name). Are you a human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence. Then you.......</span></div></div>",

I understand that you're a monster with pride and stuff, but......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune stared at you, then he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hahaha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! What's so funny?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Sorry, but what you said was totally stupid. I don't even have the power to kill anyone. After all I'm just like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Just like me? Wait a sec. Tsukune are you meaning to tell me that......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: That's right. I'm a human too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Huh?!? Are you playing me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Nope. I'm a definitely a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsukune began telling you how he came to Yokai Academy and how he met Moka and the others and you told him how you got to Yokai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So your dad found a packet from Yokai and now you're enrolled here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yup. Of course, I wish he wouldn't have taken that packet in the first place, but if he hadn't, I never would've enrolled here and I ever would have met Moka and the others. Anyway, you were sent to this school because of you getting into a fight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. I don't talk about it much. It happened when I was in my first year of high school. Some bullies were picking on a kid and.....I don't know I just lost it. One minute I was running toward them, the next minute I was standing over them covered in blood. Ever since then everyone's been keeping their distance from me and calling me \"The Bloody Warrior.\" My parents decided to transfer me here so I could make a fresh start and hopefully make some friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Looks like you did just that and even got yourself a small crush at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That is assuming that she doesn't hate me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Why would she hate you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hello? I'm a human! She's a S class vampire! That isn't exactly a normal relationship!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Well...Kokoa is a bit of a prideful vampire. Not to mention she kinda thinks that vampires like her are high above everyone else and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Tsukune. You're not helping things here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Sorry. Well I guess that explains why you haven't told Kokoa how you felt yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. I'm really scared that when she finds out I'm a human, she's gonna totally hate me. Or even worse, kill me. -sigh- What'll I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune then placed an arm on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Don't worry (name). I'm sure that won't happen. Trust me. Love works in strange and mysterious ways. Take it from me. I felt the same way when I first met Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. When I first met her, I made friends with her immediately. I even liked her, but when she told me that she didn't like humans very much, I had some second thoughts. Then I learned all Moka wanted was a friend human or monster and I became that friend. Ever since then, me and Moka have been friends ever since. So don't worry about it. I'm sure Kokoa will accept you for who you are. She may be a little stubborn, but once you get to know her, she's a kind person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thank you Tsukune. That means a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: And don't worry. I won't tell anyone that you're a human. That last thing we need is the whole school going crazy for another human getting into the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks Tsukune. You're a great friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Anytime. Now I gotta go. I'll see you tomorrow in class OK? Good luck with Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks. I'll need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Tsukune left leaving you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. Tsukune's one heck of a guy. I'm glad I got him as a friend. He's right. I should just go for it and ask Kokoa out on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your clock and you realized it was getting late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): -yawn- I better get some sleep. I got a big day tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snuggled in your bed and you went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You understood that you loved Kokoa no matter what and you were still thinking about telling Kokoa that you were a human, but you decided to wait until that day comes. The problem was that you wanted to take Kokoa out on a date, but you didn't know where. The guidebook that Yukari gave you had a lot of tips, but none of them had much interest to you. You walked in thee halls in thought thinking of where to take Kokoa. Then you ran into Mizore and Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey there (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh. Good morning (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. Hey Moka. Hey Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What's up? You look deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh nothing. I was just thinking of a good place to go for me and Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Didn't Yukari give you that book to help you get some ideas?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Not really. It just gave me tips about where are good romantic spots for you and your date. I'm not really good at being romantic. Hey Moka, Kokoa's your sister. You have any ideas?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Well.....let's see.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka thought and she thought until she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Here's an idea. Why don't you take her to a movie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A movie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hey. That's a good idea. It is a Friday today. You can go to a movie with her this weeked. Oh! And make it a scary movie. That way when she gets scared, you'll be there to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on Mizore. That's the oldest gag in the book, but I will agree that taking her to a movie sounds like a good idea. It's simple and original. Yeah. I'll ask her when class is over. Thanks you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell began to ring signaling you all to head for class. You all rushed to the classroom not wanting to be late. Meanwhile unbeknownst to you, the shadowy figure who was watching you before was watching again from the shadows. Then a cell phone rung in the figure's pocket. The figure pulled it out of her pocket and spoke to the person on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigure: Sir. Yes? Yes. He hasn't told her yet. Yes. I understand. I'll keep a close eye on him. Yes. Understood. I'll keep you posted. Goodbye sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure hung up and disappeared into the darkness. Later after class, you decided to go find Kokoa and finally ask her out. Although you were really nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. Here goes. I\"m gonna go up to Kokoa and ask her out. Simple as that. Damn it. Why am I getting so nervous? OK. Calm down.

Ohhh we should see a horror one. I love the blood effects.\", she said with much enthusiasm. To your surprise she wanted to go see a horror movie when you assumed otherwise.

Then Kokoa kissed you on the lips for a solid thirty seconds and said, \"Looking forward to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze from the kiss and felt like in a perpetual state of bliss.

Not only that, but it was the first time in a month that you were going to the human world. You were currently in the shower shampooing your head thinking about your big day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: OK. I gotta be calm. This is my first date and it'll be the first time in a while that I've been to the human world. I gotta remember to keep it discreet. Man I'm nervous. I just need to be calm about this. Yeah. I can do this! Go for it (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you hopped out of the shower and dressed casually. Then you headed for the bus stop and waited for Kokoa. As you waited for Kokoa you wondered what she would be wearing and how you and which movie you and her were gonna see. Then you heard a rustling sound in the bushes. You looked to find out what it was, but you didn't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That was weird. I thought I saw someone. Oh well. I'm sure it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly it wasn't because in the bushes, some certain characters were watching in the bushes.

I know that you're worried about Kokoa, but we shouldn't be spying on them. I feel like Mizore when she's stalking some cute boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hey!

You were used to being surrounded by boys. As you were getting dressed, Tsukune came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hey (name). How's it going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Tsukune. Geez. The locker room sure is noisy today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Who could blame them? All the boys are playing a basketball game today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Basketball? I don't see what the big deal is about that. I play basketball all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Tsukune heard a voice that made you both jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice): You just don't get it do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both turn around and see a tall young man who was tall and had his hair held back with a red headband. He was Ginei Morioka a werewolf in Yokai. When Tsukune saw him, he scowled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: It's not just about a simple game of basketball. It's about showing off for the hotties! You gotta use this opportunity to make yourself look cool in front of the ladies! Especially since you got a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Oh no. Not you again Ginei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A friend of yours Tsukune?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Well....sort of. (name), this is Ginei Morioka. The pervert of this school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: Now Tsukune, I wouldn't say perverted....I'd say I'm a guy who loves the female race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he smiled his teeth shone like a diamond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well....it's nice to meet you Ginei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: Likewise. Anyway (name). Word on the street is that you're dating Moka's little sister Kokoa am I right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ginei asked you about Kokoa, you couldn't help but blush beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): H-h-how did you know about that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: Trust me. Word on the street travels fast. I'm a newshound. I like to sniff around and look for a good scoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: A stalker and a perv is more like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: I gotta say man, you got yourself a cute looking chick there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um.....thanks? I think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ginei talked in a low voice so you and Tsukune could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: So (name)......have you done it with Kokoa yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune blushed beet red at this sudden question. You on the other hand were puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Ginei!!! What the hell are you asking?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: I'm just asking (name) if he's done it. I'm just curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well......if you mean kissing then yeah. I've kissed her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: That's good, but not what I meant. I mean have you <b>done</b> her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Gieni! Shut up! That's (name)'s business!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: Oh come on Tsukune. If it's too much for your virgin ears then don't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Say what?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the word virgin made you even more puzzled. Whatever Ginei was talking about, you had no idea what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Virgin? What's a virgin? And what do you mean by doing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing you, Tsukune and Ginei stared at you like you said something crazy. Then Ginei laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: Hahaha! You're such a kidder (name). Hahaha. Very funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Look Ginei. We gotta get ready for class, don't you have to go spy on some girls in the locker room or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinei: Oh crap! You're right! I'm wasting precious time! I gotta go get some pics! Thanks Tsukune! And I'll see you later (name) you lady killer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Ginei dashed away. Leaving you confused and Tsukune irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Man. That Ginei is nothing, but trouble. Sorry about that (name). He was saying some weird stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I just wish I knew what he was talking about Tsukune. I had no idea what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune stared at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name) are you serious? If you're playing a joke it's not funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Tsukune. I've never lied to you man. I'm serious. I don't even know what those words mean. Virgin? Done it? What does it all mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune was silent then he looked around to see if anyone was listening, then he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name)? Do you know how a baby is made right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well I know that a man and a woman sleep together in a bed......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: And then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hmm.......they have a teddy bear's picnic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your answer made Tsukune face fault to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Are you kidding me (name)?!? Are you meaning to tell me that you have no idea what that is?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What is what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: You know! Sex!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Uhhh......sex? What is that? I've never heard of that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune couldn't believe what he was hearing. He was talking to someone who didn't know a single thing about the birds and the bees. Then you both heard the teacher call in locker saying that class was about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on Tsukune! You can tell me what this sex stuff is later! We're gonna be late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hey! (name)! Wait a sec!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tsukune could ask anything more, you dashed out of the locker room with Tsukune close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile.....</span></div></div>",

Then something interrupted Kokoa from her thoughts. A rosy smell filled her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What.....is that smell? It smells so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed the smell and it led straight to Kurumu. She was standing next to Yukari rubbing a lotion on her skin. Curious as to what Kurumu was rubbing on herself, Kokoa went over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hi Kurumu. Hi Yukari. What is that lotion you're rubbing on Kurumu? It smells so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh hey Kokoa. It's just some lotion that makes your skin super smooth. Not to mention it smells like roses. I gotta look good for this class today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Why are you going out of your way to look good for a P.E. class?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Well, it's because that the boys are gonna be playing basketball today and she's hoping that she'll get asked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What's the big deal? It's just some the boys playing basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No big deal!?!? Kokoa listen, there comes a time in a girls life when she has to look good for the boys so she can get a boyfriend. After all as soon as you get a boyfriend you get to do a lot of stuff with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What kind of stuff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Like you don't know. You're going out with (name) so you should know. When you have a boyfriend you get to go on dates with him, be lovey dovey with him, and lots of other things with him too, but the best part of that is when you two are alone in a bed. That's when you do it. Ya-hoo-hoo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu! Don't go giving Kokoa weird ideas! You sound like a pervert!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What's the big deal Yukari? She's going out with (name) after all. Besides you were probably gonna ask her too right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blushing: No I was not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Huh? Done it? What do you mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh come on Kokoa. As if you didn't already know. You probably have had your cherry popped already when you and (name).....mmppphhh!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kurumu could finish her sentence, Yukari quickly covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu! I told you not to talk about stuff like that in front of Kokoa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Talk about what Yukari? And what did Kurumu mean about my cherry being popped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Kokoa's question, Yukari and Kurumu stared at her. Then Yukari spoke in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kokoa. You do know about the birds and the bees right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Birds and bees? What do animals have to do with boys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Kokoa? You do know how a baby is made right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I know that a man and a woman sleep in a bed together and.........they........go to the baby store and get one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari face faulted at Kokoa's answer. Kurumu on the other hand stared and then she squealed and gave Kokoa a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Ohhhh!! Kokoa you're so cute!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey! What are you hugging me for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Do you really not know about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: That? What are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari blushed and then she whispered in Kokoa's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: You know. Sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Sex? What the hell is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What?!? Didn't your parents teach you anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Well, I asked my mother one time about how babies are made, but she told me I'll find out when I'm older or something that. Other than that no I don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's jaw dropped and Kurumu hugged her even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Awwww!! You're so cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey! Kurumu! Stop hugging me already! Why the heck are you hugging me anyway?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Because you're a virgin you cute little vampire you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Cut it out! And what the name of all things hell is a virgin?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: AWWWW!!!! You don't even know what a virgin is? That makes you even cuter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kurumu was hugging and doting Kokoa, Yukari pondered about what Kokoa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: I can't believe this! Not only is Kokoa a virgin, but she has no idea what sex is. I never met someone like this before! Is she messing with us? Or does she really not know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell rung signaling that class was about to begin. All the girls left the locker room. Yukari had just left the locker room when Kurumu pulled her aside to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu? What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Listen. Kokoa has no idea about \"doing it\" right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: So? I say it's time that she learned. After all, I'm a woman of love and I can't stand by while a virgin is inexperienced. Don't cha think It's time we make Kokoa into a woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Wait a sec Kurumu! We should stay out of this! It's (name)'s and Kokoa's business! Besides Moka will probably blow a gasket if she finds out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Don't worry. She's harmless as a kitten when she's Outer Moka and the only way she could do anything us is that if Tsukune removed her rosary. Besides I wasn't gonna tell Moka anyway. I was gonna tell (name) that juicy piece of gossip, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Why would you do that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Because Kokoa's an inexperienced girl in need to be taught about love! And as long as there someone in need to be educated in love, Kurumu the succubus of love will be there to help them!. That being said it's time for Kurumu the succubus of love to complete her mission with you as my side kick Yukari! The mission is called Operation Cherry Popper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Yukari could protest any more, a teacher called out to start the class and everyone headed for the gym.

The first three quarters passed by in a flash and it was know the fourth quarter. It was the last minute of the game and the score was your team 40 and the opposing team 38 . Every time a team scored the girls cheered, especially Kokoa when your team scored. You team was on defense and were doing everything to keep the other team from scoring. Saizo had possession of the ball and was about to make the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: It's my time to shine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you jumped out of nowhere and stole the ball from Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Not today it's not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dribbled the ball down to the center and thought it was gonna be easy, but you were surrounded by two other players. Then you saw Tsukune ahead of you at the three point line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name)! Over here! Pass it to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Coming at you Tsukune!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dribble passed to Tsukune and Tsukune headed to the other hoop. The two players tried to catch up and stop Tsukune, but they made the mistake by taking their eyes off of you. You ran toward the hoop and called to Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Tsukune! I'm open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune threw the ball to you and then you jumped up with all your strength and slam dunked the ball in the hoop tying the score. The girls went wild with cheers. Then it was Saizo's team's ball again. Thirty seconds was on the clock and Saizo's team now had possession. One teammate dribbled the ball slowly trying to run out the clock, but one of your teammates quickly ran up to him and tried to steal it. But then the opposing teammate passed it to another and then he passed it to Saizo who was at the three point line. Saizo looked at the hoop and aimed for a long range shot, but one of your teammates quickly covered him and stole the ball. The clock was at 10 seconds and counting. Your teammate passed to Tsukune and Tsukune dribbled toward the hoop was about to make the shot, but one of Saizo's teammates blocked him. You quickly got open and Tsukune passed it to you. Just when the buzzer it was about to hit zero, you shot the ball and prayed it would make the hoop. Everyone looked at the ball and held their breath. At first it looked like it was gonna miss, but then it bounced of the hoop and went in. The buzzer sounded and the game was over. Your team 42, Saizo's team 40. The girls cheered and applauded, especially from Kokoa and her group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh wow! (name)'s team won!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Who would have thought that he'd be good at sports?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah. Not only that, but he's also out there in the good looks department too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. I wish he could be my boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey! He's mine you know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa hearing Mizore's comment made her a little jealous. Seeing Kokoa jealous made Mizore and the other girls giggle a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Take it easy Kokoa. Looking at him is not a crime is it? I'm not gonna take him from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You better not! (name)'s mine you hear?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed which made Kokoa's face go beet red for what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey! What's so funny?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hahaha. Nothing. It's just cute how you say that (name)'s yours. You really like him huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Y-yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: But seriously, do you know how lucky you are?

Then again I have Tsukune and he's just as cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa watched you being congratulated by your teammates for winning the game.

Hey Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa ran up to you and gave you a hug and a kiss on your cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)! You were great today! You looked so cool beating those guys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) blushing: Aww shucks. Tweren't nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune let out a sigh of relief. He was glad that you had forgotten about what you were trying to ask him. Now he was off the hook. For the moment at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey (name). I've got a little secret to tell you. It's about....Gah!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kurumu could say anything, Yukari gave her a strong pinch in the butt shutting her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What is it Kurumu? Cat got your tongue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Nope. Nothing. Don't mind me. Hahahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered as to what Kurumu was trying to tell you, but then Kokoa grabbed your arm and whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey (name). Can I talk to you about something? Alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh sure Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen guys. Me and Kokoa are gonna go somewhere. We'll see you later K?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you and Kokoa left. Then Kurumu threw a fit at Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey! That hurt you brat! What was that for?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: You need to keep your mouth shut about that. Especially in front of (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What are you guys talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. Let us in on the juicy gossip too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Speaking of which, Tsukune what were you and (name) talking about? It looked like he wanted you to tell him something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Well....you see.....I found out something unexpected regarding (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Huh? What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Um....well.....hmm.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune was trying to find the words as to what he and you were talking about, but he was too embarrassed to say it. Then all the girls (except for Moka) screamed startling Tsukune<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari, Mizore and Kurumu: Come on Tsukune! Out with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: OK! OK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsukune began telling them what had happened in the locker room when Ginei came and asked (name) about him and Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Oh man. Ginei's such a moron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's Ginei for you. Perverted and stupid. Then again that makes (name) cute like Kokoa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: But still, I can't believe that (name) doesn't know a thing about....you know...doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. Ever since then, he's been trying to get me to tell him what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: So why didn't you just tell him what it was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Well......uh.....look Kurumu, it's just embarrassing OK? Besides I don't want to ruin anything between (name) and Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: That'll be impossible because Kokoa's in the same boat too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Kokoa's a virgin too and she's just about as clueless as (name) is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What?!? Kokoa's a virgin too?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Wow. That is a juicy piece of gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Moka how could you not know this? She's your sister after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Well....I haven't exactly learned anything much about Kokoa because of her trying to kill me because of my roasary. So this is news to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Never mind that. (name) and Kokoa are never gonna stop asking what we were talking about until we tell them. What are we gonna do? It's way too embarrassing to tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah. I'll say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Well if they need to be taught about that kind of stuff, then I'm certainly more than willing to teach them how it's done. Especially (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore faulted her chest to show off her cleavage. Everyone else sweatdropped and yelled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune, Moka, Yukari, and Kurumu: YOU CERTAINLY WILL NOT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Besides, me and Yukari already have a plan to teach (name) and Kokoa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: You do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yup! Just leave it to me! With a little help from Yukari my sidekick, Kurumu the succubus of love will accomplish this mission! Operation Cherry Popper! Hahahaha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kurumu struck a pose like she was a super heroine and laughed like a moron, everyone looked at her like she was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yukari? Why is Kurumu calling you her sidekick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: And how did she come up with a name like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Just do me a favor. Don't ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: All right you guys! Listen up! Here's my idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu began telling Tsukune and the others her plan. Meanwhile.....</span></div></div>",

One was red and the other blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Kokoa! Look at this,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa came over and you showed her the books. She took the red one and read the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: \"The birds and the bees for dummies. The female edition.\" What the...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the other book and took a look. It was just like Kokoa's, but yours was a little different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): \"How to do it with your partner for morons. The men's edition.\" Is this some kind of joke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I don't know.

Let's see what it says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the note and it said; \"Are you curious as to what the birds and the bees are? Want to know the ultimate joy of being a couple?

I told putting your Ya-hoo crap was a bad idea! Now they're gonna figure out that it's was us who sent those books!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh calm down. Maybe they won't figure it out.

I wouldn't call myself a woman of love if I didn't have a catchphrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari sweatdrop: Kurumu, I can't even come up with the words as to how much of a idiot you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with you and Kokoa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Wait a sec. You don't think that...the person who sent us the books was Kurumu do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa's question made Kurumu and Yukari gulp. There was a long silence. Then you laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on Kokoa. There's no way that Kurumu sent these to us. Besides, not even she would be stupid enough to leave her own catchphrase on a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu and Yukari from behind the corner let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): In any case our problem is solved. Now we can find out what Tsukune and the others were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. I may not like reading books, but I'll make an exception in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Kurumu and Yukari....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: You see? They don't suspect a thing. I'd say we did a good job sidekick Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I guess so. And would you stop calling me that already?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Well then...I think it's best that we take our leave and let the lovebirds be alone. Come on Sidekick Yukari!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hey! I told you to stop calling me that! Are you even listening to me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with Yukari protesting behind her Kurumu took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well I'd say we got some studying to do. We'll read our books tonight and report back to each other tomorrow. How's that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Sounds good to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well then... I\"ll see you tomorrow.

Oh it's you. Jesus I nearly had heart attacks! I'm emphasizing the 'attacks' part cuz you might have given me more than one.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you read it?! Where is it?!

It's on my drawer but I didn't read it yet.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm burning it! It has things that no one should dare to see!

Quite alarmed as to what was going on and wanting to stop you and Kokoa from chasing Kurumu, they chased after you and them too. You all ran into a hallway with three doors on each side and passed through them. Then Kurumu with you and Kokoa chasing her came out one door and then went through another. Next Tsukune, Moka, Mizore, and Yuakari came out another and went through another door. After that, you came out one door with Kurumu and Moka chasing you and went to another door. Next, Yukari, Kokoa, and Mizore came out another door and went to another door. Then you all each came out of your own doors and slowly backed up until you all bumped into each other. Then you and Kokoa resumed the chase with Tsukune and the other girls close behind. Tsukune and the others tried to catch up with you and Kokoa, but sadly they lost you. Meanwhile Kurumu kept running and running until she she came into a hallway that also had an abandoned room. Unfortunately for Kurumu it was a dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh crap! I'm trapped!

When you found her, she was in a state of panic and begged to you two she had nothing to do with it. Then she explained about Kurumu's plan about wanting to help you two. She even explained about the part where Kurumu made her, her sidekick and made her get involved. She also said that Tsukune, Moka, and Mizore were also told of the plan and they didn't want to you two to learn that way. This made you and Kokoa a little less angry, but you both still gave Yukari a small punishment. Yukari ended up being hung upside down until her face was red. Then Tsukune, Moka and Mizore showed up. At first you and Kokoa thought that they were gonna stop you two from punishing them, but then they decided that even though you two wanted to know what it meant, Kurumu went a little too far and Yukari didn't try to stop her and they needed to be taught a lesson. Their punishments went on all afternoon. until school was over. Then after you left class, you were greeted by a hug attack from Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey (name)! Wanna walk together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure. I'd love too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa walked together holding hands and talked about the news and homework. As you walked with her you noticed how cute Kokoa was when she was happy. You couldn't help, but check her out. Then you noticed something. There was something glittering on Kokoa's schoolbag. You took a closer look and you saw that it was the keychain that you gave to Kokoa from your first date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Kokoa. Isn't that.....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa looked at the keychain and she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. It's the keychain from our first date. Ever since you gave this to me, I've never let this thing out of my sight. Whenever I see it, I always think of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to start blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So......you kept that keychain all this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. It was the first time someone's given me a gift before. I'll always treasure this, because it will always remind me of that day and it will always remind me of my first love which will always be you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were overwhelmed by Kokoa's words and you couldn't help, but be happy.

You closed your eyes and came in for a kiss. Kokoa's heart was beating like a jackhammer, but she closed her eyes and prepared to kiss you. Then both of your lips connected. Kokoa was enjoying the kiss, but for some reason your lips tasted a little different. She opened her eyes and to find that she was kissing her pillow. This made Kokoa snap out of her fantasy immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Pffft! What the....! What the hell am I doing?!? Why am I thinking of something so perverted?!?!?

What the heck are we doing here anyway?!? Haven't you forgotten what happened the last time we tried to help (name) and Kokoa?!? Not to mention we got totally punished for it! My heads still pounding from being upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No I haven't. I'll admit it that the plan from then was a misfire, but this time it's full proof! As the woman of love, I'll will not rest until I complete my mission!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: (sigh) So what's the plan this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That I can't say Sidekick Yukari. All I can tell you is that this plan will definitely work. Now put this on so they won't recognize us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw Yukari a huge overcoat, a hat and sunglasses.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little later you and Kokoa arrived at the resort with Kurumu and Yukari close behind. When you and Kokoa saw the resort, you were both amazed. The resort was even bigger and even more amazing than you both thought. It looked more like a theme park than a resort. The building was huge and looked like a palace from a far away country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Whoa! This place is amazing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No kidding! It's a good thing we got a discount before we came here otherwise we never would have been able to afford this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: How did you get the discount?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Let's just say I know my sources for discounts. Besides, it's for you Kokoa. You're my girlfriend and my girlfriend deserves the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held Kokoa's hand and kissed her on the cheek. This made Kokoa smile and she clung to your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh (name). You always have to be so wishy washy. But I love it when you're wishy washy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. Shall we get going? We gotta set up our room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah! Let's get going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you and Kokoa get off to your hotel room. Meanwhile Kurumu and Yukari who were still wearing their disguises had just gotten off the bus saw you and Kokoa heading to the hotel. They followed you and Kokoa, but kept their distance so you and Kokoa wouldn't detect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Well, I'll say this for those two, they picked a pretty swanky resort to be alone together. An expensive one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I know. It's the perfect place for a couple to be alone together. Stay on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Um Kurumu, can't we do something about the disguises? It's starting to get hot in these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Not yet Sidekick Yukari. If we take them off now, we'll look suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Don't we look suspicious enough? I mean come on. I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't start staring at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Just hang in there! I bought a change of clothes for both of us. The moment we confirm where (name) and Kokoa are, we'll change. Until then, hang in there Sidekick Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: How many times have I.....oh why do I even bother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kurumu and Yukari continued to follow you and Kokoa to the hotel. A little later you and Kokoa got your room key and went to your room. It was a big room and looked like something from a private suite. In the center of the room there was a giant bed that had blue blankets and big fluffy pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Whoa! Look at this place! It looks amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know! It looks like a room fit for a king!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa jumped and plopped down on the bed to test the softness while you set your stuff down. Then you saw a booklet on the table. You looked at the booklet and it a list of all the events happening on the resort. There was boat rides, a steam bath, a spa, the indoor bath and even a theme park. You knew that you had to save the indoor bath for last so you had to choose another thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Ahhh! This bed feels soooo good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yep. I gotta say this rooms pretty nice. Out of all the dates I've been on, I'd say this one tops them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: So what should we do today? We got all day for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booklet had a lot of choices, but should you choose or should you let Kokoa choose?</span></div></div>",

You looked around and tried to find a place to take Kokoa. It had to be a place that served good food, but wasn't like a fast food joint. You both took a look around and then you saw a restaurant.

It's great to be out of those crazy disguises!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah. At least we have a place to crash thanks to yours truly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: The only reason why we were able to get this room was because you used your succubus powers to seduce that guy for giving us the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Regardless, now we have a base of operations and I can work on my plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Speaking of which, shouldn't we be following (name) and Kokoa? I mean....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No need. Those two are going out to eat and sight seeing. They won't be back till later. Besides I need to work on the key thing to make this plan work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu then rummaged through her bag and pulled out a few bottles and a few spices and pulled out a big bottle with a heart on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What the heck is all that stuff?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: The ingredients for the key component to my plan. Without this there's no way that this plan will fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had no idea what the ingredients Kurumu bought with her, but then she looked at the bottle with the heart on it and immediately recognized what the bottle was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu! Isn't that the love potion from school?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Indeed it is Sidekick Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari Oh come on! Kurumu that's the oldest trick in the book! Besides (name) and Kokoa are already in love with each other. Why would you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Cool your jets Sidekick Yukari. I'm well aware of all that.

Don't tell me you're gonna....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Now you're catching on. I'm going to change the effects of the love potion to make (name) and Kokoa go crazy for each other. Once they get some of this potion, they'll be all over each other like crazy and their cherries will definitely be popped! Hahaha! I'm a genius!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean there's no telling what would happen if you modify the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Come on Sidekick Yukari. Have a little faith. I'm a succubus. I've got lots of experience with potions. Especially the love kind. Hehehe. This is gonna be great! This plan is definitely gonna work!

I was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well now that we've eaten, shall we do some sight seeing? We've got all day to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah! Let's go! I wanna go to the theme park!

You both had fun going on different rides and playing different games. You both went on roller coasters, bumper cars, and played some games too. In a game you won Kokoa a prize by knocking over the bottles. The prize was a giant stuffed bat. Kokoa squealed with glee and she gave you a big hug. Later you and her took a walk around the resort and saw the sights. The resort even had a gift ship which Kokoa had to shop in. There were knick knacks, accessories, and even clothes. Kokoa took some clothes and modeled for you. The ones that you liked she bought. Then she picked some clothes for you to put on and wanted you to model some clothes too. At first you declined, but then Kokoa convinced you convinced you to try some on and you modeled some clothes Kokoa. Whatever outfits that Kokoa liked she bought. A few moments later you and Kokoa came out with bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(music ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Whew! That was a lot for fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. We sure did a lot today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked up at the sky and saw that the sun was setting meaning it was getting late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): We should probably get back to our room. It's getting late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Awww come on. Let's do one more thing before we go back. Pretty please? With sugar on top?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa made the cutest pleading face. Not even you could resist something that adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. OK. Hahaha. How could I say no to that face? What did you have in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa looked around. Then she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: There! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to where Kokoa was pointing at and there in the corner on the gift shop was a photo booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A photo booth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah! I want to commemorate this moment with some photos. That way I can show big sister and so I can remember this date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK then. Let's do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Kokoa went inside the booth together and took some photos. First you and Kokoa took one of you two hugging, then making funny faces, and then another one with you two with your best smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK.I think we have more time for one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Let's make this one really special!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. Get ready.....3, 2, 1, chee....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish, Kokoa surprised you by kissing you on the cheek as the camera took your photo. Needless to say, you were surprised. You felt your cheek from where Kokoa kissed you and blushed beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): K-kokoa.....did you just....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa giggled and stuck out her tongue mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I told you this one would be special. (winks)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. Since when have you been so assertive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Since now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you and Kokoa got your pictures, you both headed back to your rooms. When you both got back, you both plopped into the bed exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Whew. (name)? I've been on a lot of with you.....well not many dates, but this one has been the best date ever so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah me too. I had a lot of fun today too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Can't wait till tomorrow. What should we do tomorrow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well......let me think. Well....how about the pool? We could always go swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Um......I don't think that's a good idea. I'm not to thrilled about pools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why not? Do you hate swimming or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: No it's not that. It's just that.....pure water can hurt me. You see vampires are weak in water. Water has an adverse effect on vampires so I can't swim in water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: But don't worry. I can be in water as long as I put this in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa went through her bag and pulled out a big bottle of shampoo that smelled like herbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What's this? Some kind of shampoo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You should say that. This is filled with medicinal herbs that allows me to go into water, but I can't just go putting my herbs in a public pool and stuff. People would think I'm crazy or something and they'll figure out about me being a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well, you're a little off on the \"figuring out about the vampire\" thing, but you're are right about the \"putting the herbs in the pool\" part.. OK then. We can skip the pool, but we have to find somewhere to go tomorrow. But where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up trying to get an idea what to do for tomorrow. Then you saw something on the table. It was a flyer that had large letters that said: \"Feeling tired and want to relax? Try our indoor bath and spa for couples!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey. How about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showed Kokoa the flyer and when she saw it, her eyes lit up with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh yeah! The indoor bath! We can do that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And we can be by ourselves and you can use the herbs so you won't be in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa gave you a big hug and a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Thank you (name)! Thank you for being so understanding. You're the best! The bestest boyfriend I ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Awww shucks Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hugged Kokoa back and petted her head. Then you heard Kokoa yawn and you yawned as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sounds like we both a little sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. Let's get some sleep. You mind if I sleep with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well....there is one bed and since were a couple....why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Kokoa got dressed in your PJs, got into bed and went to sleep.

Yukari used her most powerful spell of containment on Kurumu and it held her. Yukari managed to restrain Kurumu and she wasn't very resisting despite her lust. In fact she mis-took it for sex. \"Ohh trying to punish me oh yes do it more I'm getting sooooooo horny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully it's not as effective on them.

They expected to see you and Kokoa, but unfortunately it was another couple. A young man and an older woman walked past as they entered the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Huh? I thought for sure that (name) and Kokoa would be here by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I wonder where they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu suddenly remembered and when she did she face palmed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Aww crap! I forgot! (name) and Kokoa are going to the spa! They're gonna save the bath for last!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Oh man! What do we do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What else? Go to the spa and get them there! Come on Sidekick Yukari!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hey wait for me! And stop calling me that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu raced out of the bath with Yukari close behind. Meanwhile back with you and Kokoa, you both had left your room and were heading toward the spa. Both of you were excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Ooooh! I can't wait! That spa is calling my name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know. I'm pumped too! I wonder what should we try first when we get there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Who cares? I'm gonna try every single thing there! Come on (name)! The spa is just up ahead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha! OK, OK! Just don't drag me again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa went inside and were blown away by the inside. It was illuminated and spacious with brown and maroon red tones. The floor was tile and the were sofas the size of beds. There was also the sound of music that you and Kokoa couldn't make out, but you both felt relaxed hearing it. Then you were both greeted by a group of women wearing kimonos. Needless to say, you and Kokoa were a little surprised. A woman from the group stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Welcome. I welcome you to our spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa bowed back in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) and Kokoa: Thanks for having us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: A party for two? Right this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led you both down the hall as you both examined the interior of the spa. You were blown away by how beautiful it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Wow. This place is amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You're telling me. I've never been to spa before, but even I see that this place is terrific!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the woman in front of two rooms and gave you both keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Please change in here. The girls room is to the right and the boys is to the left. I will wait for you both outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa both went into the separate rooms to change. When you both came back you were wearing a black bathrobe and Kokoa red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. I've never worn a bathrobe before. It feels so comfy,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. It's like a I'm wearing a fluffy cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Please come this way. The spa is just right this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa followed eager to get the spa trip started. Unbeknownst to either of you, our two characters were spying on the both of you as you both left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: OK. We found them. Now all we gotta do follow them and when the moment strikes, we spike em with the potion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: But how are gonna do that without them catching us? I thought we were supposed to get them to drink it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's true, but it can also work through skin contact. Think about it. Since we can't get the potion to them through drinking it, we're gonna put the potion in Kokoa's herbs instead. Since (name) and Kokoa are gonna be bathing together, they're gonna get covered with the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I get it! But how are we gonna get to the herbs? Kokoa's probably got them locked up or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's were you come in Sidekick Yukari. You'll use your magic to unlock Kokoa's locker so we can get her herbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Are you sure this'll work? I mean what if we get caught?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Don't worry. We won't now come on, before (name) and Kokoa get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu and Yukari then sneaked into the girls side. They looked around to make sure no one was around. Luckily there was no one to be seen. Then they looked at the lockers trying to find Kokoa's locker. After a few minutes they found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: OK Sidekick Yukari. Do your stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Would stop calling me....oh forget it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari waved her wand, chanted a spell, and Kokoa's locker unlocked. Then Kurumu took out the love potion bottle and Kokoa's herbs. Then she poured potion into the herbs. The herbs at first changed color from green to pink and emitted a puff of smoke. The smoke changed into a heart and then color of the herbs returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yes! We did it! Mission accomplished! Now all we have to do is let the potion do it's magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Now let's beat it before Kokoa comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu quickly put the herbs back and Yukari relocked Kokoa's locker using her magic. Then they both raced out of the locker room when suddenly, they heard footsteps coming towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh crap! Someone's coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Quick hide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu and Yukari looked around to find a hiding place. Then Kurumu saw an open locker. She immediately grabbed Yukari and pulled her into the open locker. They hid inside and held their breath. They see the person who came in which was.....</span></div></div>",

Kurumu and Yukari stayed in hidden so they wouldn't get caught. Kurumu shifted to try to get herself comfortable, but then she accidentally stepped on Yukari's foot. Yukari was about to scream in pain, but Kurumu shoved her face in her chest to muffle the noise. Luckily the woman didn't hear her. After the woman was done she left, leaving Kurumu and Yukari in the clear. They stepped out of the locker and breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Whew. That was close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Geez! Kurumu! You're giant milk jugs almost suffocated me in there! Not to mention you stepped on my foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Sorry, there was no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: So what do we do now? Since we managed to put some love potion in the herbs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Now we wait and watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: You mean we have to stalk (name) and Kokoa again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Kurumu and Yukari left the locker room. Meanwhile back with you and Kokoa, you both being lead by the hostess of the spa to an area where there were many places to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Now this is where I leave you both. Feel free to relax and let me know if you need anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) and Kokoa: Thank you very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the hostess left leaving you and Kokoa alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh wow! There are so many things here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's hard to tell what to go for first. I don't know which to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: They even have a jacuzzi in here! Too bad I can't use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't worry. We'll save anything water related later. Hey look! They have masseusses too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Wow! I could use one of those! My shoulders have been feeling stiff all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well then, how about we stop staring and let's starting relaxing already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah! Let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Kokoa's escapade for relaxation began (with Kurumu and Yukari watching from a distance). You both headed from the massuesses first. They had you lie on your backs and they massaged your backs. At first it hurt you a bit since you never had a massage before, but then your tension went away like magic. Kokoa on the other hand sighed happily as the masseuse massaged her back and her calves, Next you both tried spa masks. At first you declined because you thought the spa mask was a bit to feminine for you, but Kokoa talked you into it. You both had masks all over your faces and sat in chairs letting the masks do their job. Then Kokoa had her hands massages and her fingernails painted. You sat in the chair while you had your legs massaged and had your shoulders massaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): (sigh) This feels good. Who would've thought a spa mask would feel so good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I told you you'd like it. (sigh) I feel like I'm in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kurumu and Yukari watched from afar getting their nails painted and their feet were in tubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Man. Why haven't they gotten in the baths yet?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu calm down, They're gonna save those for last right? So we might as well kick back and relax a bit. We got plenty of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I guess so, but still...the suspense is killing me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Just be quiet and keep an eye on them before you stress me out with your complaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you and Kokoa, you both put on swimsuits and took the kind of bath that even Kokoa would be able to take. A mud bath. You both went in separate tubs and let the mud wash over your bodies. The mud was warm and was perfect. It felt so good that you felt like you would fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): This is awesome! I've never been in a mud bath before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Isn't it great? This is my kind of bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sat in the bath for a while and then you both got dressed back into your robes. You were both feeling refreshed and deeply relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Wow. That was amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yup. That was the best spa day I've ever had. And it's not over yet. There's one more stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yup. It's getting late, so now's the perfect time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Kokoa headed off to your final destination. The Indoor bath. Kurumu and Yukari followed close behind while you both walked toward the bath hand in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yes! Finally! They're heading for the indoor bath! Now the main event will begin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Well now that we now for sure that they're heading for the bath, I suppose we'll just head home and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No way. I'm seeing this through till the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What?!? Kurumu, we shouldn't watch them anymore than we already have! Let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh come on Sidekick Yukari! Where's your sense of adventure? Let's go! We have to make sure that potion works anyway so let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: rrghh! How I got stuck hanging around with this bimbo, I will never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari sweatdropped and sighed as she reluctantly followed Kurumu. Then.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back with you and Kokoa, you both were at the entrance in the indoor bath. It was a lot bigger than you both thought. It was so huge that it looked more like a water park of some kind. When you both got there, you were greeted by a young man who politely bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan: Hello. I take it you two are here for the indoor bath correct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan: Very well. Right this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man led you and Kokoa down the halls and led you two to a room. Then gave you two a pair of towels and politely bowed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan: The indoor bath is just up ahead. Just go right through the door. Please enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the man left. Then you and Kokoa went through the door and you were welcomed to a beautiful sight. The room for the indoor bath was a little spacious and with an empty mini pool. The room was also lined with sky blue tile and in the middle of the room there was a statue of a dragon. Where you and Kokoa came in, there were two changing rooms so your clothes had a place. The room looked wonderful, but you and Kokoa were wondering about one thing. Where was the bath?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)? Are you sure this is the right room? This seems like a pool than a bath to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It should be. Hmmm. I would where the bath is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a hissing noise. Then with a gurgle and gush, steaming water gushed out from the mouth of the dragon statue. You and Kokoa watched in surprise as the bath began filling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Wow! Didn't expect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. I guess it automatically fills up. This bath keeps getting better and better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a pause between you two. Then you both looked at each other and blushed. Needless to say, you and her were excited, but at the same time you both were a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So......I guess......we should get undressed then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah.  I guess so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was another awkward pause. Then you and Kokoa went into your separate rooms and began getting undressed. You both were very nervous at this point because neither of you had ever taken a bath with someone else before. Not to mention it was going to be the first time that either of you have seen each other nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: OK. This is it (name). The moment you've been waiting for. Don't be nervous. Even though this will the be the first time that you're gonna be seeing Kokoa naked. Dah! Stop it! No dirty thoughts! Just stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa thinking: Here we go Kokoa. Don't be nervous. This is what you wanted right? So just go for it. (name)'s your lover and doing these kinds of things is normal. Just stay calm and just do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had taken off your clothes completely and were ready to enter the bath. You got the stuff you needed, put on a towel, and prepared to enter the bath. You hesitantly put your hand on the doorknob and realized that you were shaking and your heart was beating like a drum. You took a deep breath to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK (name). It's time. It's time for you to be a man and go for it. Here goes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you opened the door and.....</span></div></div>",

Well, might as well wash up before I get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over next to the shower, sat on a chair and began to wash yourself. While you were doing that, a certain someone was in the other changing room watching you and when she saw you her heart began to beat like a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa thinking: Wow.....(name) looks even better than I thought. He's right there stark naked! I can't believe it! Wait...what the heck am I doing?!? <br>\r\nI'm acting like a pervert! But.....he looks so cute when he's nude!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa looked at herself. She was wearing nothing, but a towel now and for some reason she was feeling a little self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I wonder......will (name) like my body? I mean I know it's not as curvy as Kurumu's or big sister's, but still.....what if he doesn't like my body? What if he thinks I'm too tiny or unattractive? No. (name) loves me just the way I am. I just have to go for it. Here goes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a deep breath Kokoa finally came out of the changing rooms wearing her towel. When you two saw each other, you stared at each other. Then you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey. What took you so long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I was....just getting the herbs and stuff. Washing yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yup. Pretty much. Although I could use some help washing my back. You would you....mind helping me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa blushed beet red for a moment, then she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: OK.....if you don't mind washing mine too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had you turn around, lathered a sponge and started scrubbing your back. Unknown to either of you in a separate room next to them, once again two certain girls were spying on both of you from two peep holes watching everything you both were doing. Meanwhile Kokoa had finished scrubbing your back and now you were scrubbing her back. Kokoa was still feeling a little shy so she made sure her chest and her downstairs was covered as you scrubbed her back. You were feeling a little nervous still, but you were feeling a lot more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): How is it Kokoa? Am I scrubbing too hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: No it's fine. It actually feels pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Your skin is so white. It's like snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa blushing: Umm.....thank you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrubbed all over her back all over until you were sure that her back was clean. Then you both prepared to enter the bath. Before you both entered Kokoa got her herbs and began putting them in the bath. Back with Kurumu and Yukari, someone was getting a little impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Grrrrr! What the heck is taking so long?!? I wish they would hurry up and start doing it already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu! Calm down. They're putting in the herbs now. Besides I don't think that we should be spying like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Come on! Come on! Hurry up and make love already! And....mmpphh!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Yukari quickly covered Kurumu's mouth with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Would you shut up?!? If you keep doing that someone's gonna hear us! Besides we should go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu calmed down and removed Yukari's hand from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No way! You bail when the best part's coming, but I'm staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Oh brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all the herbs were emptied and the bath was ready to use. The bathwater was now an emerald green color with a few leaves floating on the surface. To you it looked like you and Kokoa were about to bathe in a pool of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So what kind of herbs are in this thing anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Just a few medicinal ones, and a few other leaves that help make your skin shiny. I hope it doesn't bother you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No. Don't worry about it. I was just curious. Well..... I'm going in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you entered the bath (with your towel still on). The water felt so soothing you sank into the water and let the warmth wash over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Haaaahhh....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: How is it? Is it too smelly with the herbs in it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No. I don't know if it's the herbs or the water, but it feels so soothing. The smell. The warmth. It feels so good I feel like I'm gonna fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Really? Well then...I'm coming in too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa stepped in the bath (with her towel covering her). She sat in the opposite end of you and sighed in a relaxing tone. Kurumu and Yukari who were still watching from their peepholes watched in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: This is heaven. It feels so wonderful. I feel the stress washing away. It can't get any better than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Oh trust me. It's gonna get better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Kurumu! We really should get going. If the potion does take effect, we shouldn't watch (name) and Kokoa do it! It's private!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Be quiet Sidekick Yukari! We're just getting to the good part!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the potion takes effect.....</span></div></div>",

You and Kokoa were acting exactly the same as before and nothing was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Come on! Come on! Why isn't anything happening?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Nothing's happening? Let me see. (Looks through her peephole) That's weird. Nothing's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's what I said. Did I screw up the potion's effect by putting it in the herbs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Maybe it takes a while to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the bath, you were enjoying your bath. You loved the smell of the herbs and the warmth of the water. Best of all, you were enjoying them because Kokoa was in the bath with you. You looked at Kokoa as she was relaxing in the bath. As you did you couldn't help, but notice how beautiful she looked. Her snow white skin, her red hair, her emerald green eyes, everything about her was beautiful. Then you eyes fell on something that for some reason made your heart leap. Her chest. She wasn't as big as Kurumu, but you liked her chest regardless. Then you looked at her legs. They were slim and firm and looked very smooth. As you were checking out Kokoa, you couldn't help, but blurt out your inner thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow....so pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa noticed you were staring at her and her voice snapped you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What are you staring at?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Dah! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to stare! I was just looking how hot you were....gah! I mean....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected Kokoa to get mad at you for staring at her, but surprisingly Kokoa didn't. She did blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hot? You....really think so? You think I'm hot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Uh......yeah. You're really hot. Especially around the chest and the legs. Dah! Crap! Forget I said that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: What the hell am I saying?!? Knock it off man! Now Kokoa's really gonna think that you're a pervert after saying that! Geez. What the hell is wrong with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa was now as red as her hair when you complimented her. But she was happy that you complimented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Do....you really mean it? Is my body....really what you say it is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um.....well....yeah. Sorry if I sounded like a perv, but I meant it. Your body really is hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Um.....Thank you. That....means a lot to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey! I think the potions starting to work. (name)'s getting turned on by Kokoa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I think you're right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another awkward pause. Then Kokoa finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)? Since....you love me...and you're my boyfriend and stuff.....do you.....want to see more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed beet red and steam came out of your head. Kurumu and Yukari could hardly believe their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Holy crap! It's actually gonna happen! They're gonna do it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! Go for it (name)! Go after her sweet body like you mean it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What the....? Since when have you gotten into this Ms. \"let's get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Shut up Kurumu! I'm trying to watch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was now beating like a jackhammer and a certain part of your body began to perk up a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): K-k-kokoa......wh-what do you mean by...s-see more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I mean.....do you want to see more of my body?

When you finally saw Kokoa's breasts for the first time, your eroticism soared off the charts. They were about average shaped and the nipples were in a perfect shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. They're so...beautiful and....cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa blushing: Th-thank you. Th-there's more,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa's heart was beating like crazy and her eroticism soared too. She didn't know why, but she was getting turned on from you seeing her naked. Then she removed her towel completely and she was know in front of you stark naked. You nearly had a nosebleed from seeing her nude. You can not only see her breasts, but her vagina too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Holy crap! You look hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: R-r-really? Even my breasts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes! They're beautiful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Th-thanks. You.....want to touch them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you nodded nervously. You went toward Kokoa and with trembling hands reached and gently touched her breasts. Kokoa yelped in a mixture of surprise and pleasure which caused you to retract your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sorry! Did I squeeze too hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: N-no. I was just surprised. Please keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resumed touching her breasts. They were even softer than you thought and you were loving how they felt. Kokoa was uncomfortable at first, but her breathing became ragged and it began to feel good. You felt Kokoa's nipples harden and you saw how turned on she was and in turn you began to get turned on as well. She was also getting wet due to the potion's effect as her juices dripped into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa....for some reason.....I'm feeling....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I know. I'm feeling it too. (name)? I.....I want you...to....you know....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you had no idea what Kokoa meant then you saw her looking at you down there and you understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You mean....you want me to put it in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Are....you sure? I mean is this what you want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yes. Please. It's OK. Just please be gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK....t-turn around please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa did so and she also leaned forward so her butt was in front of your crotch. You also took off your towel and your erect cock sprang up. Then you got behind Kokoa and prepared to enter her. Kurumu and Yukari who were still watching the whole scene hardly dared to speak. You took aim carefully and slowly began to enter her. Kokoa tensed up and gripped the sides of the tub enduring the unfamiliar sensation. Your tip was all that came in. Something was preventing you from entering any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa...I need you to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: OK......but it hurts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's OK. Just take a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa took a deep breath and let it out. As she exhaled you felt some of the tension leave her body. You took that chance to push through and you were able to make it inside her with a single stroke. Kokoa yelped in pain as her virginity was ripped open. Even with the potions effect she still felt some pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa? Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I'm fine....but it hurts a little.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Here. Let me help relieve the pain a little. Look this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa turned her head and you met her lips in a kiss. Kokoa was surprised at first, but then she returned the kiss. You pushed your tongue between her lips and both of your tongues danced in each others mouths. As you two kissed, you gently squeezed and massaged one of Kokoa's breasts. Kokoa jumped a little, but her lips were still locked with yours. After a minute you pulled back. Kokoa stared at you with a hot look in her eyes and you couldn't help, but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Feel better now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. I feel no pain now. In fact, I feel even more horny than I did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So you think it would be OK to move?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. Make me feel good. Pound me senseless if you have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed Kokoa's hips and you slowly began to thrust inside her. Kokoa gasped as your shaft went in and out of her. She gripped the side of the tub trying to endure the intense pleasure. At first she tried to keep in her voice, but the pleasure was too great. She began to let out a series of erotic moans as the sensations washed over her. Her moans served as a great motivator as you thrust harder and faster. Kokoa moans turned into pleasurable screams as the pleasure grew stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (moan)! It feels so good!! It's my first time yet.....it feels so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): (gasp) Kokoa! You're so tight! I feel good too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were getting close. The pleasure was mounting and your thrusts grew stronger and harder. Kokoa was close too. You could tell because the mouth as well as the inside of her vagina clamped on you strongly intensifying the pleasure. Soon a more numbing pleasure began to build inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa...! I'm getting close...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Me too! Please hurry! I'm coming! I'm coming! AHHHH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): RRRGGGHHH!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you reached your limit. You hurriedly pulled out from her and violently began to ejaculate. Kokoa twitched as her orgasm shocked her like thunder and globs of semen flew out from your cock and landed all over her butt. Kokoa flopped over to the side of the tub catching her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh no! I'm so sorry Kokoa! I came all over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: So....this is what semen is...and this is what sex feels like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Here. Let me get it off for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the bucket and sponge and cleaned Kokoa off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): There. All clean. You feeling OK Kokoa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: It still tingles a little, but I'm OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm sorry. Maybe I rushed it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa gave you a heartfelt smile and gave you a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Don't be. In fact I'm happy. I finally got to experience what it was like and I was going about it wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me too. In fact, I could get used to it. I'd like to do it again some time. Oops!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered your mouth afraid that you said something perverted again, but Kokoa giggled and nuzzled in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I'd like that. Very much. Just...be sure to tell me OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and you hugged Kokoa as you both soaked in the bath a little longer. </span></div></div>",

Your dream was more or less the same. You and Kokoa met your parents and you dreamed about making love to Kokoa, except the end of the dream was different for you.

I need to let my hair breath a little.\", Kurumu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no. The water will will mix with it and it will get all sudsy. And it's no good when mixed with water the conditioner wouldn't work right.\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...you don't think that love potion might be on the fritz do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said it might not work properly if you mix with water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on what your potion was meant to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was meant for them to have sex, but if they didn't go all the way then maybe it's effects might force them to do it until-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thinking what I'm thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we gotta double check on those love birds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I was thinking we run away and never come back to Yokai when they find out we forced them to hit adulthood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\", Kurumu grabbed Yukari put on a robe and ran to your room hoping to not hear any sounds of lovemaking. When they got there they heard it and knew they needed to stop it. Kurumu broke down the door forcing you and Kokoa to stop screwing. \"(NAME) KOKOA STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa broke out of your sex fueled high and felt normal again. But felt completely embarrassed to see Kurumu and Yukari in your room with you naked with Kokoa. \"What are you doing here?!\", Kokoa screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys we did something really bad.\", Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", you asked covering up you and Kokoa with the bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny story, uhhhhh we spiked your bath water with a special love potion that allowed you guys to finally have \"experience\" but after when it mixed with the water and maybe the herbs a unforeseen complication came to mind. But now it stands to reason that you guys will be unable to control yourselves until you two go all the way if you understand what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means what we felt at the bath and right now was just us being forced by you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\", Yukari answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa tackled Kurumu and choked her, \"You fucking asshole! How dare you sully our relationship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only sped up the process. It only sped it up too much.\", Kurumu said as she was being choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokoa get off her!\", Yukari yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Kokoa!\", you said getting her off Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you telling us we can't stop having sex until we decide to let it consume us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it's not impossible to fix just give me a few days and you guys can decide to go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Kurumu! So what now?! We stay in separate rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't matter you'd draw each other like magnets to metal until you stuck to each other. We'll watch you guys overnight so you don't go crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good cuz I'm not ready to go on having moods swings, an attitude, and getting angry at nothing all the time!\", Kokoa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you were expecting a child all year?\", Yukari joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa threw a lamp at Yukari with Yukari running away to go try and get started on the potion. \"I'm really sorry guys I was only trying to help you.\", Kurumu apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it. Just let us get some rest while you guys fix this mess.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just wait in the bathroom and come out if I hear you two, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we get it.\", Kokoa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kurumu left you whispered to Kokoa, \"You think maybe we wanted to do that but we just were too scared to try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Honestly I don't think I'd have minded them doing what they did that much if it hadn't led to us being forced to do it against our will now. But I don't agree with them doing at all in the first place either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking the same thing almost. But Kokoa, do you think about having one day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But I don't want to go there yet. I'm too full of energy to settle down right now. I'd die a little inside even though it would be wonderful. But some day, not today (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right. Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two slept back to back so you wouldn't feel more tempted to have sex. For the next six hours Kurumu kept you two from doing it simply by unleashing her succubi charms forcing you both to sleep in order to please her. It was only a temporary solution as her charms while powerful couldn't last. Every time you two would try she'd come out of the bathroom used her charms and you two would be head over heels for her and sleep as she commanded. Kurumu got very tired but morning came and Yukari was actually almost done. Faster than Kurumu predicted, she was only a few minutes away from finishing an antidote and called Kurumu to tell her the good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm almost done. Should be ready within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god. I can't take it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sidekick Kurumu just hold out a bit longer and your blunder will be annulled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha.\", Kurumu laugh sarcastically.</span></div></div>",

Yukari had finished the antidote and you and Kokoa were back to normal. You and Kokoa were still a little mad at first, but you and her realized that Kurumu had good intentions so you both forgave her. When it was time to leave, you all packed up your things and left the resort. Meanwhile back at Yokai Academy, a certain pair had just arrived for the bus eager to greet you and Kokoa at the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I can't wait! (name) and Kokoa are coming back today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: I know! I can't wait to hear how their trip went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah. I wish Kurumu and Yukari were here with us. I wonder where they went?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Who knows? Hey. Maybe they hitched a ride to the resort and decided to play cupid with (name) and Kokoa again. Hahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh dear. I sure hope those two aren't causing trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Come on Moka, you worry too much. I was just kidding. Besides what are the odds of that happening? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah you're right. Hahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka could see the bus coming. The bus pulled up and you and Kokoa came out of the bus. Moka and Tsukune welcomed them back with open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh Kokoa! I'm so glad you're back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hi big sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Welcome back you two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks Tsukune. It's good to be back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: How was your trip?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh it was great! The resort was awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yup. Everything was great. We had a great time. Although, we had a few......complications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Complications?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa pointed behind them and Tsukune and Moka looked to see Kurumu and Yukari who came out of the bus smiling awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune and Moka: WHAAAAATTT?!?!?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as they headed back to the dorms. you and Kokoa explained what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Oh man. So those two decided to play cupid again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's pretty much the sum of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh dear. I guess Tsukune called right on the dot about Kurumu and Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Man. You two never learn do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu and Yukari: We're sorry. For the umpteenth time we're so sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Well there's one good thing that came out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What's that big sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: You and (name) are now even closer than you both were before. Not to mention you finally got experience what \"it\" felt like. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa both looked at each other and blushed bright pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Well....um....yeah. I guess we did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Although I wish we weren't under the influence with the love potion to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: I agree with Moka. You both were so scared when you found out what \"it\" was, but now it's different. (name), I think you've become more manly these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really? You think so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Uh-huh. I know so man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as you walked past the gate entering the school, Kokoa tugged at your sleeve to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)? Can I ask you something when we have a chance to be alone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why can't you ask me now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Because I don't want big sister or anyone else to overhear us. The last thing we need to have two certain people to be playing cupid again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Good point. I'll see you soon OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: K. See you in class (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater everyone went back to their dorms to get ready for school. You went back to your room to get your stuff in order. When you got back you placed your stuff at your desk and plopped down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): -sigh- It's good to be back. Course it sucks that I have to go back to school and stuff. Oh right. I gotta make sure everyone gets their souvenirs when I get back to class today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked through your bags trying to find the bag with the souvenirs you got for Tsukune and the others. As you went through them you pulled out an envelope. It contained the pictures you and Kokoa took. You chuckled as you went through them. Then you stopped at the one where Kokoa was kissing you on the cheek. You couldn't help, but smile and at the same time blush from seeing that photo. You also remembered what Tsukune said about you being more manly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. I guess have become more manly haven't I? I sure am lucky to have a girl like Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you got dressed in your school uniform, got your bag with souvenirs for Tsukune and the others and went to class. Unbeknownst to you, the figure appeared again. It watched as you headed to class with a smile on your face. Then it disappeared in the darkness.</span></div></div>",

Figured I get you guys a little something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Aww. How thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Let's see.....ah! Here Tsukune. I got you this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your bag you gave Tsukune a T-shirt that was black and had a pair of demonic red eyes that looked just like Moka's when she turned into her true vampire form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Wow! This is cool! Thanks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And for Mizore, when I saw this I just had to give it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Mizore you gave her a snowglobe that had a woman that looked just like her inside it. Only she had long ponytail instead of Mizore's short hair. She was wearing a yukata while walking in the snow with an umbrella. Mizore shook it and was delighted when she saw it snow inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Thank you (name). This gift is so thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. Next up Yukari. The one's especially for you. I figured it would be right up your alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Yukari a giant book. It was a book on the history of monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Oh wow! I love it. I'll read every single chapter down to the page numbers! Now if there's an unknown monster I haven't heard of, I can look it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I knew you would. Now then. Kurumu. This is for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Kurumu a small bottle. Kurumu was puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What is this (name)? If it's a potion I swear....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. Don't worry. It's bath salts. It's supposed to smell like a fruit salad or something like that. Apparently it's good for your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Really? All righty! I'll accept this gift! Ya-hoo-hoo. Thanks (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Anytime. Last but not least, Moka. I figured sense you're Kokoa's older sister, you both would kinda have the same interests. So I got you this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you pulled out a skeleton keychain. It was just like Kokoa's except that this one was more greener and it had a lot of weird designs on it. When Moka saw it she squealed with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Aww!!! How cute! Aww I always wanted one of these! Thank you so much (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. You're welcome. I'm glad you like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell rung and Ms. Nekomone entered the classroom which meant that class was know in session.

Your eyes looked mean and evil. You had an evil smile that would make anyone cringe and your skin was a little pale. You also had a weird crown on your forehead that had a red gem in the middle. Needless to say you were a little spooked. You evil reflection looked at you and suddenly let out an evil laughter that startled you which made you fall back and fall on your butt.

You were a human being in a monster world with a vampire girlfriend. The story seemed like a fairy with a happy ending, but there was one thing that could make that story have an unhappy ending. The fact that you were a human. Remembering that made you worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name)? Is something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm sorry. It's just that.....I just remembered the fact that I'm going to have to tell my secret to Kokoa eventually. And I'm worried that she's not gonna take it well. Not to mention that she might kill me for not telling her. I'm scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune then placed his arm around your shoulder and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name). It'll be OK. Take your time. You can tell Kokoa when you're ready. Just take your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know. But.....for some reason, I feel like that time is gonna come sooner than I expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Like I said tell her when you're good and ready. Don't worry man. I know what you're going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. You're right. Thanks Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Anytime bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in a dark corner of the bathroom once again the mysterious figure appeared again.

There in the center of the room was a chamber/tank filled with blue liquid with a red orb inside. The red orb  glowed and an image of someone appeared. It was the figure's master Lord Saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Slave. What news do you being me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigure: My lord. I bring good news. The boy is even closer to the vampire than he ever was before. They are inseparable. Now would be the perfect time to execute the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: I see. Very well slave. Proceed.

But...you are not to under any circumstances attack these two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his finger and a picture of you and Kokoa appeared for everyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: These two are the key pieces to our plan. Leave these two to me. Anyone else....destroy them! We will begin the assault tomorrow! The resurrection of our master is neigh!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golems roared and raised their spears. The orb glowed and looked on at the scene as it chuckled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Soon I will be free and reborn. And I will be able to destroy the clan who so wrongfully destroyed my body. That accused Bloodriver clan. Hahaha. Prepare yourselves filthy vampires. Soon I'll be free and I will destroy you all! Then I can conquer Yokai and then....the world!

You wanted your room to be perfect so after school, you spent the last hour making sure your room was spic and span. You dusted, vacuumed, washed and tidied everything in your room until everything was perfect and clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew. All done. I did a pretty good job if I do say so myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around to double check if there was any spot that you missed. Then your eyes fell upon your desk. On top of it was the pictures that you took with Kokoa. When you saw them, you couldn't help, but reminisce about you and Kokoa's relationship. You remembered all the great times you both had together, the good and the bad. The time when you first met her, the time that you both got stuck in the cave, the time you went to the movies, even the times you both had at the resort, everything was precious to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): -sigh- Oh Kokoa. I love you so much. I just.....wish I could tell you the truth about me. I'm surprised she hasn't figured it out that I'm a human yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still feeling a little uneasy about Kokoa finding out that you were a human and if she found out about that, you both would probably be finished. Then you remembered what Tsukune said to you about taking your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. (name). Calm down. Like Tsukune said, I gotta take my time. I can tell Kokoa when I'm good and ready. For now (name) my man, your girlfriend's gonna be here any minute and you gotta be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a knock on the door. You knew who it was. You dressed in shorts and a t shirt and opened the door and greeted Kokoa at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hi (name). Sorry if I'm late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No worries. Come on in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off her shoes by the door and closed it behind her. She was wearing a blue blouse and a white skirt that showed off her legs. You thought she looked absolutely cute in that outfit. You led her the living room part of your dorm room which had a couch big enough for two people and it also had a screen TV that was about 40 inches wide. Perfect for a couple watching a movie together alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Glad you came. Please make yourself comfy. You need anything? Tea or juice perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Well....I would like some tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. Tea it is. Oh. By the way I was just about to put on a movie. You want any snacks to go with it? I got cookies and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oooh! I love cookies! I want some cookies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Kokoa's little kid reaction made you chuckle. You went to the kitchen and got started making some tea and getting cookies. Kokoa sat on the couch and looked around the room. She had never been to a guy's room before and she thought your room was exquisite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: So this is (name)'s room. It's a lot more tidy than I thought. I'm glad I have a boyfriend that's tidy. (sniff) Wow. This place smells great! It smells like....(name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in the kitchen, you were feeling excited and nervous at the same time as you were preparing the tea and cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK (name). Calm down. You cannot mess this up. Be a good host and be courteous. After all it's just you and her. I wonder if anything will happen tonight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you thought back to the resort where you and Kokoa first did it, which made you blush crimson red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No! Stop it! Don't be a lech (name)! But.....then again Kokoa did say she wanted to do it again sometime.....no! it's immoral! I can't be a horny dog! But....it felt so.....no! Stop it! You're being weird!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a whistling noise snapping you out of your thoughts. The tea kettle was about to blow so you quickly got it off the stove before it boiled over. After that you got some cookies and got two cups. You put them on a tray and went to the living room. Then you saw Kokoa and you nearly dropped your tray for Kokoa was.....</span></div></div>",

I'm loving your scent (name). I can't get enough of it! mmmm! It smells like.....(name). It smells sooooooo good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um.....Kokoa? What are you doing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kokoa heard your voice, she yelped in surprise and put your cushion back and pretended that she was doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Um....uh....nothing! Nothing at all! Just admiring um...ahem. I was inspecting that your room smells fine and there are no odd smells and stuff. Everything is tip top. Hahahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) sweatdrop: Um.....OK. If you say so. Anyway, I got the tea and cookies. Also you also can watch some TV if you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: All right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you sat on the couch with Kokoa next to you. You dimmed the lights and Kokoa grabbed the remote and looked through channels. Then she saw a movie that she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Alright! I'm watching this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Is it another horror movie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Not really. This one is a bit violent though. There's a lot of action fighting scenes and even a hint of romance. Wanna watch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you and Kokoa sat together and watched the movie. The movie was a little scary at first and violent, but you liked what you see so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. This movie is getting good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What did I tell you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the movie, the hero had finally defeated the villain and then the heroine jumped into his arms and hugged him. Then the hero and heroine gazed passionately into each others eyes and then they kissed. Seeing this made you and Kokoa blush bright pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I-it's a kissing scene...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah.....I forgot about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man...they're really going at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. N-no kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kissing scene continued for about 20 seconds and then it switched to the next scene. Seeing the kissing scene made you begin having thoughts of kissing Kokoa. You tried to put it out of your mind by changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So......the movie's pretty good huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Uh yeah...it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long awkward pause then a moment later, Kokoa suddenly rested her head on your shoulder. You could feel her warmth on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Umm...Kokoa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: D-don't mind me. I'm....just feeling sleepy. So......could you lend me your shoulder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): S-sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa buried her cheek in your shoulder like a puppy. Then you wrapped your arm around her and brought her closer to you. Kokoa was a little surprised at first, but she snuggled closer to you and got comfy. You could feel her body heat next to you which made your heart leap a little. Then Kokoa spoke in a timid voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Um....(name)? Do you mind if I do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): N-no. Not at all. In fact....your body feels nice.....and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Y-you too. It feels...nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa continued watching the movie in silence. Then you realized that the inside of the blanket grew a little hotter and your heart was beating a little faster. You began to get that feeling, but you kept quiet. Then you looked at Kokoa and Kokoa looked at you. You both blushed again, but this time you didn't look away. Then you spoke in a quiet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa....do you mind if.....I....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. Do what you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kokoa inched closer and closer and then.....</span></div></div>",

How the heck did the TV get so loud?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and saw how it happened. Under Kokoa's leg was the TV remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oops. Sorry. I guess I accidentally touched the remote and that's what turned it up. Hehehe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh yeah. Hehehe. How funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another long awkward pause as you two avoided making eye contact. It would seem that you two both got caught up in the moment and almost did something drastic. You didn't mind getting serious with Kokoa, but you thought about her feelings and tried to put it out of your mind. After all you wanted your relationship with Kokoa to last for a long time. Then Kokoa finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: So...um....movie's over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....yeah. I guess so. You....want to watch another?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Actually....I was wondering if I could go take a shower real quick. Then I was gonna go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....yeah. Sure. Go right ahead. Let me know if you need anything. I'll be in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: OK. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa went to take a shower. Needless to say, you were feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh crap! This is getting insane. That kiss scene made me nervous as hell! OK calm down (name). Calm down (name). Just relax. Just be calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were in the other room trying to calm yourself down, Kokoa was in the shower trying to relax herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Damn it, What am I doing? A high class vampire like me getting nervous for being in a boy's room? How pathetic. (sigh) OK Kokoa. You can do this. Just be calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Kokoa came into the room wearing her pajamas. She was wearing a yellow t shirt and blue shorts. When you saw her, you thought she was absolutely adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow! You look cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Th-thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So....you wanna sleep with me or.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I don't mind sleeping with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ok then. Night then Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Um....yeah. Night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Kokoa got into your bed and tried to get some sleep, but you couldn't. You were way too aroused to go to sleep. You tried to think about something else, but your thoughts always led back to Kokoa. Then just when you couldn't take it anymore, you heard Kokoa speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)? Are you awake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Can't get to sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: No. You too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen was a long pause, then you both began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What the heck are we doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah.

We've been acting like a pair goofs. Hahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah I know. Hahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both were silent. Then you both looked into each others eyes and then Kokoa said the question that you were longing to ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Do you...want to do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kokoa's blushing face in surprise.

You looked at her and she looked at you. Your face grew close to hers and your lips connected with hers. At first it was a small peck, but then you both were engaged in a tender loving kiss. You slipped your tongue in Kokoa's mouth and both of your tongues danced in each others mouths. You felt your cock getting hard from the kiss. Soon it was erect and felt hot. Suddenly Kokoa yelped stopping the kiss which startled you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa? What's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Something's...poking my leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What do you....oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you realized your erection was what was poking Kokoa, you immediately blushed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKokoa: Is...that your erection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah...sorry.

And why the heck is it so big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Umm...it's hard to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Are you meaning to tell me...that this was inside me the other day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reluctant to answer, but you answered with a nod. Kokoa's face turned deathly pale and she spoke in a angry/surprised tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: How could you squeeze this...thing inside someone else's body?!? I mean...what if you tore me or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't worry. The female body was designed to take a cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: But..still....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at it and then looked away in embarrassment. You couldn't help but smile from her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's OK. Go ahead and touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa reached out and hesitantly touched your dick. At first she withdrew her hand from the feel, but you pushed it forward and she was gently touching your cock. She gently used her fingers to slide long the shaft which tickled you a little. She then lightly pinched the tip with two fingers. You couldn't help but grunt in surprise from the sudden sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: S-sorry, Did I hurt you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No. It felt good actually. Ha ha. So.....how is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: It's weird. It's hard and soft at the same time. Are you sure this feels good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes. Very.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I see. So....what should I do to make it better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Looks like she's getting into it. Time for the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well....it'd feel good if you sucked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa's face blushed beet red so much, that steam came out of her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You don't have to if you don't want to...but....it'd feel awesome if you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa was silent for a moment. Then she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Okay. I'll do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively gulped. Kokoa approached your cock and took hold of it. She slowly took the base and made it vertical. Then her lips touch the tip, near your slit. You could feel her soft lips touching you. She carefully stuck out her tongue and licked your tip with her tip. The mere touch made you gasp in pleasure. Kokoa blushed in embarrassment, but she continued to slide her tongue over your cock. She slicked the tip lightly with her tongue, and then stuck it out behind the ridge. Your upper body began to shiver from the pleasure. Suddenly Kokoa's lips slid over your tip and takes your cock into her mouth. You felt her warm tongue wrap around it which made you tremble with pleasure from this new sensation. Kokoa gripped the shaft and began to move her head back and forth making your cock slide in and out of her mouth. With Kokoa moving her head in a rhythm started making nasty sounds. Then Kokoa sucked on the tip hard making you moan. Your whole body tingled like someone shocked you with electricity. Because of this being your first blowjob, you reached your limit in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa...(moan)...I'm gonna come!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Huh? What do you...? Wha! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa got away from your dick. The next minute, semen burst from your cock and hit her square in the face. Kokoa went rigid with shock as the semen went all over her face. She remained frozen in place as the cum dripped off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Wha....what is this stuff? Is this....semen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sorry...I couldn't hold back. Hold on. I'll get a tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a tissue and cleaned her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa. That was amazing. Have you done this before? You don't seem like a beginner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: No. It was my first time. And....I've read....a couple of books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I see. Hahaha. So you are a healthy young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa blushed again and looked away. Then you embraced her and lied her down on the bed and you both got undressed. Then you got on top of her pushed yourself inside her. You went easily due to your cock being covered in saliva. Kokoa gasped as you went inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: It.....it really does fit. Even though it's super big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly moved your hips making Kokoa gasp and grip the sheets. She was tight inside her, but not to tight for you to move. Then you sped up your movements making scrape her inner walls. Kokoa moaned even louder and gripped the sheets tighter. By the way she was reacting you surmised that she was feeling good, and so were you. You gave her a hard thrust and Kokoa squealed with pleasure and you went faster and harder. The more she moaned, the wetter she became. There was so much of her juices, they leaked out and stained the bed. Soon even though that you came before, you were on the brink of coming again. Kokoa was too. She moved her hips in time with yours seeking pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa.....here it comes.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you pulled out and once again, your cock exploded with semen and landed all over Kokoa. Kokoa moaned one more time as she came when your semen got all over her skin. When you finished, you embraced Kokoa and you both stay like that for a while. Then Kokoa looked at the clock. It was 12:30 at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Man. Look at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I wonder if we can get up tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa smiled and rested her head on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Don't worry. I'll wake you up. And if I don't, you wake me up. Right now. I just wanna stay like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and loved the pleasant feeling of having Kokoa in your arms. Soon you and Kokoa were fast asleep. Then the next morning....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The very next morning, everything changed. You awoke to a strange noise. It was a rumbling noise like an earthquake, but it sounded more like a marching noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the...? What is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got up which caused Kokoa to wake up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Mmm......huh? What's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa. Do you hear that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa listened and she too heard the strange rumbling. Then you both heard a commotion in the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What's going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Quick. Get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got out of bed and got dressed and Kokoa followed suit. You looked outside the room. Students were running back and forth in a panic. You heard someone yell to get ready for battle and someone yelling not to panic. Then Moka, Tsukune and the others ran up to you and Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name)! We got trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah! It's terrible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Guys what's wrong? What the heck is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. The whole school's in a panic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Well duh! The school is under attack! There's some kind of army heading this way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa and (name): What?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Come on! We'll show you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the others headed for the rooftops of the school so you all could get a good look from above. You looked the distance and saw the army of golems coming towards the school and leading the army was the mysterious figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Holy crap! What are those things?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I think those are golems. I've read about them in ancient times, but I never imagined I'd see them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Can they be stopped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Well....they're pretty weak usually, but these golems are different than the ones I was studying a while back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: There sure are a crap load of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Will we be able to stop those things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Don't worry Big Sister. I'll destroy every single one of those stupid things if I have too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'm with Kokoa. I say we get them before they get us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now hold on guys. I don't know if this is such a good idea. Maybe we should tell the Headmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: There's no time (name). We have to take action now. They're almost here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Not only that, but we have the entire school to consider. We have to make there are no casualties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: OK. Here's the plan. Moka and the others will hold off the golems while (name) and I get everyone to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka, Kokoa, Mizore, Kurumu, and Yukari: Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Tsukune. If you would please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka showed her rosary and Tsukune removed it. Moka was enveloped in a aura of bats and she emerged in her true vampire form. Then the girls went off to prepare for battle. Before they left you pulled Kokoa aside to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa. Are you gonna be OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I'll be fine. Don't worry. I'm an S class vampire. Those chunks of rocks are nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But....what if you get hurt? What if....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish, Kokoa kissed you on the lips to calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: It's OK (name). I'll be fine. Have some faith. Besides I've got Big Sister backing me up. (winks)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa left to join the other girls in battle. You couldn't help, but worry even more about Kokoa. Then you felt Tsukune's hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: It's OK (name). Kokoa and the others will be fine. They can handle themselves. I know you're worried, but you have to believe in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Come on. We gotta evacuate the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with the army, the figure was leading the army golems to the school. They grew closer and closer. As the they approached the school, the figure stopped and stood above a rock while the army marched on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave thinking: This is it. The time has come to begin the operation. Time to begin phase one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave aloud: My golem army. You have your objective! Fulfill your objective, for the sake of our master!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem army raised their spears and roared. Then the mysterious figure was about to give the command to begin the attack, but then he saw something in the in front of the school. There standing in his way were Moka and the rest of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Well, well. What have we here? It looks like we have some people who wish to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Moka and the others....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: There sure are a ton of those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Come on Kokoa. Don't tell me that you're getting scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Actually quite the opposite Big Sister. I\"m getting excited because I get to fight by your side again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Heh. I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: OK girls. It's time to kick some ass. You guys ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: You bet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. Let's kick ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Kokoa. Let's teach these rock heads to know their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the figure raised his hand and shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: ATTACK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the figure disappeared into the darkness while the army charged at the girls. The girls braced themselves and got ready to fight. Kurumu's wings, tail and her nails extended. Mizore's hands turned into ice claws and her hair turned into ice as well. Yukari readied her wand and a circle of magic cards appeared behind her. Moka and Kokoa were now emitting a powerful aura ready to fight. Then they charged at the army too. Both sides came closer and closer to each other and then the battle began!</span></div></div>",

Inner Moka jumped into a bunch of golems and they surrounded her. Then the golems were destroyed instantly thanks to one of Moka's swift kicks. Kurumu slashed every golem that came across her like swiss cheese with her swift claws. Suddenly a few of the golems came at her from above, but Kurumu extended her wings and flew out of the way just in time. Then she swooped down and slashed the golems to ribbons. Mizore used her ice claws to shatter the golems and froze for those who tried to overwhelm her. Yukari used her magic to summon washtubs and her taro cards to destory some golems. Kokoa was being attacked by five other golems with spears, but that didn't stop her. She dodged out of the way and then gave them a series of powerful kicks. The golems were destroyed instantly and turned into rubble. From the looks of things it seemed like the girls had the advantage. The problem was the amount of golems seemed endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Damn! These things are easy to beat, but there's no end to them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I know! Every time we beat a few, it's like more keep taking their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh come on! Quit complaining! These guys are nothing! We have keep fighting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: If you got time to complain, then keep fighting! I'll take blood over peace any day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I hate to say it, but they're right! We gotta keep going until we wipe this army out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with the mysterious figure, it stood by watching the fight from afar. From the looks of things, it seemed that Moka and the others haven't noticed it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Everything is going according to plan. Now while those girls are fighting the golems, it's time to make my move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious figure dashed through the army at an incredible speed. Then he dashed through the fight. The only one who saw the figure run by was Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What the....! What was that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a golem raised it's spear and prepared to attack Kokoa. Kokoa thought she was done for, but then Inner Moka leapt from out of nowhere and destroyed the golem before it had a chance to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Snap out of it Kokoa! That golem almost had you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Big Sister! I thought I saw something run by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa thinking: Was that just my imagination?

He saw you and Tskune at the front gate with many students who could overpower him but he noticed they were next to the school gateway. By activating it's protective wall when the last of them evacuate it will isolate you from the others. Slave took out a spell book and began the incantation to remotely activate the barrier. Just as the last few students were evacuated you and Tskune double checked and saw the only Kokoa and Moka were left while the others were dealing with golems outside the grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warriors, focus all your efforts on the vampires. Specifically Bloodriver's offspring.\", Slave telepathically informed his army. The golems left and were dog-piling Inner Moka. Kokoa fought them off along-side her but the force overwhelmed them. As you saw Kokoa and Inner Moka in danger you instinctively went over to help. Slave casted the spell and seperated you from the others. Kokoa tried getting rid of the golems holding Moka down but they were too strong, but then as you ran to help Slave grabbed you, and you struggled to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa glanced back as she heard your voice, her face turned into horror as she saw you in mortal danger. Kokoa went into a Vampiric fury but Slave ceased her advamce but holding your head in a position that would have him easily break your neck if she took a single step closer. \"LET HIM GO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you do something for me. Then he goes free.\", Slave said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\", Kokoa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inject him with your blood, then he lives.\", Slave replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?

Kokoa was still in shock from finding out that you were a human. She was about as motionless as a statue. She wasn't in any state to answer anyone. You tried to get free from Slave's grip, but he had a firm hold on you. Inner Moka couldn't break free either. She may be have been a vampire, but not even she can take the weight from all those golems on top of her. Then things took a turn for the worse. A golem had come out of the dog pile and was now walking toward Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa!! Get out of there! That's golem's gonna kill you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Snap out of it you fool! You'll die if you don't move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly both yours and Moka's voices fell on deaf ears. Kokoa still didn't move, no matter how loud you both yelled, You knew you had to do something because if you didn't Kokoa would die. The golem was now right behind Kokoa. It readied it's spear and prepared to strike. It seemed like it was the end for Kokoa, but then you couldn't take it anymore. You gave Slave a powerful elbow in the stomach knocking the wind out of him and forcing him to let you go. Finally being free, you ran desperately toward Kokoa determined to save her life. Everything seemed to go in slow motion. The golem raised his spear and thrusted it into Kokoa. At the last moment you jumped in the way and the spear impaled right through your body. Blood spattered on the ground and Inner Moka gaped in horror and shock at this horrific scene and Slave smiled with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Perfect. Just how I expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: (NAME)!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubled over and coughed up a lot of blood. The golem puled out it's spear and more blood gushed from your body. Inner Moka in a fit of rage finally broke free from the dog pile of golems and gunned straight for Slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: YOU BASTARD!!! I\"LL KILL YOU!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unleashed her signature roundhouse kick that had the golem's name on it. The golem shattered with a boom. Then Moka attacked all the other golems in a series of blows. Soon all the golems were nothing, but pebbles. Next Moka gunned straight for Slave, but all Moka got was air. Slave had used his magic to retreat and he was nowhere to be seen. Moka still in a rage punched a rock and reduced it to rubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: You bastard!!! Come back and face me you coward!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Inner Moka heard Slave's voice all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Hahaha! Another time Ms. Akashiya. Another time. Until then, rather than trying to defeat me, shouldn't help your human friend?  It looks like he's gonna need that blood right about now. Better hurry and tell your sister to save him. HAHAHA!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you fell over in a bloody heap unable to stand anymore. Blood oozed from your body and formed a puddle.

There's no time to get him to the nurse and Kokoa's still in shock from what Slave said. What the hell do I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka racked her brain trying to figure out what to do. Then she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Yes. There's that. His chances may be slim to none, but it's the only option I have. (name), please......live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka gently flipped you over and cradled you in her arms. At this point you were slipping into unconsciousness. You tried to keep your eyes open, but your slowly closed as everything went black.

He kneeled before the red orb once more and spoke to his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: I have come to make my report master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red orb flashed and lightning seemed to erupt from inside the tank. Then the face of Lord Saber appeared in front of Slave and his voice boomed throughout the chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Slave! Report! Did phase one of the plan go well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Yes Lord Saber. Everything went according to plan. Although we had an unexpected turn of events my lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Yes. The plan was proceeding well, I had the boy and the Shuzen girl alone and I told her that he was a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: And....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave The girl was so shocked that she couldn't inject her blood into him. So I used one of the golems to try coerce her into doing it by injuring her, but the boy jumped in the way and got himself stabbed in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that Lord Saber glared at Slave with anger and lightning bolts flashed throughout the room making Slave flinch in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Saber: You fool! You better not have killed him! He's the only thing that can free me from my prison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Please Lord Saber! I'm not finished! It's true that the Shuzen girl didn't inject him with her blood, but someone else did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Saber: Someone else injected the boy with blood? Who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: The Shuzen girl's elder sister. She goes by the name of Moka Akashiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Saber: Moka Akashiya? Are you sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Yes my lord. I saw her do it with my own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Saber was silent. Then he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Saber: Hahaha! This is perfect. Even better than I hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: What do you mean my lord?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Saber: Don't you see? That girl is an Akashiya. Her vampire blood is ten times more powerful than that Shuzen's girls is. In fact, her blood may be the perfect thing suitable for my new body. You have done well Slave, even if it was an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Thank you my lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Slave: Now then. Proceed with phase two. Do not fail me. Is that understood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Yes my lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Slave disappeared into the darkness.

One was a letter and the other was the keychain that you gave to Kokoa on your first date. The letter said only said these words. \"I'm sorry. Don't look for me.\" You stared at the letter in shock and we're at a complete loss for words. That letter could only mean one thing.

You wanted her with you again. You were willing to do anything to see her and make her love you again, but you didn't know how to.

It was only just a suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave then put the key chain on the desk next to you and began walking out of the room. You looked at the key chain and thought about Slave's offer.

OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Guess we should keep looking then,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: In the meantime, I'm gonna go check on (name) to see of how he's holding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu, Mizore, and Yukari went back to search some more, Tsukune was about to follow suit, but Moka stopped him by grabbing his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Tsukune. Come with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: But Moka weren't we gonna look for Kokoa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: We are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Wait a minute.

Back with Yukari, she was on her way back to your room to try and comfort you. Or at least try to cheer you up. Before she went to your room she bought a canned tea to make you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I just hope (name) likes peach tea.

Then footprints began appearing on the floor. It looked like something from a crime scene in a detective show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yukari what are you doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I'm using a spell to show the footprints in the room. If someone really kidnapped (name), we'll find their footprints here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I get it. That's a pretty smart trick kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: But how will we know which foot prints are which? There's a ton of them in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Don't worry. My wand can also detect which footprints are a friend's and which one's are an enemy's. So if someone came in here we'll find their footprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari let her wand hover around the footprints. Most of the footprints were their own footprints and a few were the nurses, but then Yukari's wand began to glow and then the footprint it was on changed from blue to green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Aha! My wand got something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Really?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen other footprints that were just like the one Yukari found began changing colors as well. The footprints lead across the room and led out the window to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Oh no. It's just as we feared. Someone took (name).

Are you sure you know where Kokoa is? I doubt that she would come over here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Like I said Tsukune. It's sisterly instinct. Just trust me on this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: OK. Whatever you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a colony of bats flew past them. As they flew by, something hard and metal landed on Tsukune's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Ow! What the...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Tsukune? What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: It's nothing. Something just landed on my head that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune to see what hit him. To his surprise, there lying next to him on the ground was a can of tomato juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What the...? Moka! Look what fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune picked up the can and showed it to Moka. When she saw it, she raised one of her eyebrows in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: A can of tomato juice? Where did this come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: I don't know. This landed on my head when that colony bats flew by earlier. I wonder where that came from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune and Moka looked around to see where it the can came from. Then Moka saw something. There was a bat flying in the sky, but it was carrying a bag full of something. It was a miracle that the bat even high in the sky carrying the bag. Inner Moka. When Tsukune saw the bat as well, he nearly fell in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What the heck?!? What kind of bat carries a bag like that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Only one bat I know. Tsukune, Get ready to catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Wait. Moka what are you....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Moka gave a powerful kick. The air pressure came straight at the bat and scored a direct hit. The bat lost control and began losing altitude. It tried to stay in the air, but the bag was too heavy. Tsukune immediately ran toward the bag with his hands open. The bag and the bat fell closer and closer until Tsukune managed to catch the bag and the bat landed right on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Whew. That was close. Moka what the heck did you do that for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Because that bat is going to help find Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Why is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka then grabbed the bat and when Tsukune saw the bat he gasped in surprise. For the bat turned out to be Kokoa's faithful friend, Ko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: OW! Hey! What's the big idea whee?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What the....! Ko?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Huh? Mister Tsukune? What are you doing here whee?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: We should be asking you that bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Moka's voice made Ko jump. Then he turned around. As soon as he saw Moka's intimidating face, he began to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Oh crap! It's MIss Moka wheeee!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune then looked at the bag to find that the bag was filled with cans of tomato juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Ko. What are doing with all these cans of tomato juice? And shouldn't you be with Kokoa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Oh! Um.....you see.....uh......I was uh.....going on a trip! Yeah! That's it! Whee! I was going on a trip away from Koka and I needed all these cans for the trip whee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: You expect us to believe that crap? You're Kokoa's faithful servant. You wouldn't take a trip away from Koka if she gave you one. Not to mention that you're carrying tomato juice. It wouldn't happen to be for Kokoa would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Um.....uh.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Ko listen. We're looking for Kokoa. We can't find her anywhere. If know anything about where she is, please tell us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Umm.....I don't what you're talking about whee. I don't know anything whee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka gave Ko a deadly glare. It was so terrifying that it would even a tough monster crack under pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: You're a crappy liar. You know where she is don't you? If you don't tell us right now, I'll gut you and turned you into a stuffed animal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: OK! OK! I'll talk! I'll talk! I know where Kokoa is! Just please don't kill me whee!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Ko led Moka and Tsukune past the cliff where it was looking to the ocean. They walked down a path next to the cliff and followed the path until it lead to a cave that was below the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: What is this place? I don't remember this being here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Is this a cave that leads to a secret passage to the school catacombs whee.

This is a good opportunity to that bastard. When I find him, I'm gonna teach him to know his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tsukune and the others could stop her, Moka went deeper into the cave and followed the golems. Soon the golems led them to the deepest part of the cave which was in the school catacombs. Moka and the others were now in the hideout of Lord Saber. There was a gathering of golems and not only that, but there was some monsters there as well. They hid behind a tall stalagmite so they wouldn't be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Oh man.

Isn't that the name of yours and Kokoa's mother Moka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yes, but why does he have grudge against our mother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka said nothing. She was trying to listen in on what else that Lord Saber was saying. Suddenly a magic window appeared and Slave face appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey! It's that guy from before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Slave: Slave? What news do you bring to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: My Lord. I have successfully captured the target. I am on my way back as we speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Slave: Were you seen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: No my lord. I was able to knock him out and no one saw me. I also took the secret route back to the catacombs so they wouldn't suspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Slave: Very good my slave. Now hurry back. We'll commence the ceremony as soon as you get here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Yes my lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window disappeared and Lord Slave spoke to his monster army once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Slave: Now my monster army!

Take out those golems before they alert the others!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Right big sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Kokoa and and Moka were about to attack, suddenly something slashed the golems each in two in an instant. Then they heard a flapping of wings and saw a familiar figure flying towards them and landed in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Geez it's about time I found you guys! And you found Kokoa too. Awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Kurumu! How did you find us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Well, it's a long story. Wait hold on, Kokoa. There's something I need to tell you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Tell it later. Right now we have to get out of here! Let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Big sister? What's wrong? You're acting weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: I'll explain later. We have to get going right now! Those golems are probably all aware of us being here by now. If we stay here, we won't stand a chance against them. We have to regroup! Move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone else could ask any more, Moka ran straight ahead using her powerful vampire speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey! Moka! Hold on! What's with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: I don't know, but she is right. We have to regroup at Yokai and plan our next move. Come on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone ran back toward Yokai before more golems showed up. Meanwhile back in the cave, Saber was smiling to himself. What Tsukune and the others didn't know about was that Saber was already aware of their presence. He just pretended not to notice. The golems were about to go and deal with them, but Saber stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: No my loyal servants. Don't pursue them. Let them go. When they come back, it'll be too late. Soon I will be reborn and not even those accursed vampires will be able to stop me and my revenge will be complete!

You're usually never the type of person to run away from a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. That's like you at all big sister! What's going on?

To be honest, I know who Saber is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: You do? How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: I've heard stories throughout my family back when I was little. At first I thought it was just rumors, but I never thought those rumors would turn out to be true. The story was that a few years ago, Saber was an a major enemy to my family. Especially to my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Your real mother big sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Yes. It was when your father and my mother met Kokoa. When they met, she made a few enemies. Saber was one of those enemies. He never approved of Father and Mother being together ever since he saw her. He vowed that he would rid of her no matter what. Due to his hatred toward my mother, Father kicked him out of the house. Saber enraged waged war with the Shuzen house. They both clashed and it was a never ending battle, but Father and Mother proved superior in power and utterly defeated Saber. After he was defeated, Saber was then banished from the family. But Saber swore revenge. Somehow, someway, he would come back and take his revenge and destroy the vampire race. Then to make sure that Saber would never wage war with our family again, Father had his body destroyed and had his soul sealed inside a red orb never to be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: So Saber was an old enemy of your family huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: How come I didn't know about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Mother and Father didn't you and our sisters to worry so they kept quiet about it. I only found out because I happened to overhear from different members of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: So how the heck did Saber get into the catacombs of the school anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: I don't know. Someone must have found the gem where he was sealed in and brought to the school. My guess is that puppet master who made those golems attack the school was the one that found it. I do know this. If Saber is resurrected, we're in for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: But big sis, Father sealed him inside that gem thing. There's no way that he can be brought back right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Unfortunately, there is a way. You see, Saber can resurrected through one way. He has to take over a human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune and Kokoa: A human body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu froze. As soon as she heard the words \":human body\" your face immediately came into her mind. She soon realized the reason why of your disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu thinking: Oh no......it can't be......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Kurumu what's wrong? Your face looks pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: In fact, didn't you have something to tell us before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Well.......uh....you see....I....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Actually Kurumu, I wanted to ask you Kurumu, Now that I think about it, do you know where (name) is?

Then she rushed toward Kurumu and began to shake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Kurumu! Please tell me you're joking?!? Tell me you're joking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: How could I joke about something like that? I'm telling you, (name)'s been kidnapped. I'm sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa gasped and then she sank to her knees and pounded the floor in anger and sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: No! No, no, no! It can't be! He can't be gone! He just can't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: How did this happen? When did it happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I don't know. When we split up, Yukari was gonna heading back to (name)'s room to cheer him up while me and Mizore looked for Kokoa some more. After that we decided to head back to (name)'s room to check up on him. When we came into the room, all we found was this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu dug into her pocket and pulled out the keychain that you had given Kokoa. When Kokoa saw it, she hugged to her chest and began to cry a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I'm sorry Kokoa. But if it helps any, Mizore and Yukari are looking for him as we speak. Yukari found some foot prints in the room and they're following them to find (name) and whoever took him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: It's my fault. It's my fault that (name)'s gone. If I hadn't done the stupid thing and let my vampire pride force me to break up with him, none of this would have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka then wrapped her arms around Kokoa and embraced her in a tender hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Don't be stupid. This is no time to be blaming yourself. No one could have predicted something like this could happen. We'll find him. So don't cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: -sniff- Thanks big sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Do you have any idea who took him if he was kidnapped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No idea. Your guess is about as good as mine. We won't know til Yukari and Mizore get back here. I haven't seen them since I left to find you guys. Let's just hope that they make it back soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. I just hope that they're okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they all heard a very familiar voice. When they heard, they looked to see two very familiar faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Aw thanks Tsukune. Glad you were worried about us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yukari! Mizore! You guys are okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Of course. Why wouldn't we be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari then saw Kokoa crying in Moka's arms and got a grasp of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: So you told her right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah. She's taking it pretty hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Did you find anything when you followed the footprints?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Even better. We saw the person who took (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this Kokoa immediately sat up and rushed at Yukari and grabbed her by the shoulders shaking her like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Where is he?!? What did he look like?!? Was he tough?!? Is (name) OK?!? Tell me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Kokoa! Take it easy! You're gonna rattle Yukari's brain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to take both Kurumu and Mizore to get Kokoa off of Yukari. After getting Kokoa to calm down, Yukari continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: From the looks of things (name) was fine, but he was knocked out. Whoever took him, wanted to make sure that he was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(flashback)<br>\r\nYukari and Mizore were following the footprints in the forest. Then they heard footsteps ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: You hear that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It sounded like it was coming from up ahead. Come on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore and Yukari followed the footsteps while keeping quiet so they wouldn't be found out. Then they caught up to the source of the footsteps. There walking ahead of them, was Slave carrying you over his shoulder like you were baggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Oh crap! That must be who kidnapped (name)! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Then let's get him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore was about to rush to Slave and rescue you, but Yukari stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Wait a sec! We can't just go rushing into this! We don't even know what we're up against!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: We can't just sit here either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Mizore I know you want to help (name), but if we just bust out there (name) might be in danger. Just wait and see what he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore didn't like waiting, but she knew that Yukari was right. Back with Slave, he shifted your weight onto his left arm and then made a sign with his right hand. A magic window of some sort appeared and in that window was the face of Saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: That must be that guy's boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: No doubt. He's definitely got that freaky evil boss vibe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Slave: Slave? What news do you bring to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: My Lord. I have successfully captured the target. I am on my way back as we speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Slave: Were you seen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: No my lord. I was able to knock him out and no one saw me. I'm also taking the secret route back to the catacombs so they won't suspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Slave: Very good my slave. Now hurry back. We'll commence the ceremony as soon as you get here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Yes my lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the window disappeared. Slave waved his hand and a magic circle appeared. The circle glowed brightly and then transformed into a portal. Slave stepped through the portal and then the portal closed.<br>\r\n(flashback ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: So the guy that kidnapped (name) was that Slave guy? You're sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes. We saw it with our own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Why? You know what's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: And who's this Saber guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: To put it simply, he's an old enemy in Moka's family that wants revenge against all the vampires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What I don't understand is why (name)? He hasn't done anything to him! It's us he wants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Maybe it's just one of those bad guy things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka who kept silent up till know was trying to figure out Saber's plan. She thought about Saber, then Slave and then about you. Suddenly, it all clicked in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: No.....he wouldn't....he just couldn't....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Moka what is it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: I think I figured out what Slave is up to and it's not gonna be pretty unless we stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Well what is it?

She's in her dorm room processing the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now isn't the time. She won't see anyone, talk to anyone, or even look at anyone. Totally isolated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened last thing I remember was you kissing my neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't kiss it, I bit it. (Name) forgive me but...I had to transfuse my blood into yours. It was the only way to save your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no no no no no no no no no no NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit I can't move my body and now I'm a vampire! You robbed me of my life! I'd rather have died!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka's rosary forced Inner Moka out. \"Listen buddy I did you a favor. Sure it might take some getting used to and you can't do certain things anymore but it's better your alive. And it's what you wanted, right? To be able to protect Kokoa? To not let her think your a weakling? Your one of us now and nothing will change it. The only reason you can't move your body is because my blood is coursing through your body and is changing you. You'll be back up by morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka...I'm sorry. I over reacted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph at you have the decency to admit when you've been proven wrong and apologize. Kokoa's lucky to have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if she even loves me anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's stubborn and I won't lie can be full of shit but trust me you can handle her. And you were human in the beginning, now she won't stand against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stronger than her and my blood is in your veins now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic should be playing at 2:10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuter Moka then returned and placed her hand on your forehead. \"Just take it easy and rest now.\" Her soothing and gentle voice lulled you to sleep. As you drifted off to sleep you had a dream of you and Kokoa going on your date and all the other great times you had before. Then in the middle of it all of the memories of Kokoa transitioned into having memories of things that never happened, with Inner Moka. In them you two were starting to fall in love and you two were happy. It was nice, \"Why bother?\", you thought in your dream. Then you saw Tskune and Kokoa waiting over by a bus. You waved them over and saw Slave driving the bus. You were concerned but then you saw Kokoa and Tskune waving goodbye and Kokoa left behind her key chain you gave her.They went on the bus and it was driving off into the tunnel. You saw Kokoa leave her key chain and then behind the bus Kokoa waved goodbye. Then the tunnel was morphing into something, you knew it wasn't good so you ran after them. But the bus was too fast you barley could catch up and then the tunnel morphed into a demon where the tunnel was it's mouth and the portal was it's fiery breath. You reached out to her as you ran but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the memories flashed back to the good and to when you were dying earlier today. You screamed out in desperation begging for them to come back. You kept on running but soon the bus had begun to cross through the portal. \"No!\", you yelled. The memories flashed back to when you were a kid and you went into a rage and when you attacked Yukari. the pain overwhelmed you and began to consume you. But then as the bus passed through the demon closed it's mouth and you lost them. You screamed out in depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up immediately and your eyes were blood shot red with yellow irises. Your nails long and sharp and your muscles were bigger and stronger. It was midnight and Moka and the others were already asleep but Moka woke up when she heard your growling. She came to you trying to calm you down but it was no use. You got out of bed and ripped off your shirt. The others woke up to the sound and were terrified. You couldn't speak only growl and roar, nothing of rational thought was crossing your state of mind. You jumped out the window and ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)...\", Moka said worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's he going?\", Tskune asked her. Then Moka forced Tskune to take off her rosary so that Inner Moka could handle the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Split up. Kurumu, Mizore, and Yukari you search the forest, me and Tskune will check the tunnel.\", Inner Moka ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't argue with her they just did as they were told without question.  Inner Moka grabbed Tskune and almost flew off into the night.</span></div></div>",

Your home in japan, was your sanctuary, a place where no one would harm you. You knew the way, it's been embedded in your memory by now. You rushed there but ran like an animal on all fours. You saw the tunnel, at first you were terrified because of the nightmare, but you realized it was no monster so you proceeded in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went through until you crossed over to the human world and saw the city light up. You were confused but the way home was fresh in your mind. You just wanted to go home. You leaped across the rooftops finding your home. You did your best to stay hidden, knowing it would bring harm. You stealthily hid under the cloak of night like a predator and silently scurried home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later you at last made it home. No one was around, no neighbors, no family, all quiet. You walked inside and busted the door open with your new found strength. You went up to your room, the place where you would be safe. Where you would be alone. Safe. You opened your door and in your room was the memorabilia of a time when life was simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled under your bed where you rested trying to escape and hide from everything. You don't know why. You just wanted to be left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka and Tskune finally made it to the tunnel where they hoped to cut you off but there was no sign of you. Moka looked around hoping to hear you coming but Tskune noticed a print on the ground. \"Moka look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were too late. He's already gone through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think he's headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My guess. His home. He doesn't know what he's doing, he's just acting on instinct. But he's no killer. He probably went there to hide from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Were his friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's confused. He doesn't know what to do. In fact what we just saw was his true vampire form. He's got the mind of a child like that, he needs proper guidance. We have to find him and bring him back to me so I can get through to his true form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Kokoa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until she copes with the fact that she loved a human, she can't help him. Unless she's willing to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Inner Moka called up the others and bribed the bus driver to take them through the tunnel. From there they split up to find where you were. Through their own various methods of tracking you it wouldn't be long until someone found you. Question was, was it the right people?</span></div></div>",

Tskune left the room in haste not wanting to be killed. You shrugged off Inner Moka's assault but then you looked on to Inner Moka with innocence. To you as you were in this feral vampire state she was a goddess, beautiful, empowering, perfection. You dared not attack her, so you kneeled down in awe of her. \"(Name)? Can you understand me?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't speak and could not understand her. Moka looked at you and saw how saving you was a mistake. Your eyes were devilish and your teeth were sharps a swords. She kneeled down and held her hand on your cheek. You stared at her wondering why she graced her presence toward you. \"I'm sorry for doing this to you (Name). Look what I've done to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tskune called out saying the others were coming. Moka knew the best way to subdue you was to just hold on to you until they came back. She moved your head to her heart calming you. Your blood-lust was forgotten for now. \"Shhhh it's ok. It's ok. Were going to get you help ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know why she was doing this. You heard her heartbeat. The sound was like the beat of a thousand drums. The bloodshot eyes of yours were toned down, you were starting to slowly transform back. Moka saw you transform to normal with much relief and glee, \"That's it (Name). Good. Just relax, think calm thoughts. Think of Kokoa.\", that last suggestion got a unique reaction out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feral vampire side remembered how you felt about Kokoa but now they seemed directed at Inner Moka now. Your transformed back into your feral vampire side and stared right into Inner Moka's eyes. Inner Moka was taken aback by this sudden action. You exposed your neck signaling her to bite into it. For Inner Moka this was an act that was only done by a vampire's mate. She quickly realized what you were doing. She pinned you down with one arm and sternly acknowledged two things, \"Tskune is my mate. And Kokoa is supposed to be yours (Name), I know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused why did she not bite me? Then without warning Yukari came bursting in thinking all was well. \"NO YUKARI RUN!\", Inner Moka yelled. You saw her and viciously attacked her in defense. You scratched at her face and was about to chomp her neck in one bite, but Kurumu intervened and flew into you right out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)! Look at me.\", she said sternly. Kurumu knew how dangerous you were right now and thought her charm would subdue you. You were too strong for it and tried biting right into her face. Kurumu dropped you out of fear and you fell right into a park.</span></div></div>",

But she was repulsed to see Slave being the one sneaking about. Slave was caught off guard by Kokoa's loud announcement, he ran for it knowing he couldn't stop an S-class vampire. Kokoa took a second to realize you were on Slave's back. \"YOU SON OF A BITCH GIVE ME BACK MY MAN!\", she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tackled Slave causing him to drop you to the ground.

He dodged in time to where she peeled the skin and he bled but still wasn't out of the fight. Slave kicked her in the gut and and uppercut-ed her in the jaw. Kokoa was stunned but as Slave went in to capitalize on his opening Kokoa used the reach to try and bite Slave square in the neck. She managed to bite right into it and sucked his blood ferociously. Her jaw grip was like that of a pit-bull, she would not let go unless she wanted to. Slave was in pain and felt like a chainsaw was cutting through his neck, but he grabbed Kokoa's sharp teeth and with great effort opened it wide enough for Kokoa to open release her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave blew out a garlic powder that forced Kokoa to back away and gag at the scent. Slave covered the wounds on his neck but it all went worse when you got up and saw him and Kokoa. You roared at them with your hair tingling menacingly. Kokoa saw for the first time your feral vampire form.

It's Kokoa. Your girlfriend!\", she said trying to convince you. You couldn't understand her and instead just attacked, but Kokoa was far stronger than you and knew your weakness, her. She held your arms apart and you snapped at her face with a series of threatening bites and growls. She closed her eyes and when you needed a moment to catch your breath she kissed you on the mouth. Her tongue exploring your sharp maze of teeth felt the rigid edges and strong firm structure. She leaned in more to your face and exposed her neck. Your eyes were open the whole time she kissed you, you saw her expose her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you angry and the first thought was to slit her stomach open and watch her guts pour out. But instead your hand moved upward and felt her titillating breasts. You felt calmer and Kokoa looked good, great, perfect like Moka. In the end there was one iron-clad rule to the both of you. You loved each other so much neither of you can physically harm the other out of pain or harmful intent.</span></div></div>",

I've had as much as I can take of this! I won't let her take him! Not when Lord Saber's resurrection is close at hand! I didn't want to do this, but I don't have a choice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave closed his eyes and using his powers began to mentally communicate with Saber back at the chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Lord Saber! I need your help! Lord Saber!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: What is it Slave? Surely, you have captured the boy by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Yes sir, but we have a situation. I've been spotted. By the vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Which vampire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: The girl who has mated with the boy. Kokoa Shuzen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: The sister of Moka eh? You're having trouble with her? Pathetic. Well, since we're so close to my resurrection, I suppose I'll help you. Besides, I want to see this girl face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the chambers, Saber's stone began to glow. Then Saber's spirit flowed out of the stone and headed straight toward to where you, Kokoa, and Slave were. Back with you and Kokoa, you both were still making out. You didn't what was going because you were still acting like a beast, but you felt safe being with Kokoa and Kokoa felt safe knowing that she was with you again. Suddenly, something flew right past you and Kokoa and headed right for Slave. It was Saber. You instinctively began sensing danger and began to growl. Saber circled around Slave a couple of times and then entered his body through his mouth. Slave was motionless for a second, then he opened his eyes. His eyes turned violet like and it seemed like there were cracks on the sides of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121210042035/ben10/images/e/e5/Screen_Shot_2012-12-10_at_11.12.33_AM.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What the hell?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Well, well, well. So this is the vampire who's been giving you so much trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave (in his mind): Yes my lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber then looked at you and when you two locked eyes, you began to growl and hiss like a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: And what happened to the boy? Wasn't he supposed to be human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave (in his mind): Yes my lord, but to save the boy's life from his injuries, a vampire named Moka Akashiya bit him and injected her vampire blood into him. Now he's undergoing the transformation to becoming a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Interesting. Hahaha. Even better than I hoped. Now I understand why you were having so much trouble. Fear not, I'll take care of this for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave (in his mind): Thank you my lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber slowly began walking toward you and Kokoa. Kokoa stepped in between both you and Saber, ready to protect you. Then you leaped out from behind Kokoa and attacked Saber with your fangs barred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name) no! Come back here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too late. Saber simply raised his hand and released a powerful blast of magic energy at your stomach while you were still in midair. You were sent flying to a tree and slammed into it so hard, that the tree snapped in two and fell over with a loud crash knocking you out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)! Grrrr! YOU BASTARD!!! HOW DARE YOU HURT MY (NAME)!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa using all of her vampire strength attacked Slave/Saber enraged that you were hurt. She swung and she kicked, but Slave/Saber dodged all with ease. Then Kokoa connected with a kick in the face, but Saber/Slave didn't even budge. Kokoa gaped in horror as Saber/Slave had a look disgust on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Weak. You call those attacks? Let me show you how attacks should be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave/Saber then gave Kokoa a powerful kick in the gut. It was so strong, that it almost went right through Kokoa. Kokoa gasped having the wind knocked out of her. Then Slave/Saber gave Kokoa an uppercut to the jaw, then two punches on each side of her cheeks and then one more powerful kick in the gut sending Kokoa flying to a rock. Upon impact the rock crumbled and was know nothing but rubble. Kokoa was now bloody and covered in bruises. Every part of her body rung in pain as she tried to get up. Saber/Slave seeing as Kokoa was no longer able to fight went over to you and picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave (in his mind): Well done my lord! You subdued them quite easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Save your praise. Let's back to the chambers. I can't stay in your body forever, but first....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber/Slave went over to Kokoa and stepped on her chest making her yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Hey girl. I know you're awake. I want you to give Moka Akashiya a message for me. When you see her, tell her that Saber is coming for his revenge and she will be the first on my list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Saber/Slave left. Kokoa tried to get up, but she couldn't. She could only watch as Saber/Slave carried you away. She reached to try and stop him, but she fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

The golems all crowded around your body as Slave placed you in the center near by the statue on Lord Saber's head. The water around the chamber seemed to come alive as the time drew near for Lord Saber's resurrection. Slave began casting the ritual, \"The first stone upon this prison, shall be the first key to his freedom.\", Slave took a stone from the chamber and crushed it with it's dirt and dust resting on your body. \"Payment of the follower, shall be paid in blood.\", Slave then cut his palm and let the blood drip down on your fresh bite mark from Moka. \"And the vessel of the enemy, shall be the host for the master,\", Slave came near the statue head and said, \"BREAK THESE CHAINS THAT BIND THEE!\", raising his left arm then turned back to you. \"The Master shall arise, AGAIN!\", your eyes opened with the same dark pink pigment as when Slave was possessed. You screamed in pain as you felt your soul being taken away, removed from your body and seeing nothing but darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue mouth opened releasing a black smoke that flew around the chamber. It circled the entire room until it rose to the ceiling and then nose dived into your body. The smoke hit your body and as it entered your body convulsed in reflex and rejected it. But in less then a moment it was now host to Lord Saber. Your mind and soul were gone. Lord Saber took your body and smiled in glee. \"Free at last. This body is incredible! The sister would not even come close to this! The true Akashiya girl was the perfect one to fuel this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome master.\", Slave bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have served me well Slave. To honor a bargain is one thing, but to go above the call of duty is a greater honor and yields a greater reward.\", Lord Saber said with your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hold out on me! It's time for my payment.\", Slave said wasting no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Your freedom. From the cursed fate of being a servant of Alucard. Instead you now..\", he touched Slave's forehead and Slave's body burned and suddenly his body was decaying, \"Are free from the bonds of life itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! AHHHHHHHHHHH!\", and with his last breath Slave was gone. Lord Saber's cruelty was feared. Slave's past failures and un-hasty progress left Saber to dispose of him now that he outlived his usefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warriors! March! Bring me the monsters, let me judge who will serve me to kill the Akashiya family or perish. Kill any who resist but leave the two girls to me. I will handle them personally.\"</span></div></div>",

Leave her alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber walked towards Kokoa who was still wincing in pain from getting hit in the stomach. Then Saber stepped on top of Kokoa's stomach hard making her scream in agony. Moka tried to get up, but she was still wracked with pain from being beat up. All you could do was sit and watch as Saber slowly wring out the life of Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Please.....stop......I'm begging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: How pathetic. A proud vampire like this losing all because she can't hit a boy he rejected. Pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Sc-screw you.....bastard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Hmm? Oh. So you actually the strength to speak do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You monster......give me back (name).......right now.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: Tell me something girl. Why do you care so much about this boy? He's a human, the sworn enemy of all vampires and monsters and yet you want me to give him back. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Because.....I love him..........I love him for who he is. When we first met, I'll admit it I hated him the moment I saw him. But as time went on, I started noticing how he's..........different from other boys. He was always kind and gentle......and even though he was scared at times (name) always plucked up courage and...saw through something till the end. I'll admit that......that I was a little upset when I found out that he was a human, but......I don't care anymore! It took me a while to realize it sooner, but I love him! Even if he's a human, (name) is (name)! And I love him no matter what! SO GIVE HIM BACK TO ME RIGHT NOW YOU BASTARD!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Kokoa......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa.....she.....she really does love me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your head you heard everything Kokoa said and you couldn't help, but tear up with joy and happiness. Moka who heard the whole thing smiled with pride. Suddenly Kokoa grabbed a firm hold of Saber's foot and began to force his foot off of her. You and Moka watched in surprise as Kokoa raised up Saber's foot little by little. Saber tried to step harder on her, but for some reason his foot was being pushed back by Kokoa's brute strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: What the...? How is she getting so strong all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa pushed Saber's entire body off of her and punched Saber with all of her strength and might. Her fist hit Saber square in the face a dull and loud thud and sent him flying straight into the rocks with a mighty crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): W-wow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Heh. That's my baby sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Kokoa won the fight, but then Saber stepped out of the rocks with a spectacular bruise on his right cheek. This time Saber was emitting a terrible aura and his eyes burned with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: You little shit! How dare you damage this body?!? I'll make you pay for that!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Come on then! I\"m not scared of you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber: You.....stinkin.....BIIIIIIITCH!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber charged at Kokoa ready to kill her. Moka tried to get up, but even if she did she wouldn't make it in time. Kokoa gave everything she had to throw that punch so she couldn't move. It looked like Kokoa was done for when suddenly.....</span></div></div>",

No, the light was taking shape and form. Into Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\", you said nothing. Your mind was a mess. Your feral vampire mind and normal mind were still conflicted but Saber was in control of both. You look to your right and see yourself as your Vampire side. \"Who do you see?\", your rational version asks to your vampire version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka, as her true self.\", the vampire version replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see Kokoa, also as her true self. Why do you think we see these two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we have a weakness for them. They're our mates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can set us free. But were conflicted. We have to love the same or else we can't fight Saber. Alone were broken and divided. But if we focus on them, the one that fuels our emotions, then we can expel him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. So let's agree who we both love. It's Kokoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She isn't as strong as us. Moka is. She's our ideal mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might be able to tame you, but Kokoa is always herself all the time. Moka is like us, two people split apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly why I love her. Because she's like us. That's why my love for her is real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokoa is strong. We need her single mind to help fix ours. Moka is broken like we are. Two negatives won't equal a positive. Not in this case. Moka loves Tskune, and we also love Kokoa. We'll always be in flux with ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka.....but............she's the only one who understands us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh.....I know. She'd be a great lover in another life. But face it, were better off with Kokoa. She might not know what were going through, but she's the only one who can fix us. And you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vampire version saw the image of Moka and saw her beauty. But knew that your rational mind was right. Kokoa loved you and will always be there for you. Moka's heart already belonged to Tskune. There wasn't any point in drawing it out hoping there might be a chance. \"Goodbye. Moka.\", then the image of Moka disappeared and reformed into Kokoa. As soon as it did your vampire version went from sad to almost complete joy. When he saw how special Kokoa was for him he knew she was the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was whole and strong enough to combat Saber's grasp but Slave still hadn't finished the spell. He needed more time to give you the opening you needed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saber fought the two vampire sisters in a ferocious slug-fest. Inner Moka was strong but combined with Saber's own spirit and your own vampire strength, Kokoa just managed to tip the scale to a full on deadlock. Slave was halfway finished the spell and Saber could feel his soul weakening. Realizing that fighting the sisters was buying Slave time he decided to stop wasting time. Kokoa tried to get a strong hit against Saber but he took advantage of her vulnerability and redirected her blow at Moka. Slave, seeing Saber gunning for him, was nearly finished and needed to chant the final verse, \"In thine unholy embrace take thine soul from out thy body and banish it to it's past state being disembodied!\", the spell was finished and Saber's soul exited your body. Saber's soul was lost and zig zagged all over the school but instead of returning to where he was trapped he entered Kokoa's body instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up and saw Kokoa possessed by Saber. \"Hmmm hmmmm hmmmeeeehehehehhee  AHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAAA! Slave...did you honestly believe I wouldn't have thought of a way to counter effect that curse in case it was used on me again? What may have worked all those years ago NO LONGER DOES!\", then Kokoa grabbed Slave by the throat and began choking him to death. \"I may have lost my ideal host, but this one will do nicely. She's got much more potential than I imagined. Even arguably stronger than (Name) and Bloodriver's offspring. Given time I'll be more powerful then I thought possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen inside Kokoa's head she resisted Saber's influence. \"GET OUT OF MY HEAD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop struggling. You don't have what it takes to break free of MY will. And you never will.\", Saber mentally replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sick of your bullshit! GIVE ME BACK MY BODY!\", Kokoa's resistance was so strong Saber released his grip on Slave's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! I'm not letting you expelling me from this body! I've waited years to exact my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! JUST GIVE ME MY BODY BACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen outside her mind Kokoa's body began spazzing out and convulsing. Inner Moka and you came to her and tried to calm her down. \"What's happening?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokoa's fighting but I think it'll tear her own body apart. Their too evenly matched that it'll kill them both. You have to go in and help Kokoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\", you laid next to Kokoa and Inner Moka allowed your mind to enter Kokoa's, you saw Saber and Kokoa fighting and it was incredible by both how strong she was and how relentless the two opponents were. You called out to her and yelled, \"Kokoa!\", she turned and saw you she paused in the middle of the fight, but time froze for a moment as you were the embodiment of everything to her. \"(Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck him up.\", you simply said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boost in confidence gave her the edge to expel Saber. \"The only one who get to roaming around in my head and mess with my body, is that lying little handsome scumbag that I absolutely adore!\", and with that she over powered Saber to his disbelief and she tossed him right out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber's spirit escaped Kokoa's body and tried escaping the school grounds entirely but Inner Moka had other plans. She had Tskune take off her Rosary and Slave used the spell to trap him inside it. The force was so great that Saber couldn't pull away. His spirit was now trapped inside Moka's own rosary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you like it here.\", she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! How can this be! I can't bend your body to my will!\", Saber questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother gave me this rosary. She not only made this to seal my true form but in case I needed to seal you. And without a host to keep your spirit alive in just a very short time your life is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloodriver! Slave! (NAME)! I will not be beaten like this! THIS WAS NOT HOW I WOULD RETURN! RELEASE ME! I AM LORD SABER!\", in just a mere minute his spirit began dying within the rosary. After a generation Lord Saber's madness was put to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Inner Moka left and reverted back to her outter form she glared down at Slave. Where does this leave you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today my debt is repaid. I've no further business with any of you. I leave you all as your ally, but not as your friend.\", Slave walked into the woods and faded into the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune saw as you and Kokoa both woke up. Your body finally began to fully return to normal as a human being. Your feral side was tired and needed to rest. It was over now.</span></div></div>",

For that alone you are going to suffer like no mortal on earth ever has in the history of history.\" You sweated buckets and was terrified by what she had in store, \"Your punishment is to become my lover for all eternity, including becoming my husband, and exclusive mate. From now on the only woman in your life will be me and me alone. Breaking away from me will result in death by cremation, water, or 1,000 steaks stabbing your heart.

I'll never reject you ever again.\", she kissed you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't disappoint.\", you said after you broke away from her loving assault.</span></div></div>",

Kokoa and Moka both decided to come with you and Tskune to the human world and stay with you guys for the summer in your respective homes. This meant you were going to show your vampire girlfriend to your folks and younger sibling. However their approval was the least of your worries, Kokoa's temper was what scarred you. You were riding the bus to your home when  Kokoa became excited to see your home and family. \"(Name) what's it going to be like? Is it huge?! And are your parents rich? They must have a bunch of fancy and sophisticated stuff.\", then as soon as you reached your stop Kokoa saw for herself your house. \"WHAT A DUMP! I mean... uh.... it's nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's not what your used to but it's fair enough. Looks like nobody's home, we'll just settle in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I was worried your folks heard me for a moment. Meantime while we settle down I'm hitting the showers, that bus reaked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto, I'll hit it after you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's stopping you from taking one with me? C'mon we've seen each other naked in the past so why be so restrictive now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case my parents or sister come back while were in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh good point.\", you finally unlocked the door and placed your belongings in your room. Kokoa placed her stuff in your bed and hit the showers just like she said. She got in the bathroom and looked herself in the mirror thinking about how much better things are now. \"Sigh....(Name) is almost acting like nothing happened. Maybe it's for the best, I liked how things were before the incident. Hmm he's taking a big risk by bringing me here when I know how much this is making him nervous. But I guess after that Saber thing, nothing can get him that wound up.\", she closed the door and got undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a sleeping bag for Kokoa to use and placed it in your room. When everything was all set up, you sat down and thought about what Kokoa was thinking of you. \"Hmmm I wonder, is Kokoa still with me cuz now I'm a vampire or because nothing changed? Ugh that is stupid to think that way. What she said to me after Sabers death proves...ugh I know she'll get mad but I should ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the bathroom but knocked first. \"Hey Kokoa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? I'm not dressed right now so if your uncomfortable seeing me like this right now don't come in.\", she said courteously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering, and I know you'll think I'm stupid, but are you with me because I'm a vampire now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) you being a vampire had nothing to do with me wanting to be with you. I learned looking back, I loved you because of how different you were from all the other monsters. It wasn't what type you were that made me like you, in fact if you turned to be a disgusting blob monster I'd have loved you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I just wondered, cuz a lot happened after last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome to prove you love me by joining me.\"</span></div></div>",

The first part was letting you both get a feel for the water. You hugged each other closely and took turns getting the full blast of the water. You could feel your member getting hard but you tried to not get too excited. Kokoa giggled as she knew this was making you feel good. But she restrained herself and turned away from you while handing you the soap. You took it and rubbed it over your hands, you then washed her back gently. You got to her rear and tried your best not to do anything provocative. Instead you rubbed the soap over it as fast as you could. Kokoa felt disappointed almost but had a better idea in mind. Soon as you finished you gave her the soap so she could get her front, but she grabbed your arm and had you rub the soap over her breasts. Kokoa enjoyed the feel of you scrubbing her body and finally she took the soap and finished up. Then it was her turn to wash you. You stood still while she rubbed your back with the soap but then she tapped your butt to your surprise. You smiled at her playful manner and said, \"Keep that up and we may be in here longer than we need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we could.

Let me say hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out your vampire form and then your eyes were red and your fangs grew out. \"Thanks, couldn't take it anymore with this guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), if that's what you want to be called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have had a different mind as him at first but now were more on the same page.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You in your vampire form pounced at Kokoa and locked your lips with hers in a passionate make out session. Both of your tongues fought for dominance, lashing at each other trying to show who was in control. At first Kokoa was assumed to be in charge, but you forced your tongue deeper into her mouth and squeezed Kokoa's butt, making the kiss more pleasurable. Kokoa's eyes rolled back and the pleasure was so overwhelming, that she had no choice to let surrender to your dominance. Then you both separated with a string of spit connecting your mouths. Kokoa looked at you with a lustful expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Holy crap....I underestimated you. You're quite the kisser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: I'm just getting started Kokoa baby. Just you wait. When I'm done, you're gonna be screaming my name like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you went on the attack again. This time you got behind Kokoa and grabbed her breasts from behind. You squeezed and kneaded her breasts making them change shape in your hands. Kokoa looked at what was happening to her breasts with her eyes half glazed and her face as red as her hair. The pleasure was so intense that she began to lose her track of mind. Her mind was nothing, but a blank and she couldn't think at all. Her breathing was ragged and her body trembled like a leaf. You smiled with a mischievous glint in your eye as you continued your assault on Kokoa's breasts. Then you gave both of Kokoa's nipples a pinch and pulled on them slightly. This made Kokoa let out a seductive moan. The pleasure was so good to her, that she almost came right on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire thinking: Well, well. Looks like she's got quite a sensitive body. Hmm. I wonder if she's sensitive down here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as you continued to attack her breasts, you snaked your arm around her hip and placed your hand right on top of her delicate place. Kokoa defensively tried to stop by grabbing your arm and tried to push it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Wait! Hold it! If you go for that spot, I'll go crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Vampire: That's the idea. I'm interested in your body because it is quite sensitive. Now I wanna see just how sensitive it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you gently began to rub Kokoa's flower making her give a sharp but pleasurable yelp. Pleased with her reactions you inserted one finger inside of her making a squelching noise. Then you moved your finger around inside her in circles making your finger feel everywhere inside. Kokoa's eyes widened as she felt this new foreign object inside her and herself getting wet from the stimulus. Her moans grew louder and insides grew hot with desire. They felt so hot that you felt that your fingers were gonna burn off. The shivering in Kokoa's body began to intensify as the rubbing from your finger made her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (moan)! Wait! (gasp) I'm gonna come! I'm gonna come!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh I'm sorry. I guess I got carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took out your finger and stopped rubbing Kokoa's breasts. Kokoa sank to her knees feeling dazed from all the pleasure. Kokoa was relieved that you stopped, but at the same time she was disappointed that you stopped pleasuring her. She expected this to be the end of your teasing, but she couldn't have been more wrong. For while she was sitting you had somehow lied on the floor and slipped your head underneath her. Your face was now face to face with Kokoa's flower much to her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Wha.....!!! What the hell are you doing?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well, I thought it would be boring for you to come that way, so I thought that I could make you come like this instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hold on! You're not gonna.....(moan)!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kokoa could protest, you buried your face in her precious place and began lick her folds. Kokoa moaned loud in pleasure as the pleasure shocked her like a bolt of lightning. She subconsciously placed her hands on your head, pushing your head close to her flower wanting more. You meanwhile opened up her folds and inserted your tongue inside her. Kokoa's body became warm, her breathing became even more ragged, and her body began to tremble more violently. Her eyes squeezed shut and her face was contorted with pleasure. You smiled with glee seeing how your tongue work was making Kokoa feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Hehe. She's is so cute when she's feeling good. I wonder how cute she'd be if I make her come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to take it up to an extreme turn by sucking at her most sensitive spot. Her clit. Kokoa began to moan even louder and pressed your head even harder against her. Kokoa was feeling so much pleasure, that she felt like she was gonna come any second. She tried her hardest to endure, but she wouldn't last much longer. You weren't gonna let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Trying to endure eh? Let's see how you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you bit on Kokoa's clit gently, but hard. Kokoa's eyes snapped open and she let out a loud scream. Her flower exploded with nectar as she came all over your face. You tried to lick up all the juices, but there was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Wow Kokoa. I guess you're a squirter. Hehe. The way you came was so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa said nothing, but then she snapped out of her daze and grabbed a hold of your rock hard member. She had a look of lust and revenge on her face wanting payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: OK big boy. You had your fun. Now it's my turn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped your shaft and to took it her mouth sucking hard making dirty noises. You gasped in surprise as Kokoa was now on the attack. She bobbed her head up and down eager to make you cum. You instinctively petted her head as she gave you this incredible blowjob. You couldn't help, but hiss and groan as you felt yourself getting closer and closer to coming very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Holyyyy shit! I gotta say Kokoa.......you're very good at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Offf courff! dob unbereshivate me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell what Kokoa was saying because she was sucking you, but you were pretty sure that she was saying not to underestimate her. She then began bobbing her head even faster and the pleasure intensified inside you. It was so intense that you couldn't hold it in anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Oh crap! Here it comes Kokoa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you came. Your seed exploded in her mouth and filled it. Kokoa was surprised, but her mouth was still latched on your member. She took every drop that came out and swallowed it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (gulp) How was that? Didn't expect that did you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: I'm must admit. You did well. But now it's time for the main event!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, you pounced on Kokoa again. This time you pushed your rod inside her all the way up to the root. Then you began to pound her like crazy. Kokoa moans at this point were now screams and her body completely was under your member power. As you pounded her, you felt yourself go deeper and deeper inside her. Kokoa wrapped her arms around your neck and her legs around your waist desperate at hanging on and wanting more pleasure. Then you both locked lips in a deep kiss as you continued thrusting. Your tongues danced and writhed in each others mouths as you both grew closer and closer to coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Kokoa.....I'm gonna come.....I'm gonna come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (moan)!!! (name)! (name)!!! You're so good!!! SO GOOD!!! MORE!! MORE!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Vampire: Hehehe! You asked for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Kokoa's request you thursted even harder and faster. You were going so fast and hard, that your member was like a jackhammer. Kokoa held on to you tighter. So tight in fact that she clawed at your back leaving red marks. Her breasts were bouncing like crazy and she as well as you were on the brink of coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)!!! I'm gonna come!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Kokoa!! If you hang on to me that tightly........I'm gonna come inside you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I don't care!!! Give me everything you've got (name)!!! MAKE ME COME!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you couldn't hold it in anymore. You gave Kokoa one more powerful thrust and you exploded with your seed inside of her. Kokoa let out an animalic scream and she came too. You pulled out of Kokoa and your seed began oozing out of her. Kokoa still backing in the afterglow slumped to the floor catching her breath. Then later you both soaked in the bath and rested before getting out. Your vampire side was exhausted from all the sex so you had returned to your normal self. You felt a little bad after coming inside Kokoa so you instinctively apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....Kokoa. I'm.....sorry for coming inside you.....well technically I didn't, but still I'm mpph....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa silenced you by placing two fingers in your lips. Then she nuzzled in your chest making you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name) You worry too much. You have nothing to apologize for. Besides I never would have imagined that your vampire side was so wild. I'm in love with you even more now. Hehe. Besides I've always wanted to have your baby. And now I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were touched by Kokoa's words that you couldn't help, but hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I love you Kokoa. I love you always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa hugged you back and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: I love you too (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Kept you waiting huh?!\", sprang out Moka and Tskune. They were thankfully in the front entrance but this made you and Kokoa internally freak out. You rushed to get some cloths on while you threw Kokoa's bag in the bathroom. You managed to get on some pants but you were still soaked from the shower. Tskune came up wondering what the noise was coming from. He noticed you and assumed you were alone. \"Oh hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tskune...please tell me why your in my house?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka insisted we surprise you and Kokoa. We won't be here all summer with you two, just for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, you caught me at a bad time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I notice, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka came up and saw you shirtless carrying her and Tskune's bags. \"Oh sorry. Did we come at a bad time?\", outter Moka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Where is Kokoa anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out getting food. House needs to get restocked on snacks and stuff you know.\", you tried covering up the fact you and her were just in the bathroom together, which you manage to pull off. Until Kokoa screamed in pain. Hearing it you immediately bolted for the bathroom to Moka and Tskune's confusion. Kokoa's skin was burning and her body steamed. You had no clue why this was, but Moka walked in and noticed what was wrong. She grabbed a bottle of lotion from her bag and rubbed it on her face, and legs. She poured out more and said to help and rub it over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO IT!\",you did as she said, right now you had no clue if she knew you two had sex or not but Moka's concern was on her sister right now. \"Tskune shut the door!\", she raised her voice out of stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Moka rubbed the lotion all across her body and finally Kokoa calmed down. Soon as you all caught your breaths Moka asked what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis, I must have forgot to put on enough lotion when I went in the shower. I feel aching all over, and I feel hot for the wrong reasons.\", Kokoa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your probably going to feel sick for a while so that the water in your body is out your system. Just relax and we'll get you in a bed.\", Moka reassured. You and Moka walked out but soon as she closed the door Moka grabbed you by the shirt collar and transformed into her inner self. \"You ass-wipe.\", she coldy threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked thinking she was mad about Kokoa getting sick now but it was for the other logical reason. \"You lied about her cuz you and her did it just now in the shower didn't you? You think I'm that stupid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm actually impressed, she didn't put on enough of that lotion for her skin, she literally willed her body to go through with it. Rare does a vampire resist water. Only one has ever managed to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, one time with Tskune. That little incident proved how tough she is, and how that sister of mine loves you. So treat her like royalty the entire time she gets back up from that. But don't tell her I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes maa'm.\", for some reason your vampire half came out almost wanting to see Inner Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know for a half vampire, your cute.\", Inner Moka flirted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are borderline sexy.\", your vampire form replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, don't go flirting with me cuz I got a man already. But thanks for the compliment.\", she said walking down to be with Tskune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you come out just now?\", you asked in your head communicating with your vampire self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see her, and see how I looked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought we agreed that Kokoa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I still think Moka is a goddess. She made me, so I couldn't help it. I won't try and steal her away or anything, love her enough to let her be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey just one thing and you better do it cuz if you don't I'll rid myself of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do it next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehhehehehee. Deal.\"</span></div></div>",

Being careful not to wake her, you lifted her up and carried Kokoa back to your room so she could get some rest. You gently set her down on the bed and put a blanket over her so she wouldn't feel chilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew. At least she's feeling better. It was a good thing Moka showed up when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat next to the bed and looked at Kokoa's sleeping face. She looked so peaceful and innocent that your heart jumped a few paces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Now that I think about it, I've never seen Kokoa sleep so soundly before. She's looks really cute. Hahaha. I can't believe she pushed herself just to make love with me. She must really love me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered what Inner Moka said about treating Kokoa like royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't you worry Moka. I promise. I'll take good care of her. You can count on me. I'll look out of Kokoa no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched over Kokoa sleeping for little while longer and then she slowly began to wake up. She let out a cute yawn and rubbed the sleepiness out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh you're finally awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: -yawn- (name)? What's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You're in my room. You fell asleep in the bathroom. Listen Kokoa, I want to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Apologize? What for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): For.....you know. Doing it in the shower thing. Here I am letting my vampire side out and doing it with you knowing that you were weak in water. It was my fault that you got sick, and I wanted to say I'm sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bowed Kokoa to emphasize your apology. Kokoa was silent. Then she got up and gave you a very gentle hug and a kiss on your lips making your heart jump in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You really do talk too much (name). You know that? It's OK. Besides, I was one who didn't put on enough lotion and I should've told you about it sooner. Also I wanted to do it. I would do anything for you, even if it meant causing me pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really? You'd really go that far for me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yes. I would. Because I love you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Kokoa's words definitely strung a few strings in your heart. You couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thank you Kokoa. You truly are too good for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Of course. So you'd better be grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know. I know. I am grateful. Thank you Kokoa. For everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Anytime. Hahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both smiled at each other and you gave each other a loving hug and kiss. You were feeling so happy, you felt that there was nothing that could make you happier. Then you noticed that the whole time, Kokoa was still naked. You immediately blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)? What's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Umm......Kokoa......you do realize that you're still naked right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa looked at herself and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. So?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait a sec. Shouldn't you be screaming, \"Eeek!!! Don't look at me you pervert!\" or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah, but we're a couple aren't we? You've seen me naked more than one occasion anyway. I don't mind. You can look at me any time you want. Well, as long as it's you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Kokoa made you blush beet red and you began to have a little nosebleed. You also began to get a hard on much to your embarrassment. You quickly bent over and you turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)? Are you OK? You look like you're in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Nope! I'm OK. Hehehehe. Don't worry. I'm just peachy! Hahahaha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn it! Think unsexy thoughts, think unsexy thoughts, think unsexy thoughts! Man! Why does my body always gotta act pervy on it's own?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard the voice of your vampire side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Because your body knows what it wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh crap! Not you again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Oh come on! You know you want to do her! You're still pent up from before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Are you for real? Come on! Kokoa just barely recovered from before! I can't take advantage of her in this situation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Oh don't be such a wet blanket! 'Sides chicks love it when you do them on the rebound. Especially the ones that say they'll do anything for you. You know you want to. We do share the same body remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Grrr!! Shut up will you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (name)? Are you sure you're fine? You seem to be acting weirder than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well......I......uh......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) vampire: Come on man! Do it! Do it! You're dying too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'd wish you'd shut up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right about one thing. Seeing Kokoa stark naked in your room was getting you turned on. Part of you wanted to do it with her again, but another part of you told you you couldn't because you had to respect Kokoa's feelings. Plus you didn't want her to think that you were a pervert. Well, more than what you already were. You tried to think about something else, but Kokoa's naked body came popping back in your mind. Then......</span></div></div>",

You know, given that reputation you had back in your old school, I was worried that you wouldn't make any friends there. But I guess I was worrying over nothing. Moka. Tsukune. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. Please continue to take care of my son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your father bowed his head to Moka and Tsukune to show his appreciation. Moka and Tsukune couldn't help, but feel a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Aww. Don't worry about it Scott. It's nothing really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yes. We're glad to have (name) as a friend and we'll always be there for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aww you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Aww, what good kids. By the way, (name) there's something I have to ask you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What is it Dad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Give it to me straight to me son. Is Moka your girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name), Moka, and Tsukune: WHAT?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your father's question made you and Tsukune face-fault to the ground while Moka blushed a very deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wh-what did you say Dad?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: I said is Moka your girlfriend? Come on. You don't have to hide anything from your old man. You can tell me. Besides, I can tell Moka's quite the cutie if I do say so myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Wait, hold on Mr. Scott. You got it all wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. Moka's my girlfriend. So you're half right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Oh come on Tsukune, you don't need to cover my son. I can tell that he's dating Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Dad! Your totally got the wrong idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

When Moka, Tsukune, and Kokoa saw the giant stack of croquettes they were a little surprised of how much food there was. You however were drooling and ready to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): All right Mom! You made your famous croquettes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Oh yeah! I've been looking forward to this all day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Oh you two. You're both too kind. Now then, I've made plenty of food so eat all you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: Thank you for the food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone dug in and started eating. You, your father, and your mother snarfed down the food like there was no tomorrow while Kokoa, Moka, and Tsukune watched you all eat in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Whoa....talk about no class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Wow......they sure love to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Are the croquettes really that good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsukune took one of the croquettes and took a bite. His eyes went wide and he looked like he was struck by lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Th-this is........the is incredible!!!!! This is a masterpiece!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsukune stuffed his face with three or two croquettes and began to eat as fast as you and your parents. Moka seeing Tsukune decided to try one too. When she took a bite she had the exact same reaction as Tsukune did. Her pink hair almost stood up on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh my gosh! He's right! These croquettes are wonderful! Kokoa you have to try this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Um....Big Sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa was a little freaked about everyone going crazy over the croquettes, but she gave in and decided to try one. As soon as she bit into it, her eyes turned heart shaped and her mind exploded. (not literally)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: These croquettes......they're......so good!!!!! Seriously!? Ms. (name)! What the heck did you do to make this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Oh nothing special. Just cut some meat, add some potatoes, and a few other stuff and cook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): See I told you! My mom's the best cook in japan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Yup! Not to mention that she's the best cook I've ever married!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Oh boys. Now there's plenty to eat so eat as much as you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: In that case, don't mind if I do!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone ate and ate until there was no more.</span></div></div>",

Then your parents showed some family pictures of you when you were a little kid, much to your embarrassment. At first, you wanted your parents to stop showing off your pictures, but Kokoa insisted on seeing them because she thought that you were cute as a kid. After a while, you all were having fun looking at all the photos of your childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Aww! Look! Here's (name) when he was 6! Oh he was so cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mom! Come on! You've been saying that almost every single photo of me we've looked at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: But it's true! You were such cutie and were so adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: She's right you know.  You do look cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: You know, seeing (name)'s photo's make me want to see your photos Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Uh... yeah! Yeah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune blushed a bright shade of pink. You figured that he had some embarrassing pictures of himself as a kid as well. Then when your mom turned the page, there was photo of you grinning with a girl that was taller than you. She looked a little like you, but she looked a little younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Who's that (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's my sister, Kurumi. She and I go way back. When I was little, she and I would do anything together. But after I started middle school and went to a different school, I haven't been able to see her much. Which is why I'm excited to have her come here. I've haven't seen her in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What's your little sister like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well... I guess you can say that she's a little like you and Kokoa. At times she was kind and sweet and sometimes she's a little stubborn and bratty. Overall, she's awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Sounds like she's an awesome person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah. I'd like to meet her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Oh she'll love you Kokoa! Once you'll be best friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Yeah. You and her can talk about stuff like that goth thing you mentioned before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa nearly snapped at your father's comment, but one look from you and she kept quiet. Afterwords, your dad and your mom decided to spend some time alone together while they waited for your younger sister to come home. Tsukune and Moka decided to do the same. As for you and Kokoa, you both hung out in your room and watched a little TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): (sigh) I wonder where Kurumui is? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh don't be such a worry wart. She's fine. She's probably just running late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Say (name)? Why did I have to let your parents think that I was a goth or whatever that is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa you know why. I can't exactly tell your parents that my girlfriend is a vampire. I mean... if they found out they'd totally freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Still. I'm not a goth! What the hell is a goth anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's basically someone who likes the darker side of life and wears black and listens to metal and punk music. Or at least that's what I heard anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Sounds like my kind of thing. Maybe I should go goth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Please don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh. By the way, remember what you told me before when your dad said I was goth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you didn't know what Kokoa meant, but then you suddenly remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hmmm. Oh! Yeah... I did... But Kokoa are you sure? I mean... my sister is gonna be here any minute and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa seductively got in real close to you. So close that she was almost inches away from kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Come on. You said you'd do it just how I like it. Besides, it's just for a little while. We got plenty of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively gulped by Kokoa's advance and your heart began to beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name); OK. But just for a little while. I don't want anyone seeing us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Don't worry. We'll be fine. Besides, I've been looking forward to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you...</span></div></div>",

You and Kokoa immediately snapped out of your little moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doorbell again?\" said Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be...\" you said taking a guess as to who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both heard a voice. A voice that Kokoa didn't know, but you knew the voice instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Where are you big bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Kurumi!\" you whooped. \"She's here! She's really here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dashed out of the room and ran to the front door leaving Kokoa in the dust. When you got there, there was a girl that looked about your age. She had short blonde hair that went to her ears. Her body was athletic, her height as tall as your shoulder, her eyes were a bright blue, she wore a red tank top and a pair of blue short-shorts with a purple jacket. When you saw her, you immediately went straight to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both embraced each other in a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man Kurumi, It's so good to see you!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise Big bro,\" Kurumi replied. \"You haven't changed much either. Still got the same wishy washy face from when we were kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I haven't changed that much!\" you grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka, Tsukune, and Kokoa came to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. (name)? Is she who I think she is?\" asked Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Moka. Tsukune. Kokoa. Allow me to introduce my younger sister; Kurumi. Kurumi, these are my friends from school Moka and Tsukune, and this is my girlfriend, Kokoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice meet to you,\" said Kokoa, Moka, and Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you all as well,\" said Kurumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumi came up to Kokoa and looked intently at her. She looked at her all over as if she was inspecting something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... What are you looking at?\" asked Kokoa feeling a little creeped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>really</i> my bro's girlfriend?' asked Kurumi suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yes.\" said Kokoa uncertain to what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Moka, and Tsukune looked on wondering what was going to happen. You were gonna assume that your sister was gonna get overprotective and say something about Kokoa not being good enough or something, but the exact opposite happened. Kurumi let a out a high and loud squeal that made you want to hold your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name). You finally got yourself a girlfriend?! You sly fox! I didn't know you had it in you bro!\" she laughed giving you a hard slap on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Take it easy sis! Geez. You're just as brutal as you were when we were kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you blame me?\" said Kurumi laughing. \"My big bro's got himself a girlfriend now. I was thinking that you'd end being the 40 year old virgin with the way things happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You didn't need to bring that up!\" you said embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumi laughed again while you started pouting and sulking. Moka and Tsukune thinking that the whole thing was cute began to chuckle while Kokoa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two certainly are close,\" said Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's only natural,\" said Moka. \"They are brother and sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumi came up to Kokoa and held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there. You're Kokoa right? It's nice to meet you and thank you for taking care of my big bro. Please continue to do so. He can be a little wishy washy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's not true and you know it!\" you said indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa chuckled and took Kurumi's hand shaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll take care of him. Even though if he's wishy washy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing. You just crossed your arms and puckered your mouth in a pout.</span></div></div>",

You, Tsukune, and your father had some guy talk while Moka talked with your mother about some things. Meanwhile Kokoa had some fun talking with Kurumi. She may have first met her, but the more she talked to her, the more comfortable she felt. Pretty soon, it was like the two of them became best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! No way! You're kidding!\" laughed Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dead serious!\" said Kurumi chucking. \"He was so freaked, he looked like that painting \"The Scream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa laughed. \"Oh my gosh! Hahahaha!!! I'd pay to see that! Hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls shrieked with laughter holding their sides. Then after a while they calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. You know what Kokoa?\" asked Kurumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a pretty awesome girl. Out of all the girls I've met in my life, you're the most funny and the most interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" replied Kurumi. \"You're probably not aware of this yet,, but you're pretty lucky to have my bro as a lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" asked Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, back when he was a kid, (name) was always a tenderhearted boy,\" explained Kurumi. He may be a little rough around the edges at first, but he's really a kind and gentle boy who always cared about his friends and family. In fact, he would always come and protect me whenever I was in trouble. Even when he got into that fight that got him kicked out, he only did it to help out that kid who was being bullied. It's a miracle that he came through all of that OK. He's a nice boy and he deserves to be with a great girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa looked at Kurumi curiously and then looked up at the ceiling. She thought back all the time she spent with you. When you first met, when you both were trapped in the cave, when you both went on your date, and even when you two fought side by side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. When I first met him he seemed to be a bit perv and a jerk, but the more I got to know him, the more I realized what a kind man he is. I guess that's why I fell for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumi looked at Kokoa and giggled which made Kokoa giggle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Keep on falling for him,\" said Kurumi. \"Because he is gonna be your husband one of these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my husband?!\" said Kokoa blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Once that happens you'll probably end up starting a family, having kids...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Kokoa was now a blushing so much, steam was coming out of her head. She then imagined herself and you living in a house with 4 kids and being happy which made her even more embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-what are you talking about?! I can't do something like that?! It's way too embarrassing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumi seeing Kokoa getting flustered like this chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. How cute...\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with you, you were going into the kitchen to get a cup of water to quench your thirst after talking to Tsukune and your Dad for so long. As you were getting a cup of water, you heard the chime of the doorbell again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That's weird. I don't think we're expecting anyone else,\" you thought as you went to the door. You went to the door and opened it. And you see...</span></div></div>",

Hello there\" the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Can I help you sir?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Names Jack King. I was wondering if Kurumi was home?\" the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumi? How do you know Kurumi?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jack could answer, your parents came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey (name)? Who's at the door?\" asked your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some guy named Jack King Dad,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness. Jack's here? Oh let him in, let him in. He's a friend (name).\" said your mom. \"Oh I better get Kurumi. She'll want to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your mom went upstairs to get Kurumi while you opened the door and let Jack in. Your father greeted him warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey how you doing Jack? Great to you see you kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise sir. By the way, is this man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I forgot you haven't met him before. Jack, this is (name) my son and Kurumi's big brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. So your old man's second kid?. That makes you my brother in law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, brother in law? What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kurumi came down the stairs with Kokoa behind with her. She had an excited look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?! Where is he?\" Kurumi asked. Then she saw Jack. The moment she saw him, she let out a loud squeal and her eyes sparkled. The boy also saw Kurumi and he gave the same reaction. You and Kokoa looked at the two of them puzzled as to what was going on. Your parents on the other hand stood off to the side and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go,\" said your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacky-poo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuru-boo-boo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kurumi ran towards the boy in out the door and jumped straight at the boy. The boy caught her and twirled her around a little before embracing her in a hug. You and Kokoa stood there a little surprised. You especially because you've never seen Kurumi act so girly before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... the hell?\" murmured Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... sis? Do you two know each other?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I forgot that you don't know him because you've been at school. (name), allow me to introduce one of the coolest guys on this planet, Jack King! My boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you heard the word 'boyfriend' you felt that the entire world just froze around you. The room was silent. Then you broke out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. That's funny sis,\" you said. \"It sounded like you just said that you had a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... son?\" said your father. \"She did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?!\" you yelled immediately getting into big bro mode. \"When? How? Why? Is he nice to you? Did he bribe you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my. I think he broke,\" said your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A few moments of calming down later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Kurumi introduced Jack to everyone and explained that she and him had been going out together for almost a year now, When your mom and dad first met Jack, they were overprotective like you were, but they accepted Jack and treated him like one of the family. After that, Jack introduced himself to Kokoa, Moka, and Tsukune. You sat off to the side watching Jack getting along with your friends, but you still felt a little overprotective of Kurumi not knowing about Jack up till now. It may have been none of your business, but still. Then Jack came up to to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Watcha doing over here all by yourself?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um...nothing. Just...nothing,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. You still feel overprotective about Kurumi am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I... Um...\" you stuttered trying to think of an excuse, but you had nothing. He hit the nail on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen (name), I just wanna let you know that I love your sister and I would never do anything to hurt her. I understand where you're coming from, but Kurumi is a grown woman you know and you gotta to trust her and make her own decisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you apologized. \"I'm sorry. It's just that she's my little sister and I was just shocked. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable,\" said Jack. \"You know I've really been wanting to meet you. Your sister talks about you after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So... if you're willing... I was hoping that we could be friends?\" asked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out his hand giving you a friendly smile. You looked at his hand and looked at him, then you smiled back and shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sure. Let's be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jacky-poo!\" Kurumi called. \"I sure could use my man right about now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Kuru-boo-boo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Jack left to go spend some time with Kurumi. As you watched him go to Kurumi, you heard your vampire side in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid. Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vampire me. You've been quiet for a while. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. Watch out for that Jack guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\" you asked a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason I'm getting a really bad vibe from him, like something about him isn't human. I also think that he's hiding some kind of strong power. I can feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Then what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, do nothing. Just be extra careful alright? And keep an eye on your sister and Kokoa too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Jack who was talking to Kurumi. You felt worried about what your vampire side said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be true? Is Jack that dangerous?\" you thought. \"Maybe my vampire side's being overprotective like I was, but... then again he's never lied to me before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name) are you okay? You look worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa's voice drove you from your thoughts as she came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's nothing Kokoa,\" you replied. \"I was just thinking that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then,\" said Kokoa. \"In any case, everyone's gonna be going to sleep. Big Sis and Tsukune are gonna be sleeping in the guest bedroom and Jack's gonna be sleeping with Kurumi. I was gonna get ready for bed myself. You coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sure,\" you said as you followed Kokoa back to your room and got ready for bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, the whole house was silent. Moka and Tsukune were sleeping in the guest bedroom, your parents were sleeping in their own bedroom and Jack slept on the couch. As for you and Kokoa, you both slept in separate rooms. You slept in your own room while Kokoa slept with Kurumi. Everyone was slept asleep except for you and it wasn't just because you were sleeping alone in your room. You lied in your bed wide awake still thinking about Kurumi and Jack and what your vampire side said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I shouldn't be worried about it, but... I still can't help but worry. I mean even if it was true, does Kurumi even know about Jack and if so how come my parents don't suspect about it? -sigh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that thinking made you even more stressed about your sister's safety. Then you had the feeling to use the bathroom. So you got out of bed and headed for the restroom. You went washed up and headed back to your room. Then you passed by your sister's room. You saw that your door was slightly ajar. You couldn't help, but peek a little through the door. You couldn't see your sister, but did see Kokoa however. When you saw her, your eyes went a little wide. She was on a mattress on the floor sleeping peacefully wearing a just a t-shirt. You could see her panties glowing in moonlight. This somewhat erotic made you start getting a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... It's almost a crime to watch Kokoa like this,\" you thought. \"I know I probably shouldn't but... I wanna do her like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully opened the door and were about to sneak into the room, but suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but let out a scream from hearing your vampire side's voice, but you quickly covered your mouth. Kokoa stirred a little, but she didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?!\" you mentally screamed to your vampire self. \"You nearly gave me a heart attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me stopping you from doing something stupid,\" replied your vampire self. \"Come on man. I understand that you wanna do Kokoa, but come on. Have some restraint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna hear that coming from the guy that said 'Do it! Do it! Do it!' when Kokoa was practiclly sick due to the shower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was one thing and this is other. I may be your other half that loves sex, but at least I have morals and know that there's a time and place for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard noise. You immediately snapped to the direction where you heard the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" your vampire side said. \"It sounded like it was coming from downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully made your way down the stairs not making a sound. The sound came again a little louder coming from the kitchen. It was the sound of clinking of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming from there,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful,\" your vampire self said. \"Be ready to switch with me if you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tip-toed behind the corner towards the kitchen and peeked out. You could see the intruder in the kitchen by the fridge. After taking a few deep breaths, you jumped into the kitchen and gunned straight for the intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it right there! Who are you and what are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intruder turned around surprised and carefully flipped the switch. The lights came on and you could see who the intruder was now. It was just Kurumi getting a cup of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-k-kurumi?\" you stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too big bro,\" she said a little surprised herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you doing?!\" you exclaimed. \"I thought you were some kind of burglar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just getting some milk. Sheesh. Can't girl get some milk around here?\" Kurumi sighed. \"Geez. I knew you were the tense kind of person bro, but I didn't think you'd go all copper on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you shouldn't be sneaking around like that!\" you snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both glared at each other. Then you both chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are we doing?\" you said. \"We're both acting paranoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" said Kurumi. \"So I take it that you couldn't get to sleep either?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. More or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some milk? I'll help you fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. Besides that can be bad for your teeth you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumi gulped down her milk and sighed contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing like a fresh cup of milk before you get to sleep,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause. Then Kurumi broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey (name)? Can I ask you something? How do you feel about Jack? I mean... I know it must have been a shocker to know that he's my boyfriend and everything, but... I really want you to accept us. I mean I really love this guy and I can't bear to be apart from him and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your hand to stop Kurumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurumi. Look, I'll be honest when I found out about you and Jack I was... surprised and yet at the same time worried about your safety. I mean you are my baby sister after all. I know that things are... rocky, but I'm willing to give Jack a chance. If you want my approval, you've already got it. You'll get no argument from me. Also I'll accept you no matter what. You are my sister after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohhh! (name)! That's why you're the best big bro a girl can ask for!\" squealed Kurumi as she gave you a big hug. \"I knew you'd say that! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. It's nothing sis, but if Jack does anything to you, he'll have to answer to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Anyway, I'm gonna go to sleep now. Night bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night Kurumi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Kurumi went back to your room. Leaving you alone in the kitchen. Your vampire side's voice came into your mind again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willing to give Jack a chance huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else could I say?\" you replied. \"It's true that I shouldn't trust Jack, but... I also want to believe Kurumi. I mean... she's my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... all I can say is to stay on guard,\" your vampire side said. \"Whatever happens, I'm sure you can handle it and I'll be right here if you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know and I thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get some sleep. We'll focus on Jack tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you went back upstairs to your room and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, you were lying in your bed sleeping in due to you staying up last night. You breathed slowly in and out sleeping soundly. Then you felt someone poke you and call your name. You paid no attention and continued to sleep. You were poked again this time a little harder. You murmured in your sleep and turned to your side. Then suddenly you were shaken like crazy and someone called your name even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)! Wake up! (Name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes snapped open and you sat up. You looked towards the person who woke you which turned out to be Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsukune...? What the heck are you doing? Don't you know what time it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) we have a problem! If you knew what was going on you'd be freaking out!\" said Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. What could be so important that you have to wake me up?\" you asked covering yourself up with the blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the girls! They're all gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up now completely wide awake. You immediately got out of bed and went straight to Kurumi's room. I opened the door to find that Kurumi's room was completely empty. Her room was neat and tidy, but there was no sign of neither Kurumi nor Kokoa. There wasn't even any sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... the hell?\" you murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I know,\" said Tsukune. \"I couldn't even find Moka. She was right next me when I fell asleep, but when I woke up the next morning, she wasn't there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw your Mom coming down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Where did everyone go?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Kurumi went with Jack to do some lovey dovey stuff together son,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? What about Moka and Kokoa?\" you asked. \"Have you seen them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom looked puzzled. \"Kokoa? Moka? Are those the names of coffee flavors or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mom. They're the names of my and Tsukune's girlfriends. You met them the other night remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I can't recall,\" said your mother as she walked down the hall. \"I can't remember meeting Cocoa and Moka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched your Mom walk away with a dumbfounded expression on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you,\" said Tsukune. \"Don't even try asking your Dad because he gave me the same response.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is going on here?\" you asked. \"It's like my Mom doesn't remember anything about last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Tsukune. \"One thing's for sure, something's definitely wrong. Moka, Kokoa, Kurumi, and Jack missing? Tell me that's not weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" you said. \"Wait... Jack is missing too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard your vampire self inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid. You there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up vampire me? I'm kinda in a situation here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that. I think it's obvious what happened here. Jack has taken the girls for some unknown reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I sensed something was wrong with that guy the moment I saw him and this confirms it. He must have taken them while we were sleeping and then wiped your parents memories leaving ours intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's true, then why didn't he wipe our memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He probably thought that we wouldn't be much of a threat either that or he screwed up and forgot about us by mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey (name)? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune's voice snapped you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Tsukune. I was talking to my vampire self,\" you said. \"He was just telling me what was going on. He thinks that Jack is the one behind this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack took the girls?\" asked Tsukune tightening his fists. \"But why? Why would he do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you said. \"But we have to investigate this. We have to find him and rescue the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but where do we start looking? I mean this isn't like Law and Order where we just find a clue at the scene of the crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only we had something or someone that saw what happened last night,\" you said thoughtfully. \"Maybe then we pick up the slack and find Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can ask your mom where Jack and Kurumi went,\" suggested Tsukune. \"Then we can go from there and look for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

As you both came into your room, you saw nothing out of the ordinary. Then you saw something moving on top of your bed. Something was tangled up in a mess of your blankets and sheets. You quietly motioned Tsukune to move next to the bed, so you both could catch the perpetrator. You both slowly creeped up on the bed Tsukune taking one side and you taking the other. Then you slowly reached out and gripped the blanket. You gently signaled Tsukune with a finger that you were gonna remove the covers and Tsukune nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne...Two...Three!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou uncovered the covers and you and Tsukune were ready to attack whatever was on your bed, but then you both stopped.

Ko?!\" exclaimed Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo opened his eyes and when he saw the two of you, he flapped up and hugged you on the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mr. (name) and Tsukune! Thank goodness I found the two of you!\" said Ko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you too Ko,\" you said as you peeled Ko off of your face. \"Now what the heck are you doing in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's terrible!\" cried Ko. \"It's awful! They took.... They are... I think...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Ko! Calm down,\" said Tsukune. \"You're acting more batty than usual. No pun intend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take a deep breath and calm down,\" you said. \"Plus we gotta get you fixed up. Tsukune get the first aid kit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you patched up Ko making sure that his wounds wouldn't get disinfected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, have you calmed down Ko?\" you asked. \"And do feel any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. I'm fine now whee,\" said Ko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what's going on? Why were you freaking out earlier?\" asked Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I almost forgot! Mr. Tsukune! Mr. (name)! It's horrible! Ms. Kokoa and Ms Moka have been kidnapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" said you and Tsukune at the same time. \"Kidnapped!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It's true! I saw it with my own two bat eyes whee! There was even another girl that I didn't know too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute Ko, did you see anything last night?\" you asked. \"If you did, you have to tell us everything you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. It all started last night. I was flying in the middle of the night going to check on Ms. Kokoa whee. I had just got into the house and flying up towards upstairs, but then I heard someone coming. So I hid and then I saw it. Someone was carrying the three girls out of a room. The guy was wearing all black clothes and he was wearing a hoodie. He carried Ms. Moka, Ms. Kokoa and the other girl out of the house and put them in a car and drove away. After that, I followed the car. Eventually the car stopped at some kind of abandoned house on the edge of town and I saw the guy get out of the car with Ms. Kokoa and Ms. Moka, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how, but that guy must have noticed me,\" said Ko \"He used some kind of crazy magic attack and shot me out of the sky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains your injuries, but how did you get all the way here?\" you continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was difficult but I was able to fly a little until I eventually made it back,\" said Ko. \"I'm so sorry whee. I should have done more. Then Ms. Kokoa and Moka wouldn't have been kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ko it wasn't your fault,\" said Tsukune. \"And you helped us more than you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thanks to you, we have a lead on where the guy took Moka and Kokoa,\" you said petting Ko's head. \"You've been a big help to us. Good job Ko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you petted Ko's head, Ko couldn't help but smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Ko. One more thing,\" said Tsukune. \"Did you see who it was? I mean did you get a good look of his face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately I didn't,\" said Ko. \"The only thing I saw was his clothes. Black with some strange symbol on it and white shoes too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the symbol?\" you asked. \"Anything will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo put a wing on his chin trying to remember what he saw. Then he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! It was dark, but I saw it. It was a strange red magic circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart jumped a little and you thought back. There was only one person you saw that had a shirt like that and Tsukune knew it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name). There's only one person who could have done this,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Jack,\" you said clenching your fists. \"Not only that... but he has to be a monster. How else would he be able to take the girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it all!\" you cursed punching your bed. \"Why didn't I see it sooner?! Why didn't I realize it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down (name). It's not your fault. Jack fooled all of us,\" said Tsukune. \"Don't worry. We'll get them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I know. One thing's for sure. Jack's sure as hell gonna pay for this. No one kidnaps my girl and my sister and my girl's sister and gets away with it!\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight!\" said Tsukune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ko. I know you're injured, but do you mind coming with us? We need you to guide us to that house you saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can,\" said Ko. \"But do either of you two have a plan whee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" you said getting your shoes on. \"We go in, beat Jack up and rescue the girls and call it a day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds something Kokoa would say,\" said Tsukune. \"but it's better than nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then! Let's get to that building!\" you said grabbing Ko and placing him on your shoulder \"Let's go Ko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the three of you set off on a mission to save the girls and kick Jack's ass.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked old and a bit run down, but it looked to be the perfect place for someone to hideout. The sun had also set and it was nighttime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is!\" said Ko. \"That's the house I saw that guy take the girls whee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's where Jack is,\" said Tsukune, \"He's right inside along with Moka, Kokoa, and Kurumi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you guys. We're coming to save you,\" you said. \"Let's go get em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Shouldn't you two come up with some kind of plan or something?\" asked Ko. \"You two could be walking right into a trap whee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there won't be a trap Ko,\" you replied. \"Besides, screw making a plan. I'm going through the front door! I'm gonna give Jack an ass kicking he won't forget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran towards the house with Tsukune by your side and both of you burst through the front door and came into the house. There waiting for you be some stairs was Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. Look who finally decided to show up,\" he said flashing a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Jack! Where are Kokoa and Moka!?\" demanded Tsukune. \"We know you took them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so what if I did?\" asked Jack coolly. \"What are you gonna do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack. Listen to me. I decided to trust you out of respect for my sister,\" you said. \"But now you just screwed up that trust. I put my faith in you and this is how you repay me. However... even though you've done all of this, I'm still willing to give you another chance. Now please answer; do you know where the girls are? If so please return them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack said nothing for a good few seconds. Then he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know where they are and I'm willing to tell you under one condition,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what condition is that?\" asked Tsukune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then smiled devilishly and spoke in a sinister tone. \"I'll give them back in exchange for your lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in shock as every ounce of hop that you could reason with Jack was gone in an instant and that was quickly replaced with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?! There's no way that we'll do that!\" said Tsukune. \"If you won't tell us where they are then we'll just have to beat it out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and try,\" said Jack. \"It'll be the last thing you two will ever do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes began to flash in a bright red color and he began to release an aura that was soaked with murderous intent. You and Tsukune immediately were on your guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible... his monster energy is off the chain...\" said Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... it's making me get goosebumps,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ko squeaked on your shoulder. \"Holy crap you guys! This guy's is a monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Ko. We established that,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it whee!\" said Ko. \"This guy's not just any monster! He's a vampire just like Ms. Moka and Ms. Kokoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Tsukune looked at Ko both of your eyes wide with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Are you serious Ko?!\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As serious as Moka's obsession with Tsukune's blood! This Jack guy is a vampire!\" said Ko. \"I can tell! His incredible monster energy is similar Ms. Moka and Ms. Kokoa! Only his is way more sinister whee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard your vampire side in your head. \"He's right. I can sense it too. (name)! You have let me take over now! Otherwise this guys gonna mop the floor with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsukune! Get back!\" you said aloud. \"This battle is gonna be too much for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wanna fight with you!\" complained Tsukune. \"I have as much as a right to fight as you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it Tsukune. Get back,\" you said. \"Besides... Jack's gonna pay for what he did. This is personal. I wanna fight him myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punctuated your statement by releasing a powerful monster aura of your own and you began to transform to your monster form. Your muscles slightly bulged a little, your hair turned white and your eyes turned red. Tsukune and Ko were amazed from your transformation. Your vampire self glared at Jack who was a little surprised but amused at your transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know. I never would have guessed that you would be a vampire as well (name),\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Mr. (name) to you bub,\" your vampire self said as he cracked his knuckles. \"I hope your ready for a beat down because in case you didn't know you broke a rule. No one... and I mean no one takes my girl and my sister and my girl's sister and lives to tell about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vampire self gave Jack a glare soaked in murderous and hateful intent. Ko and Tsukune could even feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... (name)'s vampire self is like Moka's,\" said Tsukune. \"Moody with a major power to match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" said Ko. \"If you think about it, he could pass as Moka's brother whee!\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth vampires stared at each other daring for one to make a move.

Jack crossed his arms blocking the sending a powerful shock wave that shook throughout the house. Jack then came swinging with a punch of his own, but he was able to duck out of the way making him miss. He then swung his leg in a powerful kick and Jack jumped back dodging the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty good,\" said Jack. \"Just what I'd expect from a vampire like you, but you're gonna have to do better than that if you wanna beat me kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how about I start doing better right now?!\" your vampire self yelled as you launched himself straight at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jack then entered in an all out brawl. The two of you went back and forth punching and kicking each other in an incredible speed. Tsukune and Ko watched the fighting unfold with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! Those two are really going at it!\" said Tsukune. \"Am I glad that (name)'s on our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't know if he's strong enough to fight that guy,\" said Ko. \"We gotta try and help him out whee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And I think I know how,\" said Tsukune. \"Ko. Let's see if we can find a bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo looked at Tsukune as if he had said something weird. \"Tsukune! This isn't the time to take a whiz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me! I have an idea,\" said Tsukune. \"Just help me look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with Ko flapping behind him, Tsukune ran up the stairs. Meanwhile back with your vampire self and Jack, the two of you were at a standoff with each other. You had your fair share of scrapes and bruises as did Jack, but neither of one you were ready to back down just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you had enough or do you want some more?\" your vampire self said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was about to ask you the same question boy!\" growled Jack as he jumped toward him again throwing a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vampire self managed to block it, but the force made you backpedal a little. He then countered by lifting his leg and throwing a powerful kick. The force of it created a huge shockwave of air. Jack leaped up and dodged it making the wave go right past him and crash right into a wall. Jack then retaliated with by diving straight for her with a kick of his own. Your vampire self blocked the blow but the force of it was too strong. He was forced back slamming into a wall. He winced in pain as a streak of blood dripped down on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?!\" you asked worriedly inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" he responded. \"But this guy's tough. Even tougher than everyone else who we faced before. I gotta say it's quite the challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you beat this guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I could, but now I'm not so sure. If we had some water maybe, but as things stand now we probably won't last much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Jack. \"You were so confident before. Running out of breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I'm just getting warmed up,\" your vampire self said. \"Besides you're looking a bit out of breath yourself. You sure you don't wanna take a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Really cute,\" smirked Jack. \"But I didn't come here for games, I came here to kill your ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then lunged with an intent to kill and got ready to engage him in battle once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Looks like we finally meet face to face (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Who are you? And what do you want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Oh never mind that. Right now, why don't we have a little fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to react, the mysterious figure appeared in front of you before you had a chance to react. Then he gave you a strong punch in the gut. The punch sent you reeling to a wall. You gasped as the wind got knocked out of you from the impact. You managed to stay on your feet, but you definitely felt the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): -cough, cough- Damn....that really hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Heh. You were sent reeling from that one punch? Come on. Surely you can do better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why you.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged at the mysterious figure with a flurry of punches and kicks. The mysterious figure dodged every one blow. Then it disappeared from your sights and appeared behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the hell?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious figure this time gave you a powerful punch in the face so hard that blood came out of your mouth. Then he gave you a big kick in the chin sending you flying through an empty classroom and crashing to a chalkboard. Right now you felt that every part of your body was broken. You couldn't even get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Damn....it..... he's...so strong......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Damn you're pathetic. From all the talk I heard about, I thought that you'd be stronger than this.If you don't taking this seriously, I'll have my army wipe out everyone here, including your little friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What? Then.....you're the one...controlling the army.....why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Very well. Since you asked I'll humor you. It's for you my boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Yes. You're the reason why I'm here. After all you're quite special. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me...? What do you...want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Oh nothing much really. I just need you to do something for me. Something that only you can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled when you tried to get up and your body seared in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well forget it! -cough- I won't do anything you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: What a shame. I really didn't want any bloodshed, but I guess you leave me with no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsukune began to wake up. The moment he did, the figure appeared in front of him and kicked him hard, making you gasp in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Tsukune!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune screamed in pain as the figure started attacking him. You tried to get up, but your body was still reeling from the previous attack. All you could do was listen as Tsukune's cries of pain rang in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Stop! Stop it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Hehehehe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious figure didn't listen. It continued to hurt Tsukune. Tsukune's cries rang in your ears and you hated the sound of them. This was the exact feeling you felt when Yukari was being attacked before. Then your body began to get hot and a new feeling began to take over your body. Anger. Rage. Hate. You couldn't stand to hear a friend of yours in pain. That same terrifying aura of yours overwhelmed your body and as you entered into your berserk mode once more. The mysterious figure saw what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Looks like I pushed it a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he tossed Tsukune aside. You looked at him with eyes filled with anger and let out a scream of rage, charged at the figure and unleashed a barrage of punches and kicks. This time they were a lot faster. The figure dodged them all at first, but them your fist barely scraped his cheek and then you punched him in the gut sending him flying to a wall. The wall crumbled and the rubble buried the figure. Thinking you win the fight, you snapped out of your berserk mode and you rushed over to Tsukune's side to check on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Tsukune! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: -cough- I'm fine. Just a little banged up. You sure beat the crud out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I guess so. Come on. Let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted Tsukune up on your shoulder and were about to walk away carrying him to safety, but then. There was a rumbling sound and then an explosion from where the rubble was and the figure emerged laughing with glee. He was also emitting a powerful aura filled with pure evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: No way.... he's still alive?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh shit! That aura.... It's so evil, I feel like I'm gonna be sick just by standing by this creep. I gotta get Tsukune out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you limped in a run trying to escape. The mysterious figure however was right on your heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave: Hahahaha! That's it! That's what I was looking for! Hahaha! Although.....you made the mistake of hurting so.....I'm gonna have to punish you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious figure's hand pulled out a blade and dashed straight for you and Tsukune. Meanwhile back with Kokoa and the others, they were still destroying the golems. Kurumu was flying around slashing the golems every time she swooped down. Mizore and Yukari were blasting the golems with ice and tarot cards. Moka and Kokoa were fighting side by side using their kicks and punches. The tide was turning in the girl's favor. Then suddenly.....</span></div></div>",

Slave walked in front and yelled, \"Warriors, MARCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you and Kokoa were purely devoted to each other all that was needed was to have a big distraction then close in on you for the kill. All that was required was to injure you enough to force Kokoa to inject her vampire blood in you and then all tasks at hand would be cleared. The lizards crawled out through the pipes and within minutes the school was overrun by them. They attacked every student they found but Slave's goal was to find and simply cripple you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lizards attacked you immediately ran trying to escape from them but you called out to Kokoa or the others hoping they might help get you and the others out of there.

Call to your vampire friends or I will force them to come here themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought he wanted Moka or Kokoa so you refused immediately, \"Never!\", then one of the lizards came by and began corning you to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see this one? He has a hidden talent that makes him quite viscous, it's quite gruesome. However if you don't I'll have him show you, first hand and it isn't very pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizards neck began opening up into a pair of fan with the edges poking out like spikes and the pattern it had was a series of reds and green in a threatening manner.

Then you heard a regurgitating sound and then followed by it was something hitting the wall next to you. It was a viscous black posion material that sizzled and had steam coming from it. \"That was my only warning, next time it'll spit in your eyes and then you'll go blind. Ounce that happens he'll eat off your face and have you for her dinner. Now call to them now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter witnessing what that thing did you were shaking almost as fast as those flaps of skin that made that lizard so horrifying.

Why would we hide anything from you? We got nothing to hide. Right Moka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah.

Moka and the others told me to tell them after I talked to you before. Besides we suspected you were a human in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah. We knew when you didn't transform and from Kokoa's reaction to when you were covered in blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Yeah. I'm sorry we didn't tell you anything sooner. We didn't want you to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): -sigh- It's OK. It's just now I feel like I'm even more of a weakling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: (name) it's alright. We won't tell anyone. The last thing that we need is the entire school finding out that you're a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well that's one less problem to deal with. -sigh- All this stress is bad for my heart.

I carried you here after I found you in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kokoa got up and walked toward the entrance to the cave where it was blocked by snow and started to dig her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! What do you think you're doing?!? You can't go out there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: If you think I'm staying here with you, you're sadly mistaken. I'd rather freeze to death than.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kokoa was able to make a hole in the wall of snow. She was blasted by a freezing wind. Outside it was snowing like crazy. Even the most powerful monster could freeze to death out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's not good. When I came to, it was already turning into a blizzard. So you might as well sit tight until help comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Damn it! This sucks! Why do I have to be suck in this stinkin cave with a pervert like you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Look, I'm not to thrilled about this either, but we don't have a choice. So quit complaining already, would ya?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: And why should I listen to a whinny pervert like you?!? It's your fault we're in this mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): My fault?!? You're the one that caused the avalanche you sissy vampire!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You're the one who ran into me you whiny jerkwad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the hell is your problem?!?

You think that if your nice to me, that I'll be good friends with you?!? Well I'm sorry to disappoint you, but it's never gonna happen! There's no way in hell that I would be friends with a pervert like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point that was straw that broke the camels back. You were p.oed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's it you little brat! You want a piece of me?!? I'll kick your ass right here and now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Fine then! That's just what I was gonna say! When I'm done...you're......gonna wish...that....you.....never.........crossed me.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Kokoa fainted. You rushed to her side and felt her skin. It was icy cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh no! She's suffering from hypothermia! I gotta find a way to warm her up and fast, but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the cave and then you see some logs and sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's it! I can make a fire! But I better hurry. At this rate Kokoa's gonna freeze to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently set Kokoa down and took off your coat and put it on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): -shivers- Damn it all. Why the hell am I g-g-going through so m-m-much trouble just to help this b-b-brat? Sometimes I think I'm too n-n-nice. In any case I better sh-sh-shut up and make that fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes rubbing a stick on a log, but eventually you got a spark and soon you had a roaring fire. When you finished, you gently carried Kokoa close to the fire and placed her next to it. Then you sat by the fire to prevent yourself from freezing to death. More than an hour passed. Then Kokoa began to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What......what happened? What the....? Why am I wearing this thing?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh st-stop it. I-I-I gave you m-m-my coat! At least thank me for saving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw something that you never seen before. Kokoa was blushing. Not to mention she didn't call you a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: You.....you gave me your coat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-y-yeah. You weren't g-g-getting any w-w-warmer s-s-so it was the only th-th-thing I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: (looks at the coat) But aren't you cold? You'll freeze even with the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): D-d-don't worry. I'll b-be fine. For s-some reason, I'm m-m-more worried about y-y-you other than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa could see that you were freezing. Then she did something that shocked you. She took off the coat, wrapped it around both of you, and pulled you close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wh-what are you....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Shut it. You may be a perv, but even you doesn't deserve to freeze to death. Also......thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....sure.

Kurumu and Moka actively searched for you two. With Kurumu being more worried. \"Do you see them?!\", Kurumu yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! They may have been buried under the snow. Yukari clear it with Mizore and her mom!\", Moka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be alive (Name). I don't wanna lose you when we just begun to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! There's a light over there! It must be them!\", Moka called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu and Moka ran over to see you and Kokoa freezing yourselves to death. Moka took Kokoa and Kurumu took you and ran quickly back to the cabin. They dumped you two in two heating beds and had a nurse look you both over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are they?\", Moka asked the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good news is they're going to be fine. I'd reccomemd they stay warm for a few days. But the girl is suffering from what looks like a cold. It may upgrade to the flu if it continues but overall they'll survive. \", said the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu and Moka walked in to check on you two. Kokoa was shivering and was curled up in her electric blanket. You were just as cold but your shivering settled down when Kurumu placed her hand over your head. You opened your eyes to see her smiling about your recovery. You fell asleep letting the heat thaw you out.</span></div></div>",

That was not me! I'm pretty sure it was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It wasn't me either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly the wall of snow exploded and on the other side of it was a giant white creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What the hell is that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Holy crap! It's an abominable snowman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abominable snowman growled and mumbled at you and Kokoa. Kokoa was about to stand up and fight it, but she was still a little weak due to the cold. Then you stood between her and the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Stay back you furry freak! I won't let you hurt her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnraged by your insult, the snowman attacked with it's giant fist. Luckily you leaped out of and gave the snowman a mighty kick in the face. It connected, but it didn't faze it. Instead it countered with a mighty swing of his arm. This sends you flying and you landed smack on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Are you OK?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't worry.....(cough)....I'm fine. I've had harsher attacks than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Look out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and you see the snowman above you with it's fists raised. It was about to attack when suddenly, three giant icicles rained from the sky and blocked the snowman's attack. You knew that there was only one person you know that could make icicles and she was ice-boarding to the rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name)! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm fine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Don't worry! I'll take care of this! You get out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But Mizore! I can't leave you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'll be fine! Besides you got someone with you to take care of right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that she was referring to Kokoa. She may be a little better, but she was still weak. You knew what you had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa? Can you get up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Yeah, but I'm still a little weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK then. I have no choice then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: What do you......Hey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kokoa had a chance to react, you lifting her up bridal style and carrying her to safety. Kokoa tried to get you to put her down, but she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Hey! What are you doing?!? Put me down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I can't do that. You're in no condition to walk. You're still weak. So be quiet and let me carry you K?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Kokoa could do was blush and let you carry her to safety. Then you hear the snowman behind you.

You look to the source of the voice and to see three familiar figures on a hill skiing toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: (name)! Kokoa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hey don't worry! We're here to save you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Don't you worry (name)! I'm gonna save you and I'm gonna go it using my new skiing skills!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: No Kurumu! Don't! You're still a rookie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kurumu with shining and adoring eyes eager for her to save you and Kokoa. Then Kurumu took off and she was skiing fine, but then she lost her balance and then fell over. She rolled and she rolled until she became a giant snowball. Finally she rolled until she hit a tree with a mighty boom. Everyone that witnessed this all had their jaws hung open in shock. Even the snowman couldn't believe what he saw. Kurumu dizzily got up and gave thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Don't worry......I'm OK.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the hell.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I tried to warn her! She's still having trouble skiing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Although I gotta give her credit trying to look cool and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen snowman roared and charged straight toward you and slammed his fist toward you. You were able to jump out of the way with Kokoa in your arms and Tsukune pushed Moka out of the way. Then a bright and red light began to shine from where Moka was. When she stood up she was completely different. She hair had gone from pink to silver and her eyes turned ruby red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What happened to Moka? She looks different and bit more fierce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: It's my big sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKo: Allow me to explain whee. You see, Moka is an S class vampire just like Moka. Only in her case her power was so great that her parents seal it away using a rosary. And so whenever the rosary is removed Moka's innocent self disappears and her True vampire self awakens whee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks....for the explanation. Although it was little random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Well it's been a while Tsukune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Nice to see you too Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuter Moka: Alright then. Time for you to know your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snowman roared and attack, but Moka dodged the attack with a jump. Then she charged and gave the snowman a powerful roundhouse kick in the gut, sending the snowman flying and until it was a sparkle in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Holy freakin crap! She kicked it's ass with just one kick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: That's my big sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tsukune ran up to you and Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: (name)! Are you and Kokoa OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. We're just a little chilly. Although Kokoa could use a nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Kokoa began reaching out to Tsukune's hand where the rosary was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: The rosary.....I need it....give it to me.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kokoa? What are you doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Outer Moka took the rosary from Tsukune's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuter Moka: Listen Kokoa. I'm sorry to tell you, but I can't just leave it off and be unsealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: But why? I need you big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuter Moka: I know, but you have to learn that I won't always be around. If you're worried about being lonely then don't be. You've gotten yourself a pretty nice friend. By the way, your name is (name) right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-yes ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuter Moka: Do me a favor. take care of my sister for me would you? She's a bit stubborn, but she's a good girl once you get to know her K?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um...yes ma'am. Don't worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuter Moka: Well....see you later Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kokoa could day anything Outer Moka placed the rosary back on and went back to the pink haired Moka. She fell over unconscious, but luckily Tsukune and Kurumu were there to catch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I swear. She always goes overboard all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: That's Moka for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I gotta say. She's pretty incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a loud roar. You all turned to see the snowman had reappeared and he was mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the heck?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I thought Moka sent that thing flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Crap! And were totally defenseless right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mizore came along on her ice board and stopped the snowman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Wait! Calm down dad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait. Dad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Wait could that be.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Wait. Now I remember! That's Mizore's dad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Say what now?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later Mizore explained everything. It turns out that Mizore's mom had sent Mizore's dad to find you and Kokoa after the avalanche. He did, but you misunderstood and called him a freak. After the situation calmed down and after a lot of apologizing to Mizore's dad, you all headed back to the lodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

But apparently youre too smart to live a happy normal life with your old pals and neighbors just cuz youre a little smarter than them. Or at least TOO smart for a kid your age that you not only have to be skipped a couple years ahead of your classmates, but you gotta go to one of those special schools for the 'gifted'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begged your mother not to ship you to one of those overseas private schools, but she always had it in for you... just cuz you like to tease her over her little fantasy psuedo-religious roleplay sessions she and her friends have in the basement and that you flat out refuse to be a part of cuz of how stupid you think it is... she couldnt WAIT to get rid of you! Thinks you might finally learn something of value, she says! Youre only a few years away from getting a PHD! What else of VALUE do you need to learn?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shipped off to a place called the 'Youkai Academy'. You heard rumors about this special place, but mostly silly ones like it's a special school for monsters with monster teachers teaching monsters how to become proper monsters. Normally, you'd wonder why your mother would register you to a weird place like THAT, but consider the weird stuff she's in, youre not surprised.<br>\r\nStill, you got no choice but to get your belongings, get on the plane, and spend your time all alone in your big lonely hotel room until the day youre dragged onto that special bus to that special school with all the other 'monsters' sealed away from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you sat in your lonely LONELY hotel room bored out of your skull. You watched tv, but nothing was on. Nothing worth watching anyway. You already read all 14 of your Dresden Files books who knows how many times. You already gotten 100% completion through Persona 3 and 4 and done practically everything you can do in them. With nothing else to do, you decide to go for a little walk outside. Sadly, the town youre in was pretty small and surrounded by gloomy dark forest full of feral wildlife that realizes theyre physically stronger than humans and are afraid to eat one should they leave the boundaries!<br>\r\nNo mall, no bookstore, no arcade... and a LOT of gloomy dark forest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk was very short and nobody all the townsfolk were locked up indoors for some reason. You couldnt see anybody out but yourself. You followed the path of street lights, curious to see how far they stretch which led you to a little park. You didnt get much of a view of the park cuz you dare not tread near the forest. All you made out in the light was a couple of park benches, a water fountain, and a big red glowing symbol of the occult on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBIG RED GLOWING SYMBOL OF THE OCCULT?!! Oy, the townsfolk are into this kind of crap, too?!<br>\r\nAs if tonight wasnt bad enough, you spot someone lying unconscious in the middle of the symbol! A young short black haired oriental girl who looked about your age in what looked to be a schoolgirl uniform under a pinkish yellow cape with a cute yellow bow and a big purple pointy cap not unlike a witch cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things popped into your head: First was 'What the heck is that girl doing wearing such a ridiculous outfit at this time of night?' then 'OH MY GOD! Is that girl ok?!' in that particular order. Ok, so youre not exactly a saint, but c'mon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" you sighed before running toward the circle and shouted, \"Hey lady! Are you alright?!\" She didnt so much as flinch in her 'sleep'. When you got close enough, you noticed she had a big nasty cut on her leg. The wound look so fresh, it was still bleeding. What coulda happened to her before she passed out cold? Eh, you'll have to give the third degree. You'd better get that poor girl to safety before that wound becomes something worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?!\" as you moved closer, you had to suddenly stop moving instinct. You didnt know why, but you felt something. Something BAD. You didnt know how to explain it but there was something about that glow in the symbol that gave caution vibes to your brain, telling you to stay back!<br>\r\nLogically, it made no sense. But it too hard to shrug off the bad vibes coming from the circle. It almost ALMOST seemed as if someone or something was coming. Coming to get the girl, perhaps?! C'mon, that's just plain silly! Nobody believes in that garbage... except your mom, of course. And yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to shiver and sweat as you got closer, fearing the unknown. You didnt wanna leave the girl, but... something was up! What was it?!</span></div></div>",

The longer you stand around being afraid of imaginary friends you dont know about, the worse the condition that girl in the funny hat's gonna be in. At least, that's what you told yourself, which thankfully was enough to make you suck in your gut and dash toward that circle.<br>\r\nYou ignored the threatening vibes that were pounding on parts of you that you didnt even know you have and gently AND CAREFULLY picked up the poor unconscious girl. Fortunately, she wasnt very heavy as you carried her over the threshold, although it wasnt gonna look good for your back if you kept her like that for too long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you carried her away, you looked over your shoulder and noticed the glowing circle suddenly vanished. Like *POOF* nothing was there! And the scary vibes vanished with it.<br>\r\n\"That was weird,\" you muttered to yourself as you headed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carried the wounded girl back to your apartment and laid her on your bed, putting a towel under her injured leg so she wouldnt bleed on your blanket. You knew you shoulda called 911, but considering you have quite a knowledge in medical research than a lot of the adults you knew, you gathered up some first aid supplies and decided to treat her yourself.<br>\r\nIt was a little nerve-wrecking examining the rest of her body for any other wounds without taking any of her clothes cuz youre a guy, but she didnt seem to have anything worse than the leg wound. Just a couple of very minor cuts and scrapes.<br>\r\nAfter careful examination of the wound, you concluded the tear came from some kind of animal bite judging by the grooves looking like teethmarks. Looked worse than a wolf or bear bite, but it wasnt venomous like a snake. It looked bad, but it wasnt deep enough to require sewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mixed up a couple of medicinal herbs as you flushed out excess debris and gravel from the wound and disinfecting it with a little peroxide and a bit of neosporin. You ground the herbs into a paste, applied the paste around the bleeding gaps to promote faster healing, and waited for it to dry before applying pressure and wrapping the wound in a sturdy bandage. Then you put a washcloth over her forehead when you felt her head getting warm. The tinier wounds were easily treated with neosporin and some band-aids. The treatment took no more than a half hour and you felt pretty darn good about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unngh...uh...\" and no sooner after did she start to wake up.<br>\r\nYou leaned over her and whispered, \"Easy... dont get up too fast.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh...w....what.... WHAT?!!!\" her purple eyes widened and she suddenly woke up in a sudden jolt, \"WHERE AM-OOOwww... owww...\" and immediately, she grips her aching head in pain.<br>\r\n\"Told you,\" you told her.<br>\r\n\"Ow... owie...\" she gave a cutesy painful expression as she her rubbed her forehead, \"w... where am I? Where is that jerk? I swear I'm gonna turn him into a mouse and feed him to my pet snake!\" As expected, she's still delusional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre in my apartment,\" you answered, \"I found you lying in the park out cold so I-\"<br>\r\n\"KIDNAPPER!!!\" she shouted in her ear and glared.<br>\r\n\"K-Kidnapper?! I saved your-\"<br>\r\n\"So that red-headed coward couldnt take me on alone?!\" she snapped, \"he had to hire backup to keep this big bad witch from smearing him all over the pavement?!\" Big bad witch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you had quite a lot of patience for this girl.<br>\r\n\"I honestly have no idea what you are speaking of,\" you calmly said to her.<br>\r\n\"Youre not gonna keep me her for long!\" she warned you, \"as soon as.. ugh... this stupid headache goes away, youre gonna wish you never been spawned!\"<br>\r\n\"I have some aspirin for that if you'd like,\" you kindly offered, \"might want to get some food in you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl just sneered at you, as if your politeness only made her madder.<br>\r\n\"I'm getting really sick of that goody-goody charade youre pulling,\" she then looked at her bandaged leg, \"...and what did you do to my leg?!\"<br>\r\n\"I nursed it to health,\" you said as a matter of fact, \"I would suggest not moving it too much or it might bleed like crazy again.\"<br>\r\n\"Dont tell me what to do!\" geez, why is she so damn ungrateful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps now is a good time to introduce ourselves,\" you changed the subject, \"I'm [Yuri]. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Like I'm gonna tell you who I am!\" she crossed her arms and raised her chin, \"a weakling like yourself doesnt deserve to know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari, eh?\" you had already found her school ID in her purse, \"that's a pretty name.\"<br>\r\n\"HEY!! GIVE THAT BA...ow, geez...\"<br>\r\nThen your eyes widened when you saw the NAME of the school, \"YOUKAI ACADEMY?! You go to Youkai Academy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her head and gritted her head, \"Duh... and I just happen to be the youngest, smartest, and most intelligent student enrolled there! What's it to you?\"<br>\r\n\"I've been enrolled there, myself!\" you said with a bit of excitement, \"what's it like there?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a lot better than shady kidnapping scum like you deserve!\" Yukari answered, \"I swear if you dont let me go and tell your red-headed friend to back off, I'm gonna give you the worst stomach cancer in your life!\" Again with the 'red-head' stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont have a red-headed friend,\" you said.<br>\r\n\"Dont play games, [YURI], if that is your real name!\" she finally said your name, \"I can easily feel the exact same dark aura coming off you. Plus, HE was a pseudo-doctor type too!\" Dark aura? Psuedo-doctor?! \"So what are you? A warlock? A black summoner? A necromancer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes at her in disbelief, \"I'm sorry... I do not believe in fairy-tale magic.\"<br>\r\n\"Fairy-tale magic?!\" she seemed insulted by that remark, \"do you know how many Courts could have you executed for saying such a thing?!\"<br>\r\nNow you were kinda having a hard keeping your cool and patience! \"W-What in the... er... is your head feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Mine's just fine,\" suddenly, she whipped out a cute heart-shaped wand and pointed it at you, \"yours on the other hand's gonna be filled with maggots! HYAA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cocky look on Yukari's face suddenly vanished. \"Wh-What the?!! C'mon! Work!! Work, stupid thing!!\"<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrow, \"Um... what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Trying to curse you! C'MON!!\" she shook her wand around as if trying to shake magic out of it, \"uggh!! I cant believe it! That jerk just sealed my magic! Damnit!!\"<br>\r\n\"O....k....\" this was gonna be a long night, \"I think you'd better lie down, Yukari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" she snapped again, \"no one seal's a high ranked witch's magic and lives to tell about it!\"<br>\r\nMan... no medical journal warned you about THIS kind of head-trauma! Next time, you should just call 911!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you had to tell yourself to hang in there. Sometimes a doctor gets one of those stubborn patients that may be a pain to deal with, but is still in need of help. A true doctor sucks in his gut and treats his patient to the best of his ability!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... perhaps your um... magic will come back to you after some rest,\" you try to play along with her game, \"just relax, you'll be fine. The worst is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean the worst is over?\" Yukari whined, \"without my magic, I'm as useless as an ordinary human. Just let me out of here and I'll pretend this kidnapping never happened.\"<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"Youre still hurt. You should rest first. Now please stay where you are. You mustve been out for a few hours, so you should at least have some food in you or else you might pass out again. I'm going to make us dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Yukari seemed a tad interested, \"Um... what's for dinner?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm heating some hot pockets in the microwave,\" you answered, \"meatballs &amp; mozzarella. You interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari still stared at you in suspicion, but you noticed a little drool down dripping down her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after almost a minute of silence...</span></div></div>",

Nineteen years old, an average Joe, pretty plain looking actually. You did well in high school, got good grades, but not to popular with people. You didn't talk to anyone at school for you didn't trust anyone. You see a long time ago when you were a little kid, you lived a happy life with your mother and your father. Everything was peaceful and happy until one day when your mother went out one day. You didn't know what was going on, but it was about making peace. Then your mother went missing. No one knew where or how she disappeared, but when the police were at the site where she disappeared all they found was her bracelet. This affected you greatly and ever since you never talked to anyone or bothered to make friends. You never had any friends or people to call friends so you were always by yourself. But then after you graduated your father decided it was time for you to have a change of pace. He enrolled you into a private school called Yokai Academy. At first you were gonna decline, but then your dad gave you the evil eye. So you were on the bus bound for Yokai Academy. The bus driver was really freaky to you, but you decided to ignore him Then the bus driver spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBus driver: Hey kid. You heading for Yokai Academy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) So what if I am?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBus driver: If that's the case then you better prepare yourself kid. Having a sharp tongue won't get you anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What makes you say that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bus entered a tunnel. Everything around it was warping like you were going through a portal. Then when the bus got through you were surprised to a whole new and different world. When you got off the bus you looked around. Everything was ominous and creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the hell? Where is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBus driver: Hey kid. I'd watch my back if was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the bus drove away and disappeared in the tunnel. At first you looked around, but then you headed for a tall building that looked like a castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That must be the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were walking you saw some students that were just like you. You walked while looking at your surroundings like you were a tourist. Then you bump into something hard. When you get up you look and you that you bump into.......</span></div></div>",

What more do you want? If you wanna fight I'm not interested. I've seen people like you before thinking they're all tough just because they pick on the weak.

I'm gonna kick your ass for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and wiped the dust off. Now it was your turn to get pissed. You took a fighting stance with both your fists raised ready to fight.

Your expected that Saizo to be knocked out easily, but the punch didn't affect Saizo a bit. His skin felt hard as a rock and your fist was throbbing with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Huh Is that all you got? This is how you throw a punch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe punched you hard in the stomach knocking the wind out of you and you were sent flying again this time you crashed straight into a trash can. You lied there gasping for air, you couldn't even move. Saizo slowly walked toward you smirking as he stood over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) What brutal strength! I can't even hurt him! What is he? Some kind of monster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: This was too easy. You're weak like a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grabbed you by your collar and lifted you up high. You were practically dead weight. Saizo raised his free hand and prepared to dish out one final punch. Then a voice cried out.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Hey!

And by the way look for Tskune or Moka they'll help you if you need help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rubi left you headed for the classroom and took a seat in the back of class. This makes you remember back at your previous school you sat alone the exact same way. All alone with no friends. As the classroom began to fill up Saizo entered the classroom. You remember how he kicked your ass and how he overwhelmed you. You wonder how he took your punch so easily, then you remember Mizore. The way she stood up for you for some reason got your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) That's the first time someone stood up for me. I wonder why she did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Nekomone took roll and called the students in alphabetical order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Nekomone: Shirayuki? Shirayuki?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mizore entered the room. You immediately recognized her in an instant. When she saw you she waved to you. You blushed and pretended not to care and looked away. Your heart began to beat fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the hell was that? Why did she wave? And why is my heart beating so much?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to forget about it by paying attention to Ms. Nekomone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Nekomone: Attention students. I'm your teacher Ms. Nekomone. This is Yokai Academy a school for mosnters and by monsters to learn to coexist with humans. As you know the number one rule is never reveal your monster identity under any circumstance on campus. Also never reveal your monster to other students whatsoever. Got it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) What? This can't be. It's gotta be a prank of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you think about what Rubi said about the school being for monsters. At first you didn't believe what she said, but there was something that made you change your mind. and that something was Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: What boring rules. I still say if I see a human I'll eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Nekomone: Now now Saizo. You know better. Please don't cause trouble. Besides this academy is surrounded by a holy barrier, so even a human got through they would be killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) What!?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw something really gross. Saizo's tongue was long and extended like a snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) What the hell?!?!!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: say what you what teach, but I smell human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you sweat a little and for the first time ever you were scared. You had an uneasy time throughout class. After class power walked all the way outside to avoid Saizo. Then you caught your breath and then you took a moment to process what was going on. You were in a school for monsters and if Rubi was right if they found out you were human, you'd be a dead man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I gotta get out of here! I gotta find a way out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you ran to the only place you can think of to get out. The bus stop. Unfortunately you ran into the last person you wanted to see. Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hey there punk. Glad to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything you froze with terror and attempted to run, but Saizo caught you by the collar again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Now it's time to get some payback!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Saizo transformed into his monster form which was an orc. He threw you a punch that sends you flying to a tree. You cough a little blood and you struggle to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Pathetic! Are you a monster or a mouse? You're like a human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw another punch in your face slamming you into a sign. It felt like every bone in your body was broken. and you couldn't move. Saizo stood over you ready to finish you off. Then you began to see your life flash before your eyes. You saw you with your mom before she disappeared, and then you saw the depression you went through. You were so alone and you had no one to call a friend. Then a single tear streamed from your face. You wished you had someone to come save you. You wished that someone could come and stop the pain and loneliness. Then Mizore flashed before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) Why am I thinking about her now of all times? She's not even my friend. She probably doesn't care like everyone else does. It would be better off if I died. That way I could be spared from the pain. Yet.....why? Why do I keep seeing her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo saw you crying and sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Huh Crying like a baby? Don't worry I'll make you stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo threw one more devastating punch and you closed your eyes and waited for the end. When......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's more respectable than you'll ever be!\",  she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you left Saizo to rot in humiliation and went to your next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for picking me up back there. I don't know how to thank you.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you must be, alone, distant, no friends to have your side. It's thinking like that will kill you both out there and here. Us loners need people to have their faith in to. Trust perhaps not but faith makes them more like you expect them to.\", Mizore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks for your help.

I owe you twice and hence I'm obligated to help you twice. Depending on whether or not I like to be around you as much is all speculation.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\", she gave you and firm handshake which seemed warmer than you'd have thought but it was a friendly one never the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two parted ways and went back to your classes. You were headed for you next one which was lead by Rubi herself.

Kurumu?\", Rubi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl across from you was distracted from staring at you but she gave an answer acknowledging her identity to you now.

You felt enamored by her face that you didn't know what anything around you was anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes almost began to sparkle and made you want to look deeper.

I'll enjoy you as part of my harem.\", she said noting your personality and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this happening?

You didn't know what to say or what to do. If you didn't say something now Mizore will probably think you're dumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'll be going then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wait! I.......I......I wanted to apologize. I was acting like a jerk. I'm truly sorry.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou bowed in front of her with respect. Mizore smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's OK. Don't worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Anyway th-there's something I wanted to ask you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to ask her for her, Tskune and the gang to be your friends, but for some reason you felt guilty, embarrassed, and nervous at the same time. You twildled your fingers and were fidgeting. This went on for a minute until you couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) DAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!  I can't say it! I'm so sorry!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you bowed and ran off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hey wait a minute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no good you were already out of sight. As you running you were red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Damn! Why the hell am I so embarrassed! Man! All I wanted was to be friends with her and the others. Damn it I'm such an idiot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hit something or should I say someone hard and you fell flat on your back. You look up and you see that the people who you just bumped into was the Class President and his posse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey what the hell! Watch were you're going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: Well, well, well If it isn't Mr. rule breaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosse 1: We've been looking for you punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosse 2: yeah you gone and made our president upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Not you guys again! It's none of your business so leave me alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: Oh, but it does kid. You see whenever someone like you disrupts dicipline in our school it's our job to see that they're punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grabs you by the collar and lifts you up. You struggle to get free, but you couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tskune and the others were talking about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: So you ended up saving him? I think we'd be wise to stay away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! Especially since he gave us a rotten attitude before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Kurumu! Yukari! don't say that! (name) may have been mean but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: It's not his fault!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Tskune's right it's not his fault. I did some digging and I may have found out as to why (name)'s been acting the way he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yeah? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: Yeah. It's kinda sad. Apparently before he came to Yokai. When he was little he was just like any normal person with a mom and dad. He was raised by a loving father and mother. Then his mother went out on a job and then she disappeared. No one knows where she disappeared to or what happened to her, but she mysteriously disappeared. Her husband was devastated, but (name) was heart broken. Ever since then (name)'s always been alone. He didn't make friends or try to talk to people. He just stayed all alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere a long silence. Then Kurumu spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Wow. I never realized he was so alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: The poor guy. I thought I had it rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I think we all had experience of being alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were being dragged to the lake again. Then they threw you to a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey! What the hell! That hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: You know what? I'm sick of your voice. It makes me wanna puke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all three of them transformed into their monster forms which they turned out to be lizard men. You tried to stand her ground, but this time you were trembling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm not scared of you! Bring It!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: You think you're hot shit just because you kicked Saizo's ass? Think again! You're nothing but a useless good for nothing bastard that no one wants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you have a flashback. You saw yourself as a kid being picked on by a bunch of bullies. Telling you the exact same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosse 1: What's the matter? Got nothing to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped back to reality and you realized you had to do something. So you threw a punch at the president, but he dodged it and he slashed your arm and flung into tree again making you scream in pain. you had a deep gash on your right arm and you were bleeding bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosse 1: Nice one boss! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: So boys what should we do with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosse 2: I say we eat him. Were all the past the grounds. No one will find us here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: Good idea. I am getting kind of hungry. Let's eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey crept toward you their mouths drooling. This made you quiver with fear. For the first time in your life you were scared. Scared like hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) St-stay back! Get away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lizardmen weren't listening. They closed in on you and  you were completely trapped with no way of escaping and about to be eaten by lizardmen. you started to tear up because you were so frightened. You were so scared that you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Someone please help me!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: Hahahah! You're crying like a little pussy, don't worry I'll make it painless by eating your head first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped at you ready to eat you and you closed your eyes tight with your hands covered around your head and waited for the end.

I want to do what I can to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: you little brat! You'll pay for getting in our way!

Tskune!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the posse's feet were frozen solid and you and Tskune were wisked into the air, by none other than Kurumu. Then a washtub hit bothof the class president's posses on the head knocking them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Mizore! Kurumu! Yukari! Thanks guys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It was my pleasure. These guys needed to chill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No problem Tskune! Geez and lose a couple of pounds would you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Take that you stupid poopy heads!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu then set you and Tskune down gently. Then the lizard recovered from their blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass President: Hey! Mind your own business kids! That kid is ours! Hand him over! Nobody wants him because he's a loner and a worthless good for nothing! If you turn him in now then we'll let you off the hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosse 2: Yeah.

Then you all can die with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune; Bring it on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the lizard men came at you prepared to kill. Then Tskune lost his balance due to his injury and then it happened. Tskune accidentally knocked off Moka's rosary. Then Moka transformed into her Inner vampire mode. This made you amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) what the hell? She....shes completely different than she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: That's Moka's true form. A vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen the lizard men saw this they were a little scared, but they charged at Moka anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Filthy trash. Know your place!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gave all three of them a powerful kick knocking all three of them flying into the lake. You were completely dumbfounded by this display of power.

Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Why what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Why did you all save me? I don't deserve it! After the way I treated you I thought it would be better if I just died! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore then gave you a slap in the face making you shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: You Idiot! Don't you dare say that again! DIdn't you hear Tskune?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: That's right. We saved you because we wanted too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: And we want to be there for you so you don't have to be lonely anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Most of all we want to be your friends.

Because were friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and everyone was smiling at you, even Moka in her inner vampire was smiling. Then Mizore came forward and gave you a big hug.<br>\r\nYou were overwhelmed by all this and were deeply moved. Then for the first time in your life you began to cry. Your heart of ice and hardened emotions began to melt. Tears streamed down your face as you sank to your knees bawling your eyes out. Everyone was pretty shocked about this even Moka, for this the first time you showed any emotion to them. You continued to cry as Mizore hugged you and stroked your head. And for the first time in your life you finally had friends. Friends that care about you and your life of being lonely has come to an end.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention they gave you a chance to be their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) Man. This is the first time I've had a friend like this. Tskune is pretty cool.and it's not just him, but Moka, Yukari, Kurumu, and Mizore too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you thought about Mizore. You remember what she did when you were crying.

Mizore did it to try and get you to realize that you meant alot to her even if you may have started off on a rocky start. But she knew there was something about you that made her so attracted to you. To her, wehn she was with you, she was home. You broke off the kiss and blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow..I......Mizore...\", was all you could utter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)...\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of had no idea what to say to each other after that with the emotions ridding inside you. You were about to kiss er again and see if it could spark her to say something but then you heard something from behind you causing you to turn your head.</span></div></div>",

She took your member and put half of it inside her mouth. It felt like a thunderbolt hit your body. She licked the glans and the base and put it in her mouth again. She sucked on it like she was eating a popsicle. You tried to keep your sense of reason, but the pleasure was winning the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Kuku. Looks like you are feeling good. I'll make it even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took your member and slipped it between her breasts. She moved her breasts up and down on your member making you grip the sheets.

You were completely out of breath and you couldn't even move. You still kept your sense of reason, but the orgasm did a number on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) Damn it! I have.....too.....fight it.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito sensing you were still resisting made her final move to finish you off. She got on top of you so that her vagina hug over your member.

On the outside you looked like you were drunk with pleasure, but in your mind....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) Please.....don't do it! As least let me give my virginity to Mizore!!

When I'm done with you the only person you're ever gonna want to have sex with is me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her vagina over your member and prepared to put it in her.

And why was she acting that she knew me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mizore was still running her tears ran down her face as she ran. Then she stopped and hid her secret hiding place. She sat and she cried. She felt so alone and sad. She kept remembering what Keito said which made her even more sad. She didn't want to believe it, but she couldn't help but think that Keito was telling the truth. She curled up into a ball and cried even more. Then she heard a voice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Hey.

Moka was completely surprised at this reaction, but she hugged Mizore and tried to help soothe her hurt feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: It's okay Mizore. I'm here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Oh Moka....(sniff) It's terrible...(sob).....(name).....(name) is.....(sniff)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Calm down Mizore. Take a deep breath and tell me what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you followed you and Keito walked toward a dark hallway in the back of the school. At first you were a little worried, but Keito urged you to follow her. Then she led you to a dark poorly it room. She knocked on the door and there was a voice from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Who goes there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: It's Keito. and I have a new recruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Recruit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opened and Keito led you inside. Inside there were people that had the exact same uniform as Keito. You figured that they were in the same grade, but you couldn't be more wrong. Then a tall man with glasses walked up to you and Keito making you a little nervous. For some reason you were sensing that there was heavy evil around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlasses guy: Mistress Keito, you're late<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: My apologies. I ran into some trouble, but I brought him like I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man saw you making your heart jump. Then surprisingly he bowed in front you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlasses boy: You're Mr. (name) right? We've been expecting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You have? For what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlasses boy: I'm afraid that is something only my master can tell you. Right this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lead you and Keito to another room. Everywhere you looked you could feel the other people in the room staring at you. You felt a little uneasy and you felt the need to run, but you kept on walking then. Then you were lead to a shrine and you and Keito were surrounded by other members. Then Keito stepped in front of you and spoke to you for the first time ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name). Do you know where we are? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Should I know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: This the hideout of the security committee. We keep the peace and bring out justice here in Yokai Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I see, but what does this have to do with me and you bringing me here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito flashed a smile traced you cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Remember how you beat up Saizo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remember that day. The day Saizo tried to beat you up before, but then you end up beating him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes. And?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I was watching you on that day. Youre stronger than the average person. You beat him up faster than he could blink. That's the reason why I fell in love with a big stud muffin like yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Look. I appreciate the compliments in all, but where are you going with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito then got close to your face and spoke in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name). I want you to join me. NO. Join the security committee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Think about it. WIith your power on our side nothing can stop the two of us from ruling this school! Everyone will be under our control!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That's why you brought me here? To join you? Thanks the offers interesting, but I don't do crowds. Even if I wanted to, I work alone. See ya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to walk away when Keito said something that made you stop in your tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Of course. You'll rewarded by your efforts for lending your power. You want to know more about your mother don't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) How the hell do you know that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I took the liberty of looking through your files. It's a shame.Your mom abandoned you when you were little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) She didn't abandon me! She just disappeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: That still doesn't change the fact that you were alone in your early years. Tell me (name). Would you like to see your mother again? Together we can find her and her back to you. All I ask is that you join the security committee and help us bring justice to Yokai Academy. There is no good or evil in all this, just power and keeping the peace. If you join us I guarantee that you'll have the information to find your mother. So....what do you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent for what seemed to be a long minute. Then you say.....</span></div></div>",

You must capture these targets no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the first folder and they contained pictures of Saizo and a few other people. You assumed that they were his buddies. The second one had photos of young guys from the soccer team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Pardon me for asking, but any particular reason why these are my targets?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: The first Saizo and his buddies have been ditching class lately. The boys in the second folder owes us money from a payment. The payment was due a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when you got to the third one you were about to open, but Keito stopped you from opening it and took it from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Don't open that just yet. I want you to open this one last. It's a special assignment only you can do. Got it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Y-yes. Got it. But hey! What should I do if they...I don't know resist? and what if the guys from the soccer don't have the money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito gave a devilish smile and whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Show them no mercy.

And one more thing when you complete these requests follow through the third no matter what. OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes. Of course my love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you left to find Saizo. You found him on the roof with his buddies. When Saizo and his buddies saw you, they weren't worried at first, but then when they saw you were a member of the security committee they tried to run. You chased after them and then beat the bloody hell out them without a second thought. After that you dragged them back to class and left them there in a heap. Next you headed for the soccer team. When you asked them for the payment they tried to wave you off, but then for some reason an evil feeling passed through your body. Then you started beating up everyone on the team. The boys pleaded and told you they'd get the money soon, but you didn't listen. You beat up everyone until they were all in another bloody heap. After that you went to see Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I have completed my assignments my love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Good. It's time for you big assignment. I want you to eliminate the person in that folder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the folder and you gasped in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No way.....you want me to....eliminate this person?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showed her the picture to make sure for the person on the photo was.....</span></div></div>",

It hurts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito saw what was going on and she was a little worried, but not for your sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Damn it! He's still trying to remember that snow bitch! I guess my charm wasn't strong enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she had an idea. An evil idea. A despicable awful idea. A very evil despicable awful horrible idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I'll just wipe his memory clean of Tskune and the other weaklings. I'll make it seem that they're the ones causing his brain to hurt. That will make him destroy them completely and then I'll have (name) all to myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out a weird potion and a tube of lipstick. She poured the potion on the lipstick and put it on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: This potion will not only put (name) under my control, but it will give him the strength to kill even that vampire bitch Moka! and especially that snow woman. Heheheh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran toward you and acted like she was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name). Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) This......this girl.....I've seen her before.....I....can feel it......rggghhh!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito cupped your chin and gently lifted your head to her face. Her eyes glowed and she activated her charm that was controlling you before. FIrst you stared at her and then you fell into a trance. Then Keito grew close and then she gave you a strong and passionate kiss that felt like a lightning bolt went through your body. You felt a numbing feeling inside you and then slowly you blacked out. Next you felt something wrong. You were falling into a dark pit and tnen everything was dark. Then you saw Moka, Tskune and the others smiling faces. They looked like they were evil and they wanted to hurt you. You were scared and ran away, but it felt like no matter what you did, you couldn't get away. Then you heard a voice. To you it sounded comforting and soothing. Unfortunately it was Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name). (name) Can you hear me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Keito? Is that you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Listen well (name). Those people that tried to hurt you, they are your enemies. Especially the snow woman Mizore. She is the ring leader of the group. She is the reason your memories are fuzzy. She messed up your memories because she wanted you to forget what she did to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm afraid to ask, but what did she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: It was horrible. She raped you and took your virginity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) SHE WHAT!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: That's right. You and I were once lovers. We loved each other very much. You were actually going to give your virginity to me She messed with your memories in hopes to make you forget what she did. In fact that's why your head hurts whenever you see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) How dare she?!? So she's the reason. What can I do to stop this pain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: There is one way. You must kill her and her friends. That's the only way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Then that's what I'll do. I'll make her and her friends pay!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a power surge through your body and the more angry you got, the more the power grew inside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Good. My kiss has given you the power you need to kill those despicable monsters that wronged you. When I count to three you will wake up and fulfill your mission. 1.............2..............3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen moment you said three you snapped back to reality and you were still kissing Keito. Keito lips left yours and she stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: So? Feel better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes. I feel a lot better. Thanks to you my love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempted to kiss Keito, but she stopped you by putting two fingers on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hehehe. I'm sorry, but the lovey dovey stuff will have to wait. You have a mission to do remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the photo of Mizore on the ground, picked it up and looked intently at it. Then you crushed it in your hand. Your face was filled with one emotion. Anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes. I do. I will eliminate...no....I'll will DESTROY MIzore and her friends, for taking what was supposed to be mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Keito heard this she laughed with glee while you stormed off to fulfill your mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Better look out Mizore.

And it's sure good to be back, my little snowflake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore's eyes filled with tears of joy. She was so happy that she gave you a big kiss. Unfortunately Keito saw the whole thing and she was mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name) what the hell are you doing!?!? I am your master! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Screw you being my master Keito! You controlled my body like a puppet and nothing more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: You fool! I was going to make you forget! I would have given you anything you wanted! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You took advantage of that. It's true i wanted to forget, but I never asked you to make me forget about my friends and forcing me to love you! I actually thought we could've been friends, but it's true what they say; once a bad guy always a bad guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Why you.....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Glad to have you back (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: About time you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Glad to be back guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Fine then! Since I lost my boyfriend I'll just have to destroy you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spit out a web toward you and Mizore but Moka blocked the webs. Moka and Keito were in a tug of war, but it was obvious who was winning. Inch by inch Moka pulled on the thread luring Keito toward her. Now Keito was getting a little worried. Then when Keito was close enough Moka ensnared her with her own webs. Keito struggled to get free, but even she can't break free of her own webs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hey! You can't do this to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: (name)?

For taking away what was important to me and for manipulating me and  for trying to make me hurt Mizore........I think it's time to know your place!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you jumped in the air and gave Keito a powerful punch knocking her out cold. After that Rubi and the Headmaster took Keito away to his office to give her a proper scolding. Then after that you went to your room to rest to try to take it easy. Reason being you may have gotten your memories back, but you also remembered the bad stuff. You also remembered the things that Keito did to you. You shuddered when you thought about it. For you knew eventually you had to tell Mizore what happened. Plus that was the reason that you got under Keito's spell in the first place, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Man. We may have beaten Keito, and I may have gotten my memories back, but that still doesn't change the fact that I lost my virginity to Keito. I'm gonna have to tell her eventually, but what if she hates me? She's gonna hate my guts. Wait a minute why am I making a deal about this? I mean it's no big deal right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you thought about it the more guilty and nervous you got. You rolled around on your bed hugging your pillow like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Damn it!! What should I do damn it! Should I tell her or not!!!

Come on in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou led Mizore to your bed and sat down on your bed. Meanwhile you sat down on a chair and tried to relax yourself, but you couldn't help but feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) S-s-so what's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I need to talk to you. It's about when you were mind controlled by Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you jolt up right, your muscles tensed up and you began to get nervous. Even though you got nervous you kept your trap shut and waited for Mizore to finish talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) And why did you want to talk to about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Well, Rubi and Kurumu talked to me about all the details about charms and such.and they told me that it takes a very strong and negative feeling to control a person depending on who they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) And?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'm saying that....something happened that made you have so much negative feeling that it overwhelmed you and gave Keito comeplete control over you. Something happened. What did she do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) N-n-nothing. It was just too strong that's all....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Please don't lie! I trust you and all, but even I know that you're lying. Something happened that made you fall under Keito's charm and I'm not leaving till you tell me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mizore said this you were at a complete loss for words. You didn't what you should do. If you told Mizore there was no telling how she would react. There was a possibility that her heart would be broken and that would screw up the relationship you had with her. To you that would be more heart breaking than having Keito control your mind. What should you do? Should you tell her or try to cover it up to not make her worry.</span></div></div>",

Moka led you to a giant tree by a fountain back at the academy and told you to wait by the tree to wait for Mizore. So you did. As you waited you felt nervous and scared about Mizore. You were worried that she would never forgive you. You sat by the tree and waited for Mizore to come, but you doubted that she'd look for you. Moka went off by herself and took out her cell phone. She made a phone call and told the person to meet her in the forest to help him get you and Mizore back together and she said she had a plan. Meanwhile Tskune leading Mizore to where you were and she was feeling a bit unsure herself. Then Mizore stopped and headed for a classroom and Tskune looked back to check on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Mizore? What's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Tskune. I don't think I can do this. I don't know if this'll work out. I'm still unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: OK. Mizore. Listen. You got to make up with (name). I know you don't trust him right now, but he regrets what he did too even though it wasn't his fault. I'd forgive him. Besides he was controlled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore didn't say anything. She was still unsure. Tskune was about to say something else to try to cheer her up, but then unexpected visitors arrived. It was Moka and an orange haired girl walking next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Kokoa!?! What are you doing here?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Nothing special. Big sister told me to help you get the snow woman back with some dude who broke her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: No way! Moka called you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yup. I sure did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa Yup. And I got a advice for the snow girl. Don't waste your tears on him. Forget about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yes. I'm afraid so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore said nothing , but Tskune had something to say about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hey Kokoa! You're not helping! We're supposed to be getting them back together not break them up! And Moka you're the last person to be saying that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh can it Tskune! If you ask me She's better off without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tskune saw Moka wink. At first he didn't get, but then he realized Moka had a plan. Kokoa was giving Mizore a small push.<br>\r\nForget about love.

She saw how sad you were and for some reason she began remembering the feeling of being in love with you. Then as the song goes on Mizore walks down the stairs to meet you by the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove really is revolting!<br>\r\nIt's even worse than when you're puking<br>\r\nEnough of this fluff!<br>\r\nJust forget about love!<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nI had almost forgotten the way it felt<br>\r\nWhen he held out his hand for mine<br>\r\nMy heart all a-flutter<br>\r\nKokoa<br>\r\nOh, how I shudder<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nHe'll be my  first kiss<br>\r\nKokoa<br>\r\nIt's better if it's missed.<br>\r\nForget about 'is touch<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nI can't forget about his touch<br>\r\nKokoa<br>\r\nIn the scheme of things,<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter much<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nIt matters so mu-uch<br>\r\nKokoa<br>\r\nYou're better on your own<br>\r\nA meal becomes a banquet<br>\r\nWhen you eat alone<br>\r\nMizore <br>\r\ndoo-do-mm-mm<br>\r\n[BOTH:]<br>\r\nLove's filled with compromises<br>\r\nKokoa<br>\r\nAnd don't you hate those big surprises?<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nA cozy rendezvous<br>\r\nKokoa<br>\r\nOh, please!<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nCandlelight for two<br>\r\nKokoa<br>\r\nOh, geez!<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nLook you're calling my bluff!<br>\r\n[BOTH:] <br>\r\n(I can't) (Just) forget about love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sitting next to the tree then you saw Mizore walking up to you. At first you were surprised, but then you were happy to see her, but you still felt regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore listen. I'm sorry. Even though I was being controlled, as a man I.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore then shushed you with one finger and then......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nI can't forget about my heart<br>\r\n(name)<br>\r\nI can't forget about my heart<br>\r\nMizore:<br>\r\nAnd how it felt<br>\r\nTo fall for you right from the start<br>\r\n(name)<br>\r\nI'm still falling<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nWhatever we may do<br>\r\n(name)<br>\r\nWhatever we may do<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nYou are here for me,<br>\r\nAnd I'll be there for you<br>\r\n(name)<br>\r\nI'll be there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[BOTH:] <br>\r\nTo wish, to want, to wander<br>\r\nTo find the sun<br>\r\nThrough rain and thunder<br>\r\n(name)<br>\r\nA cozy rendezvous<br>\r\nMizore<br>\r\nYes, please!<br>\r\n(name)<br>\r\nA night for just us two<br>\r\nKokoa<br>\r\nOh, to hell this!<br>\r\nEnough is enough!<br>\r\n[You and Mizore:]<br>\r\nWe can't forget about love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Mizore looked into each others eyes for a minutes then you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore. I'm sorry for everything that's happened and I know that you probably don't trust me still, but I was hoping that... you could give me another chance. No scratch that, giving us a chance. I understand if you don't want to, but you should....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mizore did the unthinkable. She gave you a big kiss on the lips. Your eyes opened wide in shock at first, but then you closed your eyes and got absorbed in the kiss. While Mizore was kissing you her tongue pressed against your lips begging for entry. Then as soon as you opened your mouth both of your tongues entangled in a deep french kiss. This went on for 3 minutes until you and Mizore separated. As you did a thin line of saliva connected your mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore......you......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hehehe. That was my first kiss. I'm glad it was you that stole it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I stole it? But you're the one who kissed me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore began to laugh and then you laughed too. This was a sign that you and Mizore had finally made up. Moka, Kokoa, and Tskune watched in the shadows feeling happy that you two made up. Well not Kokoa really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Good grief. I'm done with this mushy gushy crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Well it was thanks to you for giving them a push. Thank you Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa blushed bright pink and she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Oh shut up loser! I did it cause Moka asked me too OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Now Kokoa. Be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa: Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as for you and Mizore you and her decide to go out on a date for real this time by......</span></div></div>",

You will never even remember them but they will stay in you forever. Now when I count to three your mind will do everything I hhave commanded you. One...Two...Three.\", Kurumu ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she counted to three you were yourself again. Or at least you felt like it. But then when you saw Kurumu you had an inexplainable attraction to her now for some reason. She was attractive but now you were interested in her. But then she said the others were in trouble and that you two had to go save them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you found the others fighting Keito everyone was in their tru monster form. You saw Keito and you felt incredibly angry at her for what she had done to you. You ran over to her and hit her in the face sending her a few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?! I am your lover! They are the ones manipulating you!\", Keito pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You raped me and brainwashed me yet you claim that my friends are the ones using me? I thought you had changed!\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did! I changed for you! I love you! You wanted me to do it remember?!\", Keito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You manipulated that descision! you knew I'd be stricken with grief! I'll never forgive you! So now instead of having a friend..you have nothing but a tarnished repuattion.\", you claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to your friends with Mizore hugging you and kissing your cheek. You were happy to have recived it at all since she wasn't your first but it no longer mattered. You still felt feelings toward Mizore since Kurumu did not have you neglect those feelings. Whether it was a mistake or not it will appear you may fall for Kurumu more naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Mizore! I am so sorry...\", you pleaded for forgivness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen (Name)...I know it's sudden but I know...I Love You.\", hearing those words had you racing with joy. You hugged her tightly and kissed her face so many times it was just pure cuteness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too!\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu watched you two genuinly happy, but she felt guilt as she realized of what she had done to you in secret.

You were ready and charged at her knocking Moka out of the building. The two of you were in a heated fight outside the building which caused the entire school to watch with anticipation. Mizore ran to meet the others in hopes of making an antiodote for the spell that's making you a match for Moka and break the hold Keito has on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tskune! Where is- Yukari! Quick! Moka doesn't have much time!\", Mizore said frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari worked her magic as Mizore explained what she needed to do and by extension explain what happened to you. Yukari managed to create a potion to counteract the spell that augmented your strength. However if the allure over your mind wanted to be broken somebody would need to deploy the potion physically inside your body plus having your body at hyperactive levels of stress toward the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we do that last part?\", Mizore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he was under a large amount of pain or something to get his mind racing that could work.

(Name) is starting to brutally finish her off!\", Tskune yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside while the teachers attempted to keep the students from surrounding the fight they couldn't do anything to stop you from murdering Moka. You grabbed her by the neck and began striking her eye many times. But then Mizore came in and yelled \"STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! You took away something from me that I cherished. The thing that was special to me and my love. Yet you had the nerve to just idelly take it from me?! And treat me like a tool?!\", you yelled at Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) your wrong.

I can tell. Your heart is in the right place but it;s being mislead by Keito...please let me show you the truth.\", Mizore pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou secretly had a tazer in your back pocket which you were going to pull out when she got closer to you. But Moka saw it and made you electrocute yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\", you screamed in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see the images of your repressed memories flash before you. Keito's rape, her twisted hypnosis, but then you noticed that you saw images of your mother. Clues to why she disappeared even! When the electricution wore off your body was ried and your head hurt like a bitch!

Your virginity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No. Keito! Please! Haven't you had enough!?! You already took my first kiss! Please don't take my virginity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Oh no! I'm gonna enjoy this! I want you all for myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to get free, but Keito's webs prevented your escape. You were freaking out because you weren't ready to lose your virginity. It was bad enough that she took your first kiss, but now she wanted your virginity. More tears streamed down you face as you beg for Keito to stop. She wasn't listening to you. Her vagina grew closer and closer. And just when it was all gonna be over for your virginity. Something happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed, but it wasn't like a scream. It came out a fierce and powerful roar like a tiger. As you screamed a mirage of a tiger shadowed your face and you broke free of Keito's web. The force of your roar knocked back Keito so hard she hit the back of the wall and was knocked out. The roar echoed everywhere reaching as far as the dorms. You looked at your hands as they shook with fear and adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What.....What the heck did I just do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Never mind that! I got to find Mizore! I have to explain to her it was a mistake!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen you look and realize you were almost naked. You quickly put on your clothes and managed to sneak out of Keito's room. Then you look outside and realize it was night. Should you look for Mizore now? Or wait till tommorrow?</span></div></div>",

Mizore decided to pick a song which she loved since her childhood, she chose <i>Let it go</i>. Her voice was so heavenly along with that song you practically fell in love with her after that. She then wanted to do a song that you could have a duet in and that you both liked. You mentioned this one song that she was surprised that you knew at all but you two went along with it.

How come you know that song?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom used to sing it to me. She always would whenever I'd try to go to sleep.

Your kissed Mizore with great passion and love you never wanted it to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke it off and then you opened you eyes to see her...</span></div></div>",

(name) I was wondering....could I....take a bath with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a deep shade of red.

Then Mizore came in and soaked herself in the water but came very close to you, like you were giving off the heat she wanted.

You seemed to be made for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she began to wash you back giving you a large arousal at letting her rub her hands over your body. The inverse was the same when you washed her back.

They seemed to be brainwasing other students to spill their guts related to all sorts of things. And on top of that they were planting triggers in the students like sleeper agents. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Either the commission is overly paranoid about an attack on the school or maybe he's going to take it over.\"</i>, you suspected. Soon enough you followed Keito's captor and saw them meeting with the lamia they mentioned earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She needs to be fixed. Do what you will but be sure she is on our side again.\", said the same guy who talked to Keito earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I plant a trigger in her mind to be safe?\", said the lamia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I want to be certain she doesn't turn on us wether she is aware of it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well you may leave me to her.\", it turned out the lamia was Ririko Kagome. She must have given thecommission the names of all the lamia tudents which made sense. She wraped Keito up and inserted the flower appendage from her tail, to Keito's face. She began to have Keito braainwashed into serving whoever was behind this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Keito. Forget about this (Name). He is the enemy, he is nothing more than a human to simply get a decent amout of enjoyment from. But you do not love him.\", she ccommanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I DO!\", Keito resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have had a tton of self control if she could resist at all. You probably should save her but maybe you should come back when you brought along friends. That way you can storm the place and end this crazy scheme.

It was risky, but you knew it had to do. Then you heard Keito screaming less and less and when you looked back you saw that Keito was unconscious. Now was the time to put your plan into action. You grabbed the oil torch and then you threw it. It hit the ground with a crash and it burst into flames, spreading throughout the room. The lamia's began to panic including the one who was brain washing Keito. As soon as s.he let go of Keito you sprang into action!

Why don't you save yourself some trouble and we'll save you ugly face some trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me?!? ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamia 1: Yes? So what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were so mad steam was coming out of your ears and your face was as red as blood. Tskune, Mizore, and Keito watched with worry. Mizore especially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Oh boy. They called him the u word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Um Mizore. Just curious what happens when he's called the u word?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Well he told me he said that he kinda goes..........nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Um how nuts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you whispered at first and then you yelled like a mad man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I see. Hehehe. If you're gonna call me ugly then you should remember something. A lot of people are scared of me because I kicked their butts. and you know what they call me? THEY CALL ME MR. UGLY!!!!!!!!!   RRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore&lt; Tskune, and Keito watched as you charged at the lamias like a mad bull. Then the ground shook as you landed who knows how many blows at the lamia, beating up one after another. After the dust settled Mizore, Keito, and Tskune mouths dropped open in shock to see you standing on a pile on beaten up lamias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh wow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Did he just....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: No way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Heh. That's what you get you lamia jerks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped of the pile and then you tripped, rolled and fell flat on your face. Everyone did a face fault at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Are you kidding me!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: And to think he was being awesome too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got up and pretended that didn't happen.

Well now you will face the penalty. Lamia do your thing and have these mooks kissing your slimey tails.\", the boss ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second you heard that you realized you needed to cover your eyes and get out of their reach from their tails or else your a puppet. You, Kurumu, and Keito managed to evade the Lamia's dreaded hynotizing gaze and, brainwashing tail but everyone else wasn't so lucky. Moka has her face inside one of the brainwashing flowers on the laimia's tail and Tskune and Mizore fell victem to their enticing gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! They got Moka! She was our best weapon against them!\", Keito blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just sit there and yell! Book it!\", you said. Three of you ran out of the office and ran for the nearest exit but they were being overrun by lamia. Soon they were about to box you all in when Keito had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you get out through the window!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And leave you alone with a swarm of lamia?! Are you crazy?!\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it! I'll hold them off! Find my boss and restore security to the school! For me you handsome troublemaker.\", Keito said quickly kissing you on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your first kiss from Keito and while you didn't like her romantically she was sombody you were glad you helped. Plus she kissed real nice too. She broke it off and shoved you to Kurumu where she flew off out of the building leaving Keito to fend for herself. She took down a bunch of lamia but soon one of them grabbed her neck with it's tail chocking her them the rest of them restrained her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka, with her eyes reflecting spirals of color, came up to her saying, \"Tell me where they are hiding and I'll allow you to keep your will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take all your pathetic lamia's tails and shove them up your ass!\", Keito replied as if she was speaking to her boss which in a way she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Look into my eyes Keito.\", Moka said holding Keito's chin to her face. Keito tried to resist but the hypnotic spirals overwhelmed her and she gave in to them making her enslaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu and you saw what happend and you felt saddened by Keito's sacrafice. Youhad no idea where to find the leader behind this insanity and you were outnumbered and outmatched. \"What do we do Kurumu?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't quit. We find out where that coward is hiding and we end this!\", she said sparking your hope.</span></div></div>",

I'll keep fighting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I'll take the right if you'll take the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah! Let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kurumu took off in separate directions fighting all the lamia. Many tried to take over your mind, but you dodged all the attacks. Then you punched and kicked with all your strength knocking whoever got in your way. Meanwhile Kurumu flew up in the sky and slashed at all of her enemies with her long claws. You and Kurumu overwhelmed most of the lamias. Then came trouble. Just when you and Kurumu were gonna overwhelm the lamias suddenly the floor turned into ice. This made you lose your footing and you slipped, but luckily you kept your balance. You immediately knew who froze the floor. You turned around and there in front of you was Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Oh no. Mizore! What are you doing!?! I'm on your side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIzore didn't say anything. She silently raised her hand and several icicle spears appeared in the air and then she launched all of them at once at you. You manage to dodge them all, but just barely. One of them scraped your cheek and you froze. You wiped your cheek and looked at your hands and they were stained with blood. Even though she was being controlled Mizore was seriously trying to kill you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore! Snap out of it! It's me! (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot more icicles at you, but you dodged them again. You tried to make Mizore come to her senses, but the hypnosis was too strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name) Hold on! I'm coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu swooped down and made an attempt to save you, but that cost her big time. A Lamia wrapped her tail around Kurumu's leg and pulled her down and slammed her to the ground hard. Then before she had a chance to get away a lamia wrapped it's snake like body and Kurumu was trapped. Then before Kurumu had a chance to react the lamia hit her on the ground again and squeezed her in it's coils. Kurumu screamed in pain as the lamia squeezed the life out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No! Kurumu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name)......Save.....yourself......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) NO! They got Kurumu too!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen while you were distracted Mizore fired more shards of ice at you. This time you got hit with the attack full blast. The attack blew you back and you hit the wall hard knocking the wind out of you. You had ice needles all over your body and trust me they didn't tickle. Mizore as well as Tskune, the others, and the lamias were surrounding you and you had no where else to go. You wanted to fight back, but you didn't want your friends to get hurt. Especially Mizore.<br>\r\nYou were completely helpless and you couldn't do anything. Not to mention Kurumu couldn't save you either. You were completely on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: (name) It's time for you to join us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yes. Our master will love it if you join us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) what the hell are you saying?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Mizore. The master wants you to teach this boy what happens if he refuses to join us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: As you wish. (name) if you join us the master will let you live and you will get to be with me. If you don't....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glowed and her claws extended. You were a little scared, but you stood your ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore please! You have to snap out of it! You and the others are being controlled! Please fight it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore then slashed at you on your right arm making you scream with agony. You held your right arm as blood oozed from your arm.The lamias and Tskune and the others were loving the show. They cheered for Mizore to keep hurting you. So she did. She slashed at your left leg making you scream even more and to top it off she punched you in the gut making you cough blood. You were feeling sick and woozy due to the loss of blood, but you didn't give in. You stood up again battered, bloody, but unbeaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamia 1: You gotta be kidding! He's still getting up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamia 2: He's a glutton for punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamia 3: Why doesn't he just die already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Stop it! This isn't fair! He can't even fight back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamia 3: Shut it bitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamia holding Kurumu squeezed hard to  make her shut up. She screamed in pain as her face was turning slightly pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) K-kuru-mu.......no.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen MIzore grabbed you by the throat and her hand turned into an ice blade and pointed it dangerously at your throat. If she even moved it even in the slightest bit you're a goner. The lamias and all the people that were being controlled were cheering for Mizore to finish you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: The master is giving you one more chance. If you join us the master promises to heal your wounds and you'll live in peace. If not....then he will order Mizore to kill you where you stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely dazed due to the loss of blood. You were also too scared now because the one you love was hurting you and killing you. While she was holding you by the neck a single tear fell down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore. Please......wake up........this isn't the real you.....the real Mizore......wouldn't hurt me like this........she would never.....be taken over that easy. Please......wake up.......come back........I need you.........I'm scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were talking tears streamed down your face. Then Mizore raised her ice sword and prepared to strike the final blow. Then what happened next no one knows. Perhaps you were too scared because you were gonna die or perhaps someone was looking out for you. Anyway something happened.</span></div></div>",

Inside her mind she  was alone in the dark and saw the lamia wiith it's enticing eyes. But then something got her to take her away from them, someone to focus on. She turned away and saw you. You held out your hand and she accepted. Then the memories of the two of you rushed back to her and then reality snapped back for her. She was freed from the hypnosis and stopped herself from killing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what she was doing she threw the ice dagger at the lamia holding Kurumu. The lamia screamed in pain realesing Kurumu. The other one in fear and confusion realesed her and she then slashed at them with her long claws. Mizore froze them and shattered the ice causing their bodies to implode. Moka and the others simply stared off like they were in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka clapped slowly,\"Bravo. Never has a single being been able to resist hypnosis from a lamia AFTER being hypnotized. You never cease to surprise me. But it ends here. You wouldn't dare hurt your friends and there is nothing to break them all out of my control.\", the boss said through Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wrong.\", Kurumu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore froze Moka and the others in place, then Kurumu focused her powers and concentrated. She then opened her eyes and let out a powerful wave of her allure. Her power and will was counteracting the lamia's and it was working. In a few more moments the others were then under Kurumu's control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you Kurumu.\", they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh Kurumu was that you just messing with them?\", Mizore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the only way I can quickly overpower the hypnosis was by having their minds believe the truth.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\". you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the most beautiful thing they have ever seen.\", Kurumu answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allright let's get them back to normal and take the fight to this boss.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I can't. If I keep them like this then they wont turn against us so they need to stay infatuated with me.\", Kurumu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of-\", Mizore unfroze Moka, Tskune, Ruby, Yukari, and...where was Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that Keito had escaped while you three were distracted. Great..as if things couldn't get any worse. You turned around and saw that everyone was on Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd glady be a lesbian for you Kurumu!\", said Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please I'll give you the gift of giving birth!\", Takune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka and Ruby were just rubbing their heads on her breasts making Kurumu feel real awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought the nonsense you pulled with those geeks at the start of last year was more weird.\", Mizore commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you guys we need to stay focusesed and take back the school.\", Kurumu commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kurumu.\" they said all lovey dovey.</span></div></div>",

You were still beaten up pretty bad so Mizore managed to help to your feet and carry you. Meanwhile everyone else fought off all the armies of lamia. Even Moka in her outer form was fighting with all she had. Soon all the lamia armies were defeated and stopped and now the only thing that was left is to find the boss and rescue Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Looks like the only thing left to do is take out the boss and all of this crazy madness will end. Ugh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou body stung with pain. You were still feeling the effects from Mizore attacking you. Mizore was quickly before you side and lent you her shoulder in case you fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name) are you OK? You shouldn't be moving around so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No way....I have to see this through till the end. I can't give up till I rescue Keito. Arghh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced in pain as the blood gushed a little from your body. Mizore was now feeling terrible for what happened to you. Kurumu had Rubi and Yukari were their magic to heal you. Unfortunately you could still feel the pain, but you stayed strong and tried to fight back the tears of pain. Mizore watched  you wince in pain. She felt very terribly sorry for what she did to you. So much that her eyes filled with tears and hugged you tightly, but gently so she wouldn't make the pain even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'm so sorry! It's all my fault! Because of me you're hurt! I'm sorry! I'm.....mmmphh!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make her stop crying and saying sorry you stole her lips with a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It's OK. It wasn't your fault. You were just being controlled. I'm just glad you're back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Mizore looked each other lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name)......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kurumu cut in on the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey! Enough you two! I get enough of the lovey dovey from Tskune and Moka as it is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she yelped in pleasure and surprise for Moka has gotten a firm hold on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Oh Kurumu! You're ta tas are so big! They're like two soft mini watermelons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Ahhhhh! Moka! Stop that! This isn't the time to be........(gasp)!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Mizore looked on, Kurumu was getting felt up by everyone she cast her love charm on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu....We hate to ask you this, but....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Aren't you doing the same thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No! Definitely not! This isn't.....Ahhhh! Tskune! Everyone stop it!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was feeling Kurumu left and right and you and Mizore were blushing a little. It was funny and yet some what arousing. Soon you were heal and all better, but you weren't out of the woods yet. All of a sudden you heard a loud voice over the loudspeaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoss: Hello little kiddies. Are you having fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: What the....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It's him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoss: I'm impressed that Mizore broke free of my lamia's hypnosis and I'm even more impressed that Kurumu was able to manipulate my whole army by herself. I would expect nothing less of a succubis. You all would make worthy servants in my conquest of the whole academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Drop dead you psycho!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah! We'd never join your evil plot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoss: Oh no? Oh I think you will. See if you refuse to serve me......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the voice immediately changed to a voice that made to jump. It was Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name) If you can hear me forget about me! Get out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoss: Shut it you! You're still under punishment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a blow hit and then you all heard Keito scream in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Keito! Let her go you bastard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoss: Heheehehe If you want her back, come to the auditorium and surrender to me. Just try to rescue her if you dare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name) What do we do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You need to ask? We go save Keito!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: But it's obviously a trap. Eeep!

Let's do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I know I'm gonna regret this, but that goes for me too. Dah! Rubi! Would you cut that out?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubi: We'll go anywhere you go Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name sweatdrop) Well...at least we have an army to back us up at least. Hehehe. Anyway let's go kick some ass! Is everyone with me?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: YEAH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you all arrived at the auditorium.

It was the boss that was controlling all of you, but luckily he or she was knocked out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) All right! You caught the boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Well done (name). That was quick thinking. Although.....(looks at you) you could've been a little more modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It was the only thing I could think of OK?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: It may have worked, but couldn't you find another way?

I have to pass a test tomorrow and if I fail, I'll fail the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That's quite a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Especially since you're a snow woman. You're sensitive to heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Maybe you can cook something else? Like a fruit salad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I can't. The teacher Mrs. Apsara told me it has to be curry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But...why curry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: That's how she is. She grew up in India and she's practically obsessed with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I'll say. So what'll we do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: What's the point? I'm a failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to help Mizore, because she was depressed. I mean you were boyfriend after all. Then you had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey I have an idea. Why don't.......</span></div></div>",

You made sure that while Mizore would have to face the heat of an oven during the test it was best to handle it just for the night. You went over the dish step by step and tried explaining it as best you could for Mizore. During the first hour it was long and arduous for Mizore but after she looked over the rest of the steps while you coached her through the last few she had it down fairly well. In the end the curry was made and was done to perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent job Mizore. If this tastes half as good as tomorow then you'll probably beat everyone in your class.\", you congradulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you (Name) but I'd have never gotten here without you.\", she kissed you cheek making you blush. \"I don't mind cooking for you when we get married.\", she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are still young and as I said before, I love you as you are with or without cooking at your long list of skills. Or if it comes down to it we could have curry for the rest of our lives if thats the only thing we know how to cook.\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm! Your really funny somethimes. Makes me wonder why you were so...well different when you first came here.\", Mizore pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I changed alot when my mother disappeared. But, now that you came into my life, maybe my old self is starting to resurface. Maybe we complete each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....want to...uhhh.....have dinner with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nearly ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean..want to stay tonight.

You gently placed your hands on Mizore and looked at her as calmly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Are you sure about this Mizore? Once we do it there's no going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I know. It's fine. I'm prepared for this. I want to be one with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But I....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Please? Don't worry about getting me pregnant. I'm on my period. I was told that the chances a woman can get pregnant during her period get slim. So there's nothing to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK. Let's take this to the bed then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore slowly nodded signaling that she was ready. She took off her clothe till she had nothing, but her bra and panties. You led her to the bed and she lied down on it. Then you lied on top of her and looked into her eyes. She was shivering with anticipation as well as nervousness. You hug her tightly, but gently to stop her from shivering. She was breathing a little fast, but she was calming down. Her nervousness went away little by little. Then she spoke in a shaky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (n-n-name) Please be gentle. It's...my first time after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It's okay. I'll be as gentle as I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you gently kiss Mizore on the lips. Mizore moaned a little in the kiss and hugged you tighty. You sucked on her supple and and somewhat cold lips. Then when she slightly opened her mouth you inserted your tongue in her mouth and began the french kissing. Mizore's wrapped around yours as you and her kissed like the was no tomorrow. Then you moved your hand to her chest. When you did Mizore moaned a little louder in the kiss. You massaged her breast, but didn't squeeze to hard. You wanted more, so you pulled up her bra and breasts popped out. You placed your hand on her bulge and began to massge her breast in little circles. Mizore moaned even more and began to breathe heavily. You felt a stiff piece of flesh push on the palm of her hand. You moved your hand away to see that Mizore's nipple was hard. You gently pinched it with your thumb and index finger. A sweet moan escaped from Mizore's throat as you pleasured her body. Her mouth tasted sweet, her fragrance smelled sweet, and her body was cold and yet for some reason warm. Her nipples grew bigger and harder until it was the size of the tip of your pinky finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore...your nipples are hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: D-d-don't say that idiot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe averted her eyes, but could see that she was blushing bright red. She was so cute that you wanted to see her cute face more, so you applied your mouth to her breast. You take it in your mouth and sucked it like a baby. Mizore yelped in surprise and moaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Waaaahhh! Don't do it so strongly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sucked on her nipple so strongly she began to buck. To keep her still, you gently pushed her down on the bed and continued to suck. Mizore resisted at first, but then she got into it. Her moans turned sweet and captivated as you sucked her nipple. Sucking on her nipple was great in all, but now it was time for the big leagues. You slowly move your hand down her stomach and then you reach her crotch. She instinctively closed her legs to stop you, but you were quicker and managed to slide your hand between her thighs. You touched the spot between her legs with one finger. A deep sigh escaped her lips as your fingertip rubs across a slight damp spot on her underwear. You removed her panties and inserted one of your fingers in her. Mizore yelped in surprise as you wiggled your finger inside her. She gripped the sheets as she moaned and let the pleasure go wild inside her. Then you take out your finger and look at Mizore. She was flushed in a bright shade of pink and her chest is heaving. Now was time for the main event. Before you went any further you asked Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore? I'm going to put it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: OK....be gentle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted your weight and positioned yourself between her legs. You readied your dick and push it in the opening between her legs. You made sure the aim was perfect and pushed forward. When you did Mizore's body tensed up and gritted her teeth. You run into something that blocked your way as you enered. You pushed a little harder and your dick slides into her with a single stroke. It felt lukewarm because of her being a snow woman and her warmth in her vagina.  You looked at Mizore and you see that her eyes were squeezed shut and tears were in the corner of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore? Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Y-yes. I'm fine. It hurt a little. but it feels good now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Do..you want me to move?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes. but slowly OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and then you slowly began to move. You could feel it moving inside h er. It felt amazing! Her vagina rubbed the tip perfectly and had the perfect pressure. Every time you thrusted, a sharp sensation ran through your body. You were already pretty close to coming. You grind your teeth and suppressed it. Mizore was gripping the sheets as the pain slowly turned to pleasure. Her breasts bounced with every thrust you gave her. Her panting became more passionate and her eyes were filled with lust. Seeing this you speed up a little more. You moved slowly, but in big thrusts.This made Mizore moan even louder and she wrapped her arms around your neck. Soon a numbing sensation began to build up inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore....I'm gonna.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I know....(moan)....Go for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you couldn't take anymore as you came. Before you ejaculated you hurriedly pulled out from her body. You ejaculate and you sperm flew onto Mizore's stomach. Mizore screamed with pleasure signaling that she came too. Feeling bad for ejaculating on her you wipe her clean with a tissue. Mizoew heaved a contented sigh as you clean her up. Later you both lie down and rested for while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Sorry about that Mizore. You know for cumming on you. You okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore looked at you and gave you a heartfelt smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'm fine. I'm still stinging a little, but I'll be fine. It'll be better next time. Next time....I want to cum with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a little and hugged Mizore tand enjoyed her warmth. She may have been a snow woman, but she was very warm and comforting. Soon you fell asleep with Mizore in your arms.</span></div></div>",

It was clear why was so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I did it! I did it everyone! I passed!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Way to go Mizore!

Tskune was fine but not very good compared to Moka. However whenever they both sang in duets they were remarkably well. Moka sang her favorite song <i>Aki Jounetsu</i> it was sung beautifly and admitadley made you blush a bit making you feel a very small crush on Moka but nothing to any real extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore sang an old song that she used to love from way back when in her childhood, <i>Strangers Like Me</i>. She was always curious about how humans lived and since she just accomplished something that they are accusmed to she felt proud of herself and thought that this song felt oddly appropriet to explain how she feels having taken her first step into eventually integrating herslef into the human world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you do, I'll do it too<br>\r\nShow me everything and tell me how<br>\r\nIt all means something<br>\r\nAnd yet nothing to me <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see there's so much to learn<br>\r\nIt's all so close and yet so far<br>\r\nI see myself as people see me<br>\r\nOh, I just know there's something bigger out there <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanna know, can you show me<br>\r\nI wanna know about these<br>\r\nstrangers like me<br>\r\nTell me more, please show me<br>\r\nSomething's familiar about these strangers like me <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery gesture, every move that he makes<br>\r\nMakes me feel like never before<br>\r\nWhy do I have<br>\r\nThis growing need to be beside him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoo, these emotions I never knew<br>\r\nOf some other world far beyond this place<br>\r\nBeyond the trees, above the clouds<br>\r\nI see before me a new horizon <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanna know, can you show me<br>\r\nI wanna know about these strangers like me<br>\r\nTell me more, please show me<br>\r\nSomething's familiar about these strangers like me <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome with me now to see my world<br>\r\nWhere there's beauty beyond your dreams<br>\r\nCan you feel the things I feel<br>\r\nRight now, with you<br>\r\nTake my hand<br>\r\nThere's a world I need to know <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanna know, can you show me<br>\r\nI wanna know about these strangers like me<br>\r\nTell me more, please show me<br>\r\nSomething's familiar about these strangers like me <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...I wanna know <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she sang the last few verses she took your hand and pulled you into a large loving hug with her face resting on your chest. Moka awwed at the two of you with Tskune simply chuckling at the cutness you were both giving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to sing one more song to Mizore so you gently pulled out of the hug and picked up the mic and cleared you throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go through life, you'll see<br>\r\nThere is so much that we<br>\r\nDon't understand<br>\r\nAnd the only thing we know<br>\r\nIs things don't always go<br>\r\nThe way we planned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you'll see every day<br>\r\nThat we'll never turn away<br>\r\nWhen it seems all your dreams come undone<br>\r\nWe will stand by your side<br>\r\nFilled with hope and filled with pride<br>\r\nWe are more than we are,<br>\r\nWe are one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamily, family <br>\r\nWe are one (2x)<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIf there's so much I must be<br>\r\nCan I still just be me,<br>\r\nThe way I am?<br>\r\nCan I trust in my own heart,<br>\r\nOr am I just one part<br>\r\nOf some big plan?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEven those who are gone<br>\r\nAre with us as we go on<br>\r\nYour journey has only begun<br>\r\nTears of pain, tears of joy<br>\r\nOne thing nothing can destroy<br>\r\nIs our pride, deep inside<br>\r\nWe are one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamily, family <br>\r\nWe are one (2x)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are one, you and I<br>\r\nWe are like the earth and sky<br>\r\nOne family under the sun<br>\r\nAll the wisdom to lead<br>\r\nAll the courage that you need<br>\r\nYou will find when you see<br>\r\nWe...are...one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(One one one)<br>\r\nFamily, family <br>\r\nWe are one (repeat) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was both a shout out to Mizore and Tskune and Moka, saying all four of you are family. But it was more personal to Mizore clearly. After you finished singing she dove at you and snogged your face cutley but aggressivly. Moka and Tskune left the room leaving you two alone in Mizore's living room but they took refuge in her bathroom for a solid half hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unprepared by Mizore's aggresive advancment on you but when you got used to her lips and tongue exploring your own mouth you followed her lead and returned her affection. Your hands slowly stroked her back and head but did not make any movements that would make it go any farther. You merly enjoyed the simplicity of just having her skin against yours and her love reciprcatting your feelings toward her. It was one of the few memories of you and her that you can't forget aside from the moment you two LITERALLY are one. (Which may be sooner than they think)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We got to go and help her!\", she bolted to the door but Keito stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that and you'll wind up as crazy as those people outside. You won't be able to unless we can formulate an antidote. Besides theres another airborn substance being inserted in this part of the building. It could be fatal if inhaled.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the fear gas? Isn't it fatal as that? Plus is this room air tight?\", Tskune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No and Yes, the fear toxin isn't entirely fatal it's only as dangerous as the fear of the victem unless they commit some acts of violence which right now is the cause of alot of violence out there. The room is airtight so we'll be safe but we have a limited clean air supply. Unless we know or better get the other formula out of this section of the building then we'll be in deep trouble.\", Keito explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we extract a sample of that gas and expose it to someone?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theoretically yes but we'd be wasting precious air but it is extraordinarily dangerouse.\", Keito warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to know what that stuff is out there so........I'll expose myself to what's out there I voulenteer.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutley not!

Mizore at first got into the kiss, but then she controlled herself and pushed you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name)! What the hell are you doing?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Come on. I wanna do it!

My guess whoever was behind this knew that we were all in here and thought if we lost our senses  this way we'd be less likely to wise up that we were being drugged. (Name) better be fine after that because I swear if he foddles my breasts again I will honestly kick him where it hurts.\", Keito explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK we know what's inside and out so what? Why couldn't we just use gas masks or something?\", Tskune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we had any don't you think we'd use them genius? No we went for them the moment we saw the fear gas but they were stolen so we got set up here. But don't worry this is good.\", Keito answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Sexually predatorial monsters inside a dorm building with a toxic fear inusing gas right outside this very same building with said monsters, all orchastrated by somebody who we don't have any idea where he is, is all sunshine and rainbows?\", Tskune said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might want to ease off if you want to have sex again any time soon. And to clarify why I said that, if we just had someone who has enough to resist the gas inside and make it to the ventilation system and suck the gas outside we can co-ordinate a way to stop this ounce and for all. But it should'nt be you or (Name).\", Keito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense but guys are too easily weak to that stuff as (Name) demonstrated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right Tskune if Kurumu were here she'd be able to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually that's our only problem. Kurumu last time I checked while a couple of students were being affected by this stuff, she's snatching everyone in here, male and fe-male into having sex with her. The aphrodisiac must be setting her natural impulses into overdrive and with how strong it is, it's only a matter of time before she bothers breaking in here and taking us. Whoever goes out there has to do it fast and stealthy. Moka, Mizore?\", Keito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I could be stealthy vampire's are naturally like that especially at night.  could avoid Kurumu, but I can't be sure if I last long enough out there. Maybe about fifteen minutes at best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I could make it there faster with how slippery and cold hearted I am I can shake off the stuff for longer than Moka can but...around Kurumu.......well I don't know if I'd make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen this isn't a popularity contest. You both know where the ventalation system is we so you should be fine and theres no shame in any of you not resisting Kurumu while she's like this. But we can send only one of you, it gives us a back up option in case one of you breaks plus we'd lose too much clean air by sending both of you at the same time then (Name) and Tskune would be in a threesome.\", Keito stated. \"So ladies, who goes?\"</span></div></div>",

Every time she knocked out one more and more came. To make matters worse Mizore's Ice mask was beginning to wear off. She began to feel weak and turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: D-damn it....I have to.....shut it down....before....it's too late.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw it. The door to the ventilation room. Her job was almost complete and she was almost there. She staggered into the room and saw a giant machine. It was creating all the gas that was going around the school. Mizore's job was almost done. She just needed to destroy the machine. Unfortunately every step she took her body grew more and more hotter. She began to finger herself, but then she stopped herself and focused on the task at hand.

The machine was destroyed with a mighty boom and the gas stopped. Now all Mizore had to do was exspell the gas inside the building. She reached for the switch to exspell the gas, but her vision began to get blurry. By now she was too weak to stand. The gas was getting to her, but she kept her wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Come on....! Almost there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached and she reached until she hit it! All the air began to come back into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes.....I......did it.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore took one more breath and then fell unconscious. While was knocked out someone stepped over her and lifted her up and carried her out of the room. Meanwhile you all waited in anticipation and worry for the gas to disspell. Then the air began to get clearer and the gas began to disappear. One of Keito's subordinates looked outside to be the lookout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubordinate: Miss Keito!

You're all alone with no one to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You're wrong! I'm not alone! I'm....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt yourself falling and falling until you hit on the hard and solid ground. You got up and looked around. You were surrounded by nothing, but complete and utter darkness. Then you heard the voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Heheehehehe. You may think you're strong when your friends are around, but without them you're nothing! You're nothing, but a waste of space!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen dark figures surrounded you and then they turned to Mizore, Moka and the rest of the gang. They all surrounded you and started yelling and screaming mean things to you. You tried to not to listen, but their words echoed in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Pathetic! You're a loser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: You don't deserve to have friends!|<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: You're nothing, but a waste of space!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I don't even want to be near you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I should've killed you when I had a chance!!

There standing before you was the last person you didn't and at the same you wanted to see. It was your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): M-mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: Son. I never loved you!! You're nothing, but the scum on my shoe! You're weak and you don't deserve to be my son! Just go and die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard these words your heart literally broke and you stopped breathing. The voice laughed at you and sneered at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Hahahaah!!!! You see? Even your mother didn't love you!!! That's why she's left you all alone with your father!! You're destined for one thing!!! Being alone!!! HAHAHHAHAHAAHA!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else laughed with the voice making you even more scared and even more alone. You covered your ears to try to douse the noise, but it still rung in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) STOP IT!!!!! STOP IT!!!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the laughing and the insults didn't stop. Tears streamed down your face as the laughing and insults continued.

Then you managed to find a room and locked the door. You looked around and it was completely dark. You clawed around trying to find a switch to turn on the light in the room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later at the hot springs, everyone had a great time relaxing in the hot springs and playing game. Unfortunately you weren't having fun. Mizore was still mad at you. Or at least you thought so. Every time you looked at Mizore, she looked away. This made you feel even more depressed. You tried to apologize to her, but she just kept walking away from you. Eventually you decided to take a soak in the hot spring to get your mind off of things. All you could think about was Mizore, even if you tried to get her off your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Man. Mizore couldn't even talk to me. I wish I could try to get through to her. Maybe......I deserve it. I mean....after all I did kiss Keito and Kurumu. Even though it was because of the drugs. I'm the worst kind of man. I completely ignored how Mizore felt. I probably deserve punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard something in the bushes of the hot spring. You immediately stood up and put on your towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Who's there?!? Come out! I know you're there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a voice. It was the sound of a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Well, well, well. Lookie here. A broken hearted little boy looking for punishment. I can arrange that for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Who are you?!? Show yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen from the bushes a young woman stepped out from the darkness. She had long black hair and her eyes were violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Who are you? What do you want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) I only came to give you what you asked for. To kill you. After all it is my job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to react she was in front of you and punched you in the gut knocking the wind out of you. You gasped as you tried to catch your breath. The woman tried to punch you again, but this time you dodged it. She kept punching and punching and you kept dodging and dodging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Not bad little boy. You actually have some skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Damn! She's way to strong. At this rate, she's gonna kill me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) What's wrong? Are you going to keep dodging? There's no point. You're weak. You don't deserve to have that girl. That's why she dumped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words hit you even harder than her punches. This made you even more depressed and that made you lower your guard. The woman took that opportunity to hit you in the face, then a roundhouse kick in the face, then super punch in the face making you slam into a rock. You coughed up a little blood, but you didn't move. The woman walked up to your body and stepped on your back like she conquered a war. Then she created a spear of light with her hands and pointed it directly at your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Aww. This is boring. Finally decided to accept your punishment? That makes my job a lot easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) This isn't enough. This is nothing compared to the suffering in Mizore's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) If you're looking for someone to blame, why not blame yourself? After all you were born with that thing inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Rgghhh. I don't know what you're talking about, but....... I deserve whatever's coming. Do what you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Very well. If you wish to die, then who am I to stop you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and waited to the punishment to continue, then.......</span></div></div>",

First off, why are you here? And what do you mean I was born with something inside me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Hmm. For a boy you sure are pretty shrewd. Sorry to break it to you, but I'm afraid you don't need to know. After all you're going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mizore was still sitting silently alone by a lake. She couldn't go into the spring because the heat would make her sick. She had a mixture of feelings blurring around in her head. She was still mad at you, but she couldn't stop thinking about what Keito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'm still mad at him, but.... maybe I should apologize to (name).

I'll go find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore got up and went to find Kurumu and Keito. Meanwhile as for you and unfortunately you were still getting the crud beaten out of you. You did your best, but that wasn't enough. You were knocked flat on your back and the woman loomed over you.

It's sad to see a cute boy in a towel, but I'll tell you something before you die. This is revenge for what you did to my Okuto-chan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That crazy pervert that tried to rape Mizorre!?!? You must be out of your mind to be avenging that guy! He's nuts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) You shut up! Like you have room to talk.

You're no different from Okuto-chan! That's why that snow woman is mad at you! In fact I wouldn't be surprised that she would consider you dumping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard these words you felt that your heart got smacked by a giant hammer. Her words hit you like a ton of bricks. You were so depressed that your eyes began to lose focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) She would.....dump me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Yes. She would. I'll tell you what. I'm feeling generous today. I can take away all that pain and depression. Just say the word and I'll can give you the punishment you deserve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything. You were still shocked by what she said. The woman took that opportunity to make another spear of light and prepared to strike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Sorry that it had to come to this, but I can't let you live with that thing inside you.

Mizore return the kiss with a passion. As you kissed her your hand slowly made it's way down Mizore until it reached her butt. You gave her butt a gentle, but hard squeeze making moan in the kiss. Then you began feeling her soft and supple breasts. They weren't too big or too small. They were just right and perfect for you. You took one of her nipples and sucked on it like a baby. Mizore began moan louder and hugged your head intensifying the pleasure. Then she stopped you by pulling your head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Aww! I wanted to suck some more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hahaha. You sure like my breasts huh? But now it's my turn to suck on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But....my nipples don't look that.....wait you mean....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore slowly nodded and blushed. Then you realized what she wanted to suck. Your face had gone from apple red to scarlet shop. You blushed so red that steam came out from your head and ears like a tea pot. Mizore had you sit on a rock near the edge on the spring. At first you hid your nether regions because you were embarrassed. Mizore couldn't help, but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey! What's so funny?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hahaha. I'm sorry. It's just you're so cute when you're embarrassed. It's okay. I promise I'll be gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) O......OK......be gentle....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly opened your legs and revealed your nether regions to Mizore. When Mizore saw it, it was like she was a deer caught in the headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Is um.....something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Your......thing...... It's huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know why, but you felt extremely embarrassed and instinctively covered your face with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) D-d-don't look at it so much! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hahaha. Don't be so embarrassed. After all we are lovers. Now then..... let's get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently grabbed your shaft and begin to gently knead it. Now it was your turn to begin moaning. You felt tiny prickles of pleasure go through your body as Mizore played with your tall mast. Her temperature was surprisingly normal for a snow girl. As Mizore continued to feel your shaft you closed your eyes and let the pleasure wash all over you. You were a little embarrassed, but at the same time it felt good and you thought it couldn't get any better. Then all of a sudden you felt a wet sucking feeling on your shaft that sent a shock of pleasure through your body. You open your eyes and they went wide with surprise. Mizore was doing the unthinkable! She was sucking on your shaft!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore! What the....(moan)!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't finish your sentence because Mizore began sucking on your shaft hard making you moan. She moved her head up and down making it slide in and out of her mouth. As she rhythmically moved her head, wet noises could be heard. You moan even louder and clenched your fists and gritted your teeth with pleasure. Then because this was your first blowjob ever and Mizore was sucking hard, the pleasure built up inside you couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore! I'm.....I'm gonna come!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this Mizore back away and with one final moan coming from you, you came. Your cum sprayed on Mizore's face. Your body went limp as you reveled in the pleasure. Mizore used a towel to wipe her face off and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Wow (name). I knew you were sensitive, but I didn't know you were that sensitive. Hehe. It's kinda cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't tease me. Otherwise I'll go crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'd love to see you try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That can be arranged! haha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou playfully grab Mizore and lied her down. Then in a single swoop, you shoved your shaft in Mizore's vagina. Mizore yelped in surprise and held on tight by warping her arms around your neck and her legs around your waist. You pumped in her like mad and Mizore moaned loudly with every thrust you gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Oh my.....(moan) It's so big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm just getting started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrust even faster and harder making Mizore moan seductively and even more louder. You could tell she was loving the feeling because her vagina got wetter and tighter. Soon you were close to coming and Mizore was too. She gripped you tighter and moaned even louder. Then you couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore! Here I go again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out and then you came. Your cum went all over Mizore's stomach. At that moment Mizore screamed and trembled signaling that she came. After that you both rested on each other enjoying each others warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Whew. Man (name). You weren't kidding. You did went wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Whew, You were pretty crazy yourself. We have to do this more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mizore nuzzled in your chest and gave you the cutest smile ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I love you (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me too. Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you two kissed one final time below the moon in the starry sky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside Keito's office she was going through the reports of last nights recent suicide trying to make sense of it. The victem hung himself and left a suicide note saying \"I have nothing left to live for\", while it seemed normal Keito wasn't satisfied. She struggled in frustration with the lack of evidence to support her claims and began to have a heache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her head on her desk and groaned in a mix of pain and frustration. When she raised up her head she looked at a picture she had of you. It was of you and her hanging out after the lamia crisis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her arm wrapped around your neck but you had both of your hands on your waist posing for the picture. You had a smile that showed off your pride, while Keito had a smile like she finally was being loved by you, despite you rejecting her attempt at making you her boyfriend. Keito smiled and felt that despite the road block she wouldn't give up on her instinct and decided to head over to the crime scene herself to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she made it to the crime scene she looked around to see what the authorities might have missed. She looked through the garbage in and outside the house and inside the drawers. An hour later she didn't find anything. But to her surprise she noticed something shiny underneath one of the chair's legs. It was a small shard of glass that had blood on it msking it clearly obviouse it was murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediatly made her way to the morgue where Okuto's body was and thanks to her contact she was allowed entry. She examined the neck first to see if there were any indications of any wounds that resemble the shard of glass. But they weren't on the neck oddly. It was as if he hung himself without a stab to the neck after all but Keito had to check around the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examined the back and looked for any stab wounds, nothing. But there was a small cut from the waist and judging from the look of things the wound matched the shard of glass. She looked in the invintory of what he was wearing at the time of the crime scene and checked his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito examined it and found something, a hole in the waist area of his pants. She checked if there was a belt to match but there was no belt. <i>\"Someone took it to hide it from anyone who might've noticed the stab in his waist. Someone inside the authorities? No..that woman earlier last night.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito went into interogation and found her still angered by her lovers death. \"Where's his belt?\", Keito asked sternly. When she asked questions about it the woman began to shake causing Keito to suspect a number of things. \"Where is it? Listen to me, I can make it easy on you unless you tell me where is it?\", Keito pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKN0UiRGkLM&amp;index=19&amp;list=UU9JNHDmriSynm96zoqJce-Q\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKN0UiRG...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Stay back! You can't have it or else! It's....\", it took a moment for Keito to figure out that what she was wearing was the same belt he wore. If she took it off she would die in a matter of moments. \"I had no other choice, Okuto was a vile fiend who raped me one night. I was stupid at the time thinking he loved me but after I got fed up with trying to !@#$ other women I saw him for what he was. But then the other night he slapped this on me. Now if I want to live I had to do what he says or I'm dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get you medical attention, we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter it's the only way to catch the one who killed him, I'm sorry..\", she un-did her belt causing the piece of glass strike her back and killing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! I NEED A MEDIC!\", Keito yelled.</span></div></div>",

You all had a great time at the hot springs, but now it was time to get back to school. and to get ready for parent day. You weren't exactly looking forward to it because your parents weren't going to be around, but you were looking forward to seeing Mizore's parents. After all you were her boyfriend and it's only natural that you would have to meet the parents. You were were waling to your next class, when you ran into Tskune and Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Hey! (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh hey Moka. Tskune. Aren't your parents coming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: No way. My mom wouldn't be able to survive here in Yokai. Besides, she could hardly take me being friends with 4 different monster girls.when they first met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: It's true. But she's very sweet Tskune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What about your parents Moka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: No. My parents won't be coming either. They never did for the past few years. But i okay. I'm used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well, on the plus side at least you two aren't the only ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: At least you made up with Mizore. So I take it you'll be introducing yourself to her mom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well....I guess so.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: You lucky dog. You and Mizore are practically a couple now huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Tskune! You're embarrassing me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hehehe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Come on Tskune stop teasing. Besides we gotta get to class. We'll see you later (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Have fun meeting Mizore's mom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK. See you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Moka and Tskune left you headed back to class thinking about your friends. You felt really lucky to have them. Then you remember Keito and how she was doing. You haven't seen her ever since you were attacked in the hot springs. You were hoping she was doing all right. Then you remembered what the woman who attacked you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(flashback)<br>\r\n(woman) If you're looking for someone to blame, why not blame yourself? After all you were born with that thing inside you.<br>\r\n(flashback ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Who was that girl? And what did she mean I had something inside me when I was born? Maybe this is connected to that gas attack and that ball of light from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard someone call your name. You turn around and see....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then all of a sudden you felt a tap on your shoulder. You turned around to see that it was Keito. She had a worried and frustrated expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey Keito. What's up? Is something wrong? Did your investigation go well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Unfortunately not. I need to talk to you. Alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK. I'll see you later Mizore. I see you later in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: OK. Don't forget that the parents are gonna be in class today. If you want to make a good impression on my mom, do your best in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Sure thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mizore left you followed Keito to the security committee's headquarters. Everywhere you looked you saw other members of the committee were working hard. Some were scientists analyzing fingerprints and many other things. At first you thought everything was amazing, but then Keito led you to a room where there was a lot of guards. When you saw them you couldn't help, but worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuard 1: Hey Miss Keito. Who's the kid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuard 2: You know only authorized personel can come back here. He's not even a member of the committee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Don't worry. He's with me. In fact he's a special friend to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuard 1 and 2: Yes ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the guards let you through, Keito and you stopped by a room that had a door that said \"Top Secret! Do not enter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name). Before we enter this room, I wanted you to promise. What you're about to see is top secret and you can't tell anyone what you're about to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK. I can keep a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Keito opened the door with a keycard. The moment she did something inside the room made you cringe. In this room, this was the place that they stored the dead bodies for evidence. The entire room smelled like rotten corpses which made your stomach twinge. You felt like you were gonna be sick, but you shook it off and followed Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Keito. Any particular reason why we're here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Two things. One is a something I need to ask you and the other I need to show you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led you a drawer and she pulled out the dead body. At first you weren't interested in seeing a dead. Then when you looked at the body, you immediately recognized it. It was the woman you attacked you before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the heck happened to her?!? I thought you took her into custody!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Yes. We did. Unfortunately whoever manipulated her was one step ahead of us. Remember how Okuto Kotsubo died? He didn't commit suicide at all. He was murdered. By this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up the belt that the girl was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What?!? How could that happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: And that's not all. The girl who attacked you. She was set up by whoever was manipulating Okuto. Okuto was really raping her and when she tried to get away from him he slapped this belt on her. The belt has a mechanism that when whoever takes it off the belt kills them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wow. That's crazy. But who would do such a thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: That I don't know. Which leads me to why I brought you here. I need someone who can help work in and out Yokai Academy. This is the first time I'm asking this of a person, but (name)......Will you help me by joining the security committee?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What?!?! Why me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: You're the only one who was aware of the situation. Not to mention you were a victim of the attacks. There's also a possibility that the person who was behind the attacks may possibility come to attack Yokai again and may attack the students. Even Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you stop and think. You remember how Mizore cried during that time. You never wanted her to suffer like that again. And if she was going to be attacked again, you had to do whatever it took to protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: If you don't want to, I understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused and thought about Keito's request. Then you took a deep breath and said......</span></div></div>",

Do you understand?\", Keito informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I get the picture. So where do I go from here?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head back to class, also since your now with the committe this special band will be on your school uniform so theres no need for you to have any pass in case your late to any classes you have during the day. If you notice anything suspicious then investigate with discretion and only inflict proper treatment unless you have hard evidence. Understood?\", Keito said making sure she told you everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes maa'm.\", as you left the morgue a funny thought crossed your head, \"Ha...you know whats funny? We first met with you threantening me to join your group. Now look where we've come since then.\", you brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizore jealous of me because I put the moves on you? We havn't come far at all, in fact were right where we began even. But yeah it is funny. Get back to class (Name). Good luck. &gt;Smeck&lt;\", Keito said blowing you a kiss as you left for your class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to get a bit uncomftorable with Keito hitting on you that blatently. You did like her, hell even part of you wanted to be with her but you were far too in love with Mizore to try and be with anyone else. You couldn't even if tried, or if anyone made you. You honestly wished that Keito had someone that would be right for her and you felt bad that there wasn't anyone who would seem to measure up, or even stand up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your mind was done contemplatting your love life you went back to class where Mizore and her mother were sitting and noticed your arrival. Mizore got up and greeted you with an icy hug and warm kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed you (Namey).\", she said upon letting go of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't give me names like that it's not manly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just like to fool around withh you. Nobody else does and gets away with it so I like to point out how special I am to you.\", Mizore said seductivly winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizore...sigh I just don't have the strength to stay mad at you.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore giggled for a bit until she noticed your new band on your uniform...</span></div></div>",

Tsurara seemed impressed by your singing talent and was glad Mizore had a mate who had good pipes. When the song and praise ended the class disperssed but instead of seeing Mizore first you saw her mom as she confronted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job on the song. I guess your not half bad for Mizore. After all you both seem to enjoy each other while in private.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I can't figure out that even though your sooo touchy on the subject of you two having sex that the two of you haven't already done so? I know my daughter enough to know that she already has done it with you.\", she claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were absolutly terriffied by this realization and you shook to yout knees and blushed crimson. \"Please I swear she's not pregnant she's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop your trembling I'm not mad. In fact I just said that to only confirm what I already suspected. You !@#$%^ my daughter.\", she said with a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so I just told you indirectly that weeeee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hade sex? Yeah you told me without having to spy on you. Just one question, how many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times have you done it together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Guess you two are taking your time. Do me a favor, if I have to expect gandchildren, you better be a great parent or else.\", she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would make no other effort when that day comes.\", you repllied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore finally got up to you and congradulated on your song kissing you on the cheek as reward. She hugged you tightly and said to her mother, \"Isn't he the best mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest.....\", she paused seeing you and Mizore hug one another lovingly, \"He's perfect for you. I have to go my little snowflake. Be good, and take care of him, he's a keeper.\", Tsurara said hugging her daughter tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye mom. I'll make you proud.\", Mizore replied crying a bit but returning her mother's hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already have my darling devil. Be safe.\", Tsurara said leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there she goes again from my life. It never gets any easier. Hey? How about tonight we have our most romantic one yet?\"Mizore offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd like that.\", you answered.</span></div></div>",

She was planning on making this night with you the best and made sure everything was perfect. She got rid of her lolipop and put on some lipstick to make her look prettier to you. She even wrapped her hair around like her mother had and finally had a gift laid out just for you when it was time. Finally the knock on the door was heard and Mizore answered it with calm and collectivness. You were dressed nicely but it paled in comparison to hoow Mizore looked right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Mizore your...uhh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speechless? Hehe come in I have dinner waiting at the table.\", Mizore welcomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really you look gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I spared no expense on tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you spent a fourtune on this?\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha no. But I spent alot of time planning this. I want it to be OUR special night. The one I've waited for since...we became so close.\", she said uttering her last words softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mizore ate your dinner and made small talk to keep the night from getting boreing. It was only after dinner when things turned to be really interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So (Name), have you wondered what the future holds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I see is finding a mundane job that provides, and hopefully have a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas who's the lucky wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, right now I can't think of any one else I'd want to be that person except you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know how happy that makes me feel comming from you. Sigh....(Name) I have this for you, it's something I made.\", she said handing out her gift. It was a music box with this tune playing. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7sPQhRtoVk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7sPQhRt...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That music sounds beautiful. Where did it come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure exactly but this was used when I was girl. It put me to sleep whenever I was scared of any nightmares. It always seemed tp protect me when I wasn't strong enough to face it. Now...you are that song to me now.\", Mizore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizore.....I........I don't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll start saying all you need to say for you, I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizore..I...love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then show me.\"</span></div></div>",

You gulped and felt your member getting hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'll show you all right. I'll show I love you with all my heart Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Then show me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore jumped into your arms. You yelped in surprise, but you managed to catch her in your arms. You both looked at each other and kissed. Then you opened your mouths and chased each others tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Mmm.....(name)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore took a breath long enough to say your name and resumed kissing you. You kissed her back as you walked to you bed while carrying Mizore. You gently lied her down on the bed as you two continued to kiss. Then you reached to her breasts and slowly began to knead them. Mizore breathing began to quicken and her body grew hotter. Her eyes glowed in the darkness as you massaged her breasts. You began to take off your clothes until you had nothing but your boxers on and Mizore had nothing but her panties. You stared at her with wonder and Mizore looked away in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: St-stop staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Why are you embarrassed? I've seen them before. They're beautiful. They're not to big and not to small. And the nipples are a perfect shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Geez. Enough with the compliments. Hehe It's not fair that you get to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved so she was facing your groin. You were both now looking at each others downstairs. Mizore grabbed your boxers and pulled them down. Your member sprang into view. She reached out and gently touched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Whoa! You're humongous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently moved her fingers up and down on your shaft making you let out a moan. Your body began to heat up as well and a numbing pleasure enveloped your body. Mizore smirked pleased with your reaction. She began moving her hand with more force making you moan a little louder. Now, you felt a little annoyed, in a good way. You removed her panties covering her downstairs and pushed your face between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You had your fun now it's my turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your tongue touched her slit, Mizore's body jerked and she moaned in surprise and pleasure. You slowly moved your tongue up and down her slit making get shivers through her body. A salty fluid began leaking out from her. You put your mouth over it and sucked lightly, but hard. Mizore moaned loudly as a shock went through her body. For a moment her slit felt numb and her body shook. Now it was Mizore's turn to get a little annoyed. She grabbed your member gently, but firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's....it's not fair you dummy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she took your member and put it in her mouth. She swallowed it down as far as she could take it. Her tongue tickled the tip and she sucked on the hole. You heard dirt noises coming from your crotch as Mizore sucked on your member like a straw. You moaned loudly, but you continued to suck on MIzore's slit. Mizore moaned with your member in her mouth which made the pleasure even more intense. You both continued to assault each others downstairs letting the pleasure wash over your bodies. Then it was time for the big moment. Mizore switched positions so she was straddling you. She took your member and pushed into her entrance. She lowered her body and your member slides all the way inside her. Once it was inside of her Mizore smiled with excitement. You thought it was so cute, it was almost arousing. You were so turned on, you automatically began pushing up from below. Mizore moaned with every thrust you gave. Her body wavered for a moment, but you put your hands on her breasts to support her. It was so good to her, Mizore began grinding her hips with earnest. Both of you matched your movements as you both thrusted against each other. You were thrusting so hard, that you could feel her member scrapping against Mizore's deepest wall. Mizore moans turned into pleasurable screams as she grinded faster and you thrusted harder. Her slit inside began to convulse and you began to feel your limit breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore!! I'm.......I'm.......I'm gonna come!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (moan) Me to!! Let's.......let's come together!!! Come inside me!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wait! Are you....(moan)....sure?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes! Do it! Come inside me!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this your limit finally shattered. You thrusted inside Mizore as hard and deep as you could. The moment you did your member exploded with cum inside Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): UUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (NAME)!!!! I'M COMIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNGGGGG!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you came inside her, Mizore's body froze for a moment. Then she collapsed on top of you as you both reveled in the pleasure. You wrapped your arms around her as you enjoyed her warmth. Mizore returned the embrace as you both rested for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) How....how was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Incredible. That was very intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hahaha. It was for me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name).....I love you.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen slowly Mizore fell asleep. You looked on as you slept happily on top of you. She nuzzled her face in your chest like a kitten. You smiled and kissed on the head and wished her good night and in a while you were asleep too.</span></div></div>",

You looked around in your room frantically if anyone was inside but you saw no one. You slowly went back to bed and closed your eyes holding Mizore tightly, however unknown to you standing right in your bedroom closet very still was a scarey figure watching you. He then began to slowly creep towards you and reached out with a hand with some kind of sharp objects attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the movement right behind you and you woke up immediatly starring right at where you thought someone was. You then screamed in fear when someone WAS there but in a split-second the figure vanisheded in a flash of light. You found yourself in an allyway with building stright out of an artistic painting. You walked forward to see Mizore and your mom together. You called out to them but they started walking away from you to which you ran after them. They got farther away while you ran in slowmotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! STOP! NO!\", you screamed to them as they walked in a dark tunnel. Soon the ground quaked around you and rose up as did the tunnel where it began dripping blood and it aimed at you. The tunnel was really an enormouse gun underneath the construction. The gun cocked itself and prepared to fire at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!\", the gun fired and in an instant you awoke screaming in absolute terror waking Mizore up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! !!!!!!!!!!\", you panted rapidly and Mizore held you in her arms to try and quell your stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?! What is it?\", she said comfortingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing....just...a nightmare.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back to sleep darling, I'm here for you.

She cried out to you begging to help her. You tried to reach out but then you heard evil laughter behind you and found that figure from earlier comming toward you. You reached out farther doing everything to grab her hand but you couldn't when your hand was grabbed by that figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor little boy, your in MY world now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at Mizore and find that she loses her grip and falls to her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back to reality but you didn't scream but looked around the room without waking Mizore.

You were in a room filled with bright light. When you looked around, there was no one to be seen. Then you looked behind you and you saw a pair or red demon like eyes. When you saw them, you were frozen with fear and you wanted to run, but your legs felt like they didn't work. Then you heard a loud and booming voice. To you it sounded familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Do not fear. As long as your love for the girl is everlasting, there will be nothing you cannot accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That voice. I've heard it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: You have. After all I have been inside you since you were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What are you talking about? Who are you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Fear not. I only wished to say hello to the person whom I'll be fighting along side with. Just remember the true enemy will try to turn your love for the girl against you. Don't forget that boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden your right hand began to glow. The light grew brighter and brighter until your vision went blank. Then you heard a voice that snapped you out of your vision. It was Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: (name)? (name)? Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Dah! Moka? What are you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I just came to talk to you. You've been acting strange lately. So I came to check on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's kind of you Moka, but I'm fine. There's nothing to for you to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Don't lie now. I can tell. After all I've been with Tskune for while, so I know when you're lying. So if you need to talk about it, I'll be happy to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered what you should tell Moka. Better yet, you weren't sure if you should tell her in the first place. After a silence, you decided.....</span></div></div>",

Look out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react the person that jumped through the window attacked you with a flurry of kicks. Luckily you dodged all of them, but the attacker wasn't done yet. He gave you a powerful kick in the gut knocking the wind out of you knocking you into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name)! You bastard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore reacted by firing icicles at the attacker, but he deflected them all with ease. Then Mizore's hand turned into an ice claw and attempted to slash at the attacker, but he dodged it with ease and punch her in the face knocking her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attacker then pulled out something from his pocket. It was a serum needle filled with a black liquid. He raised above his head and looked like he was gonna eject it into Mizore. Mizore tried to get away, but she was still feeling the after effects of the punch. He was about to stab Mizore with the serum, but then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No you don't!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got up and got between Mizore and the attacker blocking his way. Unfortunately he ended up stabbing you with the needle instead. The attacker gawked at you in shock as the liquid that was in the needle quickly disappeared into your skin. You felt a sharp pain into your arm, but you felt fine. You quickly took advantage of the attacker's shock and punch him the face and kick him the stomach sending him flying. The attacker retained his composure and glared at you with hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Damn you bastard! That was meant for the snow witch! You'll pay for this!! You'll never be the same ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react the attacker flew to window and escaped. As for you, you rushed to Mizore's side and checked on her to see if she was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore. Are you okay?!? Mizore?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Mmmrrgghhhh. I'm okay. What about you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm fine, but that attacker got away. For some reason he was after you and not me. What the hell is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door burst open and Moka, Tskune, Kurumu, and Keito came in looking alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: (name)! Mizore! Are you guys okay?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: We heard noises and we came as soon as we could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: What the hell happened here?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Someone came into the room and attacked us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What?!? Who attacked you!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) We don't know, but for some reason he or she was after Mizore. He tried to inject her with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: With what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I don't know. All I know is he failed. I got in the way and he injected me instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone but you: WHAAAAAATTT!?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: This is bad! He could have injected you with something dangerous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: My poor (name)-y!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: He was so young!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey! I'm not dead yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: But still. You should have your body checked out just in case. The last thing we need is for you to be under that fear serum again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: But I.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry Mizore. I'll be fine. I'm just going to see if I'm OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you went with Keito to get you checked out. Meanwhile in an abandoned lab, the attacker had just arrived at the lab and bowed before a young woman in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: I'm back my queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman): Did you inject the experiment in the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: I'm sorry my queen. I was going to inject the experiment as planned, but there was a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: The boy got in my way and he was injected with the experiment instead. I'm sorry. I failed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attacker expected to be punished, but instead the woman laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(woman) Fail me? Hahaaha I couldn't be happier. Hahaha I was going to inject it into the boy eventually, but now hahaha it's perfect! We'll see if the serum we made works in him. After all he is the white one. It'll be way more interesting than when he almost went nuts with fear serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: You mean the previous experiment that failed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwoman: Yes. I was a little off back then, but now......now...this time it will work. That serum that was injected into him is a serum that makes someone slowly lose their sense of reason. In that boy's case he will slowly become my slave and.....and.....hahahahah!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Become a what my queen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwoman: I'll let you find that out on your own. Let's say this will be a tale like......like.....oh what was that story called? Oh yes! Beauty and the beast. Hahaha how fitting. For now we watch. I want you to infiltrate the school and watch over that boy. Make sure you record everything that happens and don't miss a single detail. Understood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Yes my queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the attacker disappeared to fulfill his mission. As for the woman, she chuckled to herself and looked at a photo with herself and another woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwoman: Finally. All my patience has paid off. Now I can finally fulfill my dream and gain the power of the white one! No one can stop me from getting him! Not even you! My dear friend. He may be your son, but he will be mine! In heart and soul. Hehehe......hehehe.....HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHA!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen back to....</span></div></div>",

But why him all of the sudden?\", she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he was the one who created the toxin. He was the second one working with my mom on some project she did during her school years. He had a fall out with her regarding the project then decided to re work it as a fear enhancement serum. But theres also a woman who worked with her during the same time. If you see any photo's or names of her do digging on her too if you get a name off her.\", you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh that's alot to ask of me. I'll need a little persuasion.

She tried looking for when your mom attended but she had no idea which year. However a certain article in the book sparked her interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Student Unlocks The Source of Monster Inhibition\", it said. Keito saw the main photo and saw four people two men and two girls. One was more of an assistant while the others were directly working on the same ball of light that was used duriing the fear gas incident. She maximized the picture and tried to get the names off the three individuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked all of them up and came to shocking truths about them. She found out that your mom was developing a cure for the source of fear within monsters but she claimed it could be the key to bringing together humans and monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Sythe Repar, a genius in monster pshychology and was the key engineer in creating the \"source\", as the callled it. He was a scrany shy person but your mom saw the brilliance in his work and used it to make the source. Keito wondered why they had any disaggrements about it but nothing mentioned anything reagrding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman however was a completly unique story. Her name's Desire Mori, she had a rare condition that kept her body at her physical prime. Her body succame to it in her early 30's and her hair now is all white. And even stranger she was a succubus! Her powers were now gone due to her condition but she preiviously had them during her school years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito digged into her friendship with your mom and found several photos of them inside the yearbook. From the old reports she and your mom were the closest as friends could be. In fact it was cocnfirmed she was present the day you were born!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after your birth there wasn't much information regarding the two of them. Your mom continued working on the source but stopped, around the time she disappeared. Now things were starting to add up but to what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Keito was to figure this out she had to know what you knew about them. She knew you were holding something back so she decided to pay you a visit in your hospitle bed. </span></div></div>",

I had my best friend and she and I did everything together.

May I?\", Desire asked kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Shhh shh there you go.\", Desire said gently rocking you back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a natural.

(Name) isn't your mate of fate he's only a couple months old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand I won't age a day now. When I look at him I feel at one with myself. I feel like love iis inside him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats sweet of you to think that but this is starting to get a little too out of control.

Never come back until you've gotten it to your head he is not yours to have!\", the memory ended and it left you speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you see. You saw the memory (Name) you saw how you acted when I held you in my arms, you loved me from the very moments you had just been born on this earth. Please don't deny me our love (Name).\", Desire said to you trying to coerce you to be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be with you Desire even if I had a choice.

Desrire had managed to enter the school grounds in plain sight but kept a watchful eye on it's security measures. She casually walked to yyour private room but before she did she made a few pit stops on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out some lipstick and applied it to her lips, she pukered up and went into the boilerroom where the artificial oxygen was being pumped into your room. There was only two guards but unfortunatley they were both male and stunned at the sight of her. Desire extended her hand pulling one into a deep kiss. When she finished with the one she then instantly got to the other guard and kissed him hard on the lips as well. Moments passed and the guards began to feel dizzy and suddenly their eyes glowed light pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesire gave them a special order when the time came and had them stand by for the signal. She walked out of the room flaunting her sexy body and continued onward to your room. Her next stop on the way was to have the survailence camras replay old footage of you sleeping to fool Keito. She dropped by the room where all the live feeds were being broadcasted where there was just a few students working it. They were all female but to Desire it didn't matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne girl wanted to know why Desire was inside here and what her purpose of being here was but instead her answer was a pair of lips against hers and mindcontrol bliss. The other girls caught on to it but Desire got the second one before she could react and the other from warning anyone. She grabbed both of them by their collars and wondered which one gets it first. She decided to iss the one struglling the most, she kissed her and even slipped her tongue to hasten her obedience. Then she got o the last one and placed both her hands on her cheeks and quickly made out with he for a breif moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesire wiped away her lipstick and some droll off her face and ordered the girls to playback old footage of you sleeping and to act like nothing happened. The three did as told leaving Desire with much satisfaction. Now that the stage had been set all she had to do was pull the curtain, or in this case the fire alarm. When it broke it out everyone left the building in a frenzy giving Desire the perfect cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito wanted a status on the situation and if you were allright. The guards reported you were allright but since they were under Desire's control it wasn't really accurate. Now that the signal was made, the guards then started sucking the oxygen out of your room leavig you with little air very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH! Can't breath! &lt;gasp&gt; No air! &lt;gasp&gt; What's going on? &lt;gasp&gt; Got to get ouuuuuuuut....\", you fainted from the lack of oxygen and just as you passed out Desire came walking in eager to see you after all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah poor little tutleduck out of breath? Hmhmhmhmhmmm. Sorry for the crude means but I had to pacify you to take you home with me. Now let's get going my love.\", she picked you up and had you o her back. She walked down the fire escape and waited for her getaway car to arrive, or limo. In only three seconds it came and just in time because by now Keito already figured out the footage she saw was only fake and Desire was long gone with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for picking me up. Would have been a pain carrying him all the way back right?\", she said to her driver which in a stunning turn of events was none other than Moka's own sister Kokoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah belive me. Don't get why you would do all the work when you cou;d have someone else get him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my lover I'd jump into hell for him to get him back, when you find love you do all kinds of thing you'd normally wouldn't do. When you get back tothe school you have that allaby I set up and memorized?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. They'll never know I helped you ecape. Now lets get moving efore they catch up. Enjoy your boyfriend back there.\", Kokoa said rolling up the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesire looked at you and saw you for the first time in over 19 years. She hand you in her arms again and cried tears of joy at the sight of this. She stroked your face and sensually kissed your cheek. She was waiting to kiss your lips for real when you awoke and hopefully while returning it.</span></div></div>",

That's all we remember.\", said one of the guards in the boiler room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can someone brazenly walk into this school and take the only person who I had heavily secured and not be seen be a single person?! Whoever took (Name) got into the survailence systems and..even wiped out the last few minutes of footage before it even happened. DAMMIT! Never has anyone mocked my skills as a safetey commisioner like this! It's unacceptable! Goddammit!\", Keito yelled. Tskune came into Keito's office when he heard her yelling at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Easy! What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito began to cry and broke down in front f Tskune. He shut the door to keep everyone from seeing her this vulnerabel. \"I lost (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost the only one I ever loved...he's gone. And I have no idea who took him or where he is. Oh god Tskune what do I do?!\", she said uncontrolably crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok. We'll find him. I know you did everythin you could. You just need to keep trying and don't give up. I know you can find him.\", Tskune comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm..sorry..I just..ever since I met him... I've always had feelings for him and it's slowly eating at me that he'll never be the one for me. But not being able to protect him even as a friend it's just..\", Keito couldn't finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune hugged her and tried to help her pull through. Then they heard a knockiing on the door, it was Mizore. \"Oh shit! Mizore will flip out if she finds out about (Name). Keep it quite Tskune.\", she said snapping out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore walked in the room, \"Uh Keito- Oh there you are Tskune. Moka's looking for you, she at the foutain waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Kinda forgot about that but I'll be there right away.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keito I looked around for (Name) and he's not in his room. Did you have him like taken to a secret room or something for safety measures or something because I'd like to be  sure he is alright.\", Mizore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. He's still in our private security room io the old caverns under the school. We just have to do a couple mire sweaps around the area until we guarentee he's safe.\", she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. But tell him I said, \"I love you\", if you get him on the phone. I feel like I haven't said it to him for a while.\", Mizore said leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god why do you have to put salt on the wound Mizore? Isn't there just a sliver of evidence or a clue that can? Wait a minute?\", Keito went to the survaince center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any hidden cameras inside the room?\", she asked one of the girls operating the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah but nothing happened here so we figured not to call you. We assumed we were hacked and thats why the footage was tampered with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito found the camera and hooked it up to the moniter. She fast forwarded to the time just before the fire alarm kicked in. Then she saw someone with white hair walk in. Keito saw what happend in here and figured out how the footage was tampered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My first kiss was given to me by an old lady...oh my god!\", the girl reacted grossed out at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up! Looks like shes somehow able to use mind control through kissing. I doubt it's natural so maybe it's through lipstick. Now where did you go? Give me a live feed on any escape routes out of the school grounds.\", she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. No man will ever take me after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moniter flashed a few images but one thing caught Keito's eye. \"Wait go back! What section of the building is that?!\", Keito asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4d, but-\", Keito ran out and went to that section. She noticed fresh skid marks that appeared on the camera. She now had a trail and a lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want he following people taken out of classes for this emergency search and rescue mission: Tskune, Kurumu, Mizore, Moka, and Deshiko. Tell them to meet me at exit 4d. Repeat exit 4d. Double time people! We got a student who needs our help and it's our job to get him back!\", Keito ordered her people.</span></div></div>",

You had no idea where you were but you knew from the look of things Desire was behind this. You weren't chained up or had any restraints for some reason. You looked around to see Desire in a blood red gown and her hair in a pony tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your up at last. Like the setting? I had it arranged for this occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you bring me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Questions, questions, questions. How about action. Want a drink? Don't worry it's free of any drugs or potions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to buy that when you nearly had the air in my room sucked out leaving me to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please you think I wanted to kill you? Besides this is the point where you and I share this one moment free of anything surprising.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then. I guess I'll have that drink if it'll get some answers from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what I wanted to hear but that's a start. It's a special wein from the succubi home world. They call it liquid love. Don't let the name scare you though it's taste is so good people keep it for moment of true romance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took her drink and took a sip. It was actually tastey and no traces of anything strange, she wasn't lying...so far. She sat by you on the bedand started to get closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, you turned out more handsome than I preiviously imagined 19 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy (Name) it's a compliment. A woman admiring you makes you feel uncomfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at her remark and tried to answer, \"No I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be shy. Your alone with me now, and you can tell me anything you want. Your feelings, secrets, repressed desires of the body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Back off a bit lady Mizore is my girl and you want to know something? I'm going to be the father of our child and marry her. What do you say to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. You having a life before we reunited and it's consequences says nothing to me. But now that we are together leave it behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave Mizore behind are you nuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I've watched you for so long, your heartbreaks, your trials, your entire life. I know you better than anyone in the world. AllI want, all I've ever wanted is your affection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love me that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than Mizore and all the other women from that school put together. Please (Name)..just this ounce let go of your attachment to the past. And if it's only for just one moment, even if you reject me...just have this kiss.\", she said leaning into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so taken aback by her words of passion that you couldn't find a way to think straight regarding escape or anything. You looked as her eyes closed and lips came closer proximity to yours. Just one kiss is all she wanted? She's waited for this for so long...it would be a true shame to deny er this little request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the last inch you closed your eyes and finaly moved toward her and returned her affection. Desire's soul felt like an array of fireworks. She felt so alive and free and the feeling was perfect for her. You simply felt like you were givng something to someone their last request in life. It didn't feel wrong or like you were cheating on Mizore. It was just something you had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought of puling back and breaking away, but you felt like you didn't want to. You couldn't explain why but you didn't feel manipulated either. Desire continued to enjoy the kiss, each second felt like a minute for her. Time slowed down for Desire to engross herself in this moment for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesire began to enter her tongue into your mouth, and you let her. She explored around and felt yours, both your tongues danced inside the bridge connected by your lips for a while and then stopped. But Desire wanted it to last just a bit longer, she placed her hands gently under your chin and pulled you deeper into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the rush of emotions that kissing made you feel while lip locked with Desire. It felt wonderful, and it felt innocent. Like a school girl giving a boy's first kiss who likes her but doesn't feel the same way, yet would be so kind enough to grant that boy one gesture of affection to show that she liked him enough to show that while it couldn't be, his thoughts about her beauty on the outside were now intertwined with her beauty on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesire began to feel the need to breath, and while she despreatly wanted it to last forever she knew you as well had to take a breather now as well. So in her final moments she pulled back, but slowly, and felt the love of the only person she truely loved as her mate slip away from her lips until they broke apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes seeing Desire both sad and yet smile. She finally kissed her mate of fate, but to her that kiss meant more to her than anyting in the world except one thing that would set her soul at true ease. Apologizing to her best friend, your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you said anything, unsure what to say to each other. You simple starred at eachother and wondered what the other was thinking. Desire wanted to say something but she couldn't say it even though it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words came out of the one person who no one would expect to hear. Desire starred at you in shock and you repated what you said, \"I love you Desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you love me, and I understand now that you are the most special woman ever in my entire life. but if you really love me, you have to let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesire cried tears of joy and sorrow, but the moemnt wasd short lived when she coughed hard and so did you. You saw what looked like smoke coming from outside the room but it wasn't smoke. It was fear gas! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome had found you.</span></div></div>",

It looked abandoned but there was no mistake that they were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito and the others looked inside and saw that there was a pink light coming from the basement. They went down ready for a fight but none was there. \"This room looks like it's made for one hell of a good time. You think that women and (Name) did it in here?\", Tskune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka and Mizore both bitch slapped him on both the sides of his face in response. Mizore checked the bed hopeing nothing happened, there wasn't signs of sex but she felt their body heats from them sitting on there for so long. Mizore got curious as to why that was but maybe it might be something else. Just then all of a sudden someome was walking down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same attacker who injected you with that serum! \"I'm coming down in peace. I know your down there.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly approached them and had his hands in the air. \"Where is my boyfriend?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were taken by Fearsome.

When I find her I'll have her head on my icicle and lick that blood dripping fro her like an ice cream cone!\", Mizore yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannibal Lector calm down there's still the matter of finding out where Fearsome took them. Is there something we have that might give us a clue were we can find Fearsome?\", the attacker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have an idea on where he set up shop. I know that Fearsome is a scientist so we just have to find a place where he can work in a lab in secret. All I have to do is have Moka, or rather Inner Moka and Kurumu fly around and see if they detect any chemical hot spots. Here I brought them in case there might be any aphrodisiac's involved so we could avoid being dosed by it.\", Keito gave the detectors to Kurumu and Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune kissed Moka telling her to be safe before removing her rosary.

She didn't use her succubus power, although how could she when she lost those powers years ago. I am amazed you snagged him despite the setback Desire. Showing all those succubi that it is possible to be yourself instead of their allure. But there's no point in it now when I begin preparations. The school's water supply will be pumped with ounces of fear gas and poison everyone in the school!

We split into pairs. Myself and Mizore, Moka and Tskune, and finally Kurumu and Deshiko. If anyone gets into trouble your on your own since our radio's can't work underground. You can try calling out or finding us but for the most part whatever happens down there your alone with your partner.

So tell me how is it working with Keito?\", Kurumu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She takes her job seriously and does it well. She can be hard on us at times but only if the situation demands it. Although ever since the whole Naga incident I see her looking at a picture she has of (Name) every day. She stares at it all the time at least once a day, so you can imagine how annoying it is when she has him on her mind.\", Deshiko explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I notice shes different around him in a good way.

Except you would have a headache since she'd act all lovey dovey 24-7.\", Kurumu noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe yeah, but one has to wonder why Keito still loves him knowing full well he's beyond her reach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the trails heating up.

Not so loud, remember were dealing with Fearsome. we need to be careful if you want to save your boyfriend.\", Keito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you really like him Keito don't act like you don't care about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm just trying to stay focused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always thought you would steal him away like I did when we met. But you let him try to come after me, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love him as much as you do. So you can imagine how hard it is to have to let him go to be happy with who he thinks is the one for him. The only time I got to remotely have a chance with him was that dinner date I had with him, and then he respectfully turned me down.  I hoped that maybe I'd have a chance with him later but...you two were perfect for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keito...you are really a true friend to me and (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming from you..it means a great deal to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait I see something moving.

Kurumu flew up and high and low while she was carrying you, but the Carnotaurus was getting closer and closer. So close that Kurumu could flew it's breath on her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Waaaahhhh!!!! Kurumu! Can't you go any faster?!? That's things gonna eat us for dinner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I'm flying as fast as I can! But.....I can't keep flying much longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see on Kurumu's face that she was getting tired and she couldn't be able to out-fly the carnotaurus much longer. You had to think of something and quick, but what? Then things took a turn for the worst. You and Kurumu were at a dead end. Now you two had nowhere to go. The carnotaurus saw you two were cornered and crept toward the two of you ready to finish it's prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh crap! We're trapped! What'll we do?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu said nothing. She was trying to think about what the two of you should do. Then she decided. She slowly descended and set you on the ground. Then she stood in front of you and extended her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu! What the hell are you doing?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (name)! When there's an openign go on and get out of here! I'll hold off this thing for as long as I can. Just get out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Like hell I will! I can't just leave you here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I said go!!! Don't worry about me! Just do as I say! I refuse to let you die! I promise I'll protect you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu flew up and charged into battle at the carnotaurus. The carnotaurus tried to bite her, but Kurumu flew out of the way and slashed at it's hide. You stood there trying to figure out what to do. You could see that Kurumu's attacks were having no effect. You wanted to help, but all you could do was watch. You couldn't run away either, because you wanted to help Kurumu. Then Kurumu's voice made you jolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What the hell are you doing (name)! Get out of here! I said I'll handle this! Go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But Kurumu....!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the carnotaurus swung it's tail and hit Kurumu hard. Kurumu was sent flying and hit the rock wall hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kurumu! No!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carnotaurus stared at Kurumu, delighted that it scored a hit on it's prey. A thin line of blood trickled down Kurumu's face and her body was battered. You gasped in horror at this sight. Kurumu struggled to her feet and extended her claws again. Then you heard Kurumu's voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I said go damn it! I said I can handle it. Get going! (cough)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kurumu! Why damn it?!? Why are you doing this?!? You know you can't beat this thing so why?!? WHY?!?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: You need to ask? (cough) You're my friend. I won't run away from a friend that's in trouble! I said I'd protect you and I meant it! What kind of friend would I be if I can't even protect you? Think about how Mizore would feel if you died. (cough) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But.....there's no reason for you to risk your life for me! I won't leave you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Please.....go......for me.....for Mizore,....Keito,......everyone.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the carnotaurus opened it's mouth and prepared to finish off it's prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): KURUMU!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about to be curtains for Kurumu when......</span></div></div>",

There has to be a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Are you sure Deshiko?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Yes. We even scanned his bloodstream and we couldn't detect anything. As far as we know, (name)'s healthy as a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: How strange. Are you sure you got injected (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes. How could I forget? Mizore saw the whole thing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's true. The attacker injected him with some kind of black stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: So what'll we do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence, then Keito spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Well for now, (name) you and the rest of you go home and get some rest. We can't do anything about it for now, but hopefully we'll figure something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Are you sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Yes. But don't worry. My team and I will figure this out. Just go and get some rest, but if something happens to you (name), I want you to call me immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you and the rest your friends went to their proper dorms and went to sleep. As for you, you stayed up a little and looked up at the ceiling. You thought about everything that happened today. A lot of thoughts ran through your mind.

He's obviously trying to pull a prank on us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yukari. Something telling me that's not Gin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Everyone! Stay frosty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the werewolf attacked. It gunned straight for Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Moka! Look out! Quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune knocked Moka out of the way and removed her rosary. This caused Moka to transform to her inner form and she was ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Time for this mutt to get fixed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf wasn't intimidated. It gunned for Moka again. This time Moka was ready. He gave the werewolf a sharp kick. The kick connected, but it didn't faze the wolf.  It regained it's composure and jumped out of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: It's getting away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: After it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I'm on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hey! Wait a minute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tskune could stop them, Moka and the gang jumped out of the window after the werewolf. Tskuen followed in hot pursuit. Then Tskune heard a piercing scream. He quickly rushed to the source of the scream. There laid a terrible sight. Yukari was unconscious by a tree, Kurumu was hanging by a branch, Mizore and Moka were still standing, but they were completely exhausted. The werewolf however was still ready to fight. As soon as it saw Tskune it went straight for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Tskune look out!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka jumped in the way and blocked the attack, but then the werewolf used it's speed to get behind Moka and gave her a sharp kick in the back of her head knocking her out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Moka no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Incredible! Even an S class monster like Moka can't keep up with this thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf was not done yet. He went after Mizore next. Mizore tried to freeze it and shoot icicles at it, but then the werewolf slashed through her ice and headbutted her in the stomach knocking the wind out of her and knocking her out cold from the shock. Tskune was know all alone. There was definitely no way he could fight off the beast on his own. Just when he thought he was gonna die. He heard a flurry of steps and then Keito and the security committee was there in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Stand down wolf boy! You're under arrest for disturbing the peace of this school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf saw it was outnumbered so it had no choice, but to run. It dashed away into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: On his heels men! Don't let the beast escape! Tskune are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I'm fine thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: What the hell happened here?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I don't know. One minute we were sleeping, and then we heard a howling noise and then were all out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I can't believe it. Even Moka's out? Men! Quickly! Get these people back to headquarters so they can heal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan: What about the beast ma'am?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Split into two teams! One team, take care of the injured! Other team, search for the beast! On the double! Move it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to anyone on the scene they didn't know the beast was in fact you. They focused on taking care of the injured and searching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.......</span></div></div>",

But you were feeling way to good to notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) -yawn- Man! I feel completely great!! I feel like I slept like a log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a loud commotion outside your room. It was the sound of the students scrambling around the hallway like crazy. You peeked out of your room to see students left and right rushing around in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the hell is going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and tried to find your friends. You looked all over, but you couldn't find your friends anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That;s weird. I wonder where they could be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Hey! (name)! (name)!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Deshiko! What's going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: There's no time! It's an emergency! Come on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything, Deshiko grabbed your arm and dragged you all the way to the nurses office. When you got there Deshiko led you to the nurse's office where a horrible sight awaited you. Moka, Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore were in lying in their beds. When you saw them you felt like your heart stopped. Tskune was bandaged up and was sitting next to Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What.....what the hell happened here?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Tskune explained everything to you and she finished her story you were completely shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Is that why the students are panicking right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Yes. Keito's doing everything she can to find the werewolf. That thing is strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Yeah. It was even able to take down Moka in her true vampire form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Yes. Everyone's resting. Mizore's the one I'm worried about. She got messed up pretty hard. She should be fine as long she rests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood next to Mizore and held her hand gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm sorry Mizore. I'll make sure this monster is brought to justice. I'll make that thing pay for what it did to you! I promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: (name)! I just got word! Keito wishes to see you immediately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But I...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I know you're worried, but you have to go. Don't worry. I'll take care of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK Tskune. Please take care of them. Let's go Deshiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile outside the attacker who injected the serum into you was listening to the whole thing.

(name) went with Deshiko because Keito wanted to talk to him regarding the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I.....I need to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore struggled to get up, but her injuries kept her from even sitting up. Mizore winced in pain as pain shot through her body. Tskune quickly rushed to her side and gently forced her to lie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Easy Mizore. You're hurt. The doctor said you got hit pretty hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: But Tskune....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: No buts. Nurse said you need to rest. That's goes for all of you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore didn't say anything and pouted, but she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Now. I have to get to class. You all get some rest and I'll come back to check on you guys later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after Tskune left there was a long silence between the girls.

Maybe Mizore was weakened during the fight with that werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah. It's not like she's sick or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: No way. I saw it. Mizore's powers were definitely weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore didn't know what to say or do. She didn't know if it was such a good idea to tell the others about her condition.

Keito's subordinates were rushing around like crazy getting testimonies fro students, and looking for clues they found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Damn it this is insane!

I brought (name) as requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Good.(name) I'm sure you're well aware of the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well yeah. The entire school is talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Yes. This beast just showed up out of the blue and attacked Moka and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I know. Deshiko told me the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: It's power is what worries me though. It was strong enough to overwhelm even Moka when she transformed into her true form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you hear this you gulped nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) So....what are we gonna do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I want you and Tskune to capture the beast and bring here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What?!? But this beast even beat Inner Moka! Not to mention Moka and the others can't be released from the nurse by tomorrow! How....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I don't expect you to fight it. I'm well aware about and the other girls conditions. I just need you to capture it so we can analyze it. I'm having a scientist come over and try to see what she can do to analyze that beast and what it's intentions are. Just focus on capturing it. Meet Deshiko and the others by the fountain in the evening. Don't worry. I'm having Deshiko assist you with a squad. Is that understood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes ma'am. We'll do everything we can. We'll capture this beast for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Good. Deshiko.

I mean having a scientist trying to figure out what a rampaging beast intentions are by wreaking havoc?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: I don't know much either, but I heard the scientist exceptionally skilled and she's pretty smart. We'll just have to do what we can. Just get Tskune and we'll capture this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK.....I'll go find Tskune and tell him the news. See you in the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went to find Tskune you thought about everything that happened. You didn't know how you were gonna capture the werewolf, but you were gonna try. Then you eyes began to get blurry and you had another vision. You were in a room of light and there was no one around. Then you see a ball of light in front of you. It was the same ball of light that helped you before. Then you see the same pair of red eyes that you saw from before. Then a white wolf appeared before. It looked gentle and kind at first, but then the ball slowly started to turn black and the wolf began to get mean. The wolf growled and then it did the unthinkable. It blasted some kind of blizzard attack from it's mouth. You slowly began to get covered in ice. Just when you were about to be completely frozen, the vision ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the hell.....was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there trying to process what just happened, but then Tskune came up to you snapping you out of your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: (name)? Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh! Tskune. It's nothing. I'm fine. But there is something I need to tell you. It's regarding the werewolf. We have orders to capture it tongiht.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Capture it?!? Why?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I don't know. but Keito says some scientist is gonna take a look at it and see what's wrong with it or something. Besides, Deshiko is gonna help us too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I see. I'll don't know how we're gonna capture this thing, but I'll do what I can to help. Let's get that werewolf!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) Don't worry Mizore. I'll avenge you.

Everyone searched high and low for the werewolf, but it was no where to be seen. You all searched for hours and hours and soon it was getting close to night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Tskune. I don't know about you, but walking in the forest at night is creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I heard that. But be on guard. We'll never know when that thing will attack. We covered the west side, but we still need to check the east. Spread out everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they did, but known to anyone the attack just happened to be passing by with Mizore in his arms. When he saw them he quickly hid in the trees. Then he pulled out a communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: My queen. I have captured the target as planned, but we have a problem. There's a squad of security members in the forest. Searching most likely me. What shall I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Destroy them. I don't care who it is. Take them out and complete your mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Yes mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as soon as one of the members got close, the attacker began it's assault. Meanwhile Tskune, you and another squad were still searching when, a red flare shot up into the sky and Tskune's radio erupted with screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadio: Tskune! Tskune! Do you copy?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I'm here! What is it?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadio: Someone is attacking us! Subject confirmed to be deadly and has a hostage! A girl with snowy hair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Snowy hair? That's Mizore!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Where are you now?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadio: 4 clocks west of here! Get here quickly! Before......Gah!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the radio emitted nothing, but static. Tskune and you raced with your squad toward the scene. They arrived in time to see the attacker holding up a student by his neck. He also had Mizore on his back knocked out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: You there! Who are you and what do you think you're doing with Mizore!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Nothing you need to be concerned about. I'll I can say is capturing her is my mission. And you're in my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attacker charged at you and Tskune. You two prepared to fight, but the attacker ran right past you and Tskune and attacked your guy's squad instead. In a single attack he wiped them all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: N-no way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): He took them all out in a single hit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Now then, as for you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attacker slowly walked toward you and Tskune. You and Tskune stood your ground prepared to fight, but you knew you couldn't win. You had to come up with a plan to rescue Mizore. You quickly came up with a plan and whispered it to Tskune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Tskune. Listen up. I'm gonna distract him. When I do I want you to rescue Mizore and get help. Got it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Come on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set down Mizore and charged at you and threw a might kick, but you countered with a kick of your own and threw a punch. The punch connected to his face, but it didn't do much. Tskune quickly rushed to Mizore and carried her to safety. The attacker tried to stop Tskune, but you blocked the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You want her? You gotta get by me first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Rrrrggghhh!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and him continued to fight, but it was clear who was at an advantage and it wasn't you. You threw punch after punch and kick after kick, but to no avail. The attacker simply punch you in the gut and the punch was so hard it made you cough blood. You doubled over in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: You're weak and in my way. Now disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attacker gave you a hard kick in the gut and sent you flying into the forest. The attacker laughed smugly and walked after Tskune calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Now to complete my mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tskune was racing to find Deshiko while carrying Mizore. Then he heard a noise. At first he thought it was the attacker, but then out stepped Deshiko with her squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Deshiko! Thank goodness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Tskune what happened?!? We saw the red flare. and the heck is Mizore here?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: No time to explain. We have to call for help! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: I'll call for headquarters right away! I'll send up a signal flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko fired a yellow signal flare that was so bright that anyone could see it. Then she and her squad, while Tskune was carrying Mizore rushed to get out of the forest. Then Deshiko realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Wait a minute! Where's (name)?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Dah! I completely forgot! (name)! He's.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone jumped at the attacker's voice. Then out from the shadows the attacker slowly walked out from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: You!?! Where's (name)?!? What did you do to him?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Wouldn't you like to know? Now. Hand over the girl and I'll spare your miserable lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Never you bastard! You'll pay for hurting my comrades! You're under arrest! Seize him men!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the squad members yelled a battle cry and charged at the attacker. Meanwhil as for you, you were in deep in the forest. You were beaten up pretty bad, but you were unbeaten. You struggled to get up and staggered to your feet, but you felt your consciousness fading. You fell flat on your back and then the last thing you saw was the full moon in the sky. Back with Tskune and the others, the attacker took out all the squad members except for Deshiko and Tskune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: What the hell is this guy?!? He's too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: What'll we do?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Only one thing you can do. Hand over the girl or die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attacker was about to kill Deshiko and Tskune when the was a piercing howl that rang throughout the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: What the....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: That howl.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a giant white wolf jumped from the darkness and attacked the attacker. He clawed and slashed him which made him scream in pain. Tskune and Deshiko watched in shock as the wolf attacked. The attacker punched the wolf hard, but the wolf regained its composure and blasted the attacker with a blizzard attack. The attacker dodged the attack and landed with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Heh! Too easy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the attacker couldn't move. He looked down and saw that his leg was frozen. The wolf saw his chance and bit him hard in the arm. So hard that his arm exploded in blood. Then the wolf lifted him up and threw him through trees with it's amazing strength. All Tskune and Deshiko could do was watch agape and in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacker: Ggghhh. Damn it! He's even stronger than I thought! I'll......have to retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a smoke bomb and used it to get away. As for the werewolf it lost it's target and it had to find a new one. Then it saw Deshiko and Tskune. It began to growl and slowly crept slowly toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Crap! Now it's after us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Tskune! Get back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was ready to strike when the wolf heard something. Then it turned tail and ran away. The reason being was...</span></div></div>",

She is Mako Yakumaru. She works as a nurse in Yokai Academy. No one knows much about her or what monster she is, but she was well known for her cures and one thing in particular. The serum in her finger. One prick and she could do anything she wanted too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako.

Her eyes were a deep golden color and all the boys were staring at her. When you saw her you felt something odd about her. Like you had seen her somewhere before. You just couldn't put your finger on it. When she came in she smiled at the whole class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Hello class. My name is Ms. Mitsuki and I will be your substitute teacher for your math class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys as well as the girls were ogling her like crazy. Everyone except you, Mizore, Kurumu, Moka, Yukari, and Tskune. After that the class began. She began by teaching basic algebra.Then a little bit more of the advanced stuff. A You weren't paying much attention. You had a lot of things on your mind. The werewolf, the attacker that tried to kidnap Mizore and that other vision you had about the werewolf. You wished you knew more about what was going on, but you weren't gonna get any answers by worrying about it. So decided to pay attention to the lesson. At first you thought you got it, but then the problems began to get more and more confusing. Soon you were completely lost and you didn't get it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name thinking) Oh crap! How was I supposed to do this?!? I don't understand this at all!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Mitsuki: Now then I need someone to solve this problem for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked all around to pick a student. You picked away praying that she wouldn't pick you. Sadly you would only jinx it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Mitsuki: Yes. Mr. (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-y-yes ma'am!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Mitsuki: Could you please solve this problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the problem on the board, but sadly it was nothing but a bunch of squiggly lines to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....I.....don't know.......how.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're answer would only make things worse as the whole class laughed at your response making you blush beet red. Mizore and the others looked in worry, feeling sorry for you. You looked down on the ground in shame, but when you looked up Ms. Mitsuki was all of a sudden close to your face. She spoke in a seductive,but stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Mitsuki: Bad boy! You're supposed to be listening not day dreaming. Do it again and I'm afraid you'll have to be in for pun-ish-ment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy: Hey! You can punish me any time Ms. Mitsuki! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 2: Yeah! Me too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Are you two crazy?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class you packed your things and got ready to leave. You managed to get a glimpse of Ms. Mitsuki. When she saw you she gave you a wink which made you blush. After that she left. Then Tskune and the others walked up to you. Mizore on the other hand was hopping mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hey! (name) Who was that girl?!? and why does it seem that she's flirting with you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! Doesn't she get that you're off the market? Unless you want to have two girlfriends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No way! As if! You know Mizore's my number one girl! Besides I don't even no that girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: But Ms. Mitsuki does seem to know you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: The question is how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Who knows? For all we know she's probably another cougar just like Ririko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Please don't even say that Kurumu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a subordinate from the security committee came up to all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurbordinate: Mr. (name). Keito would like to see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Is that so? I'll be right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I wonder what Keito wants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: It must be important.

All of whom will recive these priavte letters inside their lockers and think nothing is wrong with them? While your fool-proof plan with Mizore will keep her away from you as you privatley talk to (Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Mizore would think anything that will distract her from her boyfriend is suspicious, but not if that thing is a fake visit from her own mom. Make the call to the office first then place the letters in the lockers. Leave the last part for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.

Go to the bus stop and wait for my limo. Then wait for me, then we can properly do it.

You saw the limo right next to the bus stop waiting for you. You were about to walk to the limo, but then a vision came again. You were in a room filled with light again, but this time things were different. The ball of light was now half light half dark. Then the same voice that you heard before boomed throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: What's the matter with you boy? Are you so obsessed with lustful things that you don't see the truth before you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What are you talking about?!? Who are you? I'm not under no spell!

After this you're on your own. But remember, keep your friends and your family close and beware of the person who desires the light inside you to destroy their darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wait! Just what are you going to do? and what do you mean?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ball began to glow and you were blinded by the overwhelming light. Then the wolf appeared again. This time it was bigger, gray and standing on two legs instead of four. The wolf looked scary and ready to kill you.It growled with a low and stared at you with murderous intent and then it let out a ferocious roar. When it did, a giant snowstorm erupted from its mouth. You covered your face trying not to let the snow get into your eyes. What you didn't realize was that there was an orange aura surrounding you resembling Kirche's curse. When the ice hit it, it disappeared. Then the snow got more and more intense and you felt your body beginning to freeze up.Your body began to get frozen in ice first your feet and then it slowly crept to your body until it reached your head. It was about to cover your head, when suddenly the vision ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the....! Where am I? And why am I dressed to go on a date or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you remembered the last thing that happened. You were in the room to finish your math homework when Ms. Mitsuki (aka Kirche) looked you in the eye, and then you couldn't remember anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Whew. Why do I always end up attracting girls that always hypnotize me? Geez. In any case what should I do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pondering on what you should do next when......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't tell me it's meant for me because I'm under dressed.\", she said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer you looked back to see who was getting out of the limo. You tried to asses this whole situation along with your vision but you were too confused to think straight. The driver took off his hat and noticed who you were talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2:24) \"There's a problem. I'm gonna have to resort to Plan: B\", Saizo said to Kirche. By the time you recognized the driver when in horror was Saizo, pulling out a fucking rocket launcher! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelled to Mizore to get down and run when you saw the rocket launcher and ran the hell out of his line of fire. You ran for cover in a pile of rocks around the stop and tried drawing Saizo's fire. Saizo fired randomly at both you and Mizore while she ran for cover in the dense trees. Saizo then ran up and began to fight you hand to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3:30) You held up a decent fist fight but the lack of restraint of his monster power made you a pitiful opponent and he knocked you cold. He pulled you up on his back and went back into the limo and threw you into Kirche's side. Mizore saw you being taken and ran back and tried to follow them. Saizo got in and drove to the portal leading back to the hideout, meanwhile Mizore gave chase using her ice powers and tried to catch up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3:52) Saizo sped up the limo and the portal begun to open. Mizore desperately tried to at least grab to the back of the vehicle but she wasn't close enough to reach it. As the hope of saving grew more dire tears flowed past her eyes as she tried everything to make sure she didn't lose you. The portal began to close and soon enough Saizo was nearly there with Mizore just a few inches away from them. Kirche looked back worried she's follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(4:11) But Mizore just barely managed to make it into the portal leaving her stranded and knowing you were gone. Mizore took a breath and grasped at what just happened. She couldn't believe she saw get taken right from her and all because she was ill-prepared. She cried out at her failure and swore she would get you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to the others in shame with dust all over her. They starred at her wondering why she was so down but after explaining it to them they understood what was at stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come we never saw it coming? We should have realized...\", said Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it's strange. First he was all dressed up like he was on a date and then snapped back to reality and then out of nowhere Saizo is his driver and is packing a rocket launcher! Nothing makes sense.\", Mizore explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea's who's behind this because Saizo isn't one for brains.\", Tskune mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keito, check anyone unaccounted for in the school.\", Kurumu suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you guys. Deshiko should be getting back to me about now.\", just as she finished he radio beeped. \"Anyone not present in the school aside from Saizo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one teacher, Ms. Mitsuki. Substitute, formal background is basic as can be, and has an aptitude in science subjects. Anything happen today that might connect her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty, thanks Deshiko. I just heard Ms. Mitsuki isn't here now. Didn't he have to meet her about something?\", Keito asked everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she told him to meet her after school to make up his math work but seemed flirtatious about it. In fact we never seen her before, a woman with the amount of attention she got from everyone, she'd be on everyone's list.\", Mizore mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she's behind this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seemed interested in him like she's a cougar. Oh lord I hope not! But yeah I'd say she's the brains and the one who also took him along with Saizo.\", Mizore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this in my locker did anyone else get these?\", Keito asked holding up her card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone held up their cards and they all gasped when they noticed they may have been manipulated. You think maybe they made us loose track of (Name)?\", Moka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but Mizore doesn't have one.\", Keito noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My guess I'd have thought it to be a trap and I'd have wised up to their plane before he got on the limo. My mom was announced that she'd be here making a visit but never came. I only spotted (Name) because I was headed to meet him in the room he was retaking his work.\", Mizore explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito took all the cards and placed them in evidence bags carfully placing them inside. \"Have your people analyze them. Meantime we figure out where that portal lead to, Kurumu grab Yukari and see if she can help. Everyone else we head to the scene where the portal emerged and we be ready to get (Name) back!\", Mizore yelled out giving orders to Keito's confusion.</span></div></div>",

When they got there, there was a man waiting for them. His name was Fearsome. He looked like any other man, but he was more of a mad scientist. When he saw them he was pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Ah! My queen. You have succeeded in your mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Yes Fearsome. We finally have the key to all our answers. This boy will be the one to rid my curse and he will be mine forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Yes my queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: How is your research coming along?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Very well. I have reason to believe that this boy has the sphere that increases or decreases a monsters power. Also the serum is working perfectly. As we speak the serum is tainting the sphere in his body. Eventually the sphere will turn completely black and we will be able to extract the sphere from his body and you will be able to use the sphere to be rid of your curse my queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Excellent! And what about the boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: He should be no problem. He is only at level three. The box will be able to hold him. At least for now. But if he reaches level five then.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Then what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Then he'll go into a violent rampage and destroy everything and everyone in it's path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Don't worry. We'll be able to extract the sphere by then. When will we begin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: But my queen. We shouldn't rush things. If we extract it now it might...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kirche gave him a sharp and intense stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Listen to me Fearsome. I know we are childhood friend, but know this. Don't fail me. There won't be another opportunity like this. I have been waiting all these years to be rid of this curse and.....to be with my beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you lovingly and traced your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Do it now! Or else! I won't let anyone get in my way! I will achieve my goals no matter what! So do it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome and Saizo cringed with fear, but Fearsome bowed and obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Yes. My mistress' wish is my command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Good. Now then, Saizo? Take him to the box.We don't want him to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Yes. My queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while Saizo was carrying you to the cage they all failed to realize one thing. The sun was beginning to set.

What the hell is going on here?!? Why am I in a cage?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Because I put you in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the.... Saizo! What are you doing here?!? and let me out of this cage! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: No way I'm doing that loser. I'm under strict orders to guard you by my queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Look buddy. I don't what you or your so called queen want with me, but you'll never get away with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Heh. I don't know why either, but I'm gonna enjoy having you in a cage. Because I get to torture you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Screw you! I'm not scared of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo gave you a sneering get demonic look trying to scare you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You should be. You bitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he fired a lightning bolt at the cage. The lightning shocked you inside the cage making you scream in pain. Saizo was enjoying this. He laughed with glee and shocked you again. You felt the lightning shock you throughout your body. When the lightning stopped you slumped over ready to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hehehe. Had enough yet? What happened to all that bravado? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't say anything. You couldn't even move. Saizo kicked the cage to try and see if you were alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hey. You alive? Maybe I'll give you one more shock just to be sure if you're alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to give you one more shock when a white light shined through the window. When you fell unconscious that was the very last thing you saw. Then you began to transform. As you were transforming the cage began to creak under the pressure and then cracks began to form on the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Oh shit! He's transforming! And he's breaking free from the cage! I must warn my queen before.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Saizo could finish you burst out of the cage with a raging growl. You looked at Saizo and you growled with anger. Before Saizo could cry for help you blasted him with a blizzard blast freezing him completely. Then you burst out from the window. When you did you raced instinctively toward the tower where the portal was. Meanwhile as for Kirche, when she caught wind as to what was going on she was in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Damn it! Saizo let him escape! He's getting away! Don't let him get away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Relax my queen. It is all part of my plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: What do you mean Fearsome?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: I anticipated he would turn into his werewolf form. I wanted to see for myself what level he was at. Surprisingly he is at level four. That means he's getting close to making the sphere inside him turn black and when it does we will be ready. Even if he escapes I have a back up plan to capture him. We just need more time to let the sphere turn black. Time is all I ask mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche hesitated, but then she decided to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Very well. We'll go with your plan Fearsome. Keep watch over the boy and prepare the back up plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you, you made it to the tower and somehow made it to the portal. When it opened you raced straight through it and the portal closed behind you. Meanwhile Mizore and the others were still looking for you. Suddenly the portal opened and the werewolf jumped through it and landed in front of them. He gave off a menacing and angry howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What the...!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: It's that werewolf again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: I don't remember it being so big and grey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Be careful everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito (thinking): Oh no! (name)'s morphed again! I can't let everyone know that he's the werewolf. I'll just have to let everyone try to capture him for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito (aloud): Everyone! Capture that werewolf now! Don't let it escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone charged at the werewolf and tried to capture it, but the werewolf easily overpowered them. Yukari and Kurumu tried to use their spells, but the werewolf just deflected them away. Then the werewolf fired a blizzard blast. Most of everyone had one part of their body frozen. Then the werewolf ran off into the forest. everyone gave chase, but the werewolf was too fast. It disappeared into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Damn it! It got away! Is everyone alright?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Sure! Rrrgggh!! Except for the part that we each have one of our body parts frozen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: We're fine Keito. But.....my butt's all frozen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! I can take losing a fight, but this is just mean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Geez! That werewolf keeps getting stronger and stronger every time it shows up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Everyone try to break free from the ice. After you're free go after the werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: What about (name)?!? We can't just abandon him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I'm well aware of that Mizore. Don't worry. We're splitting into two teams. One team will go find the werewolf and the other will continue the search for (name). Moka, Tskune, and me will continue the search for the werewolf.

Mizore greeted you with a rain of kisses on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh! Hey! Mizore hahaha. Take it easy! How's it going guys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name) are you feeling okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm feeling fine. Although I don't remember anything that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: You don't remember anything at all when you were knocked out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No. All I remember is that Saizo knocked me out and then they put me in a cage.

Sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Well one thing's for sure Saizo is the attacker who tried to kidnap Mizore and the one who tried to kidnap you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: That's true, but something's been bugging me about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What do you mean Tskune?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Saizo's pretty dumb to pull off this kind of plan. Not to mention someone like him can't pull off a kidnapping like that.Someone must be ordering him to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Tskune's got a point, but the question is who's ordering him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were all pondering, suddenly someone came up to you all surprising you all.

Surely Keito told you about the scientist who was coming to investigate the werewolf situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Well yes. I'm guessing you're her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mitsuki: Yup. My name is Tonya. I'm posing as a teacher here in Yokai to help Keito investigate the werewolf case. Apparently the werewolf is causing to much of a ruckus here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: You're the scientist&gt; I find it hard to believe since you're doing nothing, but flirt to attract attention. I mean you can't just flirt like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari, Moka, Tskune, Mizore, (name) thinking: Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) In any case, is there any reason that you came here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mitsuki: I came to speak with you (name). Ms. Keito wants to see you and she wants to see me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mitsuki: Don't know hun, but she told me that this was something that she could only tell me and you alone only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I see. I'm on my way then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Let us come with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! We wanna know what's going on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mitsuki: I'm sorry, but Keito told me to only come and get (name). The rest of you can't come. You are to attend classes normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: That's not fair! We want to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's OK Tskune. I'll catch up with you later. Don't worry about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name)! With everything that's happened to you, I won't let you go alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But Mizore....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mitsuki: Don't worry Mizore darling. (name)'s will be safe with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her arm around you lovingly making me Mizore red in the face with jealously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: That's precisely what I'm worried about!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily pulled away and gently kissed Mizore on the lips making her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry. I'll be fine. I'll catch up with you later. OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore hesitated, but then she felt reassured by her kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: OK. But she better not do something perverted to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No problem. I'll be right back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you followed Ms. Mitsuki back to Keito's headquarters. Everyone watched you and Ms. Mitsuki walk away then they went to class. Everyone except Moka and Mizore. Moka noticed that Mizore wasn't walking away so she stayed behind to check on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Mizore? Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'm worried. After every time I see (name) I try to tell him that I'm pregnant, but there's always something happening he or me end up being kidnapped. And.......for some reason I'm getting a really bad vibe from Ms. Mitsuki. Like....there's something weird about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Are you sure Mizore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes. I guess....I'm just being paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: No. You have every right to worry. Don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing serious. Maybe (name)'s getting a mission of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I hope your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Come on. Let's get to class. Okay? We'll see (name) later and we'll tell him together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Okay. Let's go Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka and Mizore were just about to leave when Moka felt something inside her. Then he rosary began to glow. At first she didn't know what to do, but then she checked to make sure Mizore wasn't around. Then she went into the bathroom so she could be alone and then the rosary glowed brighter and Inner Moka spoke to her through her rosary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Listen up Moka. Mizore is right to be worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Wait what do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: For some reason I'm getting a bad feeling from that Mitsuki girl. She has a strange monster energy. It's giving me bad vibes. Be careful and watch out for (name) too. I also feel that (name) and Mizore are going to be in danger. Just keep an eye out for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Wait what are you talking about? and what do you mean that (name) and Mizore are in danger?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rosary fell silent.

Regarding everything that's happened, we believe you and Mizore are apparently targets for some unknown reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I know. And I know who attacked me as well as who tried to kidnap me and Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Really? Who is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It was Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Keito heard this she stared at you with shock. Even Moka hiding in the shadows gasped with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name). Are you sure?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes. There's no doubt about it. I saw him with my own two eyes. He kept me in a cage at his boss' hideout. And I'm pretty sure he's the attacker who attacked me and Mizore back when the school was attacked by the fear gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Impossible. It can't be.... One of our own classmates would betray us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mitsuki: (name). Is there anything else you remember back when you were at the hideout where Saizo had you locked up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No....sadly I do not. Saizo shocked me with something inside the cage and then I blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mistuki: I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) By the way Keito. There's something I wanted to ask. I heard that the werewolf has been around also around the time that me and Mizore were kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: How did you know that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Trust me. I'm in the security committee. I know where I find my information. Apparently the werewolf's been showing up at every incident. I'm pretty sure it's no coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mitsuki: Hmm. What a smart boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: You're right. The werewolf has been showing up at every incident as you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Also there's one more thing. I think I the werewolf and Saizo are working together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Think about it. Wherever Saizo was, the werewolf was too. If we can just capture the werewolf then we can find out who Saizo works for and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: That's enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito's sudden change of tone in her voice made you (and Moka) jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: You're wrong! I know for a fact that, that creature is not with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Mitsuki: Easy Ms. Keito. You seem to know a great deal about that werewolf don't you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Watch your tone Tonya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wait a sec. Now that I think about it, you were trying to tell me who the werewolf was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I did, but now I don't know if I should tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Why not?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: You just can't OK?!?

Your eyes filled up with tears and pounded the floor in anger at yourself. You couldn't believe and you didn't want to believe it, but the fact was you hurt your friends including your own girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What have I done!?!?

You can have some fun with her if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Oh yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Saizo began punching and kicking Keito like a rag doll.

But whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: I said stop whining! Just get the boy and let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Get back here! I won't let you take him! Leave him alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: And what could you possibly do to stop me? Heh. Don't worry. The spell will wear off in a minute. But we'll be long gone. And......if you and your friends have a sudden burst of courage, I'll gladly destroy you. Now then....goodbye Keito. Hope to see you soon. Hahahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: NO!!! STOP!!! COME BACK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no good. Keito and Saizo disappeared along with you. Keito was all alone. She began to cry bitter tears of anger.

When Fearsome saw them he was very pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Ah! Mistress! You're back! Was your mission a success?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Yes. You were right. The boy's love for Keito as well as the snow woman's proved to be his downfall. He went into a frenzy when I attacked his second girlfriend. He reached level five just like you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Well done! I shouldn't expect anything less of my mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Hey! Could you stop the praise and let me put this mutt down already?!? He's really heavy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Watch your tongue Saizo! Need I remind you that boy is precious cargo so don't you dare drop him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome inspected your unconscious body. You were still sleeping and you were still a werewolf. Fearsome looked at every which away. Then he took some of your furr and put it into a scanner. When he saw the results he was even more pleased than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Yes! This is perfect! He's reached level five and the sphere is know completely black!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: We established that. But now is he ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Yes. But at the same time he isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Say what?!? What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche gave Saizo a deadly glare making him shut up comepletely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Now then Saizo. I have a question for you. Why did we go through all this trouble anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Allow me to explain. Remember when the boy bonded with the sphere when he was little? Well Mira wanted to protect the boy and the sphere so to make sure it wouldn't be used for evil purposes. She placed a spell on it making it impossible to remove. In order to remove it two conditions have to be made. One the sphere had to be tainted with darkness. Two if the sphere needed to be taken out. It had to be taken out by pure energy. Now the sphere can never to be tainted on the outside unless........there was something on the inside that could taint the sphere. I pondered on this and I experimented. Thankfully Yoaki Academy was had the perfect test subjects to test my experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: You mean....the fear toxin was just an experiment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Yes. Thanks to that I was able to make a toxin that made the purest of human become a terrifying monster. The reason why I made Saizo inject the serum that made him change into a werewolf was to make the serum slowly make the sphere filled with evil energy. So that we could remove the sphere and control it's power. Also to get the energy we need I made this machine to extract it using that pure energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome pushed the button and a giant ray like machine appeared from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: I see. But what about the energy? You said the energy had to be pure in order to remove the sphere right? Where are we going to get that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: I already have a solution to that question. The purest form of energy and the energy that has the power for us to get that sphere is up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to the roof. At first Kirche didn't get it, but then the roof opened up and reveal the stars and the moon. Then Kirche understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: The moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Exactly. Tomorrow night is the next full moon. This machine gets its power by collecting lunar power from the moon.Then fires a beam that will extract the sphere from (name)'s body. And then we will finally be able to use the sphere for our own purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Yes. And once we do that. I'll bond with the sphere and I'll be my normal self again and I will rule this world and the human world! But most of all, (name) will be all mine and no one else will have him!!!! HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo muttering: OK. She's definitely flipped her wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Saizo! Did you say something!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: No mistress. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Good. Now put (name) in his room. Make sure he doesn't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo disappeared in a cloud of smoke not wanting to tick her off anymore than he had too. Then she turned to Fearsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: As for you prepare for the extraction by tonight. Don't keep me waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: As you command mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fearsome returned to his work Kirche walked out of the room and stopped in front of the doorway. She looked at Fearsome as he doing his work. Then she left and returned to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: I know you won't let me down......Scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed something. Something flashed by the window. At first she thought she saw someone, but she walked on suspecting nothing. But what she didn't know that someone was watching her. A young woman was spying on her. In fact she heard the entire conversation between her and Fearsome.<br>\r\nWhen she heard enough she raced off. She raced toward one location in particular.

Then the doors opened and the nurse stepped out of the room. Everyone automatically looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: How is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Please tell us. Is Keito going to be alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Please! Is she gonna die?!? Will she go under surgery?!? Will she.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse: Don't worry. She may have suffered a couple to bruises and cuts, but don't worry she'll be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Whew. Thank goodness<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: She's OK.

She said it is very important and you all need to be in the room to hear what she has to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone followed the nurse and she led them to Keito. She was lying down on the bed looking healthy, but she was still a little groggy over last nights events. When Deshiko saw her, she eyes gushed out with tears and she hugged Keito like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Waaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh! Keito! Thank goodness you're okay?!? Are you in any pain?!?

That's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Tell us everything you know and don't leave any details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Keito explained everything that happened that night.

In fact, I've known this for quite a while know. It's......regarding the werewolf incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: The werewolf incident?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka then froze up. She remembered what she had overheard on that day. The day she overheard that you were the werewolf. She knew exactly what she was going to say. She was going to tell them that you were the werewolf. She wasn't gonna stick around because she was worried that her friends will overreact. But then Keito voice made her stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Hold it Moka. You need to stay too. After all you know about what I'm talking about because you overheard everything I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: What?!? How did you......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: One of my buddies said they saw walking into my office. Seriously. You really didn't think I would notice did you?

There must have been quite a struggle. There had to be something here. I just know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yukari saw something. The blood she had found on the rock was a trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Whoever was wounded after the caught (name) must have gone this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari followed the trail deeper and deeper into the forest until she came to a dead end. The trail of blood stopped in front of a giant boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: This doesn't make any sense. Why would the trail just stop here? Unless.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari began to feel around the rock. She felt around until suddenly she felt some of the rock give way like a button. Then the boulder shook and slowly opened up like a door and inside it was a portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: No way! This must be how they escaped! It's just like the one back in Yokai Academy! And the trail stops right over here so now I'm sure! I better go back and tell the others!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Yukari raced away to report back to Keito to what she found. But while she wasn't looking the woman that was at Kirche's hideaway was watching Yukari. She stood motionless for one moment, but then she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

And why got to such lengths to do all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two reasons. You don't remember this but it's true. When your mother was still around I secretly befriended you unknown to her knowledge. We secretly meet every night until the day we swore this, 'We will one day be together forever even in death.', we said those exact words. But that night your mom realized my intentions of making you my mate of fate and used a memory wipe spell to take away our time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So out of unrequited love? That's the reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just for dragging you into this but because of a promise I made to your mother. She and I swore that we would use the source to make the world a better place. I seek to obliterate the humans leaving the survivors as helpless animals. While the monsters who resided in secret through fictional stores become the dominant species. She sought the idea of peace. But in the end, peace would only reach Japan at best. The rest of the world will be terrified and retaliate. So I decided to use the sphere to make me a queen succubus and have the world worshiping me as a goddess. I am after all among the most beautiful of my kind wouldn't you agree (Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only one who earns that title and would be a far better leader than you, is Kurumu Kurono!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I doubt you'll be saying that after tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm giving you a choice.

Sigh, why can't you just grow up faster so we can be together?\", Kirche thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already are. Were standing right next to each other.\", you replied still not aware of how complex relationships play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you silly. I mean as...well..as a couple.\", Kirche clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...aren't we already? I mean I like you and you like me? Isn't that how two people who love each other feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple. I mean does your mommy act the way I do? I certainly hope not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Your...don't tell her this. But I like you more than her, a bit. You make me so happy and...you make me feel good.\", Kirche made you feel like yourself and she never ounce annoyed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww. Hey, have you ever kissed a girl before?\", Kirche asked wanting to so badly start their romantic relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, no...not really..I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want your first kiss from me? It'll be our little secret. Besides, nobody is looking.\", she flirted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....your pretty enough and...I like you...but....well...ok.\", you reluctantly answered since it made you shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche leaned in and was ready to kiss you and you slowly went in as well. You were so nervous that you had no idea what to do. But soon enough you both pressed your lips against one another. Kirche didn't slip her tongue in since you weren't old enough for that kind of kissing yet, but it still felt nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\", she asked after you two broke it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That made me feel weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But was it bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know something (Name), I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than how my mom and dad do?\", you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than them combined. I want to be with you forever. Not just these late night meetings we have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's swear on it. This way that love won't die and still be around no matter where we go. I (Name), Promise that one day me and Kirche will be with together forever even if I die trying. How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Kirche, promise that one day me and (Name) will be together forever even in death. Perfect. Now how do you think we should seal the deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shake hands? That's how deals normally end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a deal this special needs more of a romantic feel to it. Maybe another kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\", you replied almost wanting another just because it was something you wanted to experience again for no concrete reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both pressed your lips together a bit hard since this was a very big deal you two were forming. You didn't force yourself to kiss her that hard because you wanted to out of affection but rather like a firm handshake, only through your lips. Kirche did it out of affection and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be going. Mom might get worried about me.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay with me just a little longer. I want us to love each other more. We just started out as a couple.\", Kirche insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIRCHE! What in gods name are you doing to my son?!\", yelled your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, shes nice. Were a couple.

How dare you try and make him your mate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't age a day now! So why bother repressing our feelings?! You love me right (Name)?\", Kirche persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, she is a very bad person.

The same where you and I met and fell in love and made this little miracle. So don't tell me you give up when our baby's future is at stake. I'm not going to give up, and I won't have you give up either.\", Mizore said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hugged Mizore tightly indicating you weren't going to let her down. \"Hey! Ass-hole! Yeah you!\", you yelled to Saizo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you calling an ass-hole?!\", he replied angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we get some food around here?

Why would he need a magic suit if he was going to control the energy anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: He probably didn't expect to control it so easily. In any case, this armor has the power is to enhance the power whoever wears it. But it puts a strain on the body. So he didn't want to use it unless he absolutely had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Deshiko's radio started beeping like crazy. Deshiko went by herself to answer the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeshiko: Yes?

If you put on that armor the way you are right now you could.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kirche! We don't have time to worry about that! If we don't act now Tskune, along with every other innocent monster at Yokai will die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: But she's right though! You can't put on that armor.

Someone else should wear the armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) There's no time for this. I\"m aware of the risks, but I have to do this! My mom was a part of this, so I have to be the one to finish it.

He wanted to test his new powers by conquering Yokai Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Hahaha! Now this world will fear the name of Fearsome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome was about to attack the school, but then an attack fired straight at him, but it didn't faze him. He looked and he had an unexpected surprise. There was an army from the security committee led by Tskune. When word got out that Fearsome was on his way to conquer Yokai, Tskune gathered all the people he could to help defend Yokai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Well, well, well. Looks like the welcome committee is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Fearsome! Your evil scheme ends here! You want to conquer Yokai? You gotta get past us first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: How annoying. Oh well. I need to test my new powers anyway. I'll play with you a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Fearsome charged and launched a powerful energy wave. The wave sent a whole bunch of Tskune's squad flying, but Tskune and the other stood their ground. A wave of the squad charged at Fearsome and used their brute force to attack, but Fearsome dodged every one of the attacks. Then he launched another powerful wave sending everyone flying. Fearsome was feeling very pleased with himself and was enjoying his new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Hahahaha! Child's play!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt a strong presence behind him. He looked in time to see Tskune launch a powerful kick to his face. Fearsome was sent flying into a tree. A thin trickle of blood dropped down on his chin. He looked at Tskune with anger and confusion. Tskune was different. He looked the same, but he was radiating with monster energy. His eyes were also a deep red color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome (thinking): Those eyes! He couldn't be!<br>\r\n(aloud) You little brat! You're a vampire aren't you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: What does it matter? The only thing you should be worried about is you getting your butt beat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Don't get cocky you little punk. Just because you were able to make me spit a little blood doesn't mean you'll be to beat me. Now I'll show you what real power is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Fearsome began radiating an aura of his own. Only his aura was way stronger than Tskune's and the ground began to tremble. Tskune's squad began to tremble with fear. Even Tskune began to sweat a little, but he refused to back down. He threw a barrage of kicks and puinches, but Fearsome dodged them all. Then he punched Tskune in the gut making him cough up a lot of blood and then charged all of his energy into his hand and unleashed all of it in a powerful beam. The force of the beam even sent all of Tskune's squad flying. When the smoke cleared bodies lied everywhere. Fearsome was standing next to Tskune and stepped on his head. He was feeling very pleased with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Hahaha! Pathetic! I only used my full power for a moment and this is all you are? I expected more from a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was walking away when Tskune grabbed him by his leg, determined to keep fighting to stop Fearsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Oh? You're still alive are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Screw.......you......you.......monster! I won't.....let you......conquer......our school......I'd......rather die.....than.....to see you.......win.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Is that so? Very well. Since you want to die so badly who am I stop you? I'll even help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged his energy and aimed at Tskune about to finish him off. Tskune closed his eyes and waited for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune (thinking): I'm sorry Moka. (name). Mizore. Everyone. I wasn't strong enough. I guess, I'm going to die here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome was about to fire his energy blast to kill Tskune when......</span></div></div>",

Then a big gust of cold wind blew toward him and was beginning to freeze him. Fearsome knocked the wind away by making his own wind. Then someone flashed by Fearsome picked up Tskune and carried him to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Who did that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I did Fearsome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome looked up in the sky and there you were carrying Tskune in your arms safe and sound. The armor you were wearing grew wings and you were filled with power. When Tskune opened his eyes, he saw you. He thought you were the most awesome sight he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: (name)....Moka....everyone....you're here....I can't believe it.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Easy Tskune. You should take it easy and rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou descend from the sky and landed safely on the ground. When Fearsome saw you, he was most annoyed. To make things even more annoying for him, you weren't alone. From the sky Inner Moka and Kurumu carrying Yukari flew from out of nowhere and landed on your right. Then Keito swung from a tree using her threads with Deshiko following close behind her, Mizore slid in using her ice powers and Kirche appeared on your left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: So I see you're all still alive. Including you Kirche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yukari and Keito checked on Tskune on his condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yukari. Keito. How's Tskune?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: He's fine. He is a little beaten up though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: He'll be fine. He just needs a healing spell and some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka looked at Tskune and saw how beaten up he was. Then she looked at Fearsome with anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: You bastard! You did this to him didn't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: So what if I did? He was weak. I guess all you vampires are always weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka charged at him ready for a fight, but then you stopped her by blocking her way with your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Moka! Don't fight him! I know he hurt Tskune, but that's what he wants. He's just goading you to a fight. Calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka then calmed down and listened to you. Fearsome then roared with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Hahahaha! Pathetic! You people are all the same! You put stupid feelings and love above everything else. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: What did you say you big bully?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: What's your problem?!? What's wrong with being in love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Everything! It's pointless, needless, and causes more pain. Kirche should know about that more than anybody. Right my dear Kirche? After all your just like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: What are you talking about? I'm nothing like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: You know very well what I'm talking about. I've heard about your little obsession with your boy toy. I've heard about how much you \"loved\" him. Personally it's pathetic. You were willing to do whatever it took just to be with him. Even killing innocent people. And all because you wanted to be with you \"destined\" one and cure your....um...condition. We're alike you and I. We both want power to accomplish our goals and we will do anything necessary to get them. The way I see it. We both also have done unspeakable things, so unspeakable that they can no one can ever EVER forgive us for our actions. I'm surprised that your so called \"friends\" haven't killed you or deserted you yet. No wonder the boy's mother separated you from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche couldn't speak after that. She remembered all the things she did and she felt bad about them. Fearsome's words hit her pretty hard and tears began to form in her eyes. Fearsome smiled with glee. You and the others felt sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: I'll tell you what Kirche. I can save you. I can help you take away all your pain. All you have to is say the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche at this point didn't know what to do. You could see that she was on the breaking point. You were about to stop her, but someone else beat you to the punch and that someone was Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Shut your mouth you stupid old man! You don't know anything about her! Kirche may have done some things in the past that were unforgivable, but there's one thing that makes her different from you! She has a loving heart! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That's right! She may have committed a lot of crimes, but at least she's trying to make up for them! She realized what she did was wrong and she's got us! Unlike you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Yeah! She also loves (name) as much as we do! And she was willing to sacrifice her life to save us! That proves more than enough that she's a good person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: And she's got us! We'll never let fall to the likes you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Mizore.... (name).....everyone.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Moka had to agree what you all had to say, but she was to stubborn to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Feh! Who cares?!? It doesn't matter anyway because your all gonna die! And once you're all out of the way, I'll take over Yokai Academy and then the human world! HAHAHAHAAH!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final battle was about to get underway and you knew that the battle was gonna be intense. Then Keito spoke to you in a hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name). Fearsome's monster energy is off the chain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I know, but I can take him. Keito, you and the others get out of here and take care of the wounded. I'll handle Fearsome<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hold on. You may be stronger (name), but i don't know if you'll be strong enough. I'm staying with you. We'll fight him together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Wait Mizore. That's too dangerous. I have an idea. The armor that (name) is wearing should be the key to winning this fight. The armor's power makes whoever is wearing it stronger if the wearer absorbs monster energy, but there's a possibility that the person could lose control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: That's even more risky! If (name) loses control Fearsome will win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Come on guys! We gotta make a decision now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do? Should you all fight together or have everyone lend you their monster energy for you to fight Fearsome?</span></div></div>",

Let's kick his ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: No way! If Mizore's gonna be fighting with you then I will too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Yeah! Me too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No. Keito, you and Kirche have to clear everyone in the area. Get all the students of here and make sure everyone is safe. Please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes. Get everyone to a safe distance and leave this to us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: No way! It's my fault your in this mess to begin with. It would only....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Keito felt Kirche's hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Keito. We should go. Do as he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: But Kirche! Fearsome's super strong and I don't know if they can beat them on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah! It's practically suicide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: I know how you all feel, but we'd only get in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: She's right. This a battle even a S class vampire like me can't get into. Besides, you should all have a little faith. After all, love conquers everything right? Or whatever that sayings supposed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito looked at Kirche and could see that Kirche's wanted to stay too, but she knew she couldn't and she knew that Moka was right. She stood up and called out to all the people that were around so they could hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Everyone! If you're still able to move retreat and help the injured! Get back to Yokai where it's safe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone student hearing Keito's words all moved toward the academy. Those who were injured were carried by other students who still had the strength to move. Keito and Kirche were about to follow, but then Keito and Kirche turned around and they each gave you a kiss on the cheek. Mizore nearly face-faulted for what she just saw and you blushed beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hey! What the hell are you two doing kissing my man?!? (name)'s mine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Just giving (name) a good luck charm. And to give you a little extra motivation Mizore. Right Kirche?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Yup. That's right Keito. Hahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Grrrrr!!! When this is over I'm gonna freeze you two to death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore was annoyed, but then she smiled and laughed and Keito and Kirche did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Don't you die on us Mizore. We're counting on you to take care of (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: We all love him very much. So make sure you protect him and kick this guys ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I will. Don't worry. I won't even let him lay a finger on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kirche and Keito followed the others back to Yokai. You, Mizore and Fearsome were now the only ones left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Are you finished with your little display? If so then I would like to defeat you two now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) The only one who's gonna get defeated is you! You ready Mizore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes! Let's do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you held Mizore's hand. She suddenly felt power welling up inside of her and she could feel her monster energy increasing. Her clothes became ice armor and she had ice wings. She then realized that you had transferred a little bit of your power to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: What is this? My power! It's overflowing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: What the hell?!? Why are you giving that girl your power?!? And how is this happening?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Isn't it obvious? We're lovers. And lovers share everything together. When two lovers fight together and when they have something to protect, there's nothing that they can't do or accomplish! Something that a madman like you that's obsessed with power and taking over the world could never understand! Let's go Mizore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Right! Let's show this bastard the power of our love and our bonds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs then, the final battle began......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Final Battle began. Fearsome gunned straight at you and Mizore with both of his fists filled with monster energy. He was hungry to kill the both of you, but you and Mizore were ready for him. You both dodged the attack by taking off into the sky. Fearsome's impact was so powerful the whole ground shook. Then Mizore fired a storm of icicles with a wave of her wings. Millions of icicles rained down on Fearsome, but he defended by unleashing a barrier to protect himself. You swooped down and broke through Fearsome's barrier with a powerful punch and launched a powerful kick at Fearsome. Fearsome deflected the kick by using his arm, but his arm rung in pain from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Grrr. You're more powerful than I thought boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm not the only one who's powerful here! Go Mizore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly jumped out of the way and Mizore swooped in with her right hand turned into an ice punch, nailed Fearsome right in the face. Next you hit Fearsome with a series of kicks and then hit him in the gut with a powerful punch. Fearsome was sent flying to the forest. He hit a couple of trees, but he quickly regained his composure. You and Mizore followed close behind in hot pursuit. Then when they saw Fearsome getting up from the rubble of trees, they automatically attacked from the sky. Mizore took a deep breath and unleashed a powerful blizzard breath attack. You gathered all of your energy into your hands and unleashed a powerful beam of energy. Both attacks hit Fearsome with a mighty explosion. So big and so powerful that everyone back at Yokai Academy felt the tremors inside the building. Everyone was safe and sound, but your friends were worried. Especially Keito and Kirche. They prayed that you and Mizore would defeat Fearsome and get back safely. Then in the after effects of the explosion Fearsome stepped out of the destruction, but he was hurt. His clothes were in taters and he was a little bloody. By now he couldn't believe it. Two kids were actually beating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Damn it! This is impossible! How can these two brats be beating me?!? I have the supreme power! I should be stronger than them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You still don't get it do you? No matter how much power you have, power doesn't win in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Love, friendship, and conviction win. Things that a creep like you will never understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Grrrrr!!!! I won't accept this! I refuse to accept this!!!! If you care about love so much, then I'll make you weak by killing one of you!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Fearsome went off the deep end and fired a shower of energy attacks. You and Mizore dodged them all, but then Fearsome took advantage of the attack and then.......</span></div></div>",

You dived in and stopped the attack before he had a chance to hit Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh no you don't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you sent him flying with a punch to the face. Suddenly you felt a little weak. You staggered and then you fell on one knee. Mizore quickly rushed to your side to check to see if you were all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name)! Are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah. I'm fine. I just felt a little weak for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Well, well. Looks like your suffering the after effects of the armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Hehehe you fool. You put on that armor even though that I practically drained you of your power? That armor serves as an amplifier and increases whoever has powers. You shouldn't have been using it all willy nilly since I drained you of all your power. Actually I'm pretty surprised that you still have some energy left. No matter. Pretty soon you'll run out of power and then killing the both of you will be all the more easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Damn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Are you sure that you're OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah, but we need to finish this quickly. If we don't, I'll run out of power and we'll never be able to defeat this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome was right about one thing, the armor may have amplified your powers, but since your sphere was extracted there was no way that you would be able to last much longer. You felt weak and you felt that you wouldn't be to last much longer. Even Mizore having received some of your remaining power, wouldn't stand much of a chance fighting Fearsome either. You had to think of something fast otherwise Fearsome would win. But how? Then you had an idea, but you and Mizore had only one shot to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore. There's only one way that we can win, but we both need to work together. Also don't do anything until I give the word Understood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hold on! If what Fearsome said was true, then you could be in danger if you use your powers again. And if we lose here, both worlds will be in danger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry. I'll be fine. Just trust me OK? Only you and I can do this together. All right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore hesitated at first, but then she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: OK. Just don't over do it. I don't want you to get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: It doesn't matter what you do. In the end you'll both die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Shut up bastard! You're the one that's going down! Let's do it (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It's time to end this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Mizore held hands once again and your energies mixed together and both of your powers began to increase. Fearsome wasn't going to stand there and let you two do this. He put his hands together and began charging all of his power into his hands. A giant ball of energy formed into his hands and prepared to fire at you and Mizore. Mizore was about to try and dodge it, but then she remembered that you told her not to move. She didn't know what you had planned, but she decided to trust you and stayed put. Then Fearsome finished charging his energy and prepared to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: HAHAHA! Now then stay there like a giant bull's eye and DIE!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Fearsome fired his attack with all he had. The beam hit with a deafening boom and there was nothing, but a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: HAHAHAHAAHAHA!!!!!! I won! I won! I finally beat those two little brats!!! Now with them out of the way I can take over Yokai! And after that I take over the human world! I will destroy everyone in my way! Like I did with those two brats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the smoke cleared and you and Mizore were still standing and both of you were in the still standing and holding hands. Both your enrgies were still on the rise and were getting stronger and stronger. When Fearsome saw this, he was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Impossible!!! They're still alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Here we go Mizore! Do it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: OK! Here goes!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Fire on the right...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Ice on the left....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore and (name): Put them both together and you get..........BLAZING BLIZZARD STORM!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Mizore fired both of your attacks at the same time. The fire and ice attacks mixed together and made one giant attack aimed straight at Fearsome. All Fearsome could do was gape and stare with fear and shock. He tried to stop it, but it was too overwhelming. The attack overpowered him and he was hit full force with the attack. The attack was so powerful that the beam shot past Yokai Academy and looked like it was tearing the sky apart. Everyone that was at Yokai saw the beam and they were amazed. Soon the beam dispersed and all was quiet. When the smoke cleared Fearsome was still standing, but his clothes were burned and frozen and he was completely knocked out. The battle was over and you and Mizore had won the fight. Fearsome was finally defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes! We won!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah. I guess we did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's finally over. We did it. We really did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both heard cheering. Then Kirche, Keito, Moka and the rest of the gang were running toward you two congratulating you two on your victory. Suddenly you felt really dizzy and then you fell unconscious. Then......</span></div></div>",

Then she faced Mizore with a stern look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm not fully convinced that my son is ready to see me yet. He has grown up with a harsh life and soon as he saw me, he would remember all the pain that he had to go through because of me. He hated everyone who treated him badly, including the monsters that bullied him. I'm sure he would probably want to have the sphere hidden and to keep things the way they are and he would never want to see me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: That's not true! (name) is a kind and caring person! He would never hate you! Sure there were some tough times he had to go through, but now he has friends and he understand the value of life and friendship and he now cares about everyone human and monsters!

You seem troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name). Listen. There's some things I want to ask you. First off you love me right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well yes. Of course I do.

We monsters been hiding our true selves for who knows how long. Not to mention we've been learning how to coexist with humans because we were afraid what the humans would think of us if we showed our true selves. Also the humans are cruel and are filled with hatred. You know first hand what it's like. Your mom left when you were little and you were filled with hate because of how you were treated. And monsters are the same way. In a way humans are like monsters and vise versa. We've always been told that humans and monsters can never truly understand each other and yet.....here we both are, me a monster and you a human falling in love with each other and understanding each other, Not to mention Moka and Tskune as well. Which brings me to my questions. Listen (name). I want to ask you something and please be honest with me OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well...sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mizore was talking to you, your mother was listening in shadows waiting for your answer.

Then you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well.....where do I begin? For starters, let me just say that yes it's been rough. Ever since my mom left me, it was overwhelmingly painful. I was constantly thinking that something happened to her or she died. Because of that I've never talked to anyone because I never wanted to feel that pain ever again. That's why I never wanted to make friends. But that only made things worse for me. I've constantly been picked on and people took advantage of me a lot and sometimes I wished that I've never been born. That made not trust people, thinking that they were always out to get you so they could use you for their own evil ends. Then I came to Yokai Academy because of my dad getting an application he found somewhere. I was expecting it to be the same like it was in the human world and it kinda was since Saizo and a few others picked on me just like the others. And to be honest I wanted to leave the school right there on the spot because I hated it so much and I was scared of being abandoned like my mom abandoned me. But then......I met you......and Tskune and the others too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held Mizore's hand and she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): When I first met you and the others I thought that you guys would take advantage of me like the others did, but then.....you guys showed me kindness, friendship, and you even saved my life a couple times. I didn't understand why you guys cared about me, but then I realized that you guys are good people and you guys refused to let someone like me go through this pain. That made me reconsider about what I thought about people. I realized that there are some people that are kind and are true friends. After a while I grew to love this school and the people who were in it. You guys didn't care if I was human or a monster. Just for being me. Thank to that I was able to learn not all people are just gonna abandon you. I wouldn't be the man I am today if it wasn't for you guys. So to answer your question; do I hate my mom for leaving?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused impressively making Mizore and your mom hold their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No. I don't. Because I know that she wouldn't want me to be sad and that she loves me with all her heart. And I'll always will love her no mater what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore smiled and your mother had tears of joy streaming down her face. Then Mizore gave you a big hug and a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I'm so proud of you (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks Mizore. Now do you have any her other questions for me Mizore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Just one more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

Mizore tense at first, but then her tension washed away with pleasure and returned the kiss. After a few minutes of kissing Mizore pulled away to catch her breath. Her voice was husky and her eyes were glazed with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name). Are you sure about this? Someone might come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): We'll be fine. Besides I doubt anyone is gonna be coming to infirmary this time of night. Trust me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: OK. But, if we're gonna be doing it, let me make you feel good first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had you sit down on a chair and she kneeled in front of you. Then she took off her shirt and unhooked hr bra revealing her small, but ample breasts. You couldn't help, but admire how beautiful and how white her skin was. In response to your thoughts your member began to get hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. I'll never get over how beautiful you look. Especially your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIzore: Hahaha. Thank you. Same with you. Now stay still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skillfully took of your pants as well as your trousers and your member sprang up pointing straight up toward the ceiling. She positioned your member between her breasts and moved them up and down stroking your member. A wave of pleasure ran throughout your body making your grip the chair tightly while Mizore continued. She saw how good you were feeling and she smiled alluringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Well (name)? Does it feel good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-yes. It does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Well then, allow me to make it even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began lubribcating the tip with saliva, then she began to lick it erotically. You were expecting it to be cold since she was a snow woman, but her tongue was warm. She slid her lips over the tip and began to suck while massaging the base of your member with her breasts. The pleasure intensified making your body heat go on the rise. Then you Mizore's tongue tickle the shaft inside her mouth. This made moan as a sharp pang of pleasure ran throughout your body. Mizore smiled with satisfaction pleased that she was making your feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore (thinking): Looks like he's feeling good. Better take it a step higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she quickened her pace. She rubbed her breasts faster and harder and let even more saliva coat your member, making the lubrication and the pleasure even better. You moaned even louder as the pleasure intensified. You were beginning to see white and your eyes rolled to the back of your head. You held Mizore's head as it bobbed up and down. The pleasure mounted as you were on the brink of orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore! Pull back! If you keep this up, I'm gonna....(moan)....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's OK. I can take it. Just cum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Mizore sucked on the tip as hard (but gently) as she could. It felt like a bolt of lightning went through your body and then you came. You member exploded with sperm into Mizore's mouth. Mizore at first was surprised, but she managed to keep your member in her mouth and swallowed your semen. When your orgasm ended, your sense of reasoning came back and your realized what Mizore did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore! You.....you swallowed my....why did you swallow it? It's nasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: No it's not. It's not nasty at all. Because it came from you. And nothing about you is nasty at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoved by Mizore's words you blushed beet red and your member stood up once more even harder than before. Now it was time for the big finish. You lied down on the bed and Mizore lied down on top of you. She took off her panties revealing her womanhood and she straddled herself over you, positioning herself over your member. Her aims your member with her hand and slowly lowered herself. Mizore's butt was now on your lap and your member was sticking up inside her. You could feel Mizore squeezing all around you inside her. The pleasure was so overwhelming you almost came, but you grind your teeth to suppress it.  You slowly began to push upward, careful not to make yourself come to early. Mizore moaned as her body twisted due to the stimulus. Then Mizore began to rock her hips and matched the timing of your thrusting. Mizore's breast bobbed up and down as thrusting grew harder and faster. You reached and grabbed Mizore's breasts and pinched her nipples making her moan louder. All of this was making her feel good, but you felt like you need to making her feel even better. You wanted to make her feel so good that she would scream your name, but how? Then you see the solution to your problem. You saw when the two of you were joined, a little pebble of flesh was poking out which was Mizore's clitorus. You reached for it and gave it a slight, but gentle pinch. Suddenly Mizore's opened wide in shock and surprise and she let out a yelp of pleasure and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: AHHHH!!! Don't touch me there!!! It's too strong! If you keep rubbing me there, I'm gonna go crazy!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was saying no, her body was screaming yes. You continued on your assault in her clitorus and Mizore's moans began to turn into screams and her insides began to tighten around you even more. Mizore began to jerk was she approached her peak and were you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore! I'm gonna.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Give it to me (name)! I want you to come inside me!! GIVE IT TO ME!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pumped into Mizore like crazy and then you saw nothing, but white again and gave one more final thrust and then your member exploded with semen inside her. Mizore's body arched backward and she let a huge scream. She went as stiff as a board and then she collapsed on top of you. She looked you with dewy eyes and she kisses you reveling in her orgasm. Then she rested her head on your chest and rested for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You OK Mizore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes......I'm fine......   That.....felt so.......awesome......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Me too. You think you'll have twins after that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I don't....know, but we'll see.... For now.....I want to....stay like this a little longer....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen......</span></div></div>",

Luckily you found her on your way to school. You quickly caught up with her. At first she was a bit sulky, but then you were bowing on your hands and knees just to get her to forgive you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore at first turned away not speaking to you, but then she saw you bowing on your hands and knees and she smiled. And she gave you a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Aww, I can't stay mad at you forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: But.....we better find Moka just to make sure she won't blab. If she blabs to everyone.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mizore blushed beet red at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I don't even wanna think about it! I'd be so embarrassed I'd die! Wait a sec. Why would Moka blab in the first place? I mean she is our friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: That's what you think. Moka has the biggest blabber mouth in Yokai history. I bet she's blabbing to Tskune right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm sorry. If I wasn't such a horny perv, this never would have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's OK (name) really. Besides, to be honest I.....kinda liked doing it in the infirmary. It kinda added an extra thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Reallly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Really. And maybe......she can do that again sometime?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard Mizore's words your member began to get hard and you blushed beet red. You were about to kiss her on the spot, but you quickly remembered that you needed to focus on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure. Now let's find Moka. We need to apologize to her as soon as possible. Not to mention keep her quiet about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So, where do we have to start looking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Maybe she's back at the clubroom. That's a good place to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK then let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both went to newspaper club's room everywhere was just the same as it was. Then you remembered the stuff that happened the other night. The night when the human and monster worlds became linked and you saw your mother. You'd think that everything would be different since that night, but things looked pretty much the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now that I think about it, shouldn't things be different now? The human and monster worlds are now linked after all. And I wonder how my mom is doing? I only caught a quick glimpse at her. I wish I could have spoken to her. I wonder how she's doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you arrive at the clubroom. Mizore was just about to open the door, but hand stopped at the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What wrong Mizore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I don't know why, but I'm nervous. What if.....she's told Tskune and they're gonna tease us about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh come on, We'll be OK. We'll go in and apologize to Moka and ask her never to tell anyone what we did. Simple as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: You're right. And if she does tell anyone, I'll freeze her and send her to Antarctica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK......I don't think you need to to go that far. Anyway let's go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: K. Moka I need to.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mizore opened the door she froze in her tracks and her eye went wide with surprise and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore what's......what the...!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw the reason why Mizore was shocked.

The reason being was that Moka was lying on the table with her breasts exposed and Tskune's pants were down and he was connected with Moka. In other words, they were doing it. There was a long silence in the room and then Moka yelped in embarrassment and covered her breasts and Tskune tried pulling his shirt down to try to cover his bottom half. You and Mizore blushed and both darted out of the room and stood out of the room in silence. Then you spoke in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore.....what the heck did we just see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: I think....we just saw Moka and Tskune doing it in the clubroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's what I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You think.....they'll be mad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Probably. Then again Moka kinda saw us so it makes it even right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. We should still apologize. I mean we were gonna go see Moka anyway to get her to keep our secret so that should be breaking even right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. You're right. Let's go in and apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both entered the room. Moka and Tskune were now fully dressed. When you and Mizore went into the room, you both automatically bowed and apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore and (name): We're so sorry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hey don't worry about it. Just keep it a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): If I may ask, why were you and Moka doing it in the clubroom in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Well.....it was originally Moka's idea and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore hearing Tskune's words screamed in embarrassment. Her hair automatically turned to ice and her hand turned to an ice claw and pointed it toward Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Moka!! I should freeze you and stuff you in the freezer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Wait!  Wait! Mizore! You didn't hear the rest of the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Anyway, Moka told me what and she said she wanted to give doing it at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Say what?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Is this true Moka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka was now red in the face and she fidgeted as she explained in a timid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Well....I saw how you two were doing it and it looked like you two were having better sex....so I....told Tskune because I wanted to give it a try to see that doing it in school would make the sex better. I'm so sorry! I was so shocked that I didn't know how to react. I swear I won't tell anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Me too. Besides the last thing we want is the entire school knowing that four students are having sex at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Let's try to keep it to a minimum OK? Since we all saw each other doing it, we should call it even by not telling anyone what we saw. Sound good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka, Tskune, and Moka: Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you suddenly remembered about your mom fusing the two worlds together. You figured since Tskune and Moka were here in the school earlier, maybe they noticed any changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Tskune. Moka. Did you notice anything different about the school lately?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: No we didn't notice anything strange.

They were both panting like they had just run a marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hey! Kurumu! Yukari! What's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: You both look like you two had seen a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Guys! You have to come quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Why? Is there something going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Just come on! You won't believe it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you all went outside to see what Kurumu and Yukari were excited about. When you all got outside, Yukari and Kurumu led you to the tunnel which was the link to Yokai and the human world. The portal was way bigger and you were all seeing the human world on the other side of the portal. When you you all were amazed and shocked with what you saw. All the students of Yokai Academy were standing outside looking to see what was going on as well. The commotion was so loud the headmaster himself came to see what all the commotion was about. And when he saw what the students were seeing, he was shocked too. On the other side of the portal there was a crowd of humans looking at the monsters on the other side of the portal. The monsters looked at the humans and humans looked at the monsters. You and the gang arrived on the scene and saw the portal. Then Keito ran up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hey guys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Keito! What the heck is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I don't know, but I think that the human and the monster worlds have somehow become linked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I don't believe it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: How is this even possible?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I think I might know. My mother did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Wait a sec. What are you talking about (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you explained everything about you and Mizore seeing your mom using the sphere's power to link the two worlds together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Your mom linked the two worlds together?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I never heard of someone having that kind of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know. She didn't want the sphere to fall into the wrong hands again so....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: She decided to link the two worlds together in hopes that humans and monsters could learn to coexist with each other in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: No way....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Forgive me (name), but what your mother did was incredible and also insane. I understand your mother had good intentions, but now we have a problem. This the first time that monsters and humans have seen each other face to face and there might be one of two possibilities. Either both sides will panic and attack each other or they will try to make peace. Sadly, they will most likely attack each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Keito! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mizore.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped Mizore before she could protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Keito's right. There is a possibility that both sides will attack each other, but not if there's someone to try to prevent any attacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you bolted straight toward the portal. Mizore and the others tried to stop you, but you kept on running toward the portal pushing your way past the students.

You took a deep breath and spoke in a loud voice so everyone could hear you. When you spoke everyone stopped and looked at you and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairy tail Epic Theme: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Everyone! Listen to me! I know you're all scared and pretty much freaked out and I understand that, but you don't have to be afraid! As you're all well aware and in case you all didn't know; two worlds have become linked. One side the race of monsters and the other side the human race. Both sides have a long history with each other. A history of fearing each other and for not understanding the unknown. Out of pride and fear humans and monsters have hated each other over the years, from the witch trials to wars. The hatred grew and grew and eventually monsters were taught to never stay close to humans because of how they treat people who were different. The same can be said for us humans. I should know. I am a human. When I was little I lost my mother at a young age. She mysteriously disappeared without a trace. When I found out, the pain was so overwhelming that I didn't want to go through that pain again. I wanted to be alone because I wanted to never get hurt again. I never wanted to suffer from a broken bond ever again. Unfortunately that only made the void in my heart even worse. Because of that, I was transferred to different schools because I was constantly getting in fights and I never made any friends. Then I came here, Yokai Academy. A place for monsters and by monsters. When I got here I was expecting it to be just like the other schools I went to. And I was right. I was bullied because I was different and I was about to sink into the darkness even more and I thought that no one would understand my pain, but then......one person reached out to me. One person saved me from my darkness and brought me into the light. And it was someone I was taught to fear of. A monster. A monster stood up for me and called me her friend, even though she was raised to hate humans. That girl saved me, she saved me of who I was. We were both a human and a monster, two creatures from two different worlds, but we both connected and made a bond! Thanks to her, I've learned what it means to have a bond and to learn how to love. I've also made many more friends and they were humans and monsters alike. I even got to see my mother again. In fact, she is the reason these two worlds are connected right now! Because she believed that human's and monsters can make friends and live together in harmony! And I believe that too! I may be young and you all think that I'm probably just a kid that lost his mind, but I believe! I believe that the monster world and the human world can live together in peace! You all no longer have to be afraid of each other! You all no longer have to fight! Because we are one! We may come from two worlds, but we are one family! A family of not just monsters and humans, but a family of friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence. Then there was the sound of a few people clapping, then the clapping grew louder and louder and then both sides erupted in cheers. Tskune and the gang were cheering the loudest of them all by your speech and Mizore had tears of joy streaming down her face. She made her way out of the crowd  and ran toward you. Then she jumped into your arms and gave you a big hug and a big kiss. Then the Headmaster came out and spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: (name). I've heard your speech and I couldn't agree with you more. And so....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused impressively and he turned to the humans and monsters and spoke so they all could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmaster: Citizens of the human and monster worlds. Since the human and monster worlds have now become linked , I have decided that the ban on Yokai has know been lifted. Monsters and humans are welcome to attend this school and they can home and you all can visit each others worlds as much as you want. A new era of peace has begun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered! You and the gang watched this happy scene before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I'd never thought I'd live to see this day with my own two eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: I know. The monster world and the human world living in peace and harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! Now we don't have to hide our true selves any more! We can be ourselves whenever we want!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Yeah! And we can see our friends and lovers whenever we want! Right Moka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Yes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: And it was all thanks to you (name). Now we can be together in the monster world or the human world whenever we want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No. It wasn't just me. Everyone of us had a part of what we happened here today. Especially my mom. If it wasn't for her, none of this would be possible. Thank you everyone. For being my friends and always being here for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, someone was standing on the treetops watching from afar. It was your mother. She had seen everything that had transpired and she beamed with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom: Well done, my son. I'm so proud of you. You've grown up to be a fine young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that your mother disappeared into the forest, pleased knowing that she had made the right choice. As for you and the rest of your friends, you entered in a new era and peace and harmony was made as you all welcomed it looking forward to a bright future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years have passed since the two worlds have linked and the world couldn't be happier. Humans and monsters were now living together in peace and harmony. And Yokai Academy was now teaching both humans and monsters to coexist with each other. Things were looking good for you and the rest of the gang as well. Yukari was now a professor of Yokai. Since she was already ahead a couple grades, eventually she would graduate and she would become one of the best professors Yokai had ever seen or had. Keito continued to be the head of the security committee and she trained humans and monsters to help her protect the peace. To make things even better for her Keito adopted a human boy and a monster girl. Kurumu met a young human boy and she eventually bore him three kids. Two of them were girls and the last one was a boy. As for Moka and Tskune, they also got married. They had a bouncing baby girl that was just like Moka in every way. And finally, you and Mizore got together and had a handsome baby boy and named him Yukio. All of your kids would grow up and go to Yokai Academy and carried on your legacies. And from then on, all of you all lived happy lives together now and forever. </span></div></div>",

You have no wolf power, no help, and no one to stop me from making love to you.\", you could hear her but not see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you the ceiling was filled with plant vines and were encircling you. Before you could react they tangled you up. \"Ahhh they like you. hn again your a real catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you bring me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to save my life. I am the victim of a terrible curse, and when that sphere is ready I'll be free of it. Then you and me can finally liive normal lives, have a family, and be the happiest couple to have lived in the monster world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of curse are you a victim of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rather not say since I'll be rid of it soon. But hey enough with the exposition let's skip to the action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady I make it a habit of only dating the one woman who I loved since the start of high-school and your just  lady with condition who I met for a few short hours and your already hearing the wedding bells which is just crazy talk. Now leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long you'll be hearing those bells yet. Let me look at you.\", her eyes began to become alluring but you looked away in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't look the vines will make you.\", suddenly you were being crushed by them and the pain was very agonizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just what'll get you to open.\", she then grabbed your netheregion and in reaction to it you gasped in surprise and pleasure. Your eyes shot open from it and you fell victim to her gaze yet again. The vines stopped crushing you now and placed you on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still didn't feel different but you knew the second she gave you an order you'd follow it without question. \"Now (Name), you can finally get crazy with me.\", your body tensed and followed her command without hesitation. The two of you began to have sex.</span></div></div>",

She loved what she saw and so did you even with your thoughts not fully within reason. She then jumped on top of you and began to gently bite your ear lobe. As she did this, she also rode your dick up and down very slowly to tease you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were loving this so much, you decided to pleasure her at the same time. You began to kiss and lick her neck while you used your hands to twist her nipples gently. She was moaning with pleasure at first but then you stopped twisting her nipples and began to kiss her like there was not tomorrow, while you used your hands to groped Kirche's ass. Her moans became sexual as you both tantalized each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started rubbing your soft member until it grew, it got bigger and harder until it stood straight and tall. She then took your member and slipped it between her breasts. She moved her breasts up and down on your member making you grip the sheets. The pleasure was strong and it extremely made it more harder for you to keep your orgasm from bursting. Howevr you held it in and decided to be the master for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted your weight and positioned yourself between her legs. You readied your dick and pushed it in the opening between her legs. You made sure the aim was perfect and pushed forward but when you did Kirche's body tensed up and gritted her teeth. You run into something that blocked your way as you entered. You pushed a little harder and your dick slides into her with a single stroke. You looked at Kirche and you see that her eyes were shut tight and that she was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I being to rough on you?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..I'm only so happy that this is happening. Don't hold it back (Name)! We become one now!\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and then you began to move up and down. You felt the sensation of your body moving inside her, and it felt amazing! Her vagina rubbed the tip perfectly and had the perfect pressure. Every time you thrusted, a sharp sensation ran through your body, almost reminding you of your first time with Mizore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already pretty close to cumming, but you managed to suppress it longer. Kirche was gripping the sheets as the her own orgasm became harder to hold back, but she wanted it to last as long as she could hold it for. Her breasts bounced with every thrust you gave her making your only get more aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sexual moans got really loud like a parade was inside the room. After the last two minutes or so, Kirche moaned as loud as she could and knew she couldn't hold it much more so she wrapped her arms around your arms and said, \"I'm gonna explode! Make your last one good!\", saying that to you the numbing sensation began to build up inside you of holding the orgasm back for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave it into one big thrust you hit Kirche's sweet spot as far as a human could potentially reach. You both achieved your orgasms and found your selves panting from it all. Kirche and you floated in what looked like heaven for a moment. You felt like you were given the best sex in your life, but you would feel awful when Mizore found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed out from it feeling great, but Kirche didn't and felt like she accomplished her next goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I can't be pregnant after that. I now have had a child with the man I love, but even if he tries to stop me from using the sphere he now can't find it in his heart to harm me. Because his other child now rests in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche planned this to use as both leverage to keep herself from being harmed and because she was obsessed beyond a doubt with you and desired that moment for a long time. Kirche cleaned herself up and rejoined Fearsome and Saizo in their work on the sphere.</span></div></div>",

Kirche could tell it was a woman since her bust was hard to notice. (Cue the music!) Before she could act the woman ran for Mizore and you before Kirche could think to use her allure on her. The hooded woman threw a smoke bomb to distract Kirche enough to rescue you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed Mizore first but she managed to get you right after. She held Mizore on her back while dragging you by the arm with you running with her for no reason. You weren't given any orders so you were more or less a vegetable in your mind. Kirche was about to order you and Mizore to capture the hooded assailant but a huge ear piercing sound struck the cavern. It was a sonic weapon that the assailant hid near Kirche so at the least could be too loud for anyone to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the hooded woman got to the portal with the two of you and safely got away from Kirche. (Music ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche was enraged at this outcome and was furious that someone managed to sneak up on her like this when she was the most powerful succubus in the world. To have her mate taken like that disgusted her. \"Fearsome! I want you to have as many of your fear bombs ready to blow up yokai and japan in one fell swop! It seems that our test subject and my mate have ran off with another woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had them in place already in case we needed to have leverage over one of them mistress just give the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant Fearsome! All of you cease you actions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Keito and Deshiko stopped making out and Kurumu and Yukari got back from having dirty fun with each other. Tskune smothered himself in Moka's breasts assuming Yukari's place while he wasn't called on for anything yet, but stopped ounce Kirche gave the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you all will stay at yokai academy and ambush (Name) and Mizore. The hottest girls will take one (Name) and appeal to his manhood, while the boy and less attractive will hold down Mizore and also appeal to her womanhood. They will show up in the center of the grounds, there you will all hide and await my order. You will do this when I say the phrase \"gang bang\", understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kirche.\", everyone said all like they were in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now, Tskune have sex with Kurumu, Moka make out with Keito, and Deshiko and Yukari pleasure each other until I say we move out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone got right to it and enjoyed doing what Kirche said but she needed to wait until she fully figured out the rest of her plan to reclaim you.</span></div></div>",

As for you Kurumu smothered you with her breasts and Moka and Yukari managed to get your member out and they both began to lick it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) (moans) Hey! Stop that! You both shouldn't be.....mmfffff!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly cut off by a kiss from Kurumu. She kissed you by inserting her tongue and making you feel her breasts. You were trying to resist, but your resistance began to grow less and less. Mizore was going throught the same thing. Tskune pulled up her bra and her breasts were know completely exposed. Tskune began to suck on the nipple making Mizore scream with pleasure. While he was sucking her nipple, Tskune's hand slowly crept toward Mizore's womanhood and soon it connected. Mizore felt like a lightning bolt struck her body and she moaned like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) M-mizore.....(moan)......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Come on. Stop fighting it (name). Enjoy the pleasure and join us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: You too Mizore. Give in to the pleasure and join us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mizore continued to be pleasured resisting with all your strength, but you both couldn't resist much longer. Then....</span></div></div>",

No one sexually rapes my man and gets away with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you and the woman had a chance to stop her, Mizore raced away to exact her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Is she out of her mind!?!? She'll be killed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oy. In any case, you'd better go after her miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: But if I do that you'll have to face Fearsome on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry. I can handle him.

But be careful. Don't you die on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'll be fine miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: One more thing. You don't have to call me miss. I'd like it better if you call Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK...Mira. I'll see you soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: God luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira watched as you ran off to face Fearsome on your own. Then she turned around and raced off in pursuit of Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: (name).........Be careful.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you ran inside to school to find Fearsome. On the way, there were dozens of students who were under Kirche's control that blocked your way. They tried to subdue you, but thanks to your martial arts they were knocked out in ten seconds flat. Soon you came to a hallway and you sensed something was off. You walked down the hallway carefully, looking around to make sure you didn't fall into a trap. Suddenly a trap door opened beneath your feet and before you had a chance to react, you were sliding down a chute and then you fell flat on your face in a big room. Then an evil and sinister laugh echoed throughout the room and there stood Fearsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Welcome (name)! I'm glad you could make it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Spare me the pleasantries Fearsome! Stop this crazy plan of yours right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Stop it? Hahaha! Don't make me laugh! Why stop when I'm on the brink of completing my research?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Didn't that spider woman tell you? Well, you're a little boy who doesn't know anything about power so I shouldn't be surprised after all. I did work with your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the hell are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: I can't drill through the wood. Very well since you seem clueless about what I'm talking about allow me to show you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed a button on his remote and a machine appeared. At the center of it was the same ball of light that was inside you, but now it was black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wait a second! Isn't that......!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Yes. This was the same ball of light that was inside of you. You see not so very long ago me, Kirche, your mother, and Scythe Repar attended here in Yokai Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What?!? My mom went to Yokai?!? That's means she was a monster?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Obviously foolish boy. Anyway we all were a part of a research team of health development. We first became a team, because of Kirche's condition. When we found out we decided to find a cure. A way to cure her of her monster powers completely. No one wanted to help her more, but your mother. She and Kirche were the best of friends. In fact, she was the reason we came together. So we researched on a way to cure her, but all our attempts had failed. Kirche was completely miserable and because of her condition not many people wanted to be with her. Your mother on the other hand she had the easy life. Many people admired her for her research and her beauty. But she didn't want to love anyone. She thought that the research was the only thing that mattered. Then she left Yokai Academy for research. She was gone for many months. Then she came back and when she did we found an unexpected surprise. She was pregnant. Apparently she fell in love with a mortal and bore his child. And you can guess who that baby was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It was me wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Yes. When you were born Kirche fell in love. She thought that you were her mate or so she says. Ever since she saw you, you were all she could think about. You were like her own son. But then your mother noticed how Kirche was acting and it just wasn't right to her. So they both began to fight. To make matters even more complicated, we completed the sphere as planned to cure her, but there was an unexpected side effect. The sphere worked it's magic, but it gave too much power. Kirche's monster energy was indeed stabilized, but it amplified her powers tenfold. She began to use them too much and became power hungry. She wanted everyone to be her slave and the one she wanted most of all was you. A pathetic little boy. She made an attempt to take over Yokai Academy and the human world. But she was stopped by the Headmaster and your mother. To make it even worse your mother took away the light ball and was planning to seal it away. I argued with her telling her that sealing it away was a waste, but then you came along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: When you came into contact with the light ball, it bonded with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remembered your vision from before. The vision when you were a baby and when you touched the sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) So that's what the vision was about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Because of you bonding with the sphere, all our research went down the tubes and our group was disbanded. But Kirche and I made a vow. We vowed to get the sphere back and fulfill our wishes. And we had a tough time getting it too. Course with the serum and a few sacrifices. Okuto and that girlfriend of his were useful toys, but pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What?!? So you were the one that sent Okuto and that girl after me and had Saizo inject that serum in me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: Yes i did. It was all to get the sphere. You see the sphere attaches itself to people with pure hearts and when it becomes dark. It grants whoever holds power and control over their monster energy, but it also makes the sphere vulnerable to be extracted. In order to remove it from you, you had to be tainted. So I invented the fear gas and eventually made a serum that makes a person lose control of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) So your serum is the reason I've been going werewolf?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearsome: That I don't know and I could care less why. Because now that the sphere is in our possession once more. We'll be filled with unlimited power and take over this world and Kirche and I well be the rulers of Yokai and the human world! HAHAHAAHAHA!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Not gonna happen! I won't let you do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged at Fearsome ready to foil his evil plans, but a powerful kick flashed by your face. You narrowly dodge it, but a scrape appeared on your face. You looked up and you see......</span></div></div>",

You raced into the fray ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mizore! Mira!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: (name)! Get back! Kirche is too strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Just stay back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: (name)! I'm glad you decided to join us. Maybe I'll have some fun with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kirche charged straight at you. She gave you a sharp kick, but you dodged with ease. You threw a couple of punches back at her, but she dodged them with ease. She threw a powerful punch and you punched back. Both your fists collided sending a small shockwave. Kirche chuckled with and looked at you with admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Well, well. Looks like you have some skills. Not bad, but not good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw a punch at your face, and you dodged again. This time a thin scrape appeared on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Hehehe. Next time you'll get a lot more than just a scrape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Get away from him you cougar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore summoned a storm of icicles, but something went wrong. Her icicles were weak and they evaporated by Kirche's monster energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: What the....what's......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Oh no. Mizore's powers are getting weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Heh. Now you're gonna get it you little snow flake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to react, Kirche reappeared right in front of Mizore and gave a big punch in the gut, knocking the wind out of her. Mizore was sent flying and landed hard on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No! Mizore! Her ice powers are getting weak again! I got to help her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raced to help Mizore by attacking her from behind, but then Kirche appeared in front of you and gave you a powerful kick. Then she held you by your collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Time to have some more fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche was about to do more harm, when Mira attacked separating you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: I won't let you hurt him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: Heh! Do you honestly think that you can beat me? Even with the power of my sphere, my powers have reached their overwhelming peak?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kirche released a powerful monster energy wave knocking Mira back. Dust flew everywhere. Mizore and Mira couldn't see anything and neither could you. When the smoke cleared to tried to figure out where you were, but you couldn't. Then you looked down and screamed in surprise. You were up in the air in some kind of weird barrier arena with only you and Kirche trapped inside. Mira and Mizore saw this and were completely shocked. Mira jumped up and tried to force her way in,but the barrier stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: hehehe. Too bad Mira. This barrier is impenetrable! Not even you can break through it. Now the (name). I get to have you all to myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Screw you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to punch her, but she simply blocked by her hand. You both traded blows back and forth, but while you were trying to hit her, Kirche managed to strike you in the tug of war of blows. Then she gave you a sharp uppercut sending you flying. You landed hard on you back and a drop of blood dripped from your mouth. Mizore and Mira watched as you were trying to fight Kirche, but you were losing. Mizore struggled to get up, but the shocks from the punches Kirche only made her fall back down. Mira rushed to Mizore's side worried for her safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Mizore stop! You're pushing yourself too hard! You're gonna die if this keeps up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: No! I can't! -cough- (name) needs my help! Even without my powers (cough) I have to save him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Hey! I know you want to help, but the fact is there's nothing we can do! Neither of us has the power to break her barrier! We have to do something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were battered, bruised, and slightly bloody. To make matters worse, you couldn't last much longer. If Kirche landed one more hit, you were a dead man. Kirche on the other hand was loving this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: What's wrong (name)? You want to get sexy with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You wish you succubi reject! I'm ain't beat yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche: I love it when they talk tough! When I'm done making you my honey, that snow witch is gonna be nothing more, but a mere memory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Just you try it! I'm not scared of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in your mind, you were really scared. Kirche wasn't even breaking a sweat and was ready to hurt you. You had to come up with a way to win, but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen......</span></div></div>",

And I'll keep loving you even if it kills me!\", Mizore replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore kept swiping ferociously at the barrier seemingly doing nothing to it. Kirche watched in boredom and disregarded her. \"Such a wasted effort. You going to behave yet? Or we still paying rough?\", she said mocking your feeble attempts at fighting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go fuck yourself you th&amp;^%#$ *^%$.\", you backtalk got Kirche really pissed off. She slowly came to you and then hit you in the face knocking you down. She then grabbed your collar and started beating on you over and over, while Mizore watched. She then started slashing at the barrier even faster and soon enough it started to show signs of it breaking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche stopped beating you for swearing at her like than but your faces was bruised and you were bleeding all over your face. \"Now...are we going to stop this? And make up?\", Kirche asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..\", you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to have to use my charm on you because I want your love to be from you. But your starting to agitate me to my breaking point.\", she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have that child inside you, but it was never conceived in love..just out of desperation! You won't get that love from me...not now, when I'm being beaten within an inch of my life. I am staying true to Mizore and so help me, if either of us die to preserve our love for each other, than at least I'm dying for a cause worth dying for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words only got Mizore to slash harder and faster, but her nose began to bleed a lot of blood and she began to have trouble standing. Kirche realized that there was no point in having you submit willingly so she decided to just go for it. Kirche then broke both of your legs by kicking them in on themselves causing extreme pain. You fell on your back but then Kirche's cloths began to disappear leaving her bra and panties on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you won't love your mate, then you'll be forced in to being a sex puppet for me then!\", Kirche yelled. Kirche made out with you passionately while you tried to move your head away from her but you could barely do it at all and it was hopeless due to the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to hump you the pain was starting to be replaced by pleasure, but then as Mizore watched this disgusting display, She used the last of her strength to shatter the barrier causing you and Kirche to fall. Kirche fell down to the ground unharmed but you and Mizore fell into the roof of the school. She managed to grab you and take most of the fall but it cost her tremendously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche got up but was stopped by Mira who then shot hr with a tranquillizer to stop her from doing any more damage. With Kirche out of commision there was only Fearsome left to deal with. But thankfully everyone under Kirche's allure was free.</span></div></div>",

She was acting like she had seen it before, but this time was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-you don't have to stare at it you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: But.....it's huge!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to say something when you felt Keito's warm hands touch your member. You felt a twang of pleasure as Keito massaged your member with curiousity with every squeeze. She gently slid her hand up and down as if she was experimenting. Then she lightly pinched the tip of your member. When she did you yelped in a mixture of surprise and pleasure making Keito hastily move her hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I'm sorry! Did that hurt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No. It....felt good actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Should I....keep going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Um.....yeah. But.....could you....suck it this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Sure. Only......if you don't mind sucking mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she asked you this you smiled and gently began licking Keito's lower lips making Keito moan with pleasure. At first she was overwhelmed by you sucking her, but then she took your entire member into her mouth and began to suck your member. A salty fluid began secreting from inside Keito and you sucked gently, but hard. Keito let out a loud shrill scream and gripped the sheets. She was shivering like a leaf and she felt like she was going numb. She gripped your member and had a determined expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: This feels.....incredible.......but.....I'm not gonna be out done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she takes your member and took it in her mouth. This time she was sucking it as hard as she could and took it inside her mouth as far as she could. There were dirty noises coming from both your crotches, but both of you didn't care. You buried your face deeper in Keito's crotch and inserted your tongue inside her. Keito moaned again with your member still inside her mouth. The vibration from her voice provided extra stimulus for you and you sucked even harder. Keito's pussy began to secrete more fluid as well as you. Then Keito pulled away from your member and caught her breath. She spoke in a hot and husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name)! Please......I want you inside me.......I can't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made Keito lie down on the bed. You looked at Keito as if she you were asking her for her approval before you went on. Keito with dewy eyes and flushed face smiled and nodded. Then you took your member and pushed it inside her. Keito moaned loudly in pleasure and wrapped her arms around you as you thrusted inside of her. Keito moaned with every thrust and her breasts bounced wildly. You grabbed keito's right boob and began sucking her nipple. Keito's voice grew even louder and she wrapped her legs around you desperate to not let you go. As you pleasure between you and Keito intensified, you felt Keito's inner walls tighten and a powerful feeling began to manifest inside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: (name)! I feel so good!! I.....I.......I think I'm gonna.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes.....me too.......don't worry........just leave it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you thrusted in Keito as hard and fast as you again. Keito screamed even louder and she hugged you tighter. Her Inner walls squeezed your member like it was wringing the cum blood out of you. This went on for a minute or two until you and Keito couldn't take it. Keito gave one loud and final scream as she finally came. You gave a final groan as you pulled out of Keito and cummed all over her. You body went limp as you lied next to Keito. You looked at each and Keito smiled as happy tears streamed down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Thank you (name). You made me happy. This may have been only for today, butthis was amazing. Thank you. Thank you so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and gently placed your hand on Keito's face and wiped away her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Any time Keito. And in case I didn't tell you.......I love you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I love you too (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt your eyes getting drowsy and then you fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

But she looked as if she had the greatest time of her entire life and she felt incredible. She started to wake up looking you in the eyes with content. \"So...this is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&gt;Sigh&lt; You know that we can't keep it going like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But (Name), that night I'll treasure in my heart forever. And I'll never forget the love we shared. No matter what, I'll always be there for you and Mizore. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know....I'm sorry for any pain I may have caused you for doing this. Or that I chose Mizore over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of feeling sorry for me. We may not be lovers in body, but we are in spirit. Along with Mizore too. But for now...I have to leave you alone for a while, because I need to let go of how I feel toward you before I can bear the thought of seeing you again. But I'll always love you, (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I you, Keito. So this is goodbye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only as..............lovers......\", Keito cried a bit as you two kissed one last time ending your time as lovers. Her lips felt sweet and she kissed with soft, yet great passion. You returned the kiss without hesitation and held her close to you one last time knowing it would never happen again. You two broke this kiss as slowly as possible but at the same time. \"Goodbye....my beloved (Name)......I'll never EVER forget you.\", she said like she was saying farewell to a someone she would never see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes and looked at each other differently like your saw each other as a whole new person, leaving your deeply affectionate and personal feelings behind. Keito got dressed and walked out of the room not looking back. As much as she wanted to, she had to let you go until she was able to move on. IT broke her heart deep down, but inside she knew it was the right thing. Until she could bury her love for you while preserving the memory, she needed to be away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her leave your room and felt sad and guilty at the same time. You cried as she walked out and but held it together as best as you could. You laid back down and placed your arm over your eyes coping with it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later Mizore came to see you, at which time you had let your saddened emotions vent out and felt better to face your future wife. \"(Name)...are you alright?\", she asked knowing you were feelings a bit depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved her.....she was the greatest woman I have ever known and I let her go. It broke my heart...but I still can't stop loving you either.\", you confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you love her more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know anymore...but I do know what matters most. You and this baby were going to raise. And we'll do it as best we can as husband and wife, like you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have feelings for her Mizore, but I didn't bring a child into this world with you for nothing. That proves I love you more, I may not be as faithful as any boyfriend should be, but-\", Mizore put her finger over your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) you never cheated on me. I knew how much you both loved each other, that's why you two were alone last night. Because I gave that chance to you both. It sounds crazy beyond all reason, but between us, it doesn't mean anything to me and I don't care as long as you promise me you won't from here on out, be with another woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear on my life, and my mothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now we can start our lives from here on out. I love you (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love you too with all of my being, my darling snowflake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't out do my feelings of love for you! It makes me look bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you think your better than me at expressing my feelings about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I love you so much my heart would stop beating if your leg was broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much, that I would take over the world if it made you the slightest bit interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much, I would kill every female of any species leaving me as the sole surviving female of this planet just to make sure you look only at me to fill your sexual fantasies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you got me on that one.\", you both laughed and hugged each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marriage? For real?\", Mizore asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As real as this kiss will be.\", Mizore giggled and pulled you in as you made your way toward her lips. You kissed as the sun set over you two and finally faced the end of your hardships.</span></div></div>",

You catered to her needs, some rather odd, but you supported and helped her with the coming event that would soon change your lives. You were about to be visited by the others but then you heard Mizore calling, \"(Name) can you help me down the stairs?\", she called out nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you darling. How's the baby?\", you asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. You keep asking me every time we talk to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to be sure. I've never been through this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we could go through it again maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just wait till this one comes out.\", you said kneeling down and kissing Mizore's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, that's so cute.

She was able to walk towards on the couch by herself just fine and awaited to see her friends again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw that Tskune, Moka, Kurumu, and surprisingly Keito had come to visit. \"Nice to see you again (Name).\", Keito said hugging you. She seemed to be rather fine despite the bitter sweet way you parted ways the last few months, but she seemed to have moved passed it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good to see all of you again. Moka how have you and Tskune been?\", you greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been planning our wedding for a while now but we'll have it where only our members of our family will attend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's...nice. But why not us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? You, Mizore, and everybody else from school are family.\", Moka corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune was talking to Mizore about how she was holding up, \"So has it been harder to deal with the past few days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, but I do need someone to help me get across the stairs and even with some other stuff. But (Name) is always here for me. He's so responsible and protective that It's kinda annoying at times. Not for me but for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when do you suppose you'll...you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think about maybe a couple weeks. But who's to say that the kid won't come out now? Say Kurumu how are thongs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I've noticed that this one human who's about 18 years old. I was minding my business when we hit it off without him even knowing I was a monster. He's an energy-holic with others but I noticed he acts differently when were near each other. I think maybe he might be the one for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds romantic to me.\", Mizore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've actually been seeing someone too.\", Keito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never told us.

Some were Kurumu and Yukari fighting over something stupid. Some were of Keito, you and Mizore. Lastly to top it off, you had Keito take a picture of you kissing Mizore's belly. At first you were a little embarrassed, but everyone else thought it was cute. Especially Tsurara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsurara: Awww. You two look soooo cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Knock it off please.

Let's see who can come up with a name of (name) and Mizore's baby and make it a game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Let's see.....how about Miya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: No way. That's too plain.

Can't I just think of a name when it's born?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile every girl was trying to think of a name. You stepped outside to be somewhere quiet.

It's just that.....I can't believe this is all real. I mean..... I'm married and I'm gonna have a daughter. Sometimes I think it's all one big dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: But it's not. It is real. Are you getting the jitters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Kinda. I was just thinking. I've been though one hell of a ride. I lost my mom and I didn't make much friends. And I thought that i was going to be alone forever. I used to shut everyone out because I never wanted to be hurt like that again. That only made things worse. But then one girl changed all that. Mizore. She was always there and changed my outlook on life. Hell I even got to see my mother again. I really owe my life to Mizore. and you as well Tskune. No scratch that. I owe all of you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hey. You're welcome. But you did all the work by opening your heart. You're surrounded by friends and loved ones. Just know we'll always be there for you because we're your friends as well as your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. I do have one regret that happened to me though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune:What's that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I wish....I didn't have to let my mom go. I wish I could see her again. In fact.............I wonder if she's watching me and I wonder if.......I made her proud?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune put his hand on your shoulder and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Don't worry about that.

Get her in the car I'll drive!\", you said to Keito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got into the car and started it and drove as fast as possible ignoring any and all traffic laws in order to get to the hospitable. You helped walk her inside the emergency room and talked to the nurses saying she is in labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctors got huddled around her and prepared to help deliver the baby. You walked in with them since you were the baby's father, they gave you doctor scrubs and you helped keep Mizore calm. You held her hand but she squeezed it tightly and she was freezing your hand solid. \"It's ok Mizore, your going to be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\", she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I need you to push now!\", said one of the doctors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that last scream the doctors managed to take the baby out. But tragedy struck...it wasn't moving. You saw it and was heartbroken at the sight of seeing your own child die during the birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it coughed and cried after a moment. You and Mizore both took a sigh of relief seeing your child be born healthy and living. It's hair was white as snow and it's skin was palish. The doctors gave the baby to Mizore and she was crying both from the pain and the joy. \"Congratulations ma'am it's a boy.\", said the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so beautiful...he's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done. He looks just like you darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to be a little heart breaker when he's older.

I wish your mother was here for this.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter Mizore, I love you with all my heart and we now have the perfect child. They don't make them any better than him. I can feel it in my bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too (Name), if I could go back in time before we met, my life would feel so empty without you. You complete me, and our child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to name the boy then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was hoping to go with Nora since I was hoping it to be a girl, but I heard Keito give a decent boys name. Zuko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it, it's unique like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the others started coming in. \"Oh...Mizore he's just beautiful.\", he mother said crying.

Our little Zuko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That name would be better fit if he inherited fire powers.\", Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu slapped her upside the head saying, \"That a great name, it's unique and dramatic. Something that his parents share. I love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we.\", Tskune replied holding Moka by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keito, Tskune we thought about it for a while and decided you both to be the baby's god parents.\", Mizore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..wouldn't it be better if Moka was the god mother? I'm...not sure-\", Keito reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know you would guard this baby with your life if you a to. You were our ideal choice.'', Mizore replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you both so much.\", Keito cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune thanked you and Mizore too for letting him be the godfather. It was a long day but soon you and Mizore were alone with Zuko, with Mizore and the baby sleeping in bed. You watched as they drifted to sleep and felt unbelievably happy. You thought earlier if this was a dream but it was reality no mistake about it. You petted Mizore on her head stroking her softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Mizore, and I can't thank you enough for changing my life for the better.\", you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to anyone, your mother was actually the doctor who delivered your son and watched over you three in the hospitable room through the night. She cried seeing your life change and seeing her grandson for the first time. It was the best day of your life, and you didn't even know how perfect it was.</span></div></div>",

And Tskune and Keito had grown very fond of him too. Keito taught him how to read, count, and many other things. Mizore and Tskune taught how to use his ice powers, and eventually he learned how to control his powers, but only to a certain degree. He can do simple things like freezing objects and firing little icicles, but couldn't really make them as strong as his mother's. That didn't matter to Zuko. All he cared about was being with his family. You all lived together peacefully in a town in the human world next to a park. One day Zuko was playing a game of catch with you in the park. You two were throwing a ball back and forth testing each other to see how hard you could throw it. Meanwhile Mizore and Keito were doing laundry and hanging clothes on the clothes line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Wow. He's grown so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yes. Our little Zuko has grown to a fine young man. And my (name) has grown to be a fine father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Yes. You're lucky to have a husband like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: It's not just me. You and Tskune and all the others have been a big influence on Zuko. I knew making Me and (name) have made the right choice by making you two Zuko's godparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hahaha Cut it out Mizore, you're making me blush. Speaking of Tskune how is he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: He's gone to spend time with Moka. Other than that he's doing fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: I figured so. I can't believe it's been ten years already. To think that (name) was once all alone and he and I were enemies. Now we're living together and he's a loving father with a loving family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah. If only his mother can see him now. She'd be so proud of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Call me crazy, but I think she already is wherever she may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore smiled and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Hahaha. You may be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with you and Zuko's game of catch....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): (whew) Not bad son. You sure can catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: OK! Try this one daddy! This my super duper pitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was trouble. Zuko threw the ball to hard and it went past you and disappeared behind the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Holy cow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: Whoops. Sorry dad. I guess I threw it too hard. I'll get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now hold on son.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything Zuko disappeared behind the bushes in pursuit of the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oy vey. Mizore! Keito! We'll be back! We lost the ball and Zuko went after it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: K. Just don't go too far!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: And be careful! Watch out for Zuko!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you followed behind the bush to follow Zuko. Meanwhile as for Zuko he was searching for the ball he lost. The bushes grew thicker and Zuko was getting more and more lost. Soon he had no idea where he was and he was getting scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: Daddy? Where are you? Daddy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly no one answered. Zuko was now getting scared. Then he heard something. A pleasant sound like a flute drifted through the trees. Zuko followed the sound curious as to what the sound was. Soon he found a young woman sitting on a log playing the song. The song was so inviting and relaxing Zuko couldn't help, but listen. The woman saw Zuko coming towards her and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon Lugia's song flute cover. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTzGoZEgbMk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTzGoZEg...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Well hello there child. Are you lost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: Yes. I was looking for my ball and I got lost. Oh who are you? I'm Zuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: I'm Mira. I see you've taken a liking to my song.  Would you like to hear more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: Oh most certainly ma'am. I mean Ms. Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes the woman played a couple songs for Zuko. Zuko loved hearing the woman play. It made him feel so relaxed that he completely forgot that he was looking the ball and had to get back to you. Then he heard you calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Zuko! Zuko where are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: That's my daddy! I forgot that he's looking for me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: You better get going then. Oh yeah, you'll probably be wanting this. (pulls out ball)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): My ball! How'd you find it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: I found it while I was walking. Oh by the way, give your father and your mother this message for me OK dear little Zuko?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: Sure. What is it Ms Mira?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Tell him his mom always loves him. And take this to him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Zuko a little music box. Zuko looked at the box confused and then when he looked back up, Mira was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: Huh? Ms. Mira? Where'd you go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you pop out from the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Zuko there you are! I was looking for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: Daddy! I gotta show you something! I gotta show you something to mom as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really? Well then, we better get out of this forest then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuko: Yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Zuko left, the woman watched from afar and she smiled happily. And with that she disappeared into the forest playing the flute as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then.....</span></div></div>",

You recognized it as your mothers lullaby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zuko...where did you get that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms.Mira gave it to me. She said, your mom always loves you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to cry but Mizore placed her hand on your cheek to calm you down. \"Honey, you o.k.? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Yeah I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked away from them to let out your tears privatley. You remebered her from your childhood, how happy she made you, how she made you laugh,  and how she made you feel good. It reminded you of the pain you went through in  the past. But then Mizore replaced your thoughts. Your moms love never left, but took form of new love. Zuko and Mizore more than filled the gap she left behind and you knew somewhere she was watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore came behind and picked you off the ground. \"You ok now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than I have been in the last 10 years. Mizore I want you to know that when I first realized you would be there for me, I knew no matter what...I couldn't let you go. And more than one occasion I gave you a reason to leave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I never did. Because I knew who you really were. You messed up but so what?  Nobody is perfect.  And I may be more forgiving than most other women. But you deserve it, trust me. Look what we have done together.  We have a son that's so beautiful,  and stopped a pshycho group of monsters from ruling the world. You, are my hero (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much Mizore. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Zuko grew up and surpassed Mizore's powers and would later marry Kurumu's daughter.  Moka and Tskune had four kids, all female,  and would start to join the student safety commision as the new leaders which would grow to become a special task force to prevent world threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito would go on to live a happy life as a single mom with her adopted son. Lastly you and Mizore had one more kid before Zuko began highschool and would have another son named Wayne. You two lived happy lives from then afterwards and loved eachother till the very end.</span></div></div>",

She knew you would only do it if it was for a good reason but she seemed more sucpicious than serious about it for the moment. However she thought for only a moment that maybe you were thinking of going out with Keito but she instantly kicked that idea out of her head realizing you and her have been through far too much for you to just cheat on her. Even if you were going out with Keito she knew you'd tell her directly instead of trying to have Keito and herself.

Ya know, you are a real friend and seriously. That guy you are searching for will find you. And maybe your thoughts on the lovey dovey stuff won't bother you as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shut it. And thanks you cutie. But hey your last chance to be my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but Mizore and I share something that I can't deny. But were cool right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you cute guy. Were cool, but let me give you just one little thing just for the hell of it because this is my last chance I will get to do this.\", she pulled you in and quickly kissed your cheek hard deliberatly missing your lips. \"Good luck with Mizore, she's the sensative one.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka and Tskune came by thnaking you for freeing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey in the end what are friends for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a terrific friend (Name). And we'll have your back when you need it.\", Tskune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks you guys I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly Mizore came by starring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sir are one hell of a guy. You took on the headmaster, beat the crap out of another monster student, and you took on a whole army of lamia. You are the most interesting guy I have ever met. So...think you can handle a single date with me? Tonight at my place?\", she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this point I'd obviously say yes. Point me in the direction you give and I'll follow it till my feet bleed.\", you replied saying yes in an over the top manner. You two hugged tightly and couldn't wait for the date. After all this insanity you deserved some down-time.</span></div></div>",

You were pulled into this party by Mizore since it was something she wanted to do for some sort of occasion regarding the students. Something about their write of passage? But you didn't care as long as you were with her along for the party, but she wasn't around yet for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you got pulled to the dance floor by three lovely young ladies. Each had their turn before Tskune rescues you by distracting them with some orderbs. You dove into a nearby elevator but when you reached your floor, you see none other than Mizore at a safe, taking a large diamond. She then pined you to the wall while she finishes robbing the safe, and made her escape. You break free, and headed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found her leaping the Japanese rooftops like this was all fun and games. You caught up to her but she dove several dozen stories below into traffic, breaking her fall with a banner and swinging onto a tour bus. She poses for some pictures until you made it on the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped on a gas truck tanker but Mizore randomly freezes the tanker and breaks it apart separating you from the truck. The truck spins off, but you manage to get after her by jumping on the back of the truck with her laughing. Thankfully the tanker didn't explode or cause much damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as Mizore jumped off the truck she landed on a train, where, while going into a tunnel, you lose her, only to see her trail leading into a cosplay convention. Expectedly, she had detoured through the anime groups and tries to hide from you in plains sight. She escapes through the back of the convention while she tries to run away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally corner her against the gates of the of the building holding the convention. She notices your aggravation and leans to kiss you. You push her away at first wondering why she did all of this and she appears hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut seeing her drop the diamond for the authorities to reclaim she said that it was just a game to make herself feel alive. You then sweeps her into his arms and kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops arrive, and Mizore looks around, concerned. But you carry her off leaving the diamond letting this off the hook. You look through the window at the party, watching the cop cars fly past. Then, Mizore in her party dress leans in and asks if it was fun for you as it was for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply smile at her and hug her nodding. While the entire thing was entirely stupid and wreck less it was just a bit of teenage nature. Just something they did without any normal reason but had to do it for themselves. She swore never to do that thing again seeing how it drew too much attention but felt that it was worth it.</span></div></div>",

I'm the luckiest guy in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it to get to your door. It was about 9 pm when you got to your room. Then you noticed something. There was a package in front of your door. At first you were surprised at this, because you hardly received packages. You picked up the box and brought it inside with you. There was a note on top of the box and opened it and it said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtect your friends, your loved ones, and use it well. Show them the tiger beast spirit unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Tiger beast spirit unleashed? What does that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you opened the box inside and inside was a watch.

Might as well try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you put on the watch. You admired yourself in the mirror and thought you looked pretty cool. Then the watch began to glow. A jolt of electricity ran through your body. Then you began to see mirages of tigers. You screamed with pain from the shock, and then you fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you woke up and you see the watch on your hand. You remember what you experienced and tried to get the watch off, but it didn't come off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey! What the heck!?! Why can't get this stupid thing off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it flashed the time and it said 8:30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) GAH!!! I'm gonna be late for class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurriedly got dressed and raced to class. Luckily you made it to school on time. As you went through your classes you thought about the watch and what the letter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I wonder who sent it to me? and I wonder why I can't get it off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see a fly. As it was buzzing around you compelled to catch it. You resisted, but eventually you couldn't resist anymore! You slashed at the fly trying to catch it, but then you notice that everyone was staring at you. You stared back and then you ran off. You went by yourself and processed what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK! What the hell is going on? Why did I act like that? What am I a cat?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen someone came up to you.

She wanted to go there right after all of your classes ended and considered maybe spending the night there in case something might happen. It was 3 p.m. and you saw Mizore with some supplies like you were going camping. It was unorthodox but who cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you traveled to the forest you wondered what exactly you would find or what may happen there? She did say it brings love to others, so you had to consider a lot of extreme scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much farther?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were close. See these plants? They glow and seem alive. They guide people to that spot.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are these plants glowing a all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read that it was presumed to be a spell casted by witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet nobody exactly knows and people still come out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are harmless. Trust me. Besides I can freeze them in seconds.\", she encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you followed the plants to a whole garden filled with glowing plants. And soon enough you reached the lovers spot. It almost looked like a huge flower looking at the shape. And the surface was super soft. But then suddenly you smelled something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&gt;Sniff&lt; mmm yeah. It smells...gooooood.\", Mizore replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your surroundings seemed to be brighter and colorful. And you had a very huge urge welling up inside you. You starred at Mizore with lust in your eyes and she seemed to return that look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizore I can't keep my feelings for you held back any more...\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither can I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...must have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each other!\", Mizore and you both said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lunged for each other and were digging into each others mouths. You two were in a very aggressively passionate kiss and embrace. You two were being so mad with obsessive love that it may not be long before you two have sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat caused this random turn of events was that that flower you two were in WAS a giant flower and whoever goes in becomes driven to lust. But this was no ordinary trap set by nature, it was set up by a monster the academy has never encountered...an Alurane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monster who commands plant life. She closes the flower while producing highly reactive pheromones and lets any couple submit to their most impulsive desires. She watched as you and Mizore made out and noticed you begining to move hips forward and back a little. Meaning it won't be long now before you and Mizore have your first time.</span></div></div>",

She was right about one thing. You may be good at fighting, but you were just human. For the first time in your life you cared about someone more than anything else in the world. You screamed at yourself \"what to do,\" but you couldn't think of anything. Then you heard a voice in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Use the watch. Protect your loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Who's there? Who's talking to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: Use the watch to save your friend. It can give you the power to save your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) How? I don't even know to activate the damn thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlraune: HAHAHA!! You've gone so insane with fear you can't even think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe manipulated a plant and it constricted you so you couldn't move. It squeezed you tightly making you scream in pain. You look at Mizore and see the Alraune about to devour Mizore. You struggled to get free, but you couldn't get free. Then you remember what the letter said. \"Protect your loved ones. Show them the tiger beast spirit unleahsed.\" You realize that this was probably the key to activting your watch.<br>\r\nYou screamed and the tiger roaring mirage appeared on your face and you broke free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK! I had enough of you monster! I will protect Mizore no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlraune: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then pressed a button on the watch and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) TIGER BEAST SPIRIT UNLEASHED!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(background) A tiger emerges from your watch and roars. Then it shrinks and overlaps your body transforming into a red suit. Then a tiger head looks like it will bite you, but becomes your helmet. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...\" target=\"_blank\">http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130...</a>!Prjf-red.png)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlraune: What the hell!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Whoa! I.....transformed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlraune: Heh change all you want, but you will still die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used her plants to try and catch you, but you took a great jump thanks to your tiger reflexes. Then she launched seed bombs, but you slashed them using your claws. Whatever she did you countered with your poweres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlraune: Impossible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Whoa! These powers rock! Now then to get Mizore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged past her and climbed up a wall using your claws. Then you jump off it and slashed at Mizore's prison and set her free. After that you landed on<br>\r\nthe ground with ease. You set Mizore down and you turned to the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK you, Now it's your turn to be scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlraune: Damn you die!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe charged at your teeth and claws extended, but you were ready. You crossed your arms into a x and made a ball of energy and then took a deep breath and released it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) TIGER FURY BLAST!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast hit the Alraune sending her flying and knocking her out. You then went back to check on Mizore. She was fine, but she still was unconscious. You picked her up princess style and took her back to Yokai Academy. A few minutes later Mizore opened her eyes and looked around. She was in the infirmery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Where am I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you stepped out in the shadows like any awesome hero would still in your Tiger suit, but Mizore didn't know this yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I carried you here. You and your friend were under attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Yeah! Where's (name) is he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Don't worry he's safe. I took him home. I must go now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to leave when Mizore stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore: Wait.....Who are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused trying to come up with a name. Then you turned around and said.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I am TIgerman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you leapt out of the window and into the darkness. You made it back to your room in a flash. Then you turned back to normal. At first you stood there bewildered. Then you looked at the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Wow. I'm like a full time superhero! I better keep it a secret from Mizore otherwise she'll freak. The last thing I need is another reason for my rep to go down. (yawn) In any case I better get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you fell on the bed and went to sleep dreaming about your new identity and your new powers. The very next day you were tired. You walked to class sleepily to your chair, but when you got to the classroom someone was waiting for you. It was.....</span></div></div>",

She told me that you were rescued by some guy named Tigerman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: It's all over the school! Everyone is calling the guy the jungle fury red ranger like the one on TV! Everyone heard noises over at the island and then a witness saw a guy in some kind of red suit carrying Mizore to the nurse's office. He jumped from building to building like a superhero like the shows we watched as kids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh really? eh heh I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered you had to keep your identity a secret. Even if it was just Tskune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: I hate to admit that is cool, but there's one thing I have a problem with that guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Why is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: The name is just plain lame. I mean come on. Tigerman? Please He looks like a power ranger. Why not just call him a power ranger? If I was him I'd call myself that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard Tskune said this you were a little offended. You blurt your mouth before you could stop yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) HEY! It was the spur of the moment OK? It's not my fault I'm bad with names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Um....what are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had a hammer you'd smack yourself on the headfor what you just did. You just practically told Tskune your identity. (Baka!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Um nothing I'm talking about nothing! eheheheh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Wait a sec. Do you know who this power ranger guy is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Um uh no! Nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune gave the \"are you sure you're not lying look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: You're hiding something aren't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Um uh.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think of something and fast. If Tskune found out who you really were who knows what would happen. You had to get him off your back somehow. Then you had an idea. It was the oldest prank in the book, but you had to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Hey look! Moka's wearing a skimpy swimsuit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you didn't think it would work, but to your surprise it worked. Tskune looked behind like a moron and fell for it hook line and sinker. and he wasn't the only one; all the boys heard you and automatically turned around drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTskune: Where? where?!? I wanna see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(boy) Moka! In a swimsuit! I gotta see this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(boy 2) I'll add it to my collection of photos I got of Moka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(boy 3) Where is she? Where is she? I wanna see that smoking hot babe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone was going crazy looking for Moka, you took that opportunity and dashed away from the commotion as fast as you can. You ran until you were by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Phew. That was close. I can't believe Tskune fell for that. I mean that was the most dumbest trick in the book. In any case I'm glad I managed to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you thought about what Tskune said about your name being the red ranger instead of Tigerman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hmm Tskune might be right about one thing. Tigerman is a pretty plain name. It was the spur of the moment. How was I supposed to know that Tigerman was gonna be lame? Although the jungle fury red ranger does sound a little more cool. I mean I grew up watching that stuff, but I never thought I'd be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your watch and then you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK! From now on I'll be known as the jungle fury red ranger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) what are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Eeep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and the person standing there is.....</span></div></div>",

I'll go tell Moka and the others to publish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Tskune ran off back to the clubhouse. You were left alone, but you didn't mind. You needed some alone time to think about what happened to you back there. You remembered how blood thirsty you were for the meat. The thought of it made your mouth water. You realize you were thinking of meat again and slapped your cheeks and tried to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the hell is wrong with me? Why am I getting these cravings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look at your hands. When you saw them you gasped. Your hand nails were longer and they looked like claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the frick!?!? My hands!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to panic, but then you calmed down by taking deep breaths, Then when you looked at your hands again they were normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Whew. That was weird. I wonder what caused that? (looking at watch) Am I losing control of my powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back to your room thinking about what transpired today. You felt exhausted and tired. You figured you should get some sleep because not only did you need rest, but you also had a date with Mizore tomorrow. You lied on your bed thinking about what happened to you so far. Then you look at your watch and clenched your fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I have to keep from using my powers when I'm with Mizore. Especially since there's a possibility I might be losing control of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you went to sleep. Then.....</span></div></div>",

You got there a few minutes early just be punctual. You were wearing a pair of blue pants and a t-shirt that had a bat logo on it. You hummed a little tune as you waited.

You packed some supplies for the trip and wanted to have a romantic picnic while there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough you made it and the island was quite huge. You noticed an abandoned castle and the forest surrounding it was spacious. Mizore enjoyed the unique venue you chose and it seemed to please her very well. You set up the picnic and had it where the sunset-ed in front of the both of you. You had your arm around her cuddling with her and nudging your head next to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha stop it your making this too sweet.\", Mizore said in response to your head nudging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I know you like it. It's nothing like me sayyyy this!\", you started to tickle her and she busted out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooohaaahoooo stoooop! Hahahaha pleeeeeeaaaaassssss!

First off what do you want and why did you kidnap me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(beast) I merely came to talk to you. First off my name is Tygrus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Um...nice to meet you? my name is (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: (name) You wish to know why I took you correct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: I noticed that you were giving off a scent. A scent I found to be familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Familiar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: Yes. Someone.......I once knew. You smell of a tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) A tiger? What are you talking about? I'm........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you had another vision. You were in the suit again you were climbing up walls, landing on your feet, and fighting opponents. You shake your head to try to get it out of your head. You felt weak and were about to faint, but Tygrus caught you. Then he saw your watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: That watch. Where did you get that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Um I got it in the mail? Wait do you send this to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: No, but I made it. It's a prototype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Then what is this thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: It's something I invented. My father taught me everything I knew. You see my father made me the way I am because I believed him. Now I'm stuck like this. I made that watch to transform me back to my human self, but it did the opposite. It gives a human the powers of the tiger. Speed, Strength, and a giant roar like one. I made it as a request for a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) A request? From whom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: That I do not know. The name remained unknown for the person didn't reveal his or her name. All I knew was that the person wanted me to make it to protect a loved one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I see. So....uh....how do I work this thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: It should be obvious. There was a note that came with it. It told you how to work it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You mean that spirit unleashed thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: Yes that is the voice activation code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a scream. Then you remembered Mizore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Dah! I forgot about Mizore! I gotta find her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: Go! Hurry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran out of the cave and then you turned back expecting for Tygrus to follow, but then he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the.... Where did he go? Tygrus? Tygrus?!? I've got no time to think! I got to save Mizore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you raced off, in te shadows Tygrus was watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTygrus: Good luck kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to the sound of Mizore's voice through the forest.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day at school everything was quiet. As you walked by everyone that saw either looked at you and looked away. Obviously they all must've heard what you did to Saizo. They either ran away in fear or they pretended not to see you. Even Mizore kept her distance away. To you that didn't matter. As long as you were alone and you weren't gonna get hurt you'd be fine. But for some reason you felt that your stomach was in a knot. As you walked into the classroom everyone either looked away or pretended not to see you. You sat in your seat in class and looked out the window. You began thinking about what you did to Saizo and what Mizore said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Monster huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your hand and stared at it. You remembered back when you were a kid when your mom disappeared. It was hard. You were always alone and you wanted to be alone. Everyone treated you like you were an outcast. After school whenever you left you saw all the kids with their moms. You envied them so much and you missed your mom so much. You also remember when you were little you got into a fight because a kid was picking on you and he said something about your mother that made you mad. Then you got in trouble by the teacher and she called your dad. You expected your dad to be dad, but he wasn't just disappointed. He simply gave you a hug and said.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad: Listen son. i know your angry and sad about not having a mom, but you can't just go and do that to people. Hate and loneliness is like a plaque. It spreads more and more until it completely destroys. Besides your mother wouldn't want you to do this would she? I know you feel alone, but being alone and taking your hatred out on others is not what you should do. Your mother would have wanted you to apologize and move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hit you hard like a sack of bricks and hearing your father say that made you cry so hard. Your father held his embrace and stroked your hair and soothed your pain. Remembering that made you feel even worse. Now you felt guilty. You had to apologize to Saizo. Even though he was a bully you owed it to him to say sorry. After class you decided to find Saizo and apologize to him. You looked all around, but you couldn't find him. Unfortunately you found someone else. Keito. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Hello again. Good to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It's you again. Look I already said I'm not a people person so.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeito: Now now. I just came to deliver a message. It would be wise for you to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you a note and with that she left. You opened the letter you gasped. The letter said that Saizo had Mizore, and it said if you didn't show up at the bus stop he'd kill her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) No. This is my fault. If I hadn't have gone and been an ass none of this wouldn't be happening. I have to stop this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to the bus stop. As you were running you ran right past Tskune and Moka. At first they wanted to ask you why you did what you did to Saizo, but you didn't have time to chat. You raced past them and headed to the bus stop. Through the forest you looked for the bus stop. What you didn't realize was that Mizore was stalking you. She was a bit mad at you still for what you did, but she was curious as to why you were frantic. Then you saw the bus stop when you ran to it you looked to Saizo and Mizore. They were no where to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Saizo! Where are you!?! I've come to make peace!I'm sorry for what I did! I know you want to get revenge on me and that's fine you can do whatever you want with me, just don't hurt Mizore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo jumped and landed behind you which made you jump. He was in his orc form and he was pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Well well well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Saizo listen. I'm sorry what did. Just don't hurt Mizore please! Where is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You fool! I lied! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: I knew that snow witch meant something to you so I figured I'd lie just to lure you out. So I could do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit you with a big punch knocking you into a tree. You struggled to get up, and managed to get on your feet, but Saizo was coming at you with another kick, but you didn't try to dodge it. The kick sent you flying into another tree.

(cough) Maybe I really am a monster, but at least I'm trying to apologize and take the punishment. Beat me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You little shit!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then punched you in the gut making you cough blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: I'm gonna kill you! and have fun doing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept punching you like hell making you scream in pain and agony. This kept going for 15 minutes. You were bloody and tattered. Your shirt was ripped off and you were covered in scratches. Saizo was enjoying this every minute. He then grabbed you by the head and held you over the cliff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Let's see how you like it when you get dropped from the cliff. But before I do I want to hear you scream. Beg for mercy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were half concious and your vision was blurry. Then a tear streamed down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: Huh. You thinking crying is gonna save you think again. You're a loner and no one's gonna save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Do what you want. I don't deserve to live for what I've done. If I'm going to die so be it. All I wanted was to be alone so I could be spared of the pain of losing my mom. That's why I don't have any friends. I wouldn't be surprised if anyone would want me around. It would be best for everyone. At least that way I'll get to be with my mom and my suffering would end. So go ahead kill me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaizo: You little shit! Say goodbye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to drop you when....... =</span></div></div>",

You lived with your loving mom and your loving dad and you went to school and got good grades and were a pretty smart kid. In fact, you were so smart, you got honor roll and made the top twenty highest grades. On average you were placed in fifteenth place. You also took karate lessons so you could show that you may be a geek, but you got some fighting skills. You loved challenging yourself whether it was fighting, tests. and learning about many different things, but there was one thing that you loved learning about more than anything else in the world. Witches. You first learned about witches when you were in eighth grade and ever since then, you wanted to know more about them. You even believed that witches existed and more than anything else in the world, you wanted to meet one. Little did you know that you would be getting your wish and getting a little something more. It all started when you graduated from your eighth grade class and you just got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey mom! I'm home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: There's my little graduate! (kisses you on cheek)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aww mom. Easy with the kisses. I'm a full grown man now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad: Now son, you may have passed eighth grade, but you're still a baby in our eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): yeah, yeah, I know dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: So son, have you decided where you're going to go for your freshman year?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well.....not really mom. Nothing comes to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad: Hm, hm, hm. Typical. You never plan for anything do you son? Are witches the only thing you think about nowandays? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Shut up dad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad: Luckily, I just so happen to have just the perfect school for you. A school that shares the same wacky interests as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad then handed you a yellow envelope that had a packet of information on a school called Yokai Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hm. Looks interesting and it's a private school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: And you don't have to take an exam to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) And dad didn't you say there were people that shared the same interests as I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad: Yes indeedy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really? Sounds like a plan. I'll do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so a few days later, you were on your way to Yokai as an exchange student. It was a long bus ride (and with a creepy driver), but you managed to make it to Yokai. When you got there you were amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. This place is huge! A lot more classy than the typical private school. I wonder if I'll make any friends here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked around you passed by a couple of students who were talking about monsters forms and other supernatural stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): All right. Dad wasn't kidding. This is gonna be my kind of school. Making friends here should be a breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

You found a note written for you. \"Your room is prepped and ready. Located on the left side of the room. P.s. don't go in my room. \", it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou basically took your stuff and walked in your room. It was a little spacious but comfortable. You set everything up for your stay and relaxed in the living room. You more less dozed off while waiting for Yukari and took a nap while waiting.

You blushed with her being so close to you but enjoyed the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moved around while trying to get up Yukari took a deep breath and woke up herself.

I was doing something outside of school all the time that I never really had a girlfriend before.

I hope I have time to study the last two chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hey (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and Moka and Tsukune came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Tsukune.

Don't worry. I'll be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you went to Yukari's as well as your dorm. When you came in, you focused on reading the last two chapters that Yukari told you to read. It took a while, but managed to read all of them. You wiped your brow and lied down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew! Finally! I'm finally done! I thought I'd never get finished. Tomorrow's test should be a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed that your shirt was kinda sweaty. You felt a little gross so you decided to take a shower. So you grabbed a towel and walked into the bathroom. There were baskets to put you clothes in. So you got undressed, put on your towel and walked in. When you walked in, you couldn't believe your eyes. The bathroom was a lot more fancy than you thought, but a little feminine. The tiles were pink and the tub was so big that two or three people could fit in it. The towels were white and were as fluffy as a pillow. It also had a shower head that had modifications for the pressure for those who want an awesome shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh man! This is the fanciest looking bathroom I've ever seen! A little pink, but still! Wow! I can't wait to try this out! Hope Yukari doesn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you took off your towel and turned on the shower head. You felt the water wash away the tension from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ahhh. That's feels great! I could get used to this. I can't believe Yukari's got a fancy bathroom like this. I oughta relax in here more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up you planned to get into the bath first, but you remembered that you had to have proper etiquette when it came to baths. You had to wash yourself first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): This may not be a public bathhouse, but I should still be respectful. I better wash first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trying to find a sponge or something to wash yourself, but you didn't find any. So you put on your towel and opened the door. When you did you found that you had an unexpected surprise. Yukari was standing in front of the baskets putting on her towel. When you saw her you froze in place. Then Yukari saw you too.

She then answered with a formal, \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought she was playing with you. No way any girl would agree to such a request when neither of you were a couple,  yet the word echoed through your ears. Without much nervousness and confusion holding you back, you opened the door and drew the water for the tub. She went inside first and set the temprature to the right setting and got very comfortable. When the water was high enough she allowed you to come in. \"It's ok to come in now (Name), you don't have to make it awkward for yourself. \", Yukari said trying to at least make you enjoy this genrous offering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough you got in and relaxed in the water making you sigh in response. \"Ahhhhhhh, this is just perfect. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe you know look a lot more relaxed when your like this. You seem more normal.\", she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh thanks.\", you prentended not to feel awkward by her cuteness but it couldn't be helped. Yukari sensed your bashfulness and tried moving it along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) can you wash my back please. \", she asked with a cute wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly fainted from her flirtatious move but managed to stay headstrong. You took a sponge and soaked it in some soap and rubbed it on her back gently. You felt her smooth skin as you washed her back and with tender care treated it with utmost delicacy. Yukari blushed by how well done you performed your job and was glad to see your restraint. She returned the favor by planning to get you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do a good job?\", you asked out of instinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were great (Name). You were a total gentleman in my book. \", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt relieved to hear her approval and with a quiet breath readied for her turn. Yukari took the sponge and with equal care and caressing washed your back. Her hands on your body felt sofy as feathers and made you feel like you were in a dream. She even got up closer to you and was nearly right against you. It felt weird,  you didn't know what to feel or do. Instead you just assumed it was nothing. Yukari blushed as she went up closer to you begining to figure out she was developing a crush on you. A big one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon as it ended you allowed her to leave first and put her towel back on while you shut your eyes. Yukari got out and put on a robe and some night clothes. Soon as she gave you the go ahead you drained the water and put on your own clothes for the nigt. Yukari was laying on the couch and said, \"Sit with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon.\", she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat around her but then she pulled you down and the two of you were nearly right in eachothers faces. \"(Name) I think you should know something. I like you.\", then she....</span></div></div>",

Yukari was on a tree vine naked and reached out towards you pleading for you to be one with her. You leapt for her and made out like crazy. Then it all went away and cut to a ferris wheel cart with Yukari under your arm. She was eating a piece of cotton candy that you fed her and ate it like a cat. \"Mmmm it tastes great. But I'll bet you taste better. \", she said. This time she was on top of you and initiated the make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part of your dream it was all just vague and random scenarios of you and Yukari being romantic. But a certain feeling hit you when this one played in your mind. \"I can't wait for us to be husband and wife!\", Yukari said in the dream. In her typical Yukari fashion she laughed and hugged you around your chest. But this gave off something familiar. Like it wasn't a dream. A vision of the future  perhaps? Maybe,  maybe it wasn't a vision but a memory. You tried to remember where it took place but  it just faded from your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact it altogether faded from your mind in a blink.

She was asleep like a baby and smiled so cutesy and in her sleep pulled you closer towards her. You chose not wake her up and enjoyed her embrace. You gently stroked her forehead and lightly kissed it. \"Good morning Yukari. \", you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm little longer please.  Too tired. \", she replied half awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for her to wake up while she still had you in her arms. You liked being like this, with Yukari in a nice cozey bed cuddling. But then your thoughts flashed back to the dream.  You knew it was familiar,  hell you distinctly recall something but you couldn't put your finger on it. You knew something about it was familiar, but why did it? What was being said?, \"Husband and wife\", was all that you remembered last night outside of having the dream altogether. But why those words. You didn't know anyone from your old school who said that. Not even your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you knew you heard those words before from someone. As soon as you started really trying to think of an answer, Yukari started waking up. She moaned and smiled seeing you, \"Hi (Name). Sorry for just sleeping next to you without permission. I just couldn't help but ...\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's o.k. I didn't even notice.\", you answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well today I'm taking a break from testing and teaching so for today.  I want us to go out,  like you know as a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uhhh I suppose. I mean I've never done it before. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) have no fear.

One was a girl dressed in pink and had long black hair with eyes of emerald green. The other was a guy dressed in blue and gray who sat on his feet instead of his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well obviously undying loyalty is the best relationship of all. Loyalty like that comes rarely these days.\", the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People who devote themselves to people have nothing to live for. I find that to be an illusion. However I don't deny that it exsists.\", he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your such a pessemist Jahn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the optimist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you think that undying loyalty exists how about my undying loyalty to my future husband?\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a difference between obsessive infatuation and that. I happen to think the former is your case. Besides I doubt he'd reciprocate the feeling Kaguya.\", Jahn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. No wonder you'll never get married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly I find that concept to be weak. If a couple really loves eachother that much then they shouldn't need to be bound by law. It makes it stronger if you think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was nice seeing you again old friend but I think now is finally time to see my future husband.\", Kaguya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it odd choosing now of all times when you could have seen him after you turned 10? You realize were being hunted down by monster families of the highest ranks.\", Jahn warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, undying loyalty to my husband.\", Kaguya retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just steer clear of them. Particuarly the vampires. Although if you need to draw attention to any monster species don't hesitate to show off against the succubi.\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always thought they were beautiful Jahn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be helped I'm a guy with basic desires and they represent the embodiment. I mean if you had a weakness to any monster wouldn't it be obvious that it would be one that plays with your emotions and hormones? Which there are a few from what I've been told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None would compare to (Name). He's all I need.\", Kaguya said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. Well do be careful Kaguya, if he's at that school for monsters it will be hard not to be recognized.\", Jahn said as Kaguya left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine Jahn. I'll call you if I need any help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh you will.\", he said with a smirk around his face.</span></div></div>",

She nearly cried from the overwhelming happiness that consumed her being but remained calm. With one small step she walked over and went to grab your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Yu-\", before you finished answering you noticed Kaguya walking towards you. Then something clicked in your mind like you knew you had seen her before but you don't know where. But everything was about to be clear ounce she began talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi (Name), it's me Kaguya.\", she said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the name rang through your ears everything was clear. Kaguya's family was friends with your own and you remember all the time you spent as kids for one summer. It was so long ago you had forgotten her as time went on. Believing she was a monster you assumed she was in no danger when it was the exact opposite. But you greeted her with a big hug and laughed at how joyous your reunion was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god it's been a whole other lifetime! How've you been Kaguya?!\", you said with a big smile that lite like a candle in a dark room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya wasn't certain of what to say or do seeing how she was experiencing the excitment of reuniting with you but with also what you were thinking of her. However she didn't wish to spoil the moment and simply treated it as a friendly meeting. \"It's so wonderful to see you again (Name). I've missed you and thought about you for a long time.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell from her tone that she meant it in a romantic sense but you replied, \"It's good to see you again Kaguya.\" Tskune was wondering what was going on so you decided to explain the context of this reunion. \"Tskune this is Kaguya, my childhood friend. We spent an entire summer together while her folks lived in Japan for the summer season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi I'm Tskune it's a pleasure to meet you.\", Tskune said extending his arm to Kaguya. She accepted his kindness and maintained a sense of kindness around your friends. She wasn't prejudice against monsters but it was tough to maintain cover from a place like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) means a great deal to me. I hope you were watching his back.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have. But he's been working overtime with Yukari. He's her new apprentice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how nice of her. Is she a teacher?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually she's a student but is a genius. And I'm spending the year in her room.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kaguya this was a shock to her as she had assumed you thought about her as much as she did of you. She never expected to have competition let alone to this much of an extent. She kept her frustration inside herself and hoped it wasn't as bad as she feared. Maybe it would be best to have time alone to catch up with you and remind you of all the romantic times you had as children. You already wanted to talk with Kaguya alone so you kindly asked Tskune to leave which he did replying, \"Nice meeting you\", with a wave goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow it's been forever you look great.\", you complimented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well (Name) you look just as stunning. In fact I was blushing as soon as I realized it was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe you flatter me. But really wow! I didn't know you enrolled here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. I'm not even a monster (Name). In fact I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me. My family is being hunted one by one and it's dangerous for me to be here. But I had to come for you (Name). I had to. You mean a lot to me.\", she said in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaguya do you want me to guard you or something? Because with a little more time I can do that with all the spells and magic I'm learning from Yukari. Oh man you'd love to meet her. She is a lot like you, and between you and me.\", you whispered in her ear, \"I think I like her a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose seven words had nearly broke Kaguya's poor heart. For so long she waited for you but now this Yukari had undone her heartstrings and now knew she needed to save you. She teared up but quickly hid it from you not wanting to tell you how she felt just yet. But the urge was so powerful she felt that if she didn't it would lose you. \"Well listen (Name) I came here because well...\"</span></div></div>",

Couldn't she stay? Kaguya had to understand that you had a life here now. At least she could stay here with you for the rest of the year and then move with her. This was all stuff you needed to talk to her about so as soon as you came back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu let go of your head and breathed a little heavily, \"You know who you love now?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't see who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see who that person loves (Name), its so that I don't alter the answer.

Listen I have to go, I'll see you tomorrow.\", you said leaving for Kaguya's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to her room and knocked on her door quietly to make sure nobody heard you. Kaguya opened the door and to her delight saw you standing in her doorway. \"(Name)? Your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for you Kaguya. I know who I want to be with, and it's you.\", you said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH I LOVE YOU (NAME)!\", she squelled in joy. She leaped on to your neck and made you twirl around from the force of it. \"This is the moment I waited for most of my life and now here we are. (Name) pack your things, were leaving first thing in-\", you stopped her sentence by putting a finger on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Kaguya, I need to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said you wanted to be with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and I mean it. But I can't simply leave now. I have friends, a life, and a school year to finish. I promise I will come with you back to your home and we can live together. But I just need you to be patient.\", you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've BEEN patient! Your telling me to wait longer just because you can't up and leave these monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those monsters are my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay here that long. It's too dangerous and I won't leave here just because I'm worried about my safety. I waited too long to see you again so I won't let it stop me from being with you. Lets leave here and then we can be married to each other like we promised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaguya, just for the rest of the school year.

She shut herself in and slowly leaned on the door crying believing she lost you. \"Why couldn't she change his mind\", she thought. \"If I leave here without him I'll never forgive myself. But stay here and I risk everything for him? I'd do anything for him but this is too high a price. I don't want to take his friends away but still I want....oh (Name). Why did I have to fall for such a crazy fool like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your hand on the door wanting to talk to her but you knew she needed time alone. But instead of leaving you leaned on her door and facepalmed. \"Is it so selfish of me to ask this of her? Her family is an enemy to monsters and I'd be placing her in danger. But people like Moka, Kurumu, and Yukari...ahhh what have I become? I don't know what the right thing to do is anymore.\", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours went by and Kaguya leaned over and placed her ear on the door to see if you were still there. She heard you tearing up and started thinking that this was harder for you than it was for her. You were just trying to not abandon your friends and in some way Kaguya started to understand that now. She thought to herself, \"Could I do this for him? I know I could, but can I bring myself to do it? (Name).....so help me.\", she opened the door. You immediatly got up but didn't expect a happy answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I stay with you, I'm already home.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay. But only if you stay with me the entire time. I'll feel better knowing your around to keep me safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged you and you spent the night in her room. You both cuddled and slept on her bed sleeping in each others care. For Kaguya this was the first time since that summer you were this close to one another. She wanted to show some affection in some way, a simple kiss would all but satisfy her. But took a vow to only do do that when you were married. Instead she leaned closer to your face and rested on your chest. If she loved you as much as she claimed, then she would do all in her power to try and befriend her beloved's friends as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that same night Yukari was alone waiting for you to come back, and you never did. She cried and felt heartbroken that you left her like this. \"(Name)...I'll make you pay!\", she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUKARI! Shut up it's three in the morning!\", Kurumu yelled from her room next to Yukari's.</span></div></div>",

You looked and you saw Kaguya sleeping next to you. You quietly got up without waking her up and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Hm. You know.....she's kinda cute when she's sleeping. She reminds me of Yukari in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered that you slept with Kaguya without Yukari knowing where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh crap that's right! Yukari doesn't know where I am! Not to mention that she doesn't know about me Kaguya! If she finds out about Kaguya......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pictured in your mind about Yukari's reaction about finding out about Kaguya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Fantasy-<br>\r\nYukari: What?!? Not only did you not come back, but now I find out that you're dumping me for another woman?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But Yukari I.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: I don't want to hear it! For this you must be punished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her wand and you found yourself wrapped in a bondage suit and Yukari's wand was now a whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wh-wh-wh-what is this?!? And what are you going to do with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Your divine punishment! This is what you get for betraying my heart and by the way, I'm not your master any more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): WHAT!?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Now repent! And take your punishment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she began whipping you like crazy. You cried in pain and were crying with tears in your face. While you were crying Yukari was enjoying herself as she was whipping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hahahaahaha! Now prepare to experience the ultimate pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yukari! Please forgive me!<br>\r\n-Fantasy ends-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered at that thought of what Yukari would do if she found out about you and Kaguya. Then you made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: OK. I can't let Yukari find out about Kaguya. If she does she'll not only hate me, but she won't make me her apprentice anymore. So I'll just have to try to prevent Kaguya and Yukari from meeting. Yukari's probably pissed off at me enough because of me not coming back. Oh man. This sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard Kaguya waking up. She stretched and yawned as she got out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Oh (name). Good morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. Good morning Kaguya. Listen. I need to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Listen. When it comes to Tsukune and the others, I want you to keep quiet about us OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Why? If you're worried about people who would oppose us then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you went on your hands and knees and politely bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Please. I want to break it to them slowly, especially Yukari. It's gonna be hard because Yukari's my master and I know that she probably likes me. So please keep it a secret until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence, but then Kaguya smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: If that's what you want. I'll do what ever you say (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thank you. You don't know how happy that.....what the!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when you rose your head, Kaguya began to undress in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kaguya! What the hell are you doing?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: What's it look like? I'm getting dressed. I have to get ready for school you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But can't you wait till I leave the room?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Well........I've heard that lovers do this sort of thing all the time don't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Where did you hear something crazy like that?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: What seems to be the problem? I don't mind if you look at me with my clothes off. In fact...I don't mind as long as it's you (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you with innocent eyes which made you blush. You had to admit it. Kaguya was very beautiful. Because of her statement, you began to get tempted. You were willing to see her naked, but luckily your reason snapped you out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I......I......I'll wait outside until your done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you dashed outside of the room and shut the door leaving Kaguya perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: What the matter with him? Was it something I said?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after Kaguya got dressed you walked with her to class. As you walked with her, every student boy or girl would not stop staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh great. Everyone won't stop staring at Kaguya because she's so beautiful. It's like she's a celebrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you ran into Moka, Tsukune, and Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Morning (name). Morning Kaguya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) and Kaguya: Morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hey Kaguya. I got some friends I want you to meet. This is Moka and this is Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hi there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoka: Nice to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Me too. It's a pleasure. Any friend of (name)'s is a friend of mine. Right (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kaguya hugged you making you blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Umm. Yeah. Sure. Hehehe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you all made your way to the classroom. As you all made your way to the classroom, Tsukune talked to you in a low voice so the girls didn't hear you two talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: So is Kaguya your knew girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I don't know. To be honest, I'm not even sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Well one thing's for sure, she sure is beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukune: Hey (name). Is something wrong? You look a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well you see.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish you heard a familiar voice which made you sweat and get chills down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Hey! (name)! Where are you?!? I got a bone to pick with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh crapola!! It's Yukari! I can't let her see me! Wait! I can't let her see Kaguya either! What do I do?!? I gotta think fast! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around trying to find out what to do. Then you see an empty classroom and.....</span></div></div>",

Always thinking things through to much. Where as I am more impulsive and take action like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hm. Opposites attract I guess. You know it's what led me to have a crush on you that same time. You always dragged me around to do so many things that got us into trouble. But then, you were always there to get me and you out of trouble again. Never stopped to think about it, just went to my aid if I asked for you help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we were friends. And they tell each other everything. So tell me whats so wrong with you? What is on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...I don't know what I am doing here. Why is a human boy in a school of real monsters? Why is it that I'm having dreams of things I don't even know yet are real? And why is it.....I can't seem to know how to love the one I love back right? Kaguya, your all I have here that makes any sense here, the only one I REALLY trust. Help me.\", you leaned on her chest crying. Overwhelmed with all this weight and pressure on your shoulders it was breaking you down. Kaguya comforted you rubbing her hand on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhh. Don't worry (Name), I will be here. Always.\", she said. For the next couple hours you two sat alone in the forest talking about what was making you so overwhelmed and confused. Kaguya in her special way managed to help re-shape the stress into a positive way. She was there holding you in her arms the entire time not willing to leave your side until you were feeling better. After a while you calmed down and you got back up with Kaguya holding your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh you can let go of my hand now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But were husband and wife aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, to me we already are married. In name only right now but soon the whole world will see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Kaguya, but I swear I'll make it up to you some how. I can't begin to thank you for just everything you have done.\". you planted a kiss on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(N-name)! I told you not to kiss me until our wedding day. Not even ones planted away from my lips.\", she reacted in emberresment and pleasure. She blushed wildly unable to hide it but while she protested against it, she loved to have you do it even so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kaguya. I just didn't know how else to thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it by bringing your stuff to my room by tonight. I'll be waiting for you tonight. Let's head back.\", she said grasping your hand tighter but not too tight. You grasped it just as tight and moved close to Kaguya and enjoyed the walk back.</span></div></div>",

She was curled up in a ball and she looked miserable. Her eyes were red from crying and her cheeks were stained with tears. She tried to put it out of her head, but she couldn't help remember how she found out about you and Kaguya.<br>\r\n(flashback)<br>\r\nYukari was walking to class looking for you. She was looking forward to giving you another test to train you. Then she saw you talking to Tsukune. She was just about to call you when Kaguya walked up to you and Tsukune. When you saw Kaguya, you were very happy to see her. Yukari was surprised by your reaction and how happy you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Who the heck is that girl? What the heck is she doing with my (name)? And why does he look so happy?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust from seeing you talking with another girl made Yukari burn with jealously. Then Tsukune left leaving you and Kaguya alone. Yukari went over for a closer look. She hid behind a tree so she and (name) wouldn't notice her You and Kaguya were talking about why Kaguya was here and her family being on the run. Yukari tried to listen in, but she couldn't hear it very well. Then she heard Kaguya say the words that made her heart freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya:  \"Well listen (Name) I came here because well... I came here to take you home with me and marry you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Yukari (quietly) gasp. Her eyes went wide in shock and clasped her hands over her mouth so she couldn't be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: WHAT?!?!? Is she crazy?!?!? Who does she think she is proposing to my (name)?!?!?!? (name)'s mine! OK. Calm down Yukari. Let's not jump the gun here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yukari regained her composure, she looked back to see you were by yourself. Yukari could see that you were stressing on what Kaguya said. Then you began walking her direction. Yukari quickly used her magic to get away before you saw her. A little later she stopped by her room to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: Whew that was close! I can't believe this! That little tramp is gonna steal my (name) away! OK, calm down Yukari! It's not the end of the world. Besides (name) is your loyal apprentice. There's no way that he's gonna dump you over some girl he knew ever since they were kids and who and a girl who out of the blue proposed to him. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari paused from her thoughts for a moment then she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: It's OK! I know that (name) won't betray me! I love him! And he loves me......at least....I think he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thought about all the times you and her spent together including when she confessed to you in the bath. Then she heard you walk by. She slowly peeked outside the room to see that you were heading a different. Yukari quietly stepped out and followed you until you stopped in front of Kaguya's room. Yukari ventured closer to you until she was close enough to hear. You knocked on Kaguya's door and Yukari listened quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: (Name)? You're....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm here for you Kaguya. I know who I want to be with, and it's you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: OH I LOVE YOU (NAME)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words sent shocks throught Yukari's heart and then her heart broke. Tears streamed down her face and she could take it anymore. She ran away toward her room, locked the door, and plopped down on the bed. She cried into her pillow emotionally shattered. She couldn't believe that you chose Kaguya over her. Then her sadness turned into rage and then she screamed at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: (Name)...I'll make you pay!<br>\r\n(flashback ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: (name) you dummy. Why would you choose her over me? It's not fair. (sob) It's just not fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari began to cry once more. From the looks of things, it would seem that her heart will never be repaired. Unbeknownst to Yukari the person in white was watching her. The person watched on in silence and then disappeared in the darkness. Then....</span></div></div>",

It was nostalgic seeing how you two slept over each others houses in the past, but now it felt better being romanticly involved. You two slept together peacefully that night and nothing ruined the moment. Morning arrived and you and Kaguya both got up at around the same time. \"Yawwwwn.

Kaguya felt safe when you were around her but today she would need to attend a class without your supervision. She wanted to stay with you as long as she could but soon you made it to her class and Kaguya had to let you go for a little while. \"(Name) I'm a little worried that someone might know I'm from-\", you shushed her with your finger over her lips and reassured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaguya you'll be fine.

You let Kaguya go to survive the class on her own. Now she was alone and nervous being a human girl to a anti-monster family. There wasn't even any sign of your friends for that matter. Except for one who Kaguya felt the most uncomfortable towards, Yukari. Of all the classes she took it had to end her up with Yukari. Kaguya got a glare from Yukari knowing full well she hated her for stealing you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right class we have a new student please give your undivided attention to Ms. Kaguya Yamauchi.\", said the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to anyone the last name was fake to make certain no one else knew her family heritage. Kaguya stood up and gave a short introduction, \"Hi I'm Kaguya and I hope to enjoy my stay here.\", the response from the students seemed positive except for Yukari but regardless it all felt like she made a good impression. She wanted to boast about being Mrs. Kaguya (Name) but she knew that would hurt Yukari more than she already was. The class went on for an hour and Kaguya managed to maintain her cool. Soon it was almost over until something struck a nerve in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright class next time we will discuss about the 6 houses of Kita and their families.\", the teacher ended her session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GASP! Oh no! They'll talk about my family and they might notice something about me. And Yukari might....no. If she really loves (Name) she should love him enough to let him be happy.\", she thought to herself. Kaguya left her class and moved on to the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was bare bones and nothing else happened. After her final class ended she went right to finding you s she could hug you in her arms. But before she went outside to the courtyard she was blocked off by Yukari.</span></div></div>",

Kaguya in reflex pulled you closer and started talking in her sleep. You couldn't make out the words but you knew it had something to do with you. You let Kaguya sleep longer and watched her sleep very cutely. She looked like an angel while she slept with her hair laid out around her and her beautiful smile. Soon she woke up and her smile grew when she woke up to the sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.

This school year it taking forever. When is it over?\", she begged to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only have at least two and a half months before I can leave to complete the semester. I'm taking extra classes so we can leave during winter break. Won't the timing be perfect?\", you said seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh easy there, another comment with that tone and we'll skip the waiting. C'mon we have classes to go finish so that we can leave as early as possible. Gotta say I like your friends here. I really do, they seem nice.\", Kaguya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kaguya? What was wrong yesterday. Something was on your mind and it worried me when you didn't talk about it to me.\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing baby honest.\", she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were supposed to be honest to eachother so why is it you keep secrets?\", you raised your voice irritated by her reluctance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!

The class was lectured about her family tree and how badly her family was hated in particular. While Yukari was fascinated with it she noticed Kaguya sweating while the really bad parts were being discussed. For Kaguya's family was responsible for nearly bringing the races of vampires and witches to near extinction such as the succubi. Yukari wasn't 100% but it seemed like Kaguya was afraid of that family in particular. Could have something to do with that she's a monster? She may be a witch like her or a vampire. But a more interesting idea floated through her thoughts, was she a member of that family? Yukari wanted to for certain to try and see if it would turn up to fulfill her plan. But in order to find out she needed to get close to Kaguya and learn more about her. She decided to act as soon as the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kaguya, wanna have lunch together.\", she acted in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Hey if you don't mind I'd love to just get the whole (Name) thing off our chests so we can move past it.\", Kaguya said wanting to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. So tell me how you two know each other?\", Yukari inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We knew each other when we were young. It was during a summer break, we did so much together in those few short months. It was like we were family, and we loved doing things together even when he was annoyed with me he still liked being around me. I guess it was love at first sight and we never realized it until I left to go back home with my parents.\", Kaguya told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents? Where did you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lived in Japan but they were busy in China for so many years. (Name's) family was a friend to ours.\", Kaguya answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he treat you nicely?\", Yukari couldn't help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's so sweet, always asking me how my day is, giving me a hug every morning, he;s just wonderful. Were sticking to no affection until we get married.\", Kaguya slipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your getting married?\", Yukari acted surprised when she knew from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it isn't arranged it's our choice. I may have been the only one trying to keep it alive and going but thankfully (Name) still had feelings for me. And it's a blessing everyday I wake up next to his smiling face. I doubt he is as happy now as he'll ever be in his life. Sorry I'm just rambling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that is very happy. (Name) is special and I liked him a lot too. He has a way of making you the only thing worth living for in his life and it makes you feel wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Yukari, he spoke highly of you even now. If you ask me I think he'd go out with you if it was different.\", Kaguya said trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Listen I better go class starts in a few. See ya.\", Yukari said, \"Things will be different indeed. It seems that by getting rid of you (Name) will be all mine again! Just wait till I go through your room and dig up some dirt on you, then I will be the bride! Mwahahahhahahahahahahhaaaaa!\", she said in her thoughts.</span></div></div>",

And I just got word from the guidance consular I can leave soon as the season break hits, which means I can finally leave with Kaguya. Not sure if I want to get married right after, I'll probably be exhausted. Maybe in a week or two we can just take some time for the both of us to spend time alone and we can invite the others. I'm almost thinking about possibly telling them about her family but at the same time it would make things worse. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell them during the break so that Kaguya will be in less danger and it could stay between me us. Yeah, that's what I'll do. Kaguya won't like it and say no. But Moka, Tskune, Kurumu, and Yukari plus the others deserve to know. I owe them the truth. Now that I brought her up, I wonder how Yukari is doing? Maybe I should go spend some time to talk with her and maybe rekindle our relationship. It can't be like before, but at least she could finish with my training as her apprentice. I just wish she didn't find out the way she did about Kaguya, I should have told her directly and broke it off. Wasn't her fault, it was mine and I hurt her. Ah regardless of what or who the blame goes to I can't change how I feel about Kaguya. Still though....Yukari....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour deep thoughts ended when Kaguya came around and greeted you with a hug. \"There's my fiancee! How was your class?\", she asked in a cheery mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares your here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, \"You come up with ways to make me feel special, it's kinda like your begging me to up and kiss you on the spot. But I won't until the wedding vows.\", she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lack of affection is killing me, only about five weeks till break and more depending on the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait five- &gt;GASP&lt; oh you made me so happy!\", she hugged in anticipation. \"So we officially are going to be married by the time winter break comes, ohhh I can't wait to get ready right after we leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there Kaguya we don't have to get hitched right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", she reacted in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we take time alone ad rest and act like a dating couple instead of a married one for just a little bit and then we can spend the rest of our lives together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I have our wedding planned and ready to go at a moments notice. Why wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not saying we wait a whole month, just a week at least to rest and enjoy ourselves. That's all. And it will give my friends time to be ready so that they can come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on (Name), I like all of your friends here but they can't come to the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family won't accept them and it's meant for just our families and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal people? Is that it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are as human as you and me. They can't be blamed for being born with a reputation of being feared of frightening children at night. They didn't ask to be here and be born with those gifts and I didn't ask to be here when I'm not like them, but we all are. You didn't have to come and take me away, you had a choice to be treated like they are even for a solid day, but they didn't. And I ended growing to love and care for them like I do you. So the least you can do for them is show them the respect that they deserve a spot to watch me in my happiest moment!\", you argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is so easy for me?! I risk every waking minute to stand by your choice to make me stay here and I do that because I love you so much that I respected your opinion on these people. But the day we finally are bound by more than just love, that day needs to be perfect in every way. I can't have it ruined with them finding out who I really am and making it into a bloodbath. Something you vampire friend will know much about, and that broad with the hooters she'll be flaunting herself like a stripper in front of the reception, and need I remind you your ex will be there who's only a kid! You think I want them to be at our wedding?! You are out of your mind if you think I'll welcome them with open arms!\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two were getting at each others skin which was grabbing many students attention including Yukari's to her delight. Soon the both of you walked away angry at one another. In any relationship arguing is natural but this one hit a little harder on your emotional barrier and not just because it was your first real argument but because of how she insulted your friends. And in such a cruel manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had enough to turn some monsters against Kaguya and it was just the right kind of powerful monsters she thought were beneath her.</span></div></div>",

I'm a little busy right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yes you may help us! Help us by explaining why you're talking trash behind our backs?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Don't play dumb! We heard everything you said about us! Like the part where you said Moka a killer and knew how to make a bloodbath and called Yukari a stupid little kid! But most of all......you called me a broad and a stripper!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: What? What are you....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Don't play dumb. We know about your conversation with (name). And frankly, I won't tolerate any of it. Especially when you're insulting me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! So get ready to get your ass kicked! Cause you're gonna get it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya stood there motionless for a moment, but then she began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Something funny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Forgive me, I just find it funny that you guys are letting a bunch of petty insults getting the better of you. Not to mention you girls are acting like a bunch brats not being invited to a party. Well you're all monsters so I wouldn't expect anything less from all of you. After all you're all nothing, but a bunch of killers and sluts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu and Yukari: Say what?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: What do you mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: It's true isn't it? All you monsters do is inflict terror on people and kill needlessly. Especially monsters like you three. Moka, a vampire who sucks on the blood from innocent people and then turn them into vampires. Kurumu a succubus who turns men into slaves with their powers and wiles. And Yukari.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya looked at Yukari with a burning hate pointed at her which made Yukari cringe a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Your kind especially is known to use their powers for evil purposes and to create chaos. You monsters came into this world looking for chaos and destruction, You tricked and turned people against each other and even made them kill each other without ever having regards for your actions and only just to get what you want. In my opinion, I wouldn't know why (name) would like a selfish race like you people. Which is why I'm doing what's best for him and keeping him away from all of you so he won't get hurt. Especially Yukari. I saw the way you acted when you found out about (name) and me Yukari. You went crazy and almost hurt him which proves my point. (name) would be better with me instead of monsters for friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yukari heard these words she could not help, but feel a little bit guilty. Part of what Kaguya said was true. She did lie Moka and Kurumu and it was because that she wanted to get back at Kaguya for stealing her away from you. In fact she called it to a T.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: She's....right. I did act a little bratty and...I even deceived (name) and everyone else just to take him back. Am I doing the right thing here? I mean this is a little overboard and....everyone's is gonna hate me when they find out....is this really the right thing to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kurumu's voice snapped Yukari out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hey! That's not true! Sure there some evil monsters in the world, but there some nice ones too! Why the hell are you being such a bitch?!? What would (name) say if he heard you say these things?!? (name)'s our friend and nothing you can say will change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Don't act like you care about (name) succubus. All (name) is to all of you is his slave. I want what's best for (name). And what's best for him is to keep monsters like you away from him so he won't become corrupted. You hear me?!? (name)'s mine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari hearing Kaguya say those two words made her mad and then she steeled her resolve. She readied her wand and pointed it at Kaguya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: How dare you say that! (name) doesn't belong to anybody except me! Someone like you who thinks that way doesn't deserve him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Is that so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: You know what? I think the time for talking is over. It's time for you to know your place Kaguya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Fine. Then's let's get on with it shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Moka and Kurumu charged at Kaguya with Yukari close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: Screw this! This is the only way. There's no way I'm about to give up (name) to this bitch! She's going down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya silently stood there with a fighting stance and then she charged too. Then the battle began.</span></div></div>",

Kaguya kept dodging her blows with ease. Then Moka came at her from above with one of her special kicks, but then Kaguya blocked the kick using both of her hands. Kurumu seeing as it was an opportunity to attack came at her from behind and closed in to attack. It looked it she was gonna connect, but Kaguya suddenly raised her leg and countered by kicking Kurumu square in the face. Kurumu was sent sprawling to the ground. Then Kaguya threw back Moka's leg and roundhouse kicked her in the gut. It didn't hurt Moka much, but the force of the kick sent her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: (spit) Damn it! That hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: I gotta say, she's pretty tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: I can't believe it. She blocked Moka and Kurumu's attacks with ease! Most monsters couldn't even hold a candle to those two. Just what kind of monster is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Too easy. The succubus I expected to be weak, but Moka, I thought you were a lot stronger than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Don't get your hopes up. I'm just warming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Me too! You'll pay for kicking me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: She has no openings what so ever and she's strong enough to repel two monsters at once. How is she that strong? Wait a sec.... Could she be....no.....if she's one of those races! Impossible! Those races were wiped out from long ago! If she's really one of those type of monsters, we better pull out the big guns! I gotta think of a way to catch her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thought and she thought until she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Moka! Kurumu! I have an idea! Try to get a hit on Kaguya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Easier said than done! We can't get a single hit in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Just try to get a hit on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: You don't have to tell me twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombat (MMPR Soundtrack)<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkeKWRuz9i4\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkeKWRuz...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka charged at Kaguya and Kaguya charged at Moka. Both fighters clashed with fierce blows, each one being blocked. Then Kurumu flew in and slashed at Kaguya with her claws. Once again Kaguya dodged the attacks. Meanwhile Yukari focused on her magic wand and it began to glow. Then a ring of cards appeared around her and she began to chant a spell. Kurumu and Moka kept on attacking, but they didn't get a single hit in. They stopped for a while to catch their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Come on. I'm getting bored. Just give up already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Screw you! We're not about to give up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: That's right. Besides, it's been a while since I fought a strong opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Hmm. Very well. I'll just have to take you out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya charged ready to attack, but then Yukari finished casting a spell and cast it. The cards flew around and became the shape of a crow. The crow flew toward Kaguya ready to peck her eyes out, but Kaguya raised her hand and when it touched the crow, the crow exploded in a pile of ashes and smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: No way! She stopped my magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Ha. Is that all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something came out from the smoke and attacked her. Unfortunately Kaguya blocked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Come on. Using the smoke for cover is the most basic strategy in the book. You disappoint me Moka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the smoke pulled clear, it wasn't Moka. It was Kurumu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: What?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Got ya! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a whole army of Kurumu's emerged from the smoke and attacked Kaguya at once. One of the Kurumu clones came at Kaguya and attacked. Kaguya readied herself to block, but the clone of Kurumu disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Now I get it! They're illusions! You think a bunch of illusions will stop me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya then went to work using her feet and hands and one by one the illusions were destroyed. Soon the real Kurumu was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Aww crap! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Now I have you! Now prepare yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya was coming at Kurumu with her fist raised, but she forgot about one thing. Moka. She came out of nowhere and gave her a powerful kick to the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Kaguya! Know your place!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya was sent flying and she was slammed into a tree knocking the wind out of her. She slumped over and she looked like she was knocked out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Yeah! We got her! Nice punch Moka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Yukari did all the work. If she hadn't got Kaguya distracted, I would've never been able to get a hit on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: Yeah! That'll teach you to insult us like that you punk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: Whew, We did it. That was way too easy. I guess she was all talk. Here I was worried that she was one of those monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kaguya slowly got up and wiped her mouth. When Moka and the others saw her getting up, they were shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari: No way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: No one can get up from one of Moka's kicks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: Wow. She's tougher than she looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya wiped her lips and looked at her hand. There was a smudge of blood on it. When she saw it, she was trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Hahaha! What's the matter? Feeling scared now that you witnessed our power? That'll teach you to insult us you little skank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kaguya spoke in a low voice that didn't sound like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: How dare you......you.....actually hit my face.....you're dead.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ground began to tremble and Kaguya began emitting a powerful aura. Her hair began to stand on end and her eyes began to glow. This overwhelming power made Kurumu and Yukari sweat with fear. Even Moka began to get nervous from Kaguya's sudden change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka: What the....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu: Her energy......is insane! I've never felt something this powerful before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yukari saw Kaguya's new behavior, she was paralyzed with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari thinking: This power.....oh no....I knew it! She's a part of that race! We're so screwed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Now you'll pay! Prepare to die!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya was ready to go on a rampage when.....</span></div></div>",

Soon the ground was getting shakier, \"Just get out of here everyone run!\", you yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInner Moka took Tskune away from Kaguya and Mizore grabbed a slightly injured Kurumu at a distance from Kaguya as well. But Yukari just simply watched as you went toward her without thinking and soon Kaguya began to slowly float in the air in a fit of rage. She looked like she was going to attack the whole school but as soon as you took her by the arm she quickly glanced at you and you pulled her down into a hug. You shut your eyes tight with saddness praying you would never be in another argument with her again. And Kaguya herself began to tear up as she hurt the man she loved and treasured so much. Soon she began to loose consciousness and fell limp in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll never let her go...and I caused this....but she's a part of that family that wiped out Moka's race and my own.

But nothing can be said now, everyones in too much distress.\", Yukari thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaguya I'm sorry please forgive me. WHAT HAPPENED?!\", you raised your voice to Moka, Kurumu and Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) she insulted us! We weren't going to let her just talk shit about us like that.\", Kurumu answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all how did you find out? Because if it came from who I think it is I'm betting that it may not be the whole story.\", you replied glaring at Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit! He's on to me.\", Yukari thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukari said she talked to Saizo and talked trash about us.\", Inner Moka replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK first off Kaguya didn't talk to whoever Yukari claimed she was talking to. We were in an argument and it wasn't about you it was about us. Second it wasn't your place to get in my business whatever the reason was regarding her.

Tskune went with the others probably to discuss about Yukari's actions. They were the closest to her who didn't hate her right now and you needed to patch things up with Kaguya.</span></div></div>",

You were feeling a lot of emotions right now. Anger. Sadness. But the feeling that you were having most of all right now was shock, due to seeing Kaguya's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the heck happened to her? For a moment her power was crazy insane. I've never seen her like that before. Not even when we were kids. Just what the heck is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently stroked Kaguya's face as you prayed that Kaguya would wake up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well whatever the reason, I'm glad she's OK. I just can't believe Yukari! How could she do something so terrible to Kaguya? She lied and it's because if her that Kaguya's like this. I swear if I see her again, I'll give her a piece of my mind! But......then again.....it's my fault that she's like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wanted to be angry at Yukari, you couldn't help but feel sorry for her a little. After all you did kinda make her angry at you by choosing Kaguya over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know that I'm mad at Yukari, but....I just can't help but feel sorry for her. She may have gone and lied and tried to turn the others against Kaguya, she's still my friend. Man. Now I've gone and made her cry by threatening to hit her. And right in front of Tsukune and the others. I wish I hadn't said that to her. Somehow, I gotta set things right between her and Kaguya. I'll try to talk to her when Kaguya wakes up and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kaguya began to stir and she slowly opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kaguya! Thank goodness! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Mmm.....what.....(name)? What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well, you kinda went berserk or something and you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya suddenly got up startling you and then the anger returned on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: That little vampire! How dare she hit me?!?!? And that lowly succubus and the weakling witch too! I'll make them pay for that! No one ever touches me! EVER!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kaguya calm down! The fights already over! Calm down or you'll crazy again! What's with you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kaguya turned around looked at you and realized the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Oops! Hehehe. Sorry. I still felt a little loopy from the fight. Hehehe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK......so I take it you're OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: I'm fine. Are you? Sorry you had to see me like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's OK. I'm just glad you're you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: But.....why did they attack me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well long story short, Yukari overheard our conversation and used that to make Kurumu and Moka angry at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: I see. So where is everyone else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): They all went to have a talk with Yukari. I'm so sorry Kaguya. I never imagined that Yukari would try something like this. It's all my fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: No it's not. Yukari was the one that caused the trouble, so don't worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Well, I'm gonna go. I gotta head to my dorm room before Yukari comes in with a second attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Are you sure? I can take you to nurse if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: No. I'm gonna go back to my dorm room and get some rest. Don't worry about me. I'll see you later K?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. Take it easy Kaguya. By the way, you sure are taking this well. I would've thought you'd be mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Oh don't worry, I'm a forgiving person. Even though she and her friends attacked me and I may like them a lot less than I did before, I'm willing to forgive them for your sake (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew. That's a load of my mind. Anyway I'm gonna go talk to check Yukari. I'll see you later Kaguya. Get plenty of rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: OK. Bye (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you left to talk to Yukari and the others. Unbeknownst to you, Kaguya was still angry. Her cheek was still ringing from when Moka kicked her. Remembering that Kaguya seethe in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya: Those little bitches! They are so gonna pay for what they did! The filthy vampire Moka, the slutty succubus Kurumu, and especially that little wench Yukari! How dare they do that to me! I'll personally see to it that they will all pay! I'll wipe them out just like my family wiped the witches and the vampires out! They will pay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Kaguya left. Unknown to her, the figure in white was on top of the roof. The figure in white saw the everything that had happened. The figure watched with concern as Kaguya walked toward her dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigure in white: It's as I feared. The stress is getting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the figure looked at you running toward to where Tsukune and the others were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigure in white: If that boy hadn't calmed her down, the result would have been catastrophic. But how was he able to do it? Could he be the one? The one that I'm searching for? If that is the case, he may be the only one that can save this world from the upcoming threat. I must continue to watch over him until that time comes. I just pray it doesn't come to the point to where lives will be lost like back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the figure in white disappeared.

Also you owe me a meeting with that succubus you mentioned that gave me some minor reason to come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was what brought you here in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really friends support friends no matter what I only goaded you into something like that because I really want to meet one without them knowing I'm prey. My apologies for the deception. In fact now that I think about it regardless of what you said I'd have come either way which makes your point of undying loyalty seem to hold up. Consider me impressed on your theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you bastard you can be so sneaky.

You do at least get along with them right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. Say I asked you not to have a bridesmaid at your wedding you would rip my spine out of my body. Your doing that to (Name) and subconsciously yourself. So make peace with that and embrace them.

Not very fruitful but I'm active to try and do other things if they present themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You jumped at the idea of going out with a succubus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than jumped I dove.

And I am not making that up just because.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you see a lot of succubi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I lived with a family of succubi for almost two years. Forbidden to do anything except admire and fantasize so I judged how I would be able to tell from the good to bad. Being personality of course not in looks they always win in that level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? How do you rate me?\", Kurumu asked out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assets large and soft beautiful to witness while coverings removed I'd imagine. Hair color blue. Colorful very sexy, also nice lips, probably excellent kisser. Eyes wonderful weakest out of all other points but not lacking. Bottom is fair size, never my main attraction, but limber legs make up for it. Overall rating  a TEN, at least on purely opinion.\", Kurumu looked at him oddly. \"Did I say all that out loud? Sorry hard to remember whenever I'm analyzing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ten huh? Bold claim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, now how would you rate me and be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK fair enough. Your hair is messy, you could use a tan, your eyes look kinda creepy, and your posture is hunched all the time. I'd say a five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing what earns me those points remains anonymous. I have to say you are from what little I've seen and heard you seem to be a great person and I'd like to try and get to know you better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give me any reason to want to get to know you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have, my oddball sense of normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm, well your kinda funny. And I do like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm common with sarcasm and back talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they made small talk for about a good fifteen minutes but soon went back when it started getting colder outside.

Spoiled sport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed Kaguya you really did spoil the mood.\", Jahn retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all had a good laugh from Jahns clever and perfectly timed reply. Soon enough the double date ended and you all headed back to the academy. You dropped off Kaguya at her room and wished her goodnight. You walked on back to your room and began thinking about the two women you cared the most. \"Sigh Yukari and Kaguya. Kaguya and Yukari. Why is this becoming a contest again? I mean sure Kaguya has always been there and she is perfect. But Yukari I fell head over heels for. And not because of all the wrong reasons. Ah! If by any chance I love Yukari more what do I tell Kaguya? Well first thing tomorrow you need an appointment with Kurumu and search your feelings you know to be true about which woman a truly love. Even though one of them is absolutely bat-shit crazy for their age but again, choose to walk down that path neeeeed to wait until she's old enough so she'll be better by that time.

Never knew you liked flat chests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway Yukari may end up being your girl in the end. Because when she's matured she reels you in like nothing else.

I just hope Kaguya won't take it personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the clock and saw that it was four o'clock. You got dressed, put on shoes and then left to go see Kaguya. As you were heading toward to where you were supposed to meet Kaguya. Something flashed by right in front of you with incredible speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the....! What was that?!? Crap.

Come out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around to see who it was. Then you looked up and saw it.

After a while you along with you'r sister scraped together enough money to founded a demon hunting agency named Devil's Never Cry much to you'r dismay demon hunting wasn't exactly a expanding business venture but then a job from a place called Yokai Academy came offering a place in the school for you. Much to you'r dismay you'r sister pretty much forced you to go however there was a 2nd part to the offer you would also receive payment sent directly to you'r agency for \"protection\"  you would also be allowed to bring \"you'r tools of trade\" that last 2nd part was good enough for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow being a half demon you have some abilities which include extreme speed, power, regeneration, and the power to summon almost ghostly blue \"summon swords\".

You were a vampire you think. You see you were never really sure what species you were but you do crave blood so you have to be a vampire. You spent your early school life in a human school. This year you were going to Yokai Academy. A school for monsters. You were always consumed in electronics. You had a laptop, a mobile phone, an mp3 player and a heldheld game console. So you had a lot of electronics. Your favorite pass time was watching anime and playing video games. You weren't a complete nerd. You were more of a geek.You had very few friends. You were never big on friendships. You had large dark red eyes, long red straight hair. You also had freckles along the middle of your face.(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://orig04.deviantart.net/37eb/f/2017/147/4/3/amaya_ayumi_by_varnocdbz-dbaolo2.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://orig04.deviantart.net/37eb/f/2017...</a>). You were in general a pretty normal looking   <br>\r\ngirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway today was the day you started school at Yokai Academy.<br>\r\nSo after you packed up your bag and said goodbye to your parents you were off to your new school. You arrived at a large forest with a castle-like looking building in the distance. You began to make your way to the building but hit something and fell down. After your vision returned to normal you looked up and saw a girl who looked to be about 13(13 legal age of consent in japan). She was short with short black hair, and she was wearing a witches hat. So you guessed she was a witch. You felt your heart skip a beat. Was this love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" She said snapping you back to reality. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From what you knew, Dress code hardly mattered here from what you were told; Though right now you wished for a sweater as the early signs of people arriving into the school grounds from the dorm. Some attempted to look normal, but the odd Lizard tail and mono eye still stuck out as you walked about. Your knees started to rub in nervous excitement as you heaved your backpack up and walked around in aimless wonder to look at the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to walk about before somebody catches your eye. It was only a quick distracting glance before you accidently bumped into another student and mushed right into him before recoiling back.

But your mind could only race to think if she is looking for you as you tap her on the shoulder. Her body shifted in defence as a hammer swung upon you in an instant. You could hardly blink as it stopped right before hitting you. The girl blinked in confusion before she huffed and gave a mean glare at you. \"Hey, You shouldn't be sneaking up on people sneaking up on others...\" she blurted in anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I'm sorry. I'm new, So...\" You replied innocently enough. But your comment falls on deaf ears as the girl goes charging towards someone else with her hammer, swinging at a pink haired girl and her boy friend. You give a sigh as you gaze in a stary eyed wonder. You slowly glide towards the school where they continue to fight until the bell rings, your heart breaks as you watch the fight break up and the girl wander to her classroom. Looking at your own paper, you sighed as you walked to your first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before your new peers, you gave a small bow as you introduce yourself. \"Hello, My name is (Name). I'm uhhh...' You look to your teacher who responded with a thumbs up before continuing \" I'm a recent transfer after an incident at my old school, So I hope to... *heh* get along with all of you...\" You gaze upon the somewhat less interested class, some talking with others and others paying more attention to missed homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Maki gave you another thumbs up as you hobbled to your desk on the left of the classroom as he gave you an 'Excellent' before moving onto the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock* *Knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum as you wait outside your new dorm room, Waiting for your new roommate to open the door. What little you had for clothes and the like should have been delivered earlier, but your feet counted your lost patience. Your humming continued, hands running through your sandy blonde hair. Your eye turned as someone started walking towards you with a huff. Your heart skipped a beat, eyes glowing in delight as the red haired girl stomped upstairs. You gave a somewhat small enthusiastic wave as she stares at you 'What are you doing infront of my room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing stops as you gaze at the girl \"Your room? S-so we are roomies!? Yaaaaay!\", Your arms wrap around her as you rubbed against her/ Your flat chest rubbing up against one another as she pushes you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a huffed \"Oh...\", her face red from embarrassment of what you just did as she unlocks the door to the dorm room. You wander in after her as you look about the somewhat messy abode. Some clothes and empty bags littered the couch with various instant products lining the kitchen counter with a sink full of dishes. Her eye gazed at your bags before she picked it up and tossed it to the hallway. She then turned to you, chest puffed as she announced \"Alright, I am leader since I was here first and am the toughest one out of both of us! Now, Bow befo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly kneel into a proper bow before she finishes, causing her to blush in embaressment with a goofy smile 'Y-yeah... Like that... Kn-know your place to the Vampire. Now, Uhh... Who are you and what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm (Name) and a....\" </span></div></div>",

But your a Vampire, An actual monster! Do you got the fangs? I noticed some weirdo's today, But... Your a real Vampire!\" Your body shook in place as you squee'd slightly to her embarrassed discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa sighed as she looked away 'A-Anyway. Get settled in and uhhh... As my lesser, Clean this place up. I have a club meeting to attend to a-and deal with some things.' She quickly turned and hopped away, her bat companion following as you saluted back to her. Your hands reaching up and grabbing some of the loose refuse that littered the place and gulped it into your body. Ready to give Kokoa-sempai a treat. Perhaps more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Girl yawned as she walked into a dark stairwell, stretching her arms up as something splattered to the ground infront of her. Looking up, she could barely scream as something overcame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokoa opened the door again, blinking as everything looked... Different. The whole place was tidy, clothes were gone and all the food packages and cans were no longer there. She slowly mouthed a 'Wow...' as she wandered in and proceeded to kick her shoes off and flop on the couch. You quickly walk over, belly jiggling slightly as you kneel to Mistress Kokoa. The girl blinks before giggling \"Heh, Seems someone put on some weight. I hope you didn't eat all my food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beam back with \"No, Just the garbage....\" Your hands reaching for her socks \"May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, The pigtailed girl grins as she proceeds to pull off her socks and wiggle her toes in your face as she grinned \"Only if you lick them first... Slave~\" Her feet continue to wiggle teasingly, smelling tantalizingly sour from the being stuck in a shoe all day.You happily nod as your tongue stretches to lash against the bare sole. Her face puffs as she tries to suppress a giggle as you continue to lick the stinky sole. A small moan escaped as she leaned her head back, as you slowly bring her feet into your body. Your frame slimming as your body gives her feet a relaxing mud bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly draw the feet out of her body to give another lick, your body back to normal as Kokoa looked over and stared in shock. Her once petite feet were now enormous, clearly slightly above a foot and a half. She stared as she wiggled her engorged feet as you continue to lick and rub them, Muttering 'I have the power to change the body of those... willing... So I can... change you if you want...\" The vampire could only stare in shock before muttering in... </span></div></div>",
