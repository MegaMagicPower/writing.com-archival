The two of you had a love/hate relationship and today was one of the days that you'd gotten on his nerves, and he on yours. So you sat in silence, not even looking over at the redneck beside you until he began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moon's bright,\" he pointed out and you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, it mind as well be daytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're being a little dramatic.\" Daryl look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd ya call me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dramatic,\" you repeated, not bothering to look his way. He huffed and looked back across the field, pushing himself standing. You glanced at him out of the corner of your eye. \"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sunshine,\" he answered gruffly, \"I'll be right back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes as he walked away and you enjoyed the still of the silence until his shoes could be heard against the rungs of the ladder. You sighed as he appeared in the tower again, holding Rick's handcuffs in his hand. You frowned as he walked to you and crouched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you have those for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time ya learned not ta call people names,\" was all he said as he slapped a cuff on your wrist, yanked it back against the railing and pulled your other hand up beside it so he could cuff them together. your arms were stuck above your head when he released you and you yanked down, trying to get free. you glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go.\" He shook his head, taking a seat in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until ya learn ta watch yer mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped when Daryl's hands shout out towards your...</span></div></div>",

You gasped and clamped your mouth shut, refusing to give him the reaction he wanted as he smirked at you. He dragged a finger up from your heel to the base of your toes and a giggle escaped your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that I hear?\" he said, \"was that a laugh?\" You shook your head as your cheeks turned red, partly from embarrassment and partly from holding your laughter in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.
