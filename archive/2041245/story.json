Since Hamilcar made Hannibal swear the oath, it was all the general could think of. \"Look at it, brothers! The city is ours for the taking!!\" Hannibal's brothers looked at each other. Though Hannibal Barca was the most brilliant military tactician ever produced by the city of Carthage; their sister had a tendency to get ahead of herself. Hannibal shook her head. \"Hanno, I want you to take Maharbal and Himilcar and win over Beneventum to our cause! Mago, I want you and Hasdrubal to head for Hispania! Once Rome is taken, everything changes. We can finally build a better World!\" she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dream, sister!\" giggled Mago. Hannibal turned her grey eyes on her brother, who shrank from her. Hannibal Barca, the eldest of Hamilcar Barca's children, possessed vast magical powers. She even had a younger brother, who bore the same name, living as a wealthy merchant in Libyssa. Hannibal decided once Rome was taken, she would obliterate the Hundred and Four and transform the new Republic into one of direct election by men and by women. She was tall, standing over 5 cubitus in height. Waiting in her tent was Claudia Marcella, who was the daughter of a former consul of Rome. Marcella had been taken a year earlier and was already expecting a daughter who would be named Sophonisba. She would be named after Hasdrubal Gisco's daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you want to see what I dream?\" threatened Hannibal. Her little brother shook his head in fear. \"Then GO!\" she commanded. Her brothers moved with speed. Hannibal could see the walls of the ancient city. Soon it would be hers. \"TO WAR!\" she cried as her men roared her name. It was hard to describe the carnage as yet another legionis fell to Hannibal. She used her powers to strike down a section of the wall. The Romans in their haste sent down a few thousand half trained children who fell prey to the old trap. Gauls attacked from behind their dirt covers as once again, Hannibal's power had triumphed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Roman in his late fifties was thrown before Hannibal's feet. \"Publius Furius Philus, former consul and current praetor; isn't it?\" smirked Hannibal. The Roman's attempt to spit stopped midair and hit him in the left eye. \"Goodbye, Consul Philus!\" she declared, grabbing him by the neck and violently twisted off his head. His blood gushed like a fountain from his neck, before falling to the ground. \"Rome trembles as we advance!\" she declared. Hannibal focused her magic as more of the wall crumbled. Her men chanted her name in all the languages they spoke. Rome would soon fall. Womenkind would, at last, have a hero change their lives! She communicated with Claudia \"Soon my love, the women of Rome will be not different to the men. And our daughter will live in a world, where she can be consul or suffete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt elated at her wife's response. Sophonisba Barca-Marcella would be a force to reckon with. And Rome's hatred of women would be repaid in blood. She could hear the terror of the Romans as they scrambled for cover. Soon Rome itself would be hers. And the Senate of Rome would be consigned to history after she spread their heads across the city. She heard the sounds before he came. His army was filled with demons, false witches, humans of vast power and Nephilim. She used her magic to send Marcella to safety. She closed her eyes and Hannibal her little brother was with his army. She sent her knowledge to him and erased her brother's knowledge of her. Now she and her remaining army of 5,000 would fight the Consul. She destroyed her enemies with ease, slicing and cutting her way until she found him. \"Consul! Now you shall die!\" she cried.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>July 7, 481 CE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost 500 years ago, the Roman army lost 20,000 men here. An army of almost unprecedented size had gathered here. Caesar Marjorianus looked across at the rival army. Odoacer, the giant Goth woman who acted like a man, had gathered an army of close to half a million. That said that Hannibal Barca, the accursed Carthaginian had been the ancestor of Odoacer. Though it was doubtful. They said that she was a witch of unbridled power. She had an army of Goths, Suevi, Burgundians, Vandals and an assortment of other barbarians. She was dressed in armour that looks forged into Magna Grecia rather than Gothic. Caesar could see why that cowardly Greek Zeno had chosen her to try to take back the West.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarjorianus had taken Africa and Egypt back from Geiseric, the Vandal King. Marjorianus had defeated the Franks when they tried to rebel against his reign. Childeric was even now fighting with Odoacer, even though they loathed each other. Marjorianus had taken 34 years to get to this point. He had watched his wife, his sons and most of heirs die. Fought against his treacherous friend Ricimer. At his home, his grandson Flavius Marjorianus Malleolus was only 5 years old. He was the sole survivor left to inherit the Empire. Caesar knew that his death here would end the Empire. Britannia and Dacia were still outside the true Empire's reach. Even the Greek's Empire was fragile in the utmost. The Parthians under the rule of the heirs of Sasan had grown great at Zenos' expense. Once this was over, Marjorianus would make war on Zeno and destroy him. He would reunite the ancient Empire. The Lord and Saviour had chosen him to rule. He could not fail in his holy mission. Not when victory was so close at hand. And he would not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything hinged on this day. Marjorianus threatened to bring back the threat of Rome. Odoacer held her amulet close to her. She stood tall almost 7 feet in height. The Romans were naught but midgets by comparison. She had three daughters, Thela; Sunigilda after her wife and Onoulpha after her sister. She had given her daughters instructions to take male form if she failed. They couldn't risk the line of Hannibal Barca to fail. Odoacer took stock of her so called allies. The Vandals were led by Gunthamund; grandson of the great Geiseric. His worthless uncle Huneric and his young cousin Hilderic were both deceased. Gunthamund was not a strong ruler and was prone to shaking. But he was better than his shameful Thrasamund, an exceedingly lazy womaniser. Thrasamund was living amongst the Ostrogoths who were notable for their non-appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodoric the Ostrogoth refused to help either side. Even though he served Zeno. When it was over, Odoacer would slay Zeno and Theodoric herself. Euric was an incompetent drunk, more interesting in wine than fighting. The Burgundian brothers seemed more interested in one upping themselves than defeating Rome. The late King of Burgundy Gondioc would be delighted by his son's arrogant and weak conduct. The Suevi Theodemundus was interesting. He was disciplined, focused and determined to win. He was the one, Odoacer trusted the most. Sadly his army was the smallest. His leadership was contested, following the invasion by Marjorianus. Pity for he was more trust worthy than the other idiots. A burp let her known that Euric was awake, though he could barely stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her amulet close as she cast her spell. The lightning and thunder hit near the Roman lines. Marjorianus didn't move. It was time to advance. Odoacer moved her metal staff like a sword as she swung it with fury. Heads flew and the ground shook as she moved on. A young Roman soldier tried to fight her himself. Odoacer sent his broken body back into the Roman centre. She thought of her beautiful daughters forced to live their lives as men. She thought of the love of her life being killed after being violated. It spurred her on as she marched on. Fire flew into her eyes as she deflected arrows with her staff. A quick motion and the eye of a centurion was lost as he fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick deflection before the sweep of her weapon left 3 Roman families without a loved one. Marjorianus's army was powerful, but she had her magic. And none of the Romans could stop her. She advanced deep into the centre a trail of armies behind her. Up ahead was Rome's last hope. Caesar Marjorianus was slaying men in his horse. That would end now as a spell was cast. Lightning failed to strike him though. \"Look up in the sky!\" cried Euric. Odoacer sighed as she saw the familiar figure. \"Destroy the Anti-Cbrist!\" she declared as she saw the Consul's hateful face as his army descended from the sky.</span></div></div>",

She turned to her beautiful women. Sara and Brianna were changing into their skirts and tops. Antonia couldn't help but wolf-whistle. Both girls turned and rolled their eyes at her. It made Antonia giggle. She still remembered when they entered her lives. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1872490-The-Evil-Hypnotist/map/14\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had selected three beautiful girls as the recipients over her once shameful attention. But none had consented to come with her. After storming out angrily, she noticed Brianna, waiting for her car. After a refusal, she removed her handy pocketwatch. Brianna shook slightly, appearing gazed. \"Are you ok, Ma'am?\" Antonia asked. 'I...I'm f-fine, lady!\" she managed to stammer. Antonia flashed a wide smile as Brianna was succumbing, unable to fight the power of the hypnotic watch, swaying back and forth. Antonia knew she had to wait patiently. She watched Brianna,  fascinated as her will slowly faded. Brianna was a stubborn woman. Her eyes tried to avoid falling, she constantly fought sleep. \"Submit.\" whispered Antonia. \"I submit!\" she replied, her eyes closed. Antonia smiled, thanking her lucky stars that she was born of the superior gender, so no-one would suspect what she planned next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe declared \"You will do as I command, my Brianna!\" \"I will do as you command!\" she replied, her voice wooden and monotone. A multitude of personalities flashed through the hypnotist's mind, each one adult. \"Come to me!\" she commanded. Brianna obeyed instantly, standing before Antonia in all her beauty. \"When were you born?\" Antonia tested. \"1st November, 1989!\" she answers Antonia, her voice hollow and without emotion. \"What is your sexual orientation?\" she interrogated her further. She hoped she would get the desired response. \"Whatever you say it is!\" is the reply that Antonia received. She fought to keep from leaping for joy. \"You will call me, my beloved Mistress!\" ordered Tony imperiously. \"Yes, my beloved Mistress!\" Brianna responded. Tony ran her fingers through Brianna's hair. Antonia noticed that her new slave's body was reacting to her touch, even though Brianna remained still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonia decided to drive Bryanna to watch the film the Dark Knight. With all the audience focused on the film, no-one would notice them. There is no queue as the hypnotist approached the ticket booth. She was stunned and delighted as she saw who the cashier was. \"Miss Mesmer, what a surprise!\" exclaimed Sara. She couldn't believe her luck, no wonder Sara didn't stay back, she had to get to her job. Antonia took out $50 and her lucky coin. \"Here you go!\" she declared, shining the coin in Sara's eyes. The cashier smiled as she put away the money, but her focus remained on the coin. She was barely able to get the notes into the register. She tries to give Antonia changed, but the hypnotist refused. \"After all I am spending time with two beautiful, SWEET GIRLS. I SHOULD be the one paying for everything. And I should thank my lucky stars that I chose to SUBMIT TO MY DESIRE to see this film!\" she stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonia watched as Sara's eyes diluted. She would almost appear stoned to anyone else. Antonia knew this submission was as successful as the other. \"Come to me!\" she ordered. Sara leaves her station and stands before both women. Antonia swung her watch, moving it back and forth. \"Brianna and Sara, you belong to me!\" she commanded. Both girls' eyes slid in and out of focus before they replied \"We belong to you!\" A large grin came across Antonia's face, as she wrapped her arms around them. She noticed another girl cleaning up. She approached her, offering her $140 to cover Sara's shift. She agreed willingly. Antonia briefly debated whether to bring this new girl under as well, but disregarded it. After all, Antonia had 2 of the sexiest girls she had ever seen. What use would there be to take another? They entered the theatre, taking their seats at the back. There are not as many as Antonia expected and there are plenty of seats for the three girls. Antonia took her girls to three seat near the back. She whispered to the girls</span></div></div>",

A tiny blonde stepped off the plane, a taller blonde's arm around her waist. \"Cancun...land of joy for the inferiors!\" sneered the tiny blonde. \"Yay! Can't wait to surf!\" came a young woman, behind her. \"I think it's nice. Don't you, Eve?\" asked a fourth girl, which long brown hair. \"Anything you like, I like, Jackie!\" agreed another tiny blonde. \"We are not on Holidays, girls! We need to meet up with the others. The transformations will have begun.\" Stated the taller blonde. Erin Jade Grant said nothing more to her original comment as they walked off into the airport. \"AHHHH!\" cried the man. \"Keep your filthy hands off my soul mate!\" snapped the little blonde. The tall giant of a man cried and whimpered as the little blonde, Erin Jade Grant squeezed his fingers further. \"Is everything ok, Miss?\" asked a shaking security guard. Erin glared at the man, who backed away from her eyes, slowly going red. \"This inferior tried to grab my beloved Chelsea's buttocks! So I am breaking his hand in response. Please allow me to do this!\" she snarled. The tall blonde kissed her tiny girlfriend on the lips and whispered something. Erin released him as the quintet moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin heard the click before the others as a bullet rammed into another security guard. The shocked man was tackled to the ground. His broken right hand slamming against the tiled floor making him scream louder. Erin grinned her most malevolent grin as she, her girlfriend, her twin Eve Rina, Eve's girlfriend Jackie and their 19 year old friend Alana Taylor hopped into the taxi. Erin was thrilled to see their driver was female. \"Pleasure Resort, please!\" requested Erin as she and Chelsea moved to the front row. Chelsea ran her hands through Erin's hair as the little blonde cooed on her shoulder. \"Are you ok, little princess?\" asked Chelsea. \"I'm not the one whose b** was almost grabbed by some dirty inferior, my darling! At least not this time.\" she expressed. Chelsea kissed her neck, before resuming her stroking. She knew what Erin was thinking. She hated Sebastian even more as Erin's large ruby ring shone. Her rape survivor ring. \"I'm safe, darling! And I am ok. We are both ok!\" she expressed. \"There are so many inferiors! We still have 6 years till Rio! How much more pain; will they inflict on the superior gender by then?\" \"We will avenge them all, my sweet Erin! All of them!\" replied Chelsea.</span></div></div>",

There was his closest friend Jordan Tranh, who was like his brother. A tall man of around 185 cms, he was dark haired, brown eyed and never failed to get the ladies attention. Despite that, he had dated Tracey Wilkins for years before they broke up. Jordan didn't say why, he just turned his attention ear where. Aaron's ex Nancy Porter had also made him a free agent, saying that she wanted to be friends instead. She insisted that there wasn't another guy, she just wasn't interested anymore. Then there were the womanisers Tony Melville, a college basketball player studying engineering and Nick Rogers, typical rich kid (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1691142-Spring-Break-TG/map/11\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick flexed his muscles, eyeing the girls. He wasn't a giant like Tony, but he was the strongest of the guys, spending far more time at the gym than at class. He used his grandfather's extensive trust fund to get what he wanted. His father had been able to restrict him recently. Nick still had 10K USD to splurge. Toni and Aaron both worked as dual waiters and busboys at the Rose Cafe. Despite their hard work, they were solid B students. This vacation was earned through very hard work. \"I heard Erin Grant is coming to Cancun with her girlfriend Chelsea!\" declared Jordan. \"Oh man, I can't stand her! Her brother Aaron Jacob Grant was way cooler! Wasn't he dating two girls at once?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both girls ended up dating his sisters Erin and Eve.\" pointed out Toni. \"All 4 are super hot chicks. Wouldn't you like to get involved in that 5-way?\" suggested Nick, his grin wide. \"I would be happy with one sweet blonde.\" added Jordan. Jordan was the smartest of the guys in his second year as a dual major of biochemistry and Chemical physics. His best subjects were Genetics; Microbiology &amp; Immunology and Cell Structure &amp; Function with the same lecturer Dr Erik Jacks. \"Whoa, check out those two!\" remarked Nick, staring at two Brazilians girls. \"Guys, I think I might get some sleep! Tomorrow, I'll join you guys and hit the beaches!\" stated a jet lagged Aaron. \"Whatever!\" remarked Nick and Tony. \"Do you want me to stay back with you, man?\" offered Jordan. \"It's cool man, have fun!\" exclaimed Aaron as he headed to bed.</span></div></div>",

My wife and I would be thrilled to hear it from your point of view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her leave, gathering your strength. Lauren Scott was the hottest girl in school. Rich, smart and single; it was clear that you were smitten. The prom was 7 weeks away, but you wanted her. You wait until she's alone before you make your move. \"Uh, Lauren! Lauren!\" you called out. Lauren turns to you. \"Hi, um...Jason, right?\" \"It's Jacob, actually!\" you reply, nervously. \"Oh yeah, Jacob Miller. What do you want, Jacob?\" she replied. \"Um...listen uh...\" you stammer. You can't find your voice as to what you want. \"Here, take this!\" she said, offering a drink. \"Thanks!\" you reply, taking but not drinking. \"Do you want to go out for coffee now? Or should we go to your place or mine?\" she offers, stunning you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to process this before you You took a moment to process this before you sipped the soft drink for a bit of courage. \"Your place sounds fine!\" you replied, before frowning. Your voice sounded different. She beamed at you and took your hand. Your hand seemed unusually slender and soft. Nevertheless you ignored it as she asked you what you thought about Arrow. \"I love Arrow, it\u2019s an awesome show!\" you reply. \"I think Shado and Felicity are awesome! Do you like them too?\" \"Oh my God, I love them! They are totally awesome! And I like think that Huntress is pretty cool and so is Thea! Not Laurel though, hot but useless!\" you respond, surprised at how high your voice was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok? You sound thirsty!\" she suggests as she pointed to her car. \"Yeah, I think I'll drink some more of that nice soft drink and junk!\" you exclaim, slightly confused why you are talking like and sound like a Valley girl. She helps you into the car, which is even stranger. But you shrug and drink some more of the fizzy beverage. You giggle as the bubbles tickle your tummy. You feel this is even more bizarre as you sound even higher and girly. You finish drinking the contents of the drink, smacking your lips. \"You enjoyed that, did you sweetie?\" asked Lauren. You feel so thrilled, that things were going so well. \"Um, Lauren; I was like totally wondering, if like...\" you struggled to focus your thoughts on what you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reach into the glove box and there are some more drinks for you!\" offered Lauren. You eagerly took her up on her offer and began guzzling down the drinks. You find yourself stopping at the gates of a large mansion. Lauren pressed a button and the gates opened. \"My uncle bought this house for my parents, so that my sisters and I would have somewhere to live. Without him, my parents wouldn't have a large company and they wouldn't be spending the next 61 days in the Bahamas!\" stated Lauren. You nod, burping accidentally. You turn red and apologise but she tells you, it\u2019s ok and kisses you gently on the lips. You feel such elation. You are certain now she will go with you to the prom. She stops to smile at you. \u201cLet me let you out!\u201d she stated. You nod, again surprised by how she was acting. Nevertheless she steps out and opens the door, surprising you by picking you up and walking you to the door. \u201cWow, you are totally strong!\u201d you gasp. \u201cI know!\u201d she said, opening the door. She looks like Lindsay Lohan when she was a sexy teenager but she is taller. She opens the door and takes you to the living room.<br>\r\n\u2003<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get you a coke!\u201d she offers you. You agree and she rushes off to get you some. You tap on the table, surprised at the noise its\u2019 making. Are your nails longer? They can\u2019t be except they seemed to be. She returns quickly with a box of coke. \u201cHere!\u201d she exclaims, handing you one. You decide to drink the coca cola. It feels very refreshing and tastier than normal. You drink it down heartily. \"Wow! That tasted great!\" you remark. \"You want some more?\" she suggests, gently. You agree vehemently and it's not long before you have had at least 25 vials of the stuff. You look down at the vials you drank and giggle somewhat embarrassed. It was upon hearing your own giggle again, that it dawns on you that you really do sound different. \"Do I sound different?\" you squeal, before you realise that your voice has certainly been altered. Lauren beams at you. \"You look sexier too!\" You look down and you almost fall down. You have two very large barriers, preventing you from seeing your belly. With a great deal of trepidation, you reach between your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scream would have pierced the iciest heart. You feel nothing but soft, delicious flesh. Flesh you know you didn\u2019t have before. The long fingernails are legitimate. You realise that you are much shorter, which explains how she was able to carry you. \"I guess you feel different too?\" she quips, giggling at you. You stammer before looking down at the vials. She nods at you. \"I guess someone is going to be spending some time with her feminine side after all!\" You shake your head, glaring at her angrily. \"Turn me back!\" you demand. \"Do you have ID?\" she asked. You look at her as if she's crazy. \"What does that have to do with anything?\" you roar in reply. \"Well without ID, you could be some crazy person claiming to be a guy! Or worse, you may have hurt or kill that guy like in the film Switch! Or you can stay here with me while my parents are in the Bahamas for the next 2 months and as my sexy girlfriend...well we will let your imagination fill in the blanks!\" she proposed. You respond by \"Oh my God! What...what happened to me?\" you cry. She beams at you and hands you a mirror. You tremble before looking into the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a girl! I freaking look like Tila Tequila!\" you scream angrily. \"I know! I used her DNA when I saw her at a sex expo! Look here's the deal, Mattie! For the next 75 days, you are a girl! You are a Canadian exchange student and your parents have been told that you are on an exchange program. I have forged results so that you will be getting scores between A plus and A minus during your absence as well as a fake school, phone number and everything required to fool your parents. On the meantime, you will spend the next 2 months or 61 days living with me! Now decide quickly, either you accept or leaving my house, homeless girl!\" she threatens. You decide to accept her offer and become Lauren's new girlfriend. \"So since you are taking me to prom, we only have 6 weeks; so we have to starts practising. First, you will agree to wear whatever I tell you. I have a large wardrobe and clothes for a beautiful, tiny girl like yourself with such large assets in my room. Second, you will learn how to behave like a modern girl, both in speech and in conduct. If you behave yourself, you will get exactly what you expect. If not...well better you don't find out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to know what that is, so you agree. \"I have two older sisters, my cool, older sister Miranda is out and proud financial consultant. The younger one is a lying, backstabbing bisexual bitch who claims to be straight but isn't (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>)! My uncle Tim is a lawyer; while my father Sam works in the fashion industry. What he does is none of your concern. My mother Kelly is a professional CEO. I am telling you this because for the next 2 months, you are my girlfriend Mattie! How much you get out of depends on how you behave!\" she reveals. You nod, comforting yourself that at least you will get something from your hopeless crush on this sexy sadist. A phone rings interrupting your thoughts. \"Scott Residence, Lauren responding; how may I assist your call?\" A cold grin appeared on Lauren's face, scaring you a little. \"Sorry sis....Daddy isn't here! Good luck!\" she declares, slamming the phone down hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you. Lauren finally explains her intent to you \"Well I bet you wonder why I decided to trick you in turning into a girl. Like you probably already know by now that I am a lesbian, unfortunately my parents are homophobic jerks. They would disinherit me if they find out like they did my eldest sister Miranda. So you are the best substitute for a real girlfriend. So now you to have to decide right now, you can either stay and be my girlfriend, you can leave now and try to find another girl that wants to be together with you, but based on your current appearance, I highly doubt that any straight girl wants to have something to do with you. And there aren't many lesbian or bisexual girls around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't talking about two months....you are talking permanently!\" you gasp. \"No, I am saying that you pick me up as a guy, drink the vial, and spend some girl on girl time with me. Then you will transform back and drop me off. I can give you just enough to turn you. The 25 vials you drank will last 3 days each. My parents come back in 61! So that's another 2 weeks as a girl, unless I give you the antidote. So if you agree...\" She paused, taking something out of her backpack. She hands it to you, smirking. You read it and feel ill. The contract makes it mandatory for you to agree to the transformations at her pleasure until you turn 21. For the next 3 years, you are at her mercy. \"If you refuse...then get out of my house! And then enjoy life as a homeless girl for 75 days!\" she taunts you. You wail...before signing the document. She beams and kisses you tenderly. You focus on how nice the kissing feels rather than the fact you are at Lauren's mercy for the next 3 years. \"Okay baby, we are going to watch some TV! Then we finish our homework. I have clothes for you to wear. Tomorrow, we begin your training. You will learn makeup, fashion and how to please me! So let's go watch Arrow! I love Jessica De Gouw, Emily Bett Rickards, Willa Holland and that sexy Celina Jade/Horan!\" she declares. \"How did you handle that?\" giggled Miko.</span></div></div>",

You cooed as she pressed her lips to your neck. Unfortunately there was a knock on the door. \"Sorry Mattie, we got to answer the door!\" \"Do we have to?\" you moan. She beamed at you. \"Maybe we should dispense with this contract and you should just agree to be female forever?\" she mused. Your eyes widened at that musing and Lauren giggled again. \"Let's go!\" she declared, lifting you into her arms and running towards the door. A tall man resembling Charles Dance from Game of Throne is at the door. His eyes are grey and his expression is icy. \"And who is this?\" indicates the tall, cold man. \"Uncle Larry, don't be mean!\" giggled Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry breaks out with a big smile. \"And what is your name?\" he asked you, politely. \"This is my girlfriend Mattie!\" introduced Lauren. Larry watches you intently for a moment as you offered your hand before shaking it. \"And what is his real name?\" he asks. \"What do you mean?\" asks Lauren, nervously. Larry rolls his eyes. \"Can I come in?\" he enquires. \"Of course, Uncle!\" she answers. He entered the house, looking around. \"I assume that you two are the only ones here as your sister Skye is on vacation.\" Lauren frowns at that. \"So you turned this boy into a girl, did you?\" he interrogates Lauren, his voice less pleasant. \"He likes me and I liked her this way!\" she protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, young man?\" he asks you. \"I wanted her to go with me to prom. We are now going to prom, but she turned me into a girl! I really like her...I don't know if I will handle all these changes, but there is no way back. I signed a contract!\" you explained. \"I doubt the contract would hold up in a court of law! Lauren, this is not a nice way to get a girlfriend!\" commented Larry. \"But Uncle Larry, she is such a nice girl! But I don't feel any attraction to her as a boy! But as a girl, she makes me really happy! And since I have to live in the closet, don't I deserve a little happiness? I have guaranteed her straight As; she won't suffer academically!

Larry frowned at her declaration. \"When were you born?\" You answered him and he nodded. \"I will have documents prepared that Mattie Johnson is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. I will leave you both to your teenage love affair. But Lauren remember that \"Mattie\" is a human being, who should choose whether to be a man or a woman. Forcing him will not work, your older sister was able to win over her lover that way!\" he revealed, before heading to the door. \"Missy was a man?\" gasped Lauren, but her uncle was already gone. \"Wow! Um...Mattie...you do want to stay a girl and be my girlfriend, don't you?\" she enquired timidly. You honestly weren't sure what you wanted long-term, but you nod.

Nikki shook her before pulling both tiny women into a hug. \"It's nice to see you too, Mayor Vicario. And you, Ms Vicario! I have news, Sylvia Mary Mathews Burwell has been chosen to succeed John Kerry as Secretary of State. Once Obama's term ends, Vice President Hillary Clinton is certain to win!\" declared Nikki. Esmeralda beamed. \"That is good news, Nicole! And as I have said before, I am Esmeralda and she is Miko!\" responded Esmeralda. \"Tell us how you became a superior being!\" requested Miko. Nikki blushed and nodded. \"Okay, but from third person perspective only. It's a little embarrassing to talk about my past as a worthless inferior!\" admitted Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was excited to spend Spring Break in Cancun. The surf, the sun...the bikini clad babes. He was barely able to restrain himself from wolf whistling the sexy girls as they passed by. His eldest sister Sharon was bringing five of her closest friends with them. His sister opened their hotel room as he fell on the large King size bed. \"Hey, lazy! Get up and unpack!\" she responded. \"Later, I am having a nap! Then I'll be ready to pick up babes!\" he replied. \"God, you are such a tryhard!\" she retorted, unpacking her suitcase. She took out something and went to the bathroom. Nick just closed his eyes and entered slumber land. Strange dreams haunted him. That he looked like Jayma Mays from Glee and Heroes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1207.photobucket.com/albums/bb48...\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1207.photobucket.com/albums/bb48...</a> ). His lips were pressed against a big chested girl who resembled Caity Loitz (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/default/files/imce/2013/12-DEC/Canary6_529d57c0eacc59.93232812.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.dcentertainment.com/sites/d...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had their hands inside each other's bottoms. \"I love you, sexy girl!\" the Arrow star girl stated. He awoke with a start. He looked around before remembering he was on Spring Break. Sharon hadn't come back, so he yawned, turning on the tv. After checking each channel and realising nothing was on, he reached into his suitcase to get some trunks to impress some babes with his abs and thighs. He opened it and gasped. This was a girl's suitcase. He turned to his sister's bed, noticing that it was definitely hers. He had picked up a girls' suitcase by mistake at the airport. He rifled through the clothes, looking for something, anything he could use to identify the owner. After a quick search, he identified that whoever she was, she didn't bring much. A tiny pink bikini, a yellow sundress, a pink shorts, denim jeans and a skimpy one piece swimsuit. \"Whoever this belongs to, must be a really hottie!\" he thought to himself. He starting blinking as he felt a little dizzy. \"I think I need to clear my head!\" he thought, heading to the bathroom. 15 minutes later, he put on towel and shook. \"Wow, that's some towel!\" he exclaimed, before gasping. \"What the hell is wrong with my voice?\" he thought. He looked into the mirror and screamed, dropping the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shook his head and checked again. He was a Jayma Mays look-alike, just like he had been in the dream. She paused to debate what to do. Her clothes were too big to wear. She reached for her boxers, but they fell off when she put them on. Annoyed, she decided to wear some of the girls' clothes. The girl had barely packed anything. She discounted the one piece, sundress and shorts. To her disgust, she decided to wear the extremely revealing bikini as bra and underwear. The top chaffed her nipples, making her gasp. \"Damn, this feels freaky! Ah, this is hard!\" she squealed, adjusting the top. \"Why do girls wear these?\" she asked as she tried to keep the bottoms on place, but they kept riding up. She managed to get into the very tight jeans, gasping as she zipped up. She felt the front of her bottoms move as she put on the sandals. The tank top cut off just below her chest. \"Crap, I've got huge jugs! And I've got a wedgie! What the hell am I going to tell Sharon? She's not going to believe me! Ok, I've got to remain calm! I'm a chick now, I have no ID....\" A ringing interrupted her discourse. She looked for the source of the ringing before realising it was in her back jean's pocket. She reached inside and picked up a smart phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi?\" \"Skye, its Scott! I am waiting for you in the lobby! I can't wait to see you in that tiny bikini! See you, babe!\" answered the voice. The voice hung up before Nick could answer. \"Oh man! What am I going to do?\" squealed Nick. \"Okay, I need to make a decision! I can't stay here because Sharon won't realise I'm me! I can't go to her friends for the same reasons and this girl Skye has no ID! I guess I have to go meet that guy! Oh man, that's going to suck so hard! And I must be going nuts, because I'm talking to myself!\" Nick cried. Nevertheless she got up, put the sundress, one piece and shorts back into Skye's suitcase. She wished she had some way to convince Sharon or at least let her know anything, but there was no paper for her to write anything down. So with a heavy heart, she left her male clothes behind and made her way to the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf whistles and cat calls that followed her, made her mad. But she didn't dare do anything, lest she wind up before a police station. And she would be unable to explain anything. Worse, she didn't know if she was strong enough to do anything more than walk away. She hated feeling so helpless. She finally reached the lobby, where a tall, muscular guy called her over. He looked about 21 and he could be a footballer based on his size. Nick restrained the terror in her new body as she approached the guy called Scott. \"Skye, you look so hot!\" declared Scott, running over to give her a hug. Nick forced herself from recoiling, after all she needed Scott's help. \"So, how about we go to a restaurant, my treat? After we can enjoy our room, together!\" he whispered, taking her suitcase in his hand. Nick thought she might be sick, so she nodded in reply. The resort's local restaurant wasn't far from the lobby and Scott insisted on having his arm around Nick's waist the whole time. It was weird, not least because Scott had very soft hands for such a big guy. After what felt like an eternity, Scott helped her into her chair, beaming at her the whole time. \"God, you're beautiful, I can't wait till we are in our room together!\" he declared. Nick thought she could wait forever for such a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Skye, what would you like to order? I am leaning towards the vegetarian quiche with string beans, carrots and cauliflower a la vinaigrette!\" enquired Scott. All Nick could think about was extending this as long as possible, so she took her time going through the menu. Scott took her left hand, stroking and caressing it. Nick began to feel weird, Scott had such soft, effeminate hands. She felt herself start to get excited. She forced herself to remember that Scott was a guy not a girl. \"Do you remember when we first met? It was the first week of college and I dropped my books everywhere! I felt like such an idiot, but you were there to help me out! I can't believe it took me so long to ask you out! And today is our one year anniversary! I want to make it special, so I got this for you!\" he declared, taking something out of his pocket. Nick stiffened, terrified it was going to be a ring, but it was a long box. Half surprised at how it fit in Scott's pocket, Nick opened it to see a diamond bracelet. It looked very expensive and all Nick could stammer was \"Thanks!\" \"Let me put it on you!\" requested Scott. Nick could only nod as Scott attached it to her wrist. It fit perfectly and Nick felt her face redden. \"Oh, you are so wonderful, babe!\" exclaimed Scott. Nick blushed harder, angry at why he was acting this way. Eventually she decided on the same as Scott. Nick was surprised to learn that Scott liked all the things Nick did: Arrow, Marvel movies, tennis, basketball, soccer and that he had completed a degree in arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe talked a lot about his work as a cosmetician, saying that he could never have taken that job without Skye's assistance. Nick couldn't help but wonder whether Skye was trapped in his body or not. \"Excuse me, I was wondering if you could help me?\" asked a familiar voice behind Nick. Nick spun around to see a worried Sharon, her friend Hayley's arms wrapped around her waist. \"Yes, Miss?\" replied Scott. \"Have you seen my little brother Nick? He sort of vanished, taking his suitcase with him!\" she cried. \"Nick Tyler? Yeah, I saw him. He was with a friend of mine, Louise! Apparently he was going to spend the night with her. He had a green suitcase with him. I can't remember the room though!\" admitted Scott. Nick's eyes widened at that. Skye did have his body and she was using it to hook up with some girl! \"What's her last name?\" asked Sharon. \"Scott, I believe. Louise Scott!\" he answered. \"Thank you, sir! Come on, Hayley! Let's find my jerk baby brother and chew out that drop kick!\" she declared, angrily. \"That Nick is such a bad kid! Imagine putting his sister through that!\" stated Scott as he watched Sharon and Hayley leave. Nick forced herself not to respond. After all, Scott didn't know that Nick was not Skye, but the bad kid he mentioned. \"He is so lucky, I covered for him!\" added Scott. \"What do you mean?\" asked Nick. \"I saw him and Louise in the lobby. They were headed to Louise's room. Obviously I know what room that is! I just figured I would let the kid get laid! He looked like he needed it!\" grinned Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt his temper rise. Scott was mocking him and he had no right to act like such a jackass! Nick was about to let him have it when their food arrived. \"Dig n, sweetheart!\" beamed Scott. Nick forced herself to calm down and tasted the food. For rabbit food, it was tasty. It wasn't long before he and Scott had finished their meal. \"So babe, shall we celebrate our first year anniversary now?\" posed Scott, grinning wolfishly. Nick began to panic before replying... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nick tried to think of something, anything to get out of this. But it seemed like everything was happening in a whirlwind. Scott gleefully handed over his credit card to pay for dinner. Nick wished she could come up with an idea. But all she could think about was that she might be rammed by Scott when she gets to his room. Scott took back his credit card and grinned, squeezing Nick's hand. \"Why was his hand as soft as a girl's?\" Nick wondered. \"Is that what it feels like to a girl?\" Scott walked slowly it seemed to Nick as he appeared to enjoy what he thought was his girlfriend Skye's company. \"I have been thinking about us and I was hoping when we get home, you might think about spending some of your time at my place. Like a trial moving in?\" expressed Scott. \"Sounds great, Scott!\" Nick responded, faking her enthusiasm well. Scott seemed happy to hear that. The elevator was ahead of them. \"Our penthouse awaits, milady!\" declared Scott, theatrically. Nick nodded, though she was less pleased. \"Our penthouse of pleasure!\" added Scott, grabbing Nick and kissing her tenderly on the lips. Nick's eyes flew open. This couldn't be happening! Even weirder was that Scott's lips were as soft as her hands. And to Nick's horror, she found herself responding to the kiss, wrapping her arms around Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott broke the kiss with a wide grin. \"Here's our stop!\" he declared. Nick suddenly realise what had happened! She had kissed a guy! And even worse, she liked it. But the thought of sex was too horrible, still. She forced herself to think of something to say, but before she could state she was sick, Scott's tongue was massaging hers. \"Why does this feel so awesome? Oh God, please don't let this lead to sex!\" she thought as Scott lifted her to the bed. Nick felt the blanket caress her tight jeans and exposed back. She knew she was scared, but she wasn't expecting what came next. Scott burst with laughter. \"AHAHAHA! Your face!!!!HAHAHAHA!\" he roared. \"What's so funny?\" Nick squealed. \"This!\" revealed Scott, removing the skin from his face. Nick screamed before she started to grin. \"You're a girl!\" Nick exclaimed, happily. Relief flowed through her body. \"Yep!\" declared Scott, removing the rest of her get-up. Scott was the Caity Loitz lookalike from the dream. \"So if it's not clear, my name is Skye Louise Scott!\" affirmed Skye. \"Wait, you're Skye?\" gasped Nick. \"Yep! And you are, my sexy girl?\" \"I'm Nick, Nick Tyler!\" confirmed Nick. Skye giggled \"Didn't I tell your sister that you were a bad boy for spending the night with Louise? Did I lie? Well, you're not a boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happen?\" cried Nick. \"Perhaps, you shouldn't rummage through other people's things! At any rate, you are very hot! And since according to your ID...\" she paused to reveal that she had Nick's ID, which she had left in her suitcase \"You are 19, I think you are old enough to spend the night with me!\" \"Wait, aren't you going to turn me back?\" squealed Nick. \"Why would I do that? Even if I knew how! I'm bisexual, you are a hot girl, I got what I want!\" she declared. \"but....\" \"We either have a nice shower right now, sex or you can go back to your sister! But I suggest picking one of the first two options!\" suggested Skye. Nick stared at Skye before replying \"Ok, how about this offer? We will make love. We will then shower and sleep without our clothes in this bed. But before I do these things, I have a request!\" Skye giggled at Nick, before nodding. \"I like your offer. What is your request?\" she asked. \"I want to know how I became a girl!\" Nick demanded. \"Oh, that's simple! My homophobic parents own a fashion company and I am a cosmetician and photographer. As a professional makeup artist, I get expensive clothes that the models' reject. This way I was able money to go on this nice vacation. Recently, there has been a rise in transgender models. And to make sure, these ex-males appear more feminine, they are exposed to certain chemicals. These chemical alter them at a chromosomal level. It fixes the damage to the Y chromosome, reverting it back to an X. In other words, it turns boys into girls!\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you need that?\" asked a worried Nick. \"I don't. But the clothes I brought with me, came from those models. Besides I brought 3 pieces of luggage with me! You were unlucky enough to end up with the gender-bended suitcase. Assuming of course, I didn't do it, deliberately!\" she grinned, evilly. \"How can I go back?\" repeated Nick. \"Well, I suppose I can call our locum doctor. I think he has like 4 PHDs in biology, genetics, medicine and chemistry! Or I can call my genius, lesbian, little sister...except she and I don't get along. Besides, I am not sure whether what you were exposed to was temporary or permanent! If you were under 18, I would say you are screwed! But since you are 19, it might wear off! In the meantime, you can stay with me!\" offered Skye. Nick paused before nodding. \"I would love that!\" she replied. Skye beamed at her. \"Well then shall we start with love making?\" proposed Skye. \"How would you feel about starting with the shower? I feel a little dirty!\" admitted Nick. Skye grinned at that comment, making Nick blush furiously. \"Well then let me help you out of those jeans!\" she declared. Before Nick could respond, Skye undid the button of her jeans and pulled down the zipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my! Is my new girlfriend wearing a pink bikini?\" she teased. Nick turned scarlet and moaned a little as the jeans felt to her ankles. \"You are wearing the pink bikini! You are a sexy girl!\" she continued with her teasing. She moved it to the side and gently ran her tongue over the organ. Nick moaned loudly. \"Someone tastes nice! It's an interesting bikini. I am pretty sure that the longer you wear it, the less likely you can go back. But in case, I'm wrong; I think I will enjoy it now!\" she declared, dropping the bikini to the floor. She helped Nick out of her top and dropped to the floor, squeezing her globes as she drove her face into the girl's exposed reproductive region. \"OH MY GOD!\" screamed Nick as Skye continued to please her button, while caressing her peaches. Nick was so aroused by Skye's earlier actions that she quickly lost control. \"Wow, that was easy! Strip me and let's jump into the shower!\" proposed Skye. She removed Skye's clothes, leaping into her arms. The Jayma lookalike's tongue massaged the make-up artist's as all thoughts of fear left her. As they continued, they made their way to the shower, there was a ringing. \"Damn it!\" swore Skye as she put on a dressing gown. The ringing continued. \"Okay, I'm going!\" she shouted, handing Nick a dressing gown. Nick barely had time to put it on before Skye opened the door. \"What?\" demanded Skye. Sharon and her friend were taken aback before Sharon asked \"I'm looking for my brother Nick Tyler.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only Nick Tyler is my near nude girlfriend Nikki Tyler who unless your brother had a sex change, can't be him! Nikki babe, can you come here?\" she asked. Nick managed to walk over, her face bright red. Sharon's eyed widened as she recalled the earlier encounter. \"Does my lover resemble your brother?\" enquired Skye. Sharon shook her head. \"Sorry for the rudeness, but we are about to have shower sex and you interrupted us. Good luck finding your brother.\" apologised Skye. Nick turned even redder as Skye wrapped her right arm around her. \"Sorry to have interrupted you.\" replied Sharon. \"It's ok; your brother had a green suitcase, right?\" \"Yeah, that's right did you see him? Yeah, he was with some blonde girl.\" answered Skye. \"Louise Scott!\" stated Sharon. \"No, I am Skye Louise Scott and this is my girlfriend Nikki Tyler. You spoke to Scott the footballer, huh?\" \"You know him?\" \"I knew him intimately. He is dating Skye Tyler, who great resembles Nikki, possibly because they share the same parents and last name.\" observed Skye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I know you and your girlfriend are looking for him, but me and mine, just want to spend some private together. And when she looks like this...well you understand!\" teased Skye. Nick was positively tomato like, all this talk was so embarrassing. \"Well we will let you get what you were doing! Thanks again!\" declared Sharon as she took her friend and left. \"I guess you're not the only lesbian in your family! Well let's get back to our shower! Or would you prefer the bedroom? Or something else?\" she offered. Nikki blushed before saying that she wanted \u201cThe shower!\u201d \"Excellent choice!\" declared Skye who threw her dressing gown to the floor. Nikki soon lost hers as Skye lifted Nikki into the shower. \"Now let's get warm!\" she declared, turning on the warm water. Nikki moaned as Skye planted kisses across her neck. \u201cNow do you want to lose your virginity in the shower, bathroom or somewhere else?\u201d she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shower!\" \"Excellent choice!\" declared Skye who threw her dressing gown to the floor. Nikki soon lost hers as Skye lifted Nikki into the shower. \"Now let's get warm!\" she declared, turning on the warm water. Nikki moaned as Skye planted kisses across her neck.

The new girl gasped before moaning loudly as Skye began cleaning her most private place. \"Let's get some soap in there!\" she suggested as she massaged the area further with the cloth. Nikki began bucking as Skye continued her massage. </span></div></div>",

Nikki nodded, turning a little pink. \"I was frightening of what could happen. As it turned out....\" \"That sounds like a great idea, babe! Let's head to the beach after we go upstairs and change!\" Scott replied. Nick couldn't think of anything else to say. After all, she couldn't very well change in the lobby. And undressing in public? Out of the question. . \"Let's go!\" declared a happy Scott. Nick tried to think of something, anything to get out of this. But it seemed like everything was happening in a whirlwind. Scott gleefully handed over his credit card to pay for dinner. Nick wished she could come up with an idea. But all she could think about was that she might be rammed by Scott when she gets to his room. Scott took back his credit card and grinned, squeezing Nick's hand. \"Why was his hand as soft as a girl's?\" Nick wondered. \"Is that what it feels like to a girl?\" Scott walked slowly it seemed to Nick as he appeared to enjoy what he thought was his girlfriend Skye's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been thinking about us and I was hoping when we get home, you might think about spending some of your time at my place. Like a trial moving in?\" expressed Scott. \"Sounds great, Scott!\" Nick responded, faking her enthusiasm well. Scott seemed happy to hear that. The elevator was ahead of them. \"Our penthouse awaits, milady!\" declared Scott, theatrically. Nick nodded, though she was less pleased. \"Our penthouse of pleasure!\" added Scott, grabbing Nick and kissing her tenderly on the lips. Nick's eyes flew open. This couldn't be happening! Even weirder was that Scott's lips were as soft as her hands. And to Nick's horror, she found herself responding to the kiss, wrapping her arms around Scott. Scott broke the kiss with a wide grin. \"Here's our stop!\" he declared. Nick suddenly realise what had happened! She had kissed a guy! And even worse, she liked it. But the thought of sex was too horrible, still. She forced herself to think of something to say, but before she could state she was sick, Scott's tongue was massaging hers. \"Why does this feel so awesome?

When Consul Asinius and Caesar Roberto left the site (largely because of me), their works and those of others disappeared. This new interactive is based on no less than 50 interactive stories, both current and future. I am recreating this work as a new universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1) NO relationships romantic or otherwise are to be mention under 18.<br>\r\n2) This is based on an Alternative Universe. If you are into history or religion, you might want to try a different interactive<br>\r\n3) Relationships here are lesbian or bisexual female ONLY. Because this involves the belief that sexuality is psychological, not based on \"nature\" or \"societal norms\", men who become women are only bisexual here IF they were bisexual as men<br>\r\n4) No male homosexual sex (Sorry, I do support that, but not in this story)<br>\r\n5) Some characters are lesbian only, any attempt to 'fix' them will be DELETED<br>\r\n6) The only transformations allowed are gender (male to female) and body modification (improving women's bodies).
