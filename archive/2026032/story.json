Even for a dummy.\" Libby stated looking into the doll's creepy evil smile Kris shrugged \"Yeah but there's nothing to terrified of he's only a wooden dummy what harm could he do? Let's keep him in the attic next to Mr. Wood if you don't like him in here.\" \"Fine as long as he's far away from me as possible!\" Libby said as she picked up the doll carrying him into the crammed upstairs attic where dozens of old stuff they didn't use anymore including the other dummy Mr. Wood was stored Libby tossed Slappy into a nearby dusty old chair with a disgusted look she cried \"There now at least I won't be able to look at your ugly face anymore!\" As soon as she left back downstairs the other dummy Mr. Wood turned to the new doll and opened his mouth \"Hey you...\" He called from hanging on a high shelf Slappy glanced around wondering who spoke then he saw the figure \"What do you want?\" \"I noticed that you're new around here bud and sheesh three days of having you around and already they toss you away in the attic Kris and Libby must really be getting old to bother with us anymore what's your name pal?\" The dummy wondering whether to trust this guy spoke softly \"Slappy and yours?\" The other dummy cracked a sinister smile \"Mr. Wood Kris named me after well what I'm made of she used to use me a lot for her hobbies you know the kid was a pretty talented ventriloquist for a while at least until she and her sister got into makeup and boys and all that other stuff then they threw me up here and I have been rotting away to nothing ever since look at these deep cuts into my bark that stupid cat of theirs have been using me as a scratching post and then these darn mice chewing up my clothes all the time it's not fair I tell you!\" Slappy already sick of this place nodded his head quickly agreeing everything this guy said so far \"Tell me about it that girl Libby did you hear what she called me? Plain and simple ugly do I look ugly to you? If I had my way both of those brats would get what they deserve.\" Mr. Wood managed to climb off of the high shelf to his location \"I hear you bud so how about we give those kids a taste of their own medicine? Eh see how they like being lifeless wooden puppets for a few days or weeks.\" This was actually better than Slappy hoped he was just mainly used to harmless pranks and mischief this was raising the stakes a bit but what the heck he needed a good laugh so he stretched out his hand \"Fine by me Mr. Wood I'm in!\" \"Cool but how can we turn a couple of humans into stuffed dummies?\" Slappy grinned menacingly \"Leave that to me by this time tomorrow both of those mean little girls will be doing stand up routines at their school on puppet strings and both of us will be free to do as we please.\" Both shook hands and waited for the perfect moment to strike</span></div></div>",

Don't they realize eventually we'll both turn to sawdust in ten years or so....I wonder why they even bothered to buy us if they weren't going to do.....\" Mr. Wood shrugged \"I told you pal those girls don't care about a couple of dummies like us! A log would make a better pet I told you simply waiting for them isn't going to work we got to stoop down to their level if you know what I mean.\" As he hopped off of his stool and beckoned to Slappy to follow him \"Come on if our prey aren't going to come to us then we'll go straight to them I know the way to their room they share bunk beds so it should be no trouble.....\" As quietly both crept down from the dusty and dingy attic down into the second floor they made very little noise tiptoeing as quietly as possible that even the family dog didn't stir when they crept by his basket finally they made it to their quarry's room and each dummy took a girl Slappy climbed to the top bunk while Mr. Wood stayed at the bottom \"Okay this is it you mean little brats its time you learn what happens when you abuse and abandon your belongings.....\" Then he turned to the dummy dressed in the tuxedo at the top at Kris' bunk \"So what do we do?\" Slappy's jaw dropped open in disgust as he stared at his fellow wooden accomplice \"What? You mean to tell me you don't have a plan.....I thought you said....' \"Oh I was merely paraphrasing buddy.....To tell the truth I never did anything like this before I just needed a partner in crime so to speak you didn't think I was going to try and get revenge on these two girls on my own did you?\" Slappy fumed knowing he had been stood up but luckily he himself learned a thing or two while stuck at that old pawn shop so he climbed down to the bottom bunk shoving Mr. Wood out of the way \"For the love of....no matter I got the perfect plan though this wooden worm  filled head does happen to know a few magic spells okay repeat after me Mr. Wood:Karru Marri Odonna Loma Molonu Karrano.....\" But the other dummy was hesitate at first \"Those are some strange words you just said pal you know they kind of remind me of this horror movie I saw this criminal used magic words to transfer his essences into that of a toy doll and......\" \"Just say the chant already and hurry before they wake up!\" Slappy cried out pointing at the snoring Libby it looked like she was about to turn over in her sleep \"Okay,okay....\" Mr. Wood said shaking his head bitterly \"But I still think my plan was better.\" \"You didn't have one remember now hurry up you're wasting time and more importantly dawn's approaching and this spell requires the victims to be asleep or unconscious for it to work properly.\" As the other dummy slowly recited the words with the other girl Kris at the top bunk Slappy did the same with Libby at the bottom bunk then both stared eagerly at their prey hoping the ritual worked that they would be transferred into their bodies or else be able to mentally control them question is did it even work at all?</span></div></div>",

I've got to get to math class.\" You said to yourself as the bell rung unfortunately this school even for a middle school was huge,very huge and confusing you had to ask several teachers for directions just go find home room but finally you were on your way and practically ran hurriedly to the class and see it was shockingly empty! \"Must be early.\"You said. You set your stuff down on one of the desks and check to make sure you have everything. Pencils, papers, notebook, erasers..... \"Ok. I'm set. Now to just wait for the teacher..\" You said. When you turn to sit, you couldn't move. You tried to speak, or move but couldn't do either. Then you hear a voice. \"Hehehehe. Time to have some fun, little boy. It said.\" You turned around trying to spot whoever said that but couldn't see a soul Then there is a flash of white light that surrounds you and you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you come to a hour later and open your eyes. \"W....what was that all about?\" You said wildly looking around but amazingly there was still no one not even the teacher in the class room except you yourself strange were you in the wrong room? But that disembodied voice and whatever made that weird light what the heck was that? You had no clue but found you could speak, and move again. And quickly grabbed your stuff to get out of that creepy class room as it turned out you were in the wrong room,your home room was just across the hall but upon reaching to grab your backpack you realized something was horribly wrong! My body froze. And my mouth felt like it was sewed shut \"Hey why is my book bag so big,why is the desk so big,why is....Ohh OH NO I-I SHRUNK!\" You cried indeed you were incredibly tiny about the size and height of a tea cup. You had no idea on earth how this could have happened though that eerie voice and mysterious light provided at least two clues(It did say \"Let's have a big of fun with you\" you thought thinking back) but now that you were certain you were micro sized your book bag and jacket were far too big to be of any use to you at least your regular clothes shrank with you otherwise this would be highly embrassing now in fact practically everything towered over you like you had just stepped into Jack and the Beanstalk so quickly abandoning your school supplies you ran into the now enormous and empty hallway \"Everyone else either must be in class by now or still waiting to receive their schedule.\" You thought checking your watch it read 7:45 school technically didn't start for another ten more minutes but it was getting some help that was going to be the hard thing especially at a mere two inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were trying to make sense of things, and slowly moved across the floor the ground started to shake. BOOOOM,BOOOM,BOOM \"What the?! An earthquake!?\" You whimpered as you were knocked off balance falling onto your back  It seemed to get more and more violent and closer. \"Feels like the ground is going to open up! \"You said trying to get back up then staring up and up and up you see the source of the violent shaking. A tall,young blonde haired girl about your age very pretty with blue eyes and really red lipstick not to mention wearing a thick layer of makeup is slowly coming down the hallway \"H...Holy....! She's so huge!\" You said agasped both at the fact that she was near Godzilla sized and she was even with all that makeup on was incredibly pretty!  You see her open a small pinkish makeup kit with a portable mirror attached and apply more lipstick wearing a long blue sparkling dress just past her knees as you could see her long legs with old fashioned black and white saddle shoes just one simple stomp from them and you were road kill! But at the same time  you felt your heart sank all the way to your feet. \"Ok. Don't panic..... Panicking won't solve anything. I need to think clearly and form a plan.\" You said. She did look familiar you recognized her from the gymnasium as she was seemily sitting with two other boys her age one a black haired sort of chubby kid and the other a blonde boy who could just as well be her twin brother you thought you heard some of the other kids teasing of making fun of her for wearing all that makeup and lipstick but couldn't recall what they said her name was,some kind of Mexican name or something but anyway you still look at the giant  girl still applying lipstick. \"Hmmm whoever she is she certainly looks friendly maybe she can help me..Er excuse me Miss....Whoa!\" You said as unable to move you remain frozen in fear  \"My God...... The closer I get, the bigger she seems to get.\" You said. As she's still applying lipstick? \"How much does one girl need on their lips?\" You muttered to yourself You see that you barely come up to her shoes. When she shuffled her feet, you gulp at the loud sound of them hitting the ground hard. To whoever or whatever is listening above..... \"Please don't let me be between her shoes and the ground.\" You pray silently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think that's enough for now.\" She said to herself even her voice is pretty angelic as she carefully  closes her makeup kit,capped up her lipstick tube and placed it back into the little black purse she was carrying over her right bare shoulder and heads straight in your direction her every step causing your entire world to shake and you fought for balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get her attention before I'm squashed but how?\" You said starting to panic again</span></div></div>",

Competing with her booming footsteps, you scream up at her. \"HEY! MISS! DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND\" You shouted. It seems to have worked. She stops dead in her tracks right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is someone here?\" She asked pausing briefly her voice sounds like that of an angel, making you feel like you could trust her. She starts looking around for the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOWN HERE! BY YOUR FEET!\" You said. Listening to the voice, she looks down at the ground. You stare up into her big, blue eyes as she looks down at you. \"Please don't see me as an bug, please don't see me as a bug.\" You repeated to yourself She blinks a few times and gasps clutching a hand to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh A.....Are you real person?\" She asked bending downwards slowly to examine you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" You shouted. She reaches down for you and gently picks you up each finger seemed like a giant redwood tree making you sweat a little. Her fingers wrap gently around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to lift you up okay?\" She said in a soothing manner. You are lifted off the ground and up to her face to look at you up close you see just how pretty the girl really is. \"Wh-what are you-this can't be for...but y-you-you are real aren't you? You're a human right?\" She said utterly surprised as you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....Yes I'm human just tiny but at this rate like I'm going to church if I get back to normal\" You mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl didn't respond to this she began walking you had no idea where she was going to class maybe? But no instead she walked all the way down to the first floor to the now huge empty gym and sat down on a pair of bleachers studying you carefully then asked \"How' did ....you get so small?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....don't know here I was getting ready for class, then there was flash of white light, and here i am incredibly tiny like this!\" You said truthfully You hold your head downward. This catches her attention and makes her worried and she frowns heavily you are scared of her for this reason the fact she or anyone else could just as easily crush you like a grape with one simple squeeze<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ar....Are you scared of me?\" She said concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of you, no but the situation I\u2019m in and your shoes, yes.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shoes? Why are you scared of them?\" She asked curiously gently setting you on the nearest set of bleachers you began shivering as the metal bleachers were so darn cold you were practically breathing frost but answered her question truthfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were the first thing my eyes laid on. Combined with the thundering echoing and big they are,not to mention it felt like being in a earthquake  I didn't  want to be near them.\" You said. Given your current size, she could understand why anyone at that terrified size could be just as easily stomped on by a shoe,slipper or boot though she had other things to be concerned with  right now she had something new to worry about with you expressing your fear, she didn\u2019t want that to happen to you. She brings one of her fingers to you and rubs your head in a gentle way. You look up at her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll keep you far away from my big, bad saddles then!\" She said jokingly tenderly picking you up again By comforting you, she hoped you would feel comfortable around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th\u2026.thanks.\u201d You said feeling a tad better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I\u2019ll help you get back to normal. I promise anyway I can.\u201d She said giving you a sweet smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn\u2019t expecting you to be so friendly. Are you always like this?\u201d You said starting to feel comfortable around this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mostly unless you do something to upset me of course like steal my lipstick or makeup but I don\u2019t see any reason why you would being you're really small*giggle* but if you want me to be mean\u2026.hehehe I'm just kidding.\u201d She with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no! I prefer friendly!\u201d You said quickly. You look up at her angelic face. \u201cFor someone who puts on a lot of makeup, she really  is  very pretty.\u201d You think <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh. Josh Wade. And your name?\u201d You asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thalia Halpert-Rodis don't worry Josh. We\u2019ll fix this now is there anything you remember before you got this way? You said something about...a bright light?\" She asked thinking hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was some kind of voice that said \"Time for some fun little man!\" But when I looked around there was nobody there at all! You confessed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's what the voice said? Are you certain you heard a voice at all?\" Thalia asked bringing you closer to her titanic face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah 100% I happen to have really good hearing Thalia but I wonder what a voice and a bright light has to do with me shrinking? And who was it who do it? This town's pretty freaky did you hear rumors about a bunch of children disappearing in 1947-\" you started but she a bit angry cut you off <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I've heard everyone knows about that! But anyway what you were saying about hearing the voice tell me what did it sound like?\" She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a guy's voice,he was cackling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cackling?\" She arched a eyebrow <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you know laughing like mad! Saying It's time for a bit of fun then the bright light flashed before me and that's all I remember then I woke up two inches tall y-you believe me right? You don't think I'm making this up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sitting right here beside you looking at you at two inches tall so why would I think you'd be making this up Josh?\" Thalia put a finger on her chin \"Until we can figure out how to get you back to normal you had better stay around me for a while I don't want anyone else to try and step on you or worse you have no reason to be afraid of me I won't hurt you alright?\" She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you just move here to Bell Valley?\" She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah a few days ago.\" You replied nodding <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only person to move to Bell Valley a boy named Tommy recently just moved here  three days ago but all current circumstances aside I hope you like it here.\" Thalia said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think I've seen him sitting with you in the gym this morning and that other boy is he your brother? I mean you look a lot alike.\" You ask <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who oh you mean Ben,Ben Jackson the boy with the same blond hair and blue eyes I have? No we're not brother and sister we're not related at all. He just happens to look like me that's all.\" She explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you two were getting acquainted, the bell rings. \u201cThat\u2019s the first-class bell. I need to put you somewhere.\u201d She said getting up and began walking again this time to a completely filled classroom on the first floor with th two other boys you saw her with your first day here the black haired sort of chubby boy named Tommy Frazer and the other boy who closely resembled Thalia herself named Ben Jackson,a jokester apparently as he kept on cracking lame jokes and another girl a heavy set really tall,muscular girl with white-blond hair,grey eyes and dressed in sheet black clothes Thalia told you was Greta not a nice person \"I ran into her before and she're really odd!\"  She warned you beforehand and sat down at a desk in the front row Thalia opens up her purse and gently puts you in. \"I know it\u2019s a little cramp with all my makeup, lipstick and belongings but once class is over, I\u2019ll find a better place for you you just stay still until then alright I'll check up on you in a bit.\"   She said as she zips it close as the rest of the students and the teacher Mr. Devine comes in.</span></div></div>",

Every kind of makeup you can think of.\" You noticed as you looked up at the towering metal lipstick. \"Why is this so special to her?\" You said. There was nothing for you to do except wait until class was over. You sit there quietly and wait until you hear the bell ring. Thalia puts her bag across her arm and walks out of the class. \u201cWhere is she headed?\u201d You asked. Thalia walked for a few minutes to the gym. She sits down on one of the cold bleachers and opens her bag. \"Are you okay in there?\u201d She asked as you saw nothing but her enormous face you shrank back a bit in fear but nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Where are we?\u201d You asked. As she began walking at before stopping and you see... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gym I'm helping out with the Dance Decorations Committee for the school dance.\u201d She explained while carefully setting out her purse on a set of bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A school dance? This early in the year when is it?\u201d You asked impressed as in your old town school dances didn't start until around the fourth or fifth week of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cA few days from now. Tommy Frazer and Ben Jackson,remember those two boys from this morning I was sitting with here? All three of us are working on decorations making posters and stuff it's hard work sometimes but pretty fun. Anyway sorry to ask you this but could you wait a little longer in there for me? At least until we finish up it shouldn't take long.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. But are you sure it\u2019s a good idea to leave your purse knowing that girl Greta likes to take it? Like she did that one time?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShe\u2019s not likely to be snooping around here in the gym Josh so we won\u2019t have to worry about her.\u201d She said. You both hear her name being called. \u201cI'm coming hold on for a bit Josh I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d She said as she leaves her purse on the bleachers to help with the decorations from across the gym floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes went by, you were waiting for Thalia to come back. You happen to look up to see she left the bag open. \u201cShe left the bag open. I shouldn\u2019t, but I want to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d You said tired of being stuck in some girl's purse as her makeup was starting to get to you then you slowly move a few things around in the purse and place them on top of each other. You slowly climb up from the bottom of the purse and poke your head out. You see banners, posters, and other decorations in the gym each one the sizes of billboards and can't help but mutter loudly \"Whoa\u2026. Thalia, Ben, and Tommy are  doing such a good job at this.\u201d You said. You pull yourself up and drop onto the cold bleacher. \u201cThalia isn\u2019t going to like me doing this.\u201d You said. As if she heard you say her name, Thalia comes over to the set of bleachers and places down a few banners. \u201cNow to put a few of these on the wall.\u201d She said. Thalia steps onto the bleacher and you came face to face with her saddles, For the few seconds they were in front of you, you swear your heart had stop beating. Your senses came back when they were out of sight. \u201cI think I should have stayed in the purse\u2026..\u201d You said. Thalia moved from left to right, placing banners as she went. \u201cThat should do it.\u201d She said. \"Okay Tommy and Ben I'm finished over here!\" She called <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're close to being done over here.\" The slightly chubby boy Tommy said like you Josh he was also fairly new to school but you never encountered or met him before she nodded and came down and this time you don\u2019t look as she steps down the bleachers. Back on the ground, Thalia looks at her work. \u201cPerfect.\u201d She said. Thalia looks to see her purse is open and she  moved to both close it and get out her lipstick to apply another layer of lipstick onto her already red enough lips when she saw you standing next to her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia crouches down to look at you frowning a bit at you \u201cJosh what are you doing out of my purse?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry but I couldn\u2019t help myself. I wanted to see the decorations for myself.\u201d You said. Thalia picked you up quickly clutching you in her hands <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have stayed in my bag like I told you to! Now I'll have to hide you the hard way....\" but before she could say anything else Tommy had called her from behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Thalia we need some help over here! Can you help us with these balloons?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah hold on for a bit.\"  Quickly, Thalia had to put you away to prevent risk both boys finding out about you  and there was only one place she could put you. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for this.\u201d She muttered swallowing hard Thalia had put you down her dress to hide you away as for Thalia herself this was among the strangest thing she had ever done and she had to literally leave the gym and into the girls' restroom into a lone stall and pull up her dress revealing both her old fashioned undergarments and sizable rear end and stuffed you inside the back of her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you all happened so suddenly that your head was spinning. \" What?? I'm right between her\u2026..\u201d You muttered beyond shocked and terrified that she would do this it was incredibly stuffy and hot as blazes and you couldn't see a inch and really didn't want to but could still feel the soft fabric of her underwear beneath you but still it was hard as heck to believe you were in a girl,a incredibly pretty,stunning girl's butt of all places<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh why didn't I put him in one of my pockets instead?\" Thalia thought a second later remembering her dress did have small enough pockets you could fit into but on the other hand she couldn\u2019t take you out with Tommy or Ben seeing her, so she would have to leave you where you are for now. When the boys went back to decorating, once she returned to the gym Thalia whispered to you. \u201cAre you alright? I'm very sorry about this but I couldn't think to where to put you you must be so scared and confused and I know it's not the most pleasant place I'll get you out of there in a bit but please stay still and I know that was sudden, but bear with me. And please don\u2019t move so much in there.\u201d She whispered as she went back to decorating with the boys. What happens next? </span></div></div>",

Plus with every movement she made, you were pressed into her butt. \"Is this a good thing? Pressed against her butt like this\" You said. Thalia could feel you being pressed into her butt. \"I need to hurry. Josh is probably scared out of his mind in there.\" She said. Thalia, Tommy, and Ben worked for thirty more minutes until all that was left was to paint the giant banner.   Thalia wanted to paint certain parts red, and the boys had no problem with it. Thalia had taken the paint brush and dipped the brush in the paint and started to brush the banner. To Thalia, it was no different to when she's applying her lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b></b>Thalia moves to the spots she wanted to be red and paints them until she's satisfied. \"That should do it.\" She said. Thalia was about to stand up when she felt something moving between her butt cheeks. \"J....Josh?!Ohhhhhh(GASP!)He's right in between my.....\"<b></b>! She said her blue eyes which were contact lenses widened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong?\" Tommy asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No nothing's wrong Tommy I just need to(}<b></b>Ohhhhhh stop moving!<b></b> stand up and stretch my legs for a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the movements Thalia was doing, you had moved from her right cheek to the center of her butt. When she had bent down the final time, you were right between both cheeks and heard her slightly groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n From where you are, you gauge where you'll end up. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"></font>I....If she stands up, i'll be sucked right into her....!<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"></font> gulp!\" You said. With you right in the middle of her pretty sizable  cheeks, Thalia knew that if she stood up, you were going to be sucked into her butt. She also knew that she couldn't reach into her undergarments because Tommy and Ben were around and they would see her. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"></font>If I stand up, he will without a shadow of a doubt be sucked into my..... But if I try to get him, Tommy and Ben will see me!<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"></font>\" She said lowly, but with increasing panic. She couldn't stand up, but she also couldn't reach down her undergarments with Tommy and Ben around, but she had to do something. She couldn't just stay in the position she was in forever. \"Either I stand up and try to get Josh out of out of my butt, or I could just reach and pull him out, but Tommy or Ben would see me doing it.\" She said. She didn't like either option but she had to do one of them.</span></div></div>",

Thalia\u2019s tone went from calm to a little angry back to utterly calm in a heart beat \u201cWhy are you giving me a hard time? I said I wasn\u2019t going to keep you there.\u201d She said a bit grumpily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You  weren\u2019t the one who had was faced with going up someone\u2019s butt.\u201d You agrued back <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I got you out before it happened, didn\u2019t I?\u201c She said \" Look I really apologize for doing that but I didn't want either boys nor anyone discovering what happened to you who knows what would happen....ohhhhhhh noooooooooo.......\" As Thalia was fuming, you notice her makeup was coming off and showing her colorless face. You were agasped thinking she was wearing sone type of gray powder \u201cW\u2026.What the? Why does her face have no color?!\u201d You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you should be thankful that I did get you out. I could have just left you there until we were finished.\u201d She said trying to divert the attention from her rapidly graying face but you weren't so easily fooled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026.Thalia. Y\u2026.Your face.\u201d You pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What about it?\u201d She said. Thalia looks into one of the restroom  mirrors and sees part of her face is colorless. \u201cOH NO!! \u201d She said stunned her face turning completely pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u2026why is part of your face colorless?!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It....It\u2019s a sickness just a type of sickness...uh It's a type of new gray colored makeup I have began wearing.....\u201d She quickly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gray makeup,Sickness? There's no such thing as a kind of sickness that..... I mean what kind sickness does-\u201c but you are cut off when Thalia brings you towards her enormous face,up to her massive already too red lips and to your surprise kisses you turning your entire body into a bright red human replica of her lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmwahhhhhhhh!\" You are shocked by this, and even more when how long she let it go for. After a minute, she breaks it. \u201cT\u2026.T\u2026.Thalia\u2026..\u201d You said. You couldn\u2019t speak from still being in shock. Thalia simply smiles at you \"Why did you...\" You start but she grins fully at you showing all her sparkling whites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I think you're rather cute at that size Josh!!\" As she quickly wiped you off and headed back to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the gym, Thalia puts you back in her purse. \u201cPlease Josh stay there. And I mean it this time stay still alright?\" She said. She takes out all her makeup items. While Tommy and Ben where finishing with the decorations, Thalia started putting makeup on. \u201cCouldn\u2019t wait to put on makeup already?\" Ben said rolling his eyes bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think looking this pretty is easy?\u201d Thalia said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not when you apply makeup every five minutes!\u201d Ben jested back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* If you two are done, we still have a few more things to do before its time to go home.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were finally finished the three friends leave the gym and went home so she said goodbye to them and each headed off home but while on the way back to the school as(her parents had either moved away or were dead once she escaped the colorless Grayworld so Thalia mostly hung out in the school now) While on the way to the second floor Thalia had started to put on her lipstick. While doing so, she bumps into Greta lurking around the building for some reason \u201cOh. well look who it is Little Miss Lipstick! Thalia! Still applying that lipstick?\u201d She said sneering <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today, Greta. Don\u2019t you have anything better to do?\u201d Thalia said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do now!!\"  She said as she takes her purse and her lipstick dangling it over her head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey give that back!\u201d Thalia nearly screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come get it!\u201d Greta said. Greta had held Thalia\u2019s lipstick and purse above her head as Thalia tries to jump for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! You almost got it that time!\u201d She said pulling it further from her reach <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE IT BACK!\u201d Thalia shouted she was nearly in tears by now highly upset but kept trying until Greta drops her purse and lipstick to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man It\u2019s almost too easy!\u201d Greta said sneering and smirking from  all that happened, you crawl out from her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow\u2026. \"You said. You hold your head as your sensed come back, and you wish they didn\u2019t when you saw those giant saddles Your heart felt like it stopped. You look up to see Greta is holding Thalia back from getting her lipstick with her arm. \u201cIf you spend less time putting this on, you\u2019d gotten it back by now.\u201d Greta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE ME IT!\u201d Thalia said. Greta pushes Thalia off her.  And the force of her push sent the blond girl towards the ground you barely dodge out of the way  the sound of her saddlers hitting the ground made your blood go cold. You had taken a few steps back. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting it if that\u2019s all you got.\u201d Greta said. Greta\u2019s grey eyes looks down and sees your small figure moving. \u201cWhat the? Are you carrying insects around in your purse now?\u201d She said bending forward curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn\u2019t matter! And he-it's none of your concern NOW GIVE ME MY LIPSTICK BACK!\u201d Thalia said screaming at the top of her lungs becoming more concerned with the tiny boy at her feet than her lipstick <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019ll give it back.... Under one condition.\u201d Greta said with a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?!\u201d Thalia said feeling a ping of dread as the taller girl replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m tired of seeing you prance around here like a good girl. I want to see a little badness in you. Crush this bug.\u201d Greta said pointing directly at you both of you gasped out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? NO!!\" Thalia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me Miss Goody Two-Shoes! Those old fashioned shoes of yours you always have on look like they can crush anything. So crush this bug here and you\u2019ll get your lipstick back.\u201d Greta said. Thalia didn\u2019t want to. She knew that was you down there, and she knows that you must be scared stiff of her massive saddlers being in front of you. \u201cI just want my lipstick back, but at the cost of a life? No\u2026. It\u2019s not worth that much. I can't-won't do that to him I'm looking out for him!\" Thalia thought. Then she gets an idea. \u201cGreta\u2019s not that smart. If it looks like I did it, she\u2019d give it to me.\u201d She said. Thalia took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done this before.\u201d Greta said folding her arms <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t rush me.\u201d Thalia said. \"I....I'm thinking....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve never been so scared before. Those saddlers were right in your face, and there was nowhere for you to go. Then it\u2019s like your nightmares come true. Thalia raises right foot over you. Your heartrate shot through the roof. It was beating so fast, you thought your heart was going to come out of your chest. Everything inside you was telling you to run, but your legs were frozen. You watch in horror as her saddler came down quickly. You felt it push you to the ground. You didn\u2019t open your eyes as you felt it on you. As the seconds went by, you were expecting that bright light, but it never came. \u201cA\u2026..Am I..dead?\u201d You whimper fearfully as you  work up the guts to open your eyes. You see the bottom off her saddlers are right on top of you. Your heartrate picks back up again. \u201cThere. I did what you said. Now give me my lipstick! Thalia said.</span></div></div>",

Thalia had stopped and started to talk, but there was no one around. \u201cWho is she talking to?\u201d She wondered. Thalia was looking in her hands as she was speaking. Greta squinted her eyes to see a small figure in her hand\u2026..and it was talking back. \u201cI\u2026.is that a\u2026..small person?!\u201d She stunned. She thought it was some sort of a small insect before realizing the truth  \u201cH\u2026.How did he\u2026.get so small? And how come Miss Goody-Goody here gets him? She already has make and her lipstick.\u201d Greta said. She continues to follow Thalia until she takes a sharp turn and loses her. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d Greta said. Greta looks around and sees two unmarked doors. \u201cI bet she went through here.\u201d She said. Greta steps through the doors into a eerie small room. \u201cWhat the!? What is this place!?\u201d She said startled beyond belief. As she was staring at students,kids or at least statues of a bunch of kids dressed old fashioned like from the late 1940s as her own gray eyes adjusted to the dim light she read the big blocked letters 'Class of 1947' \"What kind of room is this and why?\" She thought bewildered as like the other new kid Tommy Frazer she began wandering around looking at all the statutes until reaching one of a girl looking utterly familiar...\"Hold on this is...but it can't be....is this supposed to be Thalia?\" She quizzed herself why the heck would she be here among a bunch of missing children from the 1940s? But indeed it was she recognized her exact height,hair color(a natural blond)and eyes(light baby blue)and everything and two and two are starting to form in her brain \"So that's it huh? She's one of those lost kids from the 40s? But what the heck happened to all them and how is it she's still the same age as everyone else if they all vanished 50 years ago? I better get to the bottom of this!\" As Greta opens the door and runs back the way she came in and quickly shuts it heading in a sprint down the hallways thinking wildly \"That pretty little mysterious  princess has a lot to explain for.\u201d She said. As she's continuing walking to the second floor Greta sees Thalia walk into the girls restroom and follows her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,well Little Miss Two shoes!\u201d Greta said popping out of nowhere Thalia applying some orange makeup on her cheeks turned around in surprise and gasped <br>\r\n\"G\u2026Greta! W\u2026what are you doing on this floor? And why are you still here anyway? It's late in the evening!\" Thalia narrowed her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing how many times you need to put on that makeup in one day?\u201d She said stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem with putting on makeup?\u201d Thalia asked hiding something behind her back that wasn't her purse or lipstick <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s not. If you don\u2019t have any color or are a member of a bunch of kids gone missing years ago! Yeah I just been into a really strange room a while ago and saw a bunch of statues pretaining to the supposed 'Lost Class of 1947' and guess who I saw among them? That's right Lipstick you yourself!\" Greta said circling around her as Thalia\u2019s blue eyes eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you talking about?\u201d She said trying to play dumb <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. I know what you are so tell me what really happened to that particular class all those years ago? You're one of them I put two and two together! So is this why you're always putting on makeup and lipstick?\"  She said smiling in a sinister way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I-it's not I have no idea what you......\" Thalia said sweat starting to pour from her face and as she sweated some of her makeup slowly came off revealing her true gray form Greta's gray eyes widened in satifation <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cColorless! I knew it! Which is why you\u2019re so found of all that makeup and constantly putting it on!\u201d Greta said still circling around her \"And what else are you hiding Miss Lipstick?\" As she snatches her purse from her shoulder <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That\u2019s mine!\u201d Thalia screamed angrily swiping at it only for Greta to push her back into one of the stalls with one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that\u2019s not all I learned today!\" \u201d She said. Greta opens up the purse and pulls you out. \u201cYou have a tiny friend!\"  She said grinning savagely. You began shivering once you see just how large and terrifying the other girl is as she looks at you with a cold smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnd you were going to tell me when?\u201d Greta asked glaring down at you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t need to tell you anything. Put him down!\u201d Thalia replied angrily getting back up to her feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I\u2019m taking him.\u201d Greta said as she started to leave with you clutched in her tight fist but Thalia stepped forward <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greta please....if anyone else finds out about him, who knows what would happen.\u201d Thalia pleading to let you go grabbing at you with both hands but being Greta was a foot taller she easily evaded her swipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I\u2019m not going to show him to anyone. I\u2019m taking him for myself.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For yourself!?\u201d Thalia asked not understanding <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You have all that makeup and your precious lipstick. That\u2019s more than enough for someone like you.\u201d Greta replied as she continued to walk out the door but you suddenly spoke up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cD\u2026 Don\u2019t I get a say?\u201d You said trying to breathe <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Greta said squeezing you tighter you let out a groan outcry of pain and Thalia gasped loudly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greta! Put him down now! You're crushing him! Stop it! And give him back to me! He's not a thing,he's a person,a student like you and me!\" Thalia screamed with anger and fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\u201d Greta turned back around as she did Thalia jumped at Greta, but Greta just pushes her away smirking \"Wow. You came at me a lot more fiercely than when I took your makeup. Don\u2019t tell me you care about some beauty products more than a person\u2019s life.\u201d Greta said. Thalia\u2019s blood was boiling. Her makeup was one thing, but taking you was not going to happen as she raged her face pale and eyes wild <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m only going to say this one last time, Greta. PUT HIM DOWN NOW!!\" Thalia shouted charging at her again but was shoved aside <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I said no. Just imagine all the fun things we can do, tiny.\u201d She said bringing you back to her enormous face you began turning bright blue as you were choking to death<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T\u2026.they might be fun for you.........\u201d You barely got  out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019ll grow to like them. I\u2019ll make sure of- \"Greta is cut off when she\u2019s tackled. Greta was caught off guard and lost hold of you. You freefall all the way to the counter and lay there in searing pain but Greta's hand was still tightly wrapped around you <br>\r\n\"And I thought\u2026..Thalia\u2019s shoes\u2026..were bad\u2026.\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not taking him! GIVE HIM BACK NOW!\" Thalia shouted as she started fighting Greta. Thalia lands a few hits on her but Greta pushes Thalia off her, but she pounces right back on her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you dead before you take him-STOP IT! YOU'RE SQUEEZING HIM TOO HARD L-LET HIM GO!!\" Thalia shouted as tears began forming in her eyes Greta hits Thalia a few times, but Thalia still doesn\u2019t stop fighting. Greta manages to push her off again and get to her feet. Greta was stronger than Thalia, but that didn\u2019t stop Thalia from continuing to rush at her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a whole different level. \u201cShe\u2019s ferocious when I took her lipstick, but this\u2026..it\u2019s like she\u2019s some kind of crazy person! She really does care for this twerp....\u201d Greta thought as she needed to turn this around and could use this little twerp to her advantage and  saw you just lying there where she dropped you and quickly grabs you as Thalia came charging at her, making Thalia stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop one more step, and I\u2019ll end him\u2026.\u201d She said starting to squeeze you again Thalia really looked ready to lose it as tears began to fall and she choked out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo-You wouldn\u2019t. Not even you would do something so horrid...please Greta let him go....\"\u201d Thalia pleading again as she made a desperate grab for you but missed Greta\u2019s grip on you tightens, and you let out a painful moan. \u201cTry me. His death will be on your hands!\" Greta said squeezing even harder you were close to passing out.</span></div></div>",

You still want him?\" As she held you out to Thalia who at first outstretched her hand to take you back but then withdrew it shaking her head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's okay you can keep him,he's all yours! With him in that near death state I have no further use for him!\" As she turned away and Greta smiled cruelly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case if he's like this then I have no use for a little twerp like this either no one does...oh well might as well throw him away or better yet...\" As she neared the toilet and prepared to drop him in Greta didn't see Thalia grab a hold of you in one quick swoop,shove Greta hard so hard that she fell head first into the same toilet with a loud SPLASH  and darted from that restroom with Greta's outcry <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what th-You...... You wait until I get a hold of you! I'm going to snap your pretty neck and shove that lipstick tube down your throat!\" But the blond girl kept on running and didn't stop until she reached a good distance to where she couldn't be followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you saw when you regained consciousness instead of pearly bright lights was the face of a angel and at first you saw you really were in heaven then you realized it was Thalia's huge face you were staring at <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh Josh are you alright?\" She cried out bringing you up further to her pretty face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....awwwwww my entire body aches all over!\" You moan as you tried to get up realizing you were still in the school and in her left hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here just lie back and try and rest I'll see what I can do!\" She said as she slowly stood up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we? And what happened to Greta?\" You asked curiously looking around \"This looks like a miniature teacher's lounge!\" You observed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the teacher's lounge on the third floor,I-it was left open by accident by the school janitor I think and I without where else to go made it my home away from home-ummm anyway Greta she's gone hopefully home or who really cares where as long as she's far from us as possible!\" Thalia replied angrily you didn't reply to this as you look around the teacher's lounge it was quite different compared to others you have seen there was a small coffee table,a few chairs,a miniature fringe that was actually filled with stuff like milk,juice and sodas and a couch that the girl had apparently made into her personal bed as she had taken covers and a blanket possibly from the storage closet which was right next door and tiny pillow and back to Thalia herself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you actually stay here? What about your own home and your parents?\" You ask curiously but she chose not to reply to you instead began digging into her bag until pulling out a few tissues and smeared you with one <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" You asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleaning you off Josh you're very sweaty and must be completely terrified beyond belief after what that crazy girl did to you its highly unlikely she'd want you now...so we're safe for the moment.\" She began applying lipstick for the last time today <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which what time is it?\" You ask seeing there was no clock anywhere <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very very late around 6:00 o'clock I'm guessing.\" As she dabbed her lips with a cloth <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So may I ask what did she mean by your gray skin and why are you staying here in the school Thalia?\" You ask curiously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some things are better left unsaid.\" She replied as if that settled the matter and you questioned her no more on it instead the two of you talked for a while mostly how you mysteriously shrunk and how the school year was going so far until night fell and finally Thalia announced how tired she was you were getting pretty tired from everything what happened with you and Greta and asked exactly where you were going to sleep when Thalia said....</span></div></div>",

There's a mirror in here and I saw your reflection!\" But she doesn't sound upset or annoyed at all instead she quickly tosses on some green PJs and turns back around  as she slowly walks back to you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not mad....\" You choke out nervously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really I should be though but I guess at your size you had no choice but to look I can forgive you this one time just please don't let it happen again okay?\" You nod and turn bright red as a tomato as Thalia shuffles her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I couldn't help it anyway yo...you're very pretty,awesome looking even with all that makeup on Thalia.\" You admit truthfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you! But it's getting really late Josh I guess we should go to sleep now.\" Thalia said as she picked you and gets under the covers on the couch <br>\r\n\"Now don't get any ideas Josh I'm letting you sleep with me because of your size and I want you to stay right here by my head okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I swear I won't go anywhere else....\" You muttered drily Thalia had you on the pillow with her and had her hand over you as a cover. You stare into her now gray eyes as you just lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright and here so you won't be cold as its a bit chilly...\" And she kissed you again covering your whole body with her lipstick \"Sorry!\" She smiled as you lied down grinning back at the young 12 years old beauty<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG\u2026.goodnight Thalia.\" You said. As you both slowly drift off into sleep true to her word she slept soundly with nothing aside from a few snores but it was really the sudden outcries you heard from her in the middle of the night something about her friends being in a colorless classroom and a evil photographer named Mr. Chameleon but you drifted off yourself half hoping this was all a dream and you would wake up normal sized again although with such a beautiful girl watching over you did it matter if it was? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came, you wake up to see Thalia\u2019s face, but it\u2019s almost totally colorless. \u201cAHHHH!\u201d You shouted. You scream made Thalia wake up with a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh! What\u2019s wrong?!\u201d She asked just as alarmed as you were <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026.it\u2019s your face....its ....\" You mutter shakingly Thalia quickly leaped up nearly dropping you in the process and grabs her purse. She takes out her makeup and starts applying a bunch of it to every part of her face making her look a bit creepy but you instead ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ever going to tell me what\u2019s happening or happened to you?\u201d But she pretended not to hear you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you already Josh Some things are better left unsaid.\u201d She as she finished up minutes later her face looking as 'colorful' as ever then Thalia puts her dress and saddlers on. \"Uh oh school starts in an hour if we hurry-that is if I hurry I'll make it come on!\" She said grabbing her purse in one hand and you gently in the other and leaves the teacher's lounge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou think it\u2019s a good idea to leave here? What if someone,a teacher comes by and spots you? And what about Greta she sure was furious yesterday and she could be stalking the halls for us.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's highly unlikely she would be here early at six in the morning Josh and no one knows I'm here as long as I straight it back the way it was no one will know the difference but you're right we can\u2019t stay here forever this is a teacher\u2019s lounge.\u201d Thalia said as she began walking slowly through the hallway of the second floor \"We'll worry about finding a new place to sleep later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But after what she did yesterday\u2026.\u201d You said concerned <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine Josh I won't let her or anyone else hurt you and I already told her I\u2019d see her dead before she gets you. If I have to make good on that\u2026.\u201d She said with an angry look but smiled sunnily once she stared down at you again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thalia\u2026..\u201d You said but could do nothing as she puts you in her purse and heads down the long flight of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia was looking over her shoulder and around every corner for Greta but wasn't really looking for her at all in fact she was looking for a way back into ...but diverted her attention by muttering to herself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. She\u2019s not here. Maybe she\u2019s absent today.\u201d Thalia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think again, Little Miss Lipstick Princess!\u201d A voice said. Before she could react, Thalia is pushed and pinned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greta! What are you?! Hey! Give me my purse!\u201d Thalia screamed causing a few other students who arrived early to stare in their direction but many of these just laughed at her as they endlessly teased her about wearing makeup and lipstick anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesterday was your last mistake. You\u2019re never seeing this shrimp again!\u201d Greta said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u201cGreta. I warned you last time what I\u2019d do to you if you touched him! Thalia hissed but the larger girl laughed loudly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won\u2019t do a thing if his life means anything to you!\u201d She said. Greta opens up the purse and grabs you. \u201cYou\u2019re mine now.\u201d She said with a cruel smile as she tossed her purse back to her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRETA GIVE HIM BACK NOW!\u201d Thalia said with sheer anger her hands balled into fists as she stepped forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo. I\u2019m making the threats this time. If you come after him, I\u2019ll step on him completely until nothing's left but a smear.... \u201d She said as she shoved Thalia to the ground and was gone by the time she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOSH!!\" Thalia said worried but still wasn't about to give up just yet and she raced after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta had left the school premise and was already halfway to her house. She stops and open her hand to see her catch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey let me go.....\" You yelled but she snickered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry twerp but Thalia\u2019s not going to save you this time!\u201d She said with a solid grin <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u201cLook\u2026.. Greta. I\u2019m sure we can talk about this through like rational people.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Let\u2019s talk. I\u2019m big. You\u2019re small. If you want to see the sun again, you\u2019ll do whatever I say we're going to have some fun together! You'll get to like me possibly even more than Miss Lipstick!\"  She smirked as she closes her hand around you and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call her that!!\" You shouted angrily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what she is isn't she? A weirdo constantly putting on makeup besides I nearly flushed you down the toilet yesterday without a care. That\u2019s getting off easy, compared to all the other ways I can end you but I decided to keep you around instead...\" She said as she pounded down the street You\u2019d\u2026..really go that far?\u201d You said stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who\u2019s going to find out? Only me and the little 1947 princess knows about you. So if something did happen to you, nobody would know.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won\u2019t get away with this! Thalia will come for me! I hope....\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she won\u2019t. For your sake, you better hope she doesn\u2019t.\u201d Greta said. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she comes after me she doesn't know where I live and besides how is she going to find you when there's a hundred places I can hide you!\" She said smirking <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW\u2026.why are you like this? Neither of us done anything to you!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t need to justify myself to someone I can hold you in one hand! Now pipe down the boys are coming over and we need to practice for the school dance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boys? Practice for what?\" You ask curiously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The band we formed Grunt? Duh! And I plan on showing you to all of them they'll be delighted to see and mess with a puny twerp like yourself!\" She said as she tightens her grip. Greta stuffed you into her pocket and continued on her way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta opens the door to her house. Her parents had already left for work, so she was all alone. She goes to her room which had heavy metal bands and designs all over it and takes you out. \u201cJust you and me now, shrimp.\u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Why are doing this? What is that you want?\u201d You said. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I need to tell you anything?\u201d She said with a smug smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead remain silent it won't save you but in the meantime you want to know what I want? I want a\u2026\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

Either you give me a kiss or I get to step on you!\" Greta said but you could sense the true malice behind her voice as her fist suddenly slammed down on the dresser and you were nearly bounced to your death hundreds of feet below \"I asked you a question twerp! Give me a kiss or else!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....\" You began you have never been so scared in all your life <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you'd rather be with that Miss Goody-Goody 1940s freak who looks like she belongs in a circus!\" Greta smirked and laughed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she's a lot nicer and way prettier than you'll ever be!\" You state bravely despite your shaking body <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would watch my mouth if I were you puny!

You would put Thalia at maybe 5'4)<br>\r\n\"Good! I knew you would see it my way! Okay puny pucker up!\" As Greta slowly bent forward and grabbed hold of you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghhhh yuck! Nasty!\" You began spitting nonstop as her big lips cams into contact with you it felt like putting your lips on a brick wall;there was absoutely nothing to feel as her lips like Greta herself felt stone cold unlike Thalia whose lips felt really warm and comforting <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck indeed! You call that a kiss? Ewwww you're so slimy on second thought you're not my type Miss Lipstick can take you back after all!\" Greta said as she made a disgusted face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you're letting me ho back to her?\" As your hopes are brightened <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be dumb of course not! You belong to me now puny and just so you don't even think about escaping....\" Greta grabbed hold of you and set you in a small metal cage locking it shut <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There enjoy your new home twerp! I'll be back up here to check up on you later the rest of the band has just arrived! And as I said before don't count on Thalia's pretty,perky butt to come and save you!\" As she departed the room you were saved at the moment by noticing she left the only window open and despite the cage already being small enough you saw a place,really thin you could squeeze through and did it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! Out of there but now I got to get out of here before she returns who knows what she'd to me?\" As you began running at full force towards the open window and climb down the massive drapes but due to a shout nearby you let go of it and scream uncontrollably as you're falling at a speed of 145mph<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh my God! I'm falling I-I'm going to die! Can this get any worse?\" As you heard loud booming rock music coming from directly below you Greta and at least four guys you recognize one or two at school are practicing heavy music they have guitars,drums(Greta does)and equipment for the bass,speakers,microphone but fortunately you're caught a lucky break when to your amazement......</span></div></div>",

Thalia! I...is that.....\" You cried relieved she nodded as she slowly brought you up to her titanic face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it's a good thing I secretly followed Greta here.\u201d She said looking around wildly for her nemesis fortunately the taller,tougher girl was nowhere in sight then you replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the rescue but we really should get out of here. Greta could be done practicing at any moment.\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah come on!\" With a nod, Thalia places you in her purse and heads back to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was still going but it was late in the day and they had a late lunch  but she really wasn't that hungry So Thalia secretly headed back to the teacher\u2019s lounge as usual nobody saw her  and takes you out. \u201cAre you alright? Did she hurt you?\u201d Thalia said with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not physically\u2026..\u201d You said your neves were shot but feeling a tad better you'd be feeling a lot better if you were your regular size <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d Thalia said curiously  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe made me kiss her. But I didn\u2019t like it!\u201d You said remembering the horrible experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she do that?\u201d Thalia said frowning <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. A power thing? Has she always been like this?\u201d You said curiously the giant blond girl nodded setting you on the table<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much. Greta\u2019s always been a jerk well as long as I knew her which wasn't really that long!\" Thalia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve only know her for one day, and I\u2019ve already had enough of her.\u201d You said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about her anymore. She won\u2019t get you again.\u201d Thalia said. \u201cThat reassuring. Thanks.\u201d You said. Thalia rubs your head to comfort you. \u201cSo would you mind if I asked you sort of a personal question.....when Greta kissed you\u2026. Was she better than me?\u201d Thalia asked a bit mischievously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked arching your eyebrows not sure what you just heard and she repeated herself <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she better than me?\u201d She said bringing you even closer to her huge face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would it matter to you?\u201d You said sensing the flirting tone in her voice <br>\r\n\"I\u2026..just want to know.\u201d Thalia said as her already makeup covered cheeks blushed bright red. You were going to tell her you could practically sense the wanting in her voice and pretty face but you had a better idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThalia\u2019s is a better kisser, but she doesn\u2019t know that. If I word this right\u2026..\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u2026well is she?\u201d Thalia said a bit impatiently(she was really,actually flirting with you now <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y\u2026yeah. I mean. She\u2019s not a perfect kisser,I mean she's not much of a kisser at all and her lips felt like the rear end of a......anyway but she knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d You said a bit honestly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she is better than me?\u201d Thalia asked her voice getting bossy and a bit disappointed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I wouldn't say that you're far the better kisser and the prettiest girl in this school even under tons of makeup and lipstick....\" But that was all you could get out as Thalia brings you to her too red ruby lips and kisses you happily <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwah!\"  She beamed sweetly at you and you blushed bright red Okay so there  is a vast difference between the two. Thalia\u2019s kiss was warm and soft. Greta\u2019s kiss was rough and cold. Thalia holds the kiss for a few seconds before breaking it. \u201dThank you Josh for saying that! So how was it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s nothing to brag about.\u201d You said, hoping  to put this to rest didn't she realize how much prettier and sweeter she was compared to most of the really snobby girls here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to be?\" She asked placing her hands on her hips in a pouty way and shaking out her blond hair <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um what I meant to say is....\"You said quickly, wanting to avoid those things at all costs <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on....\" Thalia said suddenly getting up and gently grabbing a hold of you and her bag as she got to her feet as the bell rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for the final class of the day reading class.\" Thalia said \"Our book reports are due today anyway.\" She said as she secretly emerged from the teacher's lounge and put you in her purse. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to stay in there long, ok? Just this last class fortunately I don't have to decorate for the dance today so we'll just head back here once all the kids leave for the day.\" She said as she followed the usual crowd to the second classroom on the first floor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least leave the purse open a little for some air?\u201d You silently called up from inside the purse Thalia halfway stopped and stared down at you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I trust you not to sneak out?\u201d She asked giving you a calm look <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI won\u2019t. I learned my mistake from last time.\u201d You nodded Thalia nodded and  closes her purse and leaves It slightly open for you and heads to class. She takes her seat in the front row and puts her purse under her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sound of the topic being discussed you recognize the subject it is,is reading class as the semi-bald teacher Mr. Devine with his thick eyeglasses is teaching You sit there and wait next to her lipstick until the class is over. When it\u2019s over, Thalia picks up her purse, opens it, and takes out her lipstick. \u201cUh-oh. Must be time for a new layer. Or 3.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce school ended the two of you headed </span></div></div>",

The things that Greta would have made you do\u2026.

You are the nicest and prettiest girl in the school.\u201d You said while blushing.

Why are you ask.....\" You said getting a look of paranoid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you do that for me?\u201d She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?\" You said out loud <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said would you be willing to rub my feet if I asked you Josh?\" Thalia grinned fully at you and you thought <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay<i></i>maybe she can be a bit rebellious herself for such a cute girl!\" <br>\r\n\"Well Josh.....\" She got a bit impatient <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er okay yeah I\u2026..wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d You said not wanting to make her mad and  Thalia puts you down and takes off her saddlers and then white really short socks revealing her really small cute feet and extends them slowly to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D\u2026don\u2019t exhaust yourself okay?\" She said. You nodded and slowly step up to her left foot  and touch it and  hear  adorable a giggle from Thalia as her foot twitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe stop that tickles!\" She giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry it's just that your feet...they're.....they are really huge. Or I\u2019m just that small. And your toes are like cars!\u201d You said amazed  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if they smell a bit Josh.  I've been walking around a lot.\" She said blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't. Just....lay back and relax.\" You said honestly You start to rub them and Thalia threw her head back in relief. She felt a little bad using you like this, but it was cute having a little boy at her feet and rubbing them. You continue to rub her feet until you had to stop from utter exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright? I said don\u2019t exhaust yourself.\u201d Thalia said with concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do a bad job.\u201d You said swinging your arms to relax the aching muscles but she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m not Greta, Josh. I won\u2019t berate you if it\u2019s not good.\u201d She said. Thalia picks you up and brings you to her ruby too red lips. She gives you a long kiss before breaking it. \"Mwah! Thanks for doing this for me, Josh.\u201d Thalia said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it\u2019s the least I can do for you.\u201d You said. You both stare at each other before Thalia speaks again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh\u2026. Josh? Can I ask you something?\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\u201d You said wondering what she possibly wanted now she didn't take her time either just blurted it out  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can\u2026.I be your girlfriend?\u201d She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah sure.....Wait, what?!\u201d You said stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026.I like you,I really like you Josh! You\u2019re just cute as a button. And it\u2019s multiplied by your size.\u201d She said truthfully making your jaw drop<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y\u2026.you think I\u2019m cute? Really?\u201d You said, red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes I do you really are even if you weren't two inches...And besides you always call me pretty and that's no mere compliment S\u2026so you must feel the same way don' you?\" She said completely flirting with you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u2026well\u2026. You are pretty,very pretty! And I do feel the same way, but\u2026.. Why would you want a two inch tall person, when you can have anyone else?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because no one has ever showed interest in me. Tommy sees me as a friend and Ben can\u2019t take anything seriously without jokes. But you don\u2019t tease me about my makeup and call me pretty every chance you get.\u201d She said bending  forward even more so all you can see is her billboard face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThalia\u2026. Are you sure about this? This is something serious you\u2019re talking about.\u201d You asked thinking if this was right or not but she stood by her word<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. I\u2026.want to be your girlfriend. So will you be my boyfriend please?\" She asked batting her eyelashes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like you weren\u2019t the only one with feelings towards Thalia. That would explain the flirting she did with the \u201cWho was a better kisser?\u201d. You did have feelings for her as well. You just wanted her help at first, but seeing her not take advantage of you and even fighting to keep you away from Greta, you felt something deep down for her. \u201cThalia\u2026. I would love to.\u201d You said. Thalia squeals with joy and gives you a big kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much! I promise. If we can\u2019t find a way to return you to size, I\u2019ll take care of you. And keep Greta away from you.\u201d She said honestly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep her far away and I\u2019ll stay this size for you.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh! Would you really?\u201d She asked amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, sure.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I\u2019ll just have to keep Greta at bay.\u201d Thalia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both spent the time talking about how to get you back to normal and ways to keep Greta away when night came. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to get late.\u201d Thalia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the drill.\u201d You said. Thalia sets you down on the table and you turn from her so she can undress. As Thalia was shaking out her hair, she looked in the mirror to see you not peeking at her this time. Looks like somebody learned their lesson! Sorry guess some of Ben's sarcastic nature rubbed off on me a bit!\" She mutters as she puts on her green pajamas and walks over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn\u2019t peek! I swear!\u201d You quickly said a bit scared but she shakes her head  \u201cI know. The mirror.\u201d She said pointing to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O\u2026.oh.\u201d You said. Thalia picks you up and gets under the covers on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the rules, right?\u201d She said a bit sternly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo funny business and stay by your head.\u201d You repeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay good.\u201d She said as she placed her hand over you like a cover. You stare into her grey eyes to which she beams innocently  before she gives you a kiss. When she breaks it, she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. You got lipstick on me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I won\u2019t apply as much next time.\u201d She replied shrugging<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo only 4 layers?\u201d You joke.<br>\r\n\u201cHa. Ha. Ha. Very funny. Goodnight, Josh.\u201d Thalia said letting out a low yawn as soon you both slowly fall asleep to the sound of crickets outside the school.</span></div></div>",

You really want her to tell you why she is like this, but she won\u2019t say a word to you \u201cShe\u2019s adamant about that greyness,about that odd colorless form. Even though she\u2019s beautiful with or without her makeup, I love to know what\u2019s causing this color loss.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In her sleep, Thalia pulls you to her cheek and holds you there firmly. \u201cJosh\u2026..\u201d She moaned barely audible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D\u2026.did she just call my name in her sleep?!\u201d You said amazed You couldn\u2019t get out of her hold, so you had to wait until she woke up. \u201cShe might sleep in. Today\u2019s Saturday.\u201d You said.  You wait thirty minutes for Thalia to wake up finally she does opening up her eyes and staring wildly at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026. Josh\u2026.? Where are you?\u201d She said half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your cheek.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O\u2026.oh. Wait\u2026. What were you doing there!?\u201d She said, holding you in front of her. \u201cYou moved me there in your sleep.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026..did?\u201d She asked arching a eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You also called out my name as well.\u201d You said at this Thalia starts blushing furiously it's though it's hard to see due to her gray face. \u201cI\u2026.If you want to talk about it\u2026..\u201d You said smiling a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...W\u2026.we were holding hands. And kissing after watching a movie or was it simply walking together through the school hallways?\u201d She said. You both blushed and looked away from each other. You both were boyfriend/girlfriend, but neither of you had experience with this. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026get dressed now\u2026..\u201d She said. Thalia puts you down on the pillow and puts on a new set of clothes including a white short sleeved shirt with tiny red polka dots with a red bow at the center,navy blue shorts and red bright slippers and her hair was redone in a ponytail with a red bow and makeup. Once she\u2019s done, she places her hand down and you climb on. \u201cS\u2026so what\u2019s the schedule for today?\u201d You asked. \"Well It\u2019s Saturday\u2026. So I was\u2026.thinking we could go to the mall or one of the stores together.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\u201d You said. Thalia puts you in her purse and heads outside of the school then begins walking downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia pulls you out when she gets into a beauty saloon store  \u201cAll this makeup\u2026.. Whoa!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I first came here after.....but ohh everything's actually cheap and I can afford it. They have everything I need.\u201d She said happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s roomy in here. You need more makeup.\u201d You joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got to look pretty for a certain someone.\u201d She said with a wink. You face turns red as she puts you back in her purse. Thalia grabs the makeup she wants and pays for them. Once she walks to the back of the  department store she puts them in her purse, except her new lipstick that she starts using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Not even five minutes and she\u2019s using that lipstick.\u201d You said. Thalia heads to the back asile  that had a few purses for sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh. This yellow one is nice, but this blue one matches my shorts!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That purse can\u2019t be cheap.\u201d You said. To your surprise, Thalia buys the blue purse. Thalia heads to the restroom to show you. \u201cAll that makeup and you had enough for a new purse\u2026.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saved up my money.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever thought about dialing back on the makeup?\u201d You asked but she shook her head \u201cNot really, but since I have a little special person now, I need to look good for him.\u201d She said smiling fully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u2026.Well\u2026.. I think you're pretty even if you don\u2019t have your makeup on.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that for true, or just to spare my feelings?\u201d She asked calmly bringing you up closer to her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026it\u2019s true. Even without all that makeup on and grey, you still look pretty.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with it, I\u2019ll be even more pretty for you.\u201d She said as she gives you a kiss and puts you in her old purse. When she walks out, she\u2019s pushed back inside by a few girls from the middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh! Look who it is!\" They laughed mocking her but she ignored them and headed now to the next store  which was a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So many dresses,so many modern clothes-I mean clothes! I need to pick one for the dance which is in a few days.\" She said. Thalia browses around and picks a few dresses including a red one,a green one and a blue one and heads to the changing room. She opens her purse and takes you out. \u201cJosh. I need your take on a dress that will look good on me for the dance.\u201d She said smiling down at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a particular one in mind? What about that black one over there?\" You said pointing to it \"It's cheap.\" But she frowned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I picked a few out with actual colors but  I need your opinion on them.\u201d She said as she set you down on the chair and walks to the dressing room. \u201cJosh. Can I trust you not to peek on me?\u201d She said calmly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word.\u201d You said. Thalia headed into the changing room and comes out in a red dress with back straps. \u201cWell?\u201d She said beaming \"What do you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it had some sparkles or something to make it shine, it would be perfect for you.\u201d You said. Thalia looks in the mirror and nods in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm you're right. It has no shine to it. On to the next one.\u201d She said. Thalia walks back into the changing room and after a few minutes, comes out in a white dress with some rhinestones on the chest. \u201cHow about this one? It's a bit expensive.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can you afford it? It looks like it costs a fortune!\" You pointed out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually have plenty of money to pay for it.\" She replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang then your parents must be loaded to be able to let you have that type of dress!\" You cry out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhh someone might hear you! And I'm not rich I just happen to come from middle class anyway what do you think Josh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it matches the color of the decorations, but won\u2019t other people be wearing white as well?\u201d You asked She thought about this <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll just blend in. I want to stand out.\u201d She said.  Thalia goes in and comes out in the green dress which looked plain compared to the rest <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay how do I look in this one?\u201d She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her in that dress, your heart skipped a beat. \u201cD\u2026don\u2019t just gawk at me like that. How do I look?\u201d She said in a huffily voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P\u2026.perfect. You\u2019ll stand out at the dance in green definitely.\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are-are you sure Josh? Because it looks a little too plain to me! How about the last one?\" As she pulled out the sparkling blue one you nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks great,better than the previous one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll wear it then!\" Thalia takes off the green  dress and puts her old clothes back on putting all the other dresses back on the rack before picking out the blue one and proceeds to the checkout. Thalia pays for her dress and heads out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I'm going to look stunning at the dance.\u201d She said once she got back outside it was a cloudless,blue sky and pretty day today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore stunning than you know? Is that possible?\u201d You joked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh quit it. You\u2019re making me blush!\u201d She said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's  the point. You\u2019re really cute when you blush.\u201d You can't help but say out loud Saying that, Thalia's face got redder as  she snapped out of it when her stomach growls to you it sounds like a roaring titanic monster or animal of some kind <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa someone's not  happy with you! Did you eat?\u201d You asked  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026. No. Come to think of it. I didn\u2019t eat at all yesterday.\u201d She said \"I was too occupied with other things........\" She muttered under her breath <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that\u2019s how you stay thin. You starve yourself.\u201d You joke but the giant girl covered in makeup frowned even more <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026.don\u2019t starve myself!\u201d She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that\u2019s how you fit into those dresses. You know that\u2019s not healthy.\u201d You said, chuckling. Thalia was a little annoyed at you poking fun at her, but she had an idea as a small smile played upon her pretty face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're right. I should eat. And I know the perfect thing.\u201d She whispered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, pick where. We\u2019re at the food court.\u201d You pointed out as she left the clothes store and headed into one of the fast-food joints <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh I already have my meal or at least am about to.......\" She said with a michievous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where at?\u201d You said. You notice Thalia is looking at you with a hunger. \u201cThalia\u2026..\u201d You started <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I need to eat. Listen.\u201d She said. Thalia holds you against her stomach and it rumbles loudly a bit louder than ever <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need food now. And you\u2019re the closest thing.......\u201d She said you tried to back up but where could you go? As it was a a hundred foot drop to the ground if you fell off her hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019d\u2026.eat your boyfriend?\u201d You choke out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do, you\u2019ll become a part of me. We\u2019ll never be separated.\u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThalia\u2026.. If you\u2019re joking with me\u2026.\u201d You said trying to convince her otherwise but she looked dead serious <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019ll be quick.\u201d She said as she slowly brought you to her open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THALIA!!\" You cried out  When you got closer, Thalia closed her mouth and puckered up her too red lips. You felt being pressed up against something soft and warm. You open one eye to see nothing but a wall of red. You\u2019ve seen this shade of red before. It\u2019s Thalia\u2019s lipstick color. \u201cMwah!\u201d She said, breaking the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThaila\u2026.. W\u2026..were you teasing me?\u201d You asked fearing settling in every part of your body <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe! But one good tease deserves another. You know I would never eat you.\u201d She giggled cutely <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026.. You sounded so serious about it.\u201d You shiverimg like crazy but she calmed you down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that but I had to make you believe me. Did I scare you that bad?\u201d She asked sounding sorrowful <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little\u2026..\u201d You muttered Thalia kisses you again. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry so about now?\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m good.\u201d You said quickly. Thalia headed to an ice cream parlor and gets bowl of vanilla with chocolate syrup on top. Thalia takes a seat and gives you a few small pieces. When she finishes, Thalia puts you in her old purse and heads back to the school with her new dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Thalia gets back to the teacher\u2019s lounge, she puts her dress on the table. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for the dance! I have a dress and a little boyfriend!\u201d She teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re\u2026.not going to show me off, are you?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It\u2019s already bad enough Greta knows. I don\u2019t want the whole school to know.\u201d She said. You shiver when she mentioned Greta. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know about you or discover your tiny state!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a lot of other girls might discover of my existence and you know how wily eleven and twelve year old girls can be about tiny doll-men!\"  You pointed out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh but they won't discover you Josh not as long as you're with me little cutie!\"  Thalia cooed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Thanks\u2026..\u201d You said. Thalia sits on the couch and gently rubs you. Then she gives you a few more kisses. \u201cYou plan on kissing me all day?\u201d You said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re too cute not to kiss!\u201d She cooed bringing you even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I love the compliment, I don\u2019t want to be the color of your lipstick.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you suggest?\u201d She said. \u201cHow about\u2026..</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll go first. I\u2019ll count to thirty. That should be enough time.\u201d She said as  the giant girl put you on the ground softly and closes her eyes. One....two...three.......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she starts counting, you look for a hiding spot. (She won\u2019t find me under the couch.) You thought.

He could be under the couch.\u201d She said \"Josh you can't keep hiding forever you know!\" Thalia said a bit playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ahhhhh crud she's smarter than she appears.\u201d You thought as she got on her knees and you see her blue eyes looking in scanning the entire area you remain completely still, hoping her gaze would overlook you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia gets up and you breath a sigh of relief.\"Ohhhh where could he be? Did he leave?\u201d She said a bit annoyed you laugh a little as she racks her brain. Thalia looks for a few more minutes until she calls it quits. \u201cOk. I give up, Josh. Where are you?\u201d She said. You come out from under the couch. Thalia sees you come out and picks you up. \u201cI looked under there, and didn\u2019t see you!\"  She said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stood still and carefully held my breath.\u201d You said grinning <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I want another try at this. That was cheating!\u201d She said with her hands on her hips <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m game for a rematch.\u201d You said as you smiled back Thalia puts you on the ground and starts counting. You know the first place she will look is under the couch. And she\u2019s going to re check all the other spots you can get in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine.....ten....eleven....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your eyes came to her  massive red slippers. \u201cShe\u2019s getting close to thirty. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d You thought panicking a bit then you begun climbing the enormous soles.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs you get to her slippers and climb in them just as she hits thirty. \u201cThis time I\u2019ll find you.\u201d She said with a prideful smirk just as you predicted, Thalia looked under the couch first and feels around under there. \u201cThought he\u2019d be there again.\u201d She said frowning a bit <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not I play to win, Thalia.\u201d You said. As she was looking around, you notice that her slipper didn\u2019t reek of sweat. \u201c<b></b>For as much as she walked today, not a hint or drop of sweat in here.<b></b>\u201d You said. Thalia continues to search, but comes up empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\u201d She said. Thalia looks around until her eyes fall onto her slippers. \u201cHe isn\u2019t\u2026..I mean it would be really weird and even he's not that.......ohhhhh.......\u201d She muttered as she felt something moving around and Thalia smiling to herself put her foot inside the slipper you\u2019re in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw Thalia\u2019s foot coming in the slipper, you ran to the toe section. Thalia wiggled her toes around to feel for you. \u201cA rock and a hard place here.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe I know you're down there Josh! I can feel you...and tehehehe you're tickling my foot stop it!\" She giggled but  you touched her big toe and her other toes  stop moving and her foot is taken out. The slipper is then picked up and turned upside down. You fall out onto her hands. \u201cReally, Josh? You were hiding in my slippers?\u201d She said with a broad grin on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would look under the couch first, and I was running out of time. Your slippers were the closest thing.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I\u2019d put them on? You\u2019d be trapped in there. Do you know what too much pressure will do to you?\u201d She said as she brought you to her face still smiling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have sensitive feet. I\u2019m sure you were bound to feel me if I was trapped in there.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should stop before you make my ribs sore from laughing too hard!\u201d She said as she had a serious fit of the giggles then  took a seat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we should play something else?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And I know just what.\u201d She said. Thalia brings you to her ruby red lips and start kissing you. \u201cIt\u2019s called the kissing game!\u201d She said. You were constantly bulldozed by Thalia\u2019s too massive lips, but you weren\u2019t complaining. With each kiss, some of her lipstick got on you. \u201cWell? *mwahhhhhhhhhh* How do you like this game? *Mwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh*\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d You said although you were being smothered by her massive juicy too red lips causing her to aimlessly giggle <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh! I can't help it......You *mwah*........ are....... *mwah*..... so.......... *mwah*...... cute! *mwah*.........\u201d She said. Thalia kept barraging you with kisses for a few more minutes before she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d She said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot more than what I suggested.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I want to keep doing this, it\u2019s nighttime.\u201d She said looking up at the clock which read 7:58PM<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the drill\u2026.\u201d You said. As Thalia puts you down, you turn your back as she changes. As Thalia changes into her PJ\u2019s, you wanted to take just a quick glance, but remembering the mirror that caught you last time. \u201cIf I\u2019m really quick, maybe she won\u2019t notice.\u201d You said. Moving your head a little, you see Thalia just removing her light blue shorts and only in her underwear busy shaking out her blond hair, her long,slender legs, her round rear end that you vividly remember being trapped against and her extremely pretty angelic face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is so beautiful.\u201d You said. As you were gazing at her, you notice at the last second that Thalia was looking at you through the mirror. \u201cOh uh!\" You mutter. You waited for Thalia to turn around and berate you, but she doesn\u2019t. Instead, you see her bashfully smiling. \u201cI\u2026is she smiling?\u201d You said. Thalia walks over to you now in her green PJ\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh\u2026..\u201d She said as she slowly got up frowning at you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m sorry! I couldn\u2019t help myself! You\u2019re just\u2026..so pretty.\u201d You said unable to stop yourself at this remark Thalia blushes heavily, even though her face was now grey, you could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling you would do this again.\u201d She said sighing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d You said feeling ashamed at what you just saw and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth, I\u2019m not mad as I was when you did it the first time.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re\u2026.not?\u201d You said amazed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Since you been using my trust well, I think\u2026..you can\u2026.look every now and then.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!? Are you serious!?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y\u2026.yeah. I trust you enough to give you some leeway. Just don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d She said smiling mischievously at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won\u2019t. You\u2019re my girlfriend, not a piece of meat.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia lays down and places her hand over you. \u201cI trust you know what\u2019s not allowed while I sleep.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I\u2019ll be right here when you wake up.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you aren\u2019t, you\u2019re going to ride in my shoes all day.\u201d She said forcing a loud yawn from her mouth <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slippers or saddlers?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saddlers.\u201d She whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d You said quickly. Thalia giggles at your reaction and kiss you. \u201cI\u2019m teasing, Josh. Calm down.\u201d She said. Thalia pulls you closer to her. The sound of her gentle heartbeat eases your nerves and lulls you to sleep. \u201cGoodnight, Josh.\u201d She said before closing her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Wake up.\u201d You said. She stirs, but doesn\u2019t wake up. \u201cThalia. The dance is today.\u201d You said. Her eyes open, but only a little. \"Yeah but It\u2019s\u2026.not until tonight.\" She muttered as she rubbed her eyes and sat up blinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t want you to oversleep and forget.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019ll be up and\u2026..ready by then until then I need a little more sleep Josh.......\u201d She said, closing her eyes again as she went back to sleep. You couldn\u2019t escape her iron grip, so you had to wait until she woke up again Which wasn\u2019t for another two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're trying to go back to sleep yourself you are startled awake when you heard a low rumble. \u201cWhat the?\u201d You said terrified then you hear the rumbling again, and it wakes up the giant girl holding you closely  \u201cWhat\u2019s that\u2026..sound?\u201d She said, half asleep. Thalia hears the rumbling coming from her stomach as she sits up. \u201cI hear you. Give me a minute.\u201d She said. Thalia rubs her eyes and yawns. \u201cJosh\u2026.? Where are you?\u201d She said, not seeing you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEr your other hand.\u201d You inform her as Thalia brings her hand up and opens it. \u201cYou slept like a rock.\u201d You joked but she doesn't reply to this <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\u201d She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifteen minutes to ten.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. The mall should be open when I get there. Do some last minute shopping and eat. Unless\u2026..you want to volunteer. She said. Thalia opens her mouth wide and you back up. \u201cI\u2026.I\u2019m good.\u201d You said. Thalia giggles and puts on her clothes which was her usual navy blue shorts and short sleeved shirt which tiny red dots on it with a red bow on the top and her pink hair bow and make up and heads to the mall. \u201cWhat do you need this time?\u201d You asked curiously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some jewelry. Nothing fancy. Just a necklace or a bracelet.\u201d She replied as Thalia heads into the jewelry store and starts browsing. \u201cOhhhh. This necklace with the heart is gorgeous!\u201d She said. Thalia tries it on and nods with approval. She pays for the necklace and heads to the food court. Thalia heads to the food court and gets and ice cone. She eats and finishes it as exits the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia heads back to the teacher\u2019s lounge and takes you out of her purse. \u201cGot what you need?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m all set.\u201d She said. Thalia starts doing her hair and makeup so that all she has to do later is just put on her sparkling green dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen night came, the school dance was packed with the students wearing black and white. When Thalia walked through the gym door, all eyes were on her and her green dress. As she made her way through the crowd, she was getting compliments left and right. \u201cWow. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be popular.\u201d She mutters. Thalia makes her way to the food table and opens her purse. \u201cYou doing ok in there?\u201d She asked glancing down at you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Seems like you caught the all the guys attention.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"think it\u2019s because of this dress. Although, I do enjoy the heads I\u2019m turning. Even Ben did a double take.\u201d She said noticing her double twin staring jaw dropped Thalia drops some pieces of food in for you. \u201cThere. I\u2019ll put some more in later.\u201d She said. Thalia zipped her bag closed and heads to the dance floor. Greta and her band was performing, and even though Thalia and her are at odds, Greta was good at performing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia was enjoying herself at the dance. Chatting with friends, drinking, enjoying the music, and everything else. Thalia made her way to the bathroom and took you out. \u201cEnjoying yourself out there?\u201d You said. \u201cI am, but I wish I could dance with you. That\u2019d be the cherry on top of this dance.\u201d She said. \u201cYou\u2019d save the last dance for me?\u201d You said. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d She said. \u201cWell don\u2019t let me keep you from the fun.\u201d She said. Thalia gives you a quick kiss before putting you back in just as someone comes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThalia. Not putting on your lipstick.\u201d A voice said. Thalia tunes to see Greta blocking standing in the doorway. \u201cOh. Greta. Aren\u2019t you and your band suppose to be playing?\u201d Thalia said. \u201cOn break. Can\u2019t perform on empty.\u201d She said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re here why?\u201d She said. \u201cYou know why?\u201d Greta said. \u201cCan\u2019t you just leave him alone. He wants nothing to do with you.\u201d Thalia said. \u201cAnd let you have all the fun? I know you used him as a servant at least once. What\u2019d you make him do?\u201d Greta said. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your concern. Now get out the way.\u201d Thalia said. \u201cSorry princess. But we\u2019re settling this.\u201d Greta said, pushing Thalia back in. \u201cGreta\u2026. I\u2019m sure we can talk this out like rational people.\u201d Thalia said. \u201cRational, huh? And what do you have in mind?\u201d Greta said. Thalia pulls you out and you see Greta. \u201cUh\u2026. H\u2026hi, Greta\u2026.\u201d You said nervous. \u201cYeah. Nice to see you too, shrimp. Hurry it up. I\u2019m back on in 10.\u201d Greta said. \u201cJosh\u2026.. I know you won\u2019t like this. But Greta won\u2019t stop coming. I need you to agree to what I\u2019m about to say.\u201d Thalia said. \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d You said. \u201cWe share him. I get him for half the week, you get the other.\u201d Thalia said. \u201cL\u2026like I\u2019m some kind of toy?!\u201d You said. \u201cToy? I like the idea.\u201d Greta said with a mischievous smile. \u201cHe\u2019s not a toy! Josh\u2026. I know how you feel, but think this through for a second.\u201d Thalia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\u201cThalia is right. Greta\u2019s persistent. She won\u2019t stop anytime soon. If this gets her off my back, I\u2019ll put up with it.\u201d) You thought. \u201cOk. I\u2019ll do this.\u201d You said. \u201cShrimp\u2019s on board with the idea. Now who get\u2019s him first?\u201d Greta said. \u201cJosh will decide.\u201d Thalia said. You wanted to stay with Thalia. Who knows what Greta has planned for you. But it would be better to go ahead with Greta and get all the torture and pain out the way now. \u201cHurry up, shrimp.\u201d Greta said. \u201cDon\u2019t rush him! Take all the time you need, Josh.\u201d Thalia said comforting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. I\u2019ll go with\u2026\u2026</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re going to do this. Or else......\" She said as she slammed her fist into the ground again but you called her bluff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll kill me?  Do it.\u201d You said boldly \"You won't be able to do it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I won\u2019t kill you. I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep my promise to the Lipstick Girl... No, shrimp. I\u2019ll make you suffer. And you know making people suffer is what bullies do do best not that I what you'd call a bully I just don't like people who think they're better than everyone else and little twerps like you and that new kid Tommy what's-his-name who knocked me over that one day!\" She said. She has a point. She took Thalia's lipstick probably as a game or prank but the blond girl took it more seriously more than to publicly humiliate her but  who knew what kind of crazy plans this girl had for you? \u201cSo I\u2019ll say it again. You will either do this or POW!!\" She said as she punched the wall her gist made a deep imprint and crack in the wall  you shivered and moaned <br>\r\n\"A\u2026.Alright. I\u2019ll\u2026.do it.\u201d You said defeated knowing you had little choice in the matter what was to stop her from crushing you totally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I  knew you\u2019d see things my way.\u201d She said as Greta sits on her bed and plucks you roughly up with one hand \"You better put me on cloud 9.\u201d She said as she drops you right in front of her feet. You stare up at them and shiver. \u201cHoly cow! What size shoe does she wear? Her feet are massive! You said a bit amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m waiting!\u201d She said impatient. Not wanting to anger her anymore, you start to rub her feet as best you can. Greta could feel your tiny hands moving on her feet and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You should get know them. They\u2019ll be the last thing you see if the pretty little princess thinks to come for you which is highly unlikely!\" She said smirking and laughing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u201cThalia\u2026.\u201d You muttered sadly For 20 minutes, you rub her feet until she tells you to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Was that so hard to do?\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re not the one who\u2019s exhausted.\u201d You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot to kiss them.\u201d She said stretching out her massive feet each toe was the size of a car compared to you! You were at first going to say something, but stop yourself. Swallowing your pride, you pucker up and kiss both of her feet. \u201cAw! Thanks for the love, shrimp!\u201d She said. You spit to get the salty taste out of your mouth. \u201cIf you behave more, you\u2019ll find your life to be easier. You might even forget all about Miss Makeup!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Thalia does keep her promise\u2026. I hope she does it very slow.\u201d You mutter to yourself. Then there was a knock at the door. \u201cAh! That must be them my buddies coming over for band practice!\u201d Greta said as she got up. \u201cDon\u2019t even try to escape. I\u2019ll find you.\u201d She said before leaving  Greta had left her door open. You wanted to run, but remember what she said she\u2019d do to you. You wait a few minutes until she comes back. \u201cGood. You didn\u2019t run. Maybe I won\u2019t show you to my bandmates and just play with you myself.\u201d She said. She picks you and brings you over to her dresser and drops you in with her shirts. \u201cBe glad I didn\u2019t put you in my shoe.\u201d She said before closing it. You were in complete darkness. You couldn\u2019t even see your hands. All you do is just sit there and wait. You could hear the loud rock music that was being played by Greta\u2019s band. As the loud music was playing, you count the minutes until it stopped. After some minutes pass, you hear footsteps and the dresser opens up. Greta grabs you and hold you in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2026.you done already?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and we played great. But I want to show you something.\u201d She said. She puts you on the floor and lifts her barefoot over you. What you saw made your stomach twisted. A mangled and flatten small insect. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Get a good, lasting look, shrimp. That could be you.\u201d She said. Greta stomps down in front of you and twist her foot. \u201cIt only lasted for two seconds.\u201d You won\u2019t be that lucky. So you better pray Thalia forgets about you!\u201d She said. Greta was going to pick you up, but there was a knock at her door. \u201cUgh. Who could that be now?\u201d She said. Greta left to go see who it was and left you there. You nearly hurl at seeing the sight of that mangled insect. \u201cH\u2026.How can\u2026.someone be so cruel?\u201d You said. You heard footsteps coming. You wanted to run and hide under the bed, but are still in shock. What shocks you more is seeing who\u2019s booming footsteps they were. \u201cT\u2026.Thalia!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh\u2026. Where are you?\u201d She asked appearing out of nowhere whispering \"I secretly followed her to her house! Where are you....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" DOWN HERE! LOOK DOWN! You shout. Thalia  looking like she was worried sick suddenly looks down to see a small figure. \u201cJosh!\u201d She said. Before Thalia could get you, Greta comes back and sees her. \u201cHey! She said. Greta tackles Thalia and the two start fighting. To avoid being crush by the two of them, you duck under Greta\u2019s bed and watch. Thalia lands a few good hits, but Greta returns the favor. \u201cYou got a lot of nerves coming here.\u201d Greta said. \u201cI\u2019ll make you pay for taking him!\u201d Thalia said. The two girls start hitting each other as you watch. \u201cPlease win, Thalia.\u201d You said. </span></div></div>",

You...you oversized boar!\" As Greta had in a headlock nearly choking her but the thinner and smaller girl was able to break loose but physically there was nothing the blonde girl could do as Greta was far bigger and stronger than her so the most Thalia could do was dodge and strike whenever she could finally Greta grabbed hold of you in a vise practically squeezing you to death <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!

I'd say he should have a say in all this don't you? Considering it's his life in the balance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you have a point! Okay you pick then little boy who do you want to go with?\" Greta asked lowering you to eye level <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it oblivious?\" You asked raising a eyebrow \"Greta you're absolutely bonkers! Taking stuff and people that don't belong to you so who do you think I want to go with?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta threw a dirty look at the blond girl <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I knew you were going to choose her!

If I see either of you again blondie you'll be putting on makeup to cover up all those bruises I'll imprint on your face and you shrimpy....I'll just step on you and squash you flat!\" Greta hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThalia didn't say anything else she just took you and walked out of the house without glancing back once a good distance from the street she looked down at you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" She asked bringing you close to her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah once more just a tad bruised you didn't' really think I was going to choose her! She's 100% bonkers!\" You said breathing hard <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she is!\" Thalia giggled \"I'm just glad you're....ohhhh Josh you're...re returning to normal!\" She gasped out loud as she gently dropped you to the ground sure enough you felt yourself slowly returning to normal within a matter of minutes as quickly as you had shrunken to two inches tall in the last two days you had returned to normal once you returned to your regular height Thalia....</span></div></div>",

Thank goodness you\u2019re ok.\u201d She said in a panic but you were bewildered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, mom?\u201d You asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn\u2019t come home. Do you have any idea how worried I was about you!? Where were you!?\u201d She scolded but you already had a excuse ready<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stayed with a friend. It was sort of a last second.\u201d You said. You sweated a little hoping your mom would buy your lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sigh* Okay but could you at least tell me next time? I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep because I was worried sick about you.\u201d She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see it didn\u2019t stop you from making the house spotless.\u201d You said glancing around the house as your father was enjoying the Monday Night Football game in the Family Room your mother shrugged <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m a stress cleaner. Sue me.\u201d She said. After a deep breath and sigh of relief, you took a bath and headed to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came, you were expecting to see Thalia\u2019s grey face. \u201cWhere\u2019s Thali-Oh. I\u2019m not small anymore.\u201d You remembered realizing how happy you were,extremely happy that you\u2019re back to normal size, but you do sort of miss being with her a little. You get up to wash up and upon finishing and telling your parents you're headed to the pool slide at the only other city park you grab your swimming trunks and head to the pool and see Thalia standing there amid dozens of other kids and teens You were going to say hi, but stop when you see her in a striped green and black swim suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking at her like that. plus with all that make up on that was apparently water proof made you lose all knowledge of speaking. \u201cJosh. Josh!\u201d Thalia said as she beamed at you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Thalia?\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you expecting anyone else? I said hi and you froze up.\u201d She joked \"Tommy and Ben said they were going to be here but I haven't seen them around so for now I guess it's just you and me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.. I wasn\u2019t expecting a swimsuit model.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S\u2026.s\u2026.Swimsuit model!?\u201d Thalia said with a red face looking down at herself \"Oh this....the main store was all out of the regular one piece bathing suits so I picked out this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else would have been an insult.\u201d You said. Thalia didn\u2019t know how to respond. Beautiful and pretty were one thing, but being compared to a swimsuit model, now she was the one lost for words. \u201cThalia? Thalia!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you\u2019re the one who spaced out.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O\u2026Oh. Sorry. Well aren't you going to change into your swimming trunks or are you planning to be wearing your regular clothes in the water?\" She said. You both looked away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was there, but neither of you knew how to express it. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026..going to go change.\u201d You said breaking contact at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I\u2019ll\u2026wait for you.\u201d She replied as you ran into the bathroom and change into your swimming clothes. After finishing, you look in the mirror and took a deep breath. \u201cCalm down, Josh. It\u2019s just Thaila. She\u2019s just like any other girl. Oh who am I kidding? No she\u2019s not. She\u2019s 20x better than any girl.\u201d You said. You throw some water on your face. \u201cI need to know. I have to ask her.\u201d You said. You head out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou took your time in there. Is there something wrong?\" Thalia asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y\u2026.yeah. So you want to just jump in or go down the slide?\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s jump in!\" She said as she started to head to the closet one but you stopped her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I just thought of something. Won\u2019t your make up run? And dry up?\" You quizzed her but she shook her head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it's waterproof I can stay for as long underwater as I want. Now come on.\u201d She said, jumping into the water. You followed in after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you\u2019ve done this before?\u201d You asked as you noticed how good she was <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a few times.\u201d She replied doing a quick lap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you\u2019re a fish?\u201d You joked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa,Ha see for yourself.\u201d She said as she started swimming from one end of the pool to the other. She was surprisingly fast, and at the same time graceful. Watching her doing this a few times before stopping. \u201cWell?\u201d She said upon stopping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I think you broke the world record of fastest swimmer.\u201d You said. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d She pointed out and beamed at you and you were desperate to impress her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay prepare to be astonished.\u201d You boasted as you start swimming from one side to the other. You\u2019re weren\u2019t as fast as her but you didn\u2019t let her out do you. \u201cHow was that?\u201d You asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what you\u2019re doing, at least.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like I need a teacher then. Preferably blonde. And a former giant.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh really?\"  She giggled as you and her climbed out of the water and sit on the edge. With her close to you, your heart was beating fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right there. Just ask her. But what if she says no? What then? No one else compares to her.\u201d You thought. While deciding, not noticing the slight smile on her face Thalia comes over to you and sits in your lap with her arms around you. \u201cT\u2026.Thalia!? You said beyond amazed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Josh?\" She said beaming innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u2026.what are you doing?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone had to make the first move. And you were taking your time, so I thought I\u2019d do it.\u201d She said her face barely a inch from your own <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F\u2026.first move?\u201d You said stunned Thalia moves her head ever closer, her lips to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you like me.\u201d She whispered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u2026.what?! W\u2026.where did you get that from?\" You said. Thalia gives you a small kiss on the check. You start blushing when she breaks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it for me.\u201d She whispered in your ear in a flirting way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026.like you.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going.\u201d She said as her red ruby lipped smile got wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u2026.what?\u201d You said. Thalia started to kiss you again, but a little closer to your lips and stopped <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI want you to say: I like you and want you as my girlfriend.\u201d She said firmly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG\u2026.girlfriend?!\u201d You choked out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t play dumb. I knew it since yesterday. And today when you called me a very pretty and kind girl and spaced out.\u201d She pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y\u2026you also spaced out.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn\u2019t expecting swimsuit model. Now are you going to say those words, or do I have to find a way to shrink you back down to make you say them?\u201d She said a bit sternly With a flushed face, and no other choice you say what she wants to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026..like you. A\u2026..and want you as my\u2026.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it for me, Josh.\u201d Thalia said liking the direct amount of control she currently had over you though she knew deep down it wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G\u2026.girlfriend.\u201d You said. Thalia then kisses you fully on the lips. After a few seconds, she breaks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if only there was a way to shrink you down.\u201d She teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u2026.would you really shrink me down if you could?\u201d You asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe every now and then. And I'd keep you in my saddles!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u2026.. Like shrinking me down wasn't bad enough. I'd be roommates with your toes\u201d You said annoyed but she lets out another cute giggle <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m just teasing. I wouldn't keep you in my shoes silly that would be very wrong!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were too soft hearted to crush insects on purpose. It had to be an accident.\" You said. as she got off of you and you couldn't help but notice despite her really thin figure and being in the sixth grade(most of the kids here were also in the 6th grade)she had really long,sexy legs and a sizable rear end then she then kissed you once more and whispered \"You'd be safe in my purse.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm safe.\" You said. Thalia continues the kiss for a few more seconds, then breaks it luckily there was no one else  in this section of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where to now? It\u2019s starting to get crowded here.\u201d You said but she suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's go to......\" </span></div></div>",

Mint! Chocolate! Vanilla! Strawberry! Which one do I get first?!\u201d She said incredibly excitedly and licking her red cherry lips  as you look at the poster.<br>\r\n\"All you can eat contest?\u201d You said. \"Look!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Winner gets free ice cream for life. Kids have been pouring in here since 7 this morning and many turned out a little worse for the wear! Claiming they'll never eat another thing of ice cream for as long as they live!\" The shop keeper said from behind the counter shaking his head <br>\r\n\"For life? Really? I'm in how about you Thalia how much ice cream can you eat?\" You asked <br>\r\n\"This is an all you can eat contest? Well I guess I can eat quite a bit! I might have a little trouble fitting in to my clothes but okay.\" She says as she also studies the notice board<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Where do I sign!?\u201d You said happily<br>\r\n\u201cRight here.\u201d The shop keeper said. Thalia quickly signed her name and took her seat in an occupied booth as did you.<br>\r\n\"All right. One rule. The bowls have to be completely empty.\u201d The shop keeper said as he brought a bowl for both Thalia and her opponent. \u201cFor an extra bonus, contestants can try to be the record of ice cream bowls eaten. Record is 21. Now are you both ready?\u201d He said holding up a small flag<br>\r\n\"Ready!\u201d Thalia and you said union <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then Go!\u201d He said bringing the flag down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any time, Thalia and youquickly eat the first bowl of ice cream. And quickly, the next bowl is given. Then the next. And the next, and the next, until you unable to eat another scoop from your vanilla filled bowl clutched your stomach and got up mostly your head was aching from brain freeze. \u201cFirst round goes to this young lady!\u201d The shop keeper said gesturing to Thalia despite her petite appearance the part of her face that wasn't covered in makeup was covered in specks of multi-colored ice cream she was quite the eater the crowd(and there were very few in the crowd) as Thalia comes to you with a big smile while wiping her mouth off with a napkin \u201cI did it Josh! I\u2019m advancing to the next round!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026.\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the contest goes on, Thalia advances further and further in until she gets to the finals. (\u201cAll those bowls of ice cream and not a single sign of brain freeze.\u201d Losing color is one thing, but I\u2019m wondering if Thalia is even human.) You thought. You watch the contest and Thalia wins. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have a winner!\u201d The shop keeper said, raising Thalia's arm in victory. \u201cYes!\" Thalia cries happily in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop keeper then takes Thalia's  picture, frames it, and labels it \u201cWinner of the ice cream contest.\" \u201cNow, is the anyone from the crowd who challenges the now...Er you don't mind if I call you the Ice Cream Queen do you?\"  He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" She replied smiling you steal a glance at her midsection she's strangely still incredibly thin <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then anyone want to challenge her for the top title? Any takers?\"  No one from the crowd steps up, except you. \u201cLadies and gents, we have a challenger!\u201d He said. You and take a seat in the both.<br>\r\n\"Really, Josh? You\u2019re going to do this again? I thought you said you were full?\"  Thalia said a little smug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm willing to try it another try.\u201d You said. Then the shop keeper brings you both bowls of ice cream.<br>\r\n\"Same rule as the contest. Bowls must be completely empty. Ready?\u201d He said.<br>\r\n\"Ready!\u201d You both said. \u201cGo!\u201d He said. You and Thalia quickly eat multiple bowls of ice cream. The contest was neck and neck and neither you nor Thalia showed signs of giving up. That was until you notice you both were nearing the shop record of the most bowls eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, both contestants are nearing the house record. But there can only be one winner! He said.<br>\r\n\"Quit while you\u2019re ahead, Josh. I\u2019m not losing to you.\u201d Thalia said still strangely thin her face partially covered in a mixture of makeup and ice cream<br>\r\n\"Not a chance.\u201d You said.

The dog wore a rainbow sweater that must have been 2 sizes too small for him, and thick glasses covering his piercing, frightening red eyes. His hair was long and dirty, making him look even bigger. From his slobbering mouth were long fangs perfectly suited for the kill. If Larry had to put a guess on the breed, he'd say a cocker spaniel. But whatever sat next to him was clearly one of a kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I got no problem eating my own shit, but at least that's juicy!\" The humanoid dog laughed hysterically, slapping Larry's back hard. Larry was too terrified to even scream. He got up to try and run away, but found his legs wouldn't work. No matter how hard he fought and pushed, they just wouldn't move. The dog rolled his eyes at Larry's attempts to get away. \"Oh, stop being such a pussy. You'll get your chance to leave and run free, I can promise you that. But first I need to talk to ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the <b>FUCK</b> are you?!\" Larry gasped, still struggling. He needed to get out of here. No, he needed to wake up. This was all a nightmare. Some awful nightmare brought on by a combination of that crazy old lady and bad airplane food. The dog scratched the crack of his ass repulsively and then extended his hand to Larry. \"Name's The Puppy, servant of Agua. I'm here to help you reach your full potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry looked at The Puppy's hand with a grossed out expression, shivering in his seat. The Puppy shrugged. \"Guess you were able to guess I didn't clean up today! Almost stink palmed ya!\" The Puppy laughed hysterically again, so much to the point that he actually started crying. He wiped away his tears before leaning near Larry's face. \"Alright, back to business. Do you know what you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry looked at The Puppy, both confused and repulsed. \"Larry Chaney, 19 year old kid from University of Miami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Puppy growled in frustration, putting on a crooked and forced smile for Larry, like a parent would do for a particularly stupid child. \"Let me explain this slowly, so my words can sink into that thick simian skull of yours. <b>YOU</b> are a <b>Corrupter.</b> Ooh, I know \"Corrupter\" is a big word for ya, but keep listening. Now a Corrupter is a soldier of the Haitian God Agua, and the receiver of his virus.

You have unlimited power and NO responsibility. Hell, you actually <b>HAVE</b> a responsibility to have as much fun and devour as many people as possible.

The victim is none other than Kate's little sister Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's head has long shaggy hair with a bow on top. You would find her to be the cutest little sister ever.

The sight of Luna's neck stump made Kate more upset. Though Luna's headless body comforts her as much as possible. As they walked, they then spotted a pale looking girl with a scythe. It is her the Guillotine Girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's body guided Kate away as they ran away from the supernatural being. They would go up hills, over the swamps, got through logs, climb up to trees. The Guillotine Girl seems to know where they are. There was almost no escape.

Alex's head held her breath, though she has no lungs which made it easier. Kate got out slowly with Luna's head and left with everybody together, except for Alex's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate puts her head back on her original body and so does Luna. Alex however is stuck as a head tied to Luna's waist. Alex was really disapointed, but was glad that Kate and Luna are back together,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate? I'm so glad to see you.\", said Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't go running off like that again.\", said Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.

But first we need to rest.\", said Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but first thing tomorrow is Operation Get my pretty body back.\", said Alex's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three then went Kate and Luna's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guillotine Girl looked around for her new friend. She was worried sick about losing someone that is close to her. The pale girl told all of her headless servants to look all over the mansion. The demon sat on a chair to rest after searching for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Luna. I miss you already. You were the only person that understands me. In fact, I like you, no wait, I love you.\", said The Guillotine Girl who started crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should worry about what you have than what you don't have.\" said a head who came rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maribelle, I didn't notice you here.\", said the Guillotine Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts literally the head that gave Kate advise in finding her sister and the Guillotine Girl herself some beauty tips. For the record, she is a blond female head with some curls that made her look all fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you miss Luna and you'll find her soon. Its not like she ran away since she has no feet and she would never do that.\", said Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you roll all the way here to tell me that?\",asked the Guillotine Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what friends do. I know some of your victims hate you and I started of being like that too, but after getting to know you and saw your time with Luna. I started like you more.\", said Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can be friends with any head who likes me. Luna can't be the only one.\", said the Guillotine Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit.\", said Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its getting late, time to go back to the shelves.\", said The Guillotine Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't do that. Let me sleep by you.\", said Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale demon just did as the head said. She did give her some good advice so she does deserve some sort of reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Kate and Luna's house, Kate called Alex's parents that Alex is staying over for school reasons. However its just to hide the fact that Alex is stuck as a head. Kate and Luna for a time test out their new ability to take off their heads and swap them around. Alex also joins in the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having Kate's body makes me feel so big and my chest feels heavy.\", said Luna's head on Kate's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My original body has a better chest than your sister.\", said Alex's head on Luna's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up.\", said Kate's head on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey swapped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me, I'm a head again.\", said Luna's head on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a plain looking body, it feels nice.\", said Alex's head on Kate's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I have my little sister's body again.\", said Kate's head on Luna's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kept at it again for the night. In the morning after breakfast, the three got ready to look for Alex's body. Luna and Kate looked as if they were ready for camp while Alex's head is in Kate's backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay in there?\", asked Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I have hands, I'll give a thumbs up.\", said Alex's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now off to the woods.\", said Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three then headed to the woods.

I was stuck there for who know how long. Its all thanks to that demon who snuck up behind me.

I'll find your body and have some fun at the same time.\", said Sonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\", said the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sonia went out to party at the same time looking for Elise's body. So far she made no progress at all and forgot to ask about what Elise's body looks like. She then went to the head who seemed to be bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to ask, what does your body look like?\", asked Sonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a black dress with some a Gothic look.

However, those two men are still after you, and their is an enemy agent on the loose who you do not recall their identity... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory B, You and Max try to sneak to the top of the stairs to see who was at the door.

You both wake up in completely different place, the secret base of this mysterious organization. The two men are in the room, and one explains that you and Max were the first test subjects of your government's teleportation project, but they had sabotaged the device. The Matter Slammer had transported you and Max to the abandoned, old house without any memories. Additionally without you and Max appearing at the correct location, your government was likely to abandon the project and label it a failure. This would allow this group to have the only working Matter Slammer, if only theirs actually worked. The two men reveal a terrible, mashed-up creature, the result of their Matter Slammer. It was something crossed between a dog and snake. It had the head, legs, and tail of a dog, but its body was long and scaly. One of the men explain that their teleportation device scrambles and mixes whatever is being transported. Their team had been working on a fix to the problem, and they now need to test it. Since you and Max are now MIA, you make the perfect test subjects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first bad ending is where you and Max manage to escape right away from the two men. Running down hallways, you find an open room to hide in. After closing and locking the door, you and Max realize that you are where this group's Matter Slammer is located. Unfortunately, there is no other way out and the agents are trying to break in. You Max agree to use the teleporter separately to avoid being mixed-up together. He goes first and successfully disappears. You then activate the machine for yourself, but the process was taking too long. The men manage to break down the door and swarm in side. Wisely, none of them try to approach you for fear of being teleported with you. But the mashed-up dog/snake lunges to attack you just as the Matter Slammer activates. You are suddenly in an open field. Max spots you and runs away in fear. You realize that the dog/snake and been mixed up with you. Fur and scales cover your body, and you have sharp claw-like hands. What do you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second bad ending stems from where you and Max decide to play along, waiting for a better opportunity to escape. The two men leave you, handcuffed, in the small room. Reasoning that you and Max are secret agents, you try to see if either of you have any special gadgets that can help you escape. Max finds a device hidden in his shoes and pulls it out. The device has two buttons with two tiny labels, 'Para' and 'Emer'. Neither of you have any idea what they mean, but you both decide agree on the 'Para' option. Max pushes it, and a gas spews out that paralyses you both. The men from before return at a later time and find you and Max still paralyzed. They place you both in the Matter Slammer and activate the device. Moments later, you and Max materialize standing in an empty field beside each other, miles away from the enemy agency's base, and the paralysis has worn off too. Unfortunately, you realize that you are not standing beside Max. You and Max are standing in the same spot, with only one body between you. Both of you heads are attached to the same shoulders. What do you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould this story start from the first or second 'bad ending'?</span></div></div>",
