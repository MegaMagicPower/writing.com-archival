What's worse, looking down alerts you to the fact that you're completely naked! Can you find your way home in a strange world where all forms of life (all plants, animals, and humans) have an undying obsession with tickle-torturing your most sensitive spots, or will you be stuck here forever, a tickle-slave to all various types of life here? Spoiler alert, it's the latter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n- You start out completely nude, and are not allowed to ever wear any clothing.<br>\r\n- Every single lifeform, including all humans, all animals, and all plants, are completely obsessed with tickle-torturing you.<br>\r\n- There is no way to escape, and you are stuck here forever.</td>",
