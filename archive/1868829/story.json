Three legendary heroes stumbled upon the burial ground of a sealed dark lord and when they got close the monster awaken sapping the power of the heroes, not much is known after that but this has awaken the full power of lord Akron that released a shock wave that those around miles felt which revived the dead becoming his evil servants. Akron was a demonic entity that exists for chaos and domination thus he had a endless army of undead and demonic beings that ravaged the land and destroyed entire armies in a single blow, this was the darkest time of history and the world was enveloped under a dark cloak and endless night until nine heroes came that pierced the corrupted lands and seemingly undefeatable armies and purged both, this tipped the balance of the war towards defeat of Akron by the heart of where it began, the fallen lands. The leader of the group was named Zero, it was said that he was an equalizer for his mask of day and dusk, his armor with a yin-yang symbol, long silver hair and his two blades one with the pitch darkness of the night and another with the illumination and glow of the sun itself, this man led a last assault on the fallen lands on where Akron\u2019s throne will fall with his army. With raised morale and improved arsenal the armies once lost in the dark came with the full power of light and hope cutting through the army that once slaughtered them while Zero with his eight associates faced against Akron with unrelenting force and assaults that eventually defeated and ridded Akron the face of middle earth. With all the dark army vanquished, peace was restored in the land but the damages done has been scarred for centuries to come and thus the legend ends here and hope to all that this evil will never arise again\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the year 2104 where magic and technology exists and the world is seperated by factions that are usually at conflict at each other. You are either a part of these factions or one of the dark armies that want to rule the world, each set of charecters have their own story which can ignore each other or eventually meet with each other, each one determines the fate of earth, so are you on the path of good or evil? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way the faction trying to combine the other factions is called the Alliance which the following factions are apart of it, Darkwatch, Ancients, Holy Knights, Splinter cells, and B.I.A (Brothers-In-Arms or brotherhood-In-Arms, same thing) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also forgot to mention (All) the 9 heroes in the storybook, you know if anyone wants to do some sort of descendent or treasure hunting their weapons or some plot thing I don't want to know about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero- Main hero, already explained<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFerro Abyss- Bird anthro, the master assassin of the group who's knowledge of stealth, counter-tactics, and status effects made him deadly on the field <br>\r\nWeapon- Vera laminae percussori (Blades of the true assassin)<br>\r\n <br>\r\nVorgan Lovic- Orc, the heavy beserker that wouldn't let anything stand in his way. When it came to clearing a path through an army, he delivers and destroys everything in the process. <br>\r\nWeapon: Mace of the molten core (Guess what? Earthquakes!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna Ecluse- Night elf, the master mage that has the power of the night and sun, light and darkness, the beginning and end of time. A powerful ally. <br>\r\nWeapon: Baculum tempus (The staff of time)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHondew Casmodan- Dwarf, the master of drinking till he drops and demolitionist.

The experianced inventor that created many traps, invented new weapons, and the only one that had a gun<br>\r\nWeapon: praestantissimum magnum <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegolis Amick- Wood elf, the master archer that had deadly accuracy and never missed a target. Very useful in both long range and short range as he is quick with a blade as his sight is sharp. <br>\r\nWeapon: Arcus aquila (Bow of the eagle)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvila Quin- Human. The immoveable force that is her impenetrable armor and shield, no matter how powerful the attack she never seemed to move in the slightest. She became the guardian in the group who covered the others as she sustained unlimited forces while they attack. <br>\r\nWeapon: impenetrabilis metallum murum and Herbam susceptor (The impenetrable shield and blade of the protector)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVindicus Ignis- Fire demon, the defector. Vindicus was a general in Akron's army, but then something changed after a certain someone felt their aura and changed their heart. Now he was a fighter in the group as the fire expert, who defeated many, many opponents with masterful fire magic that incinerated everything into black, charred corpses. <br>\r\nWeapon: Infernalis herbam inferus (Infernal blade of inferno) </span></div></div>",

Tech was short, Asian, had blue eyes, black thick hair, was skinny, and had yellow and blue armor that had electricity runinng throough it, he had tesla gautlets, on his arm was aparently a modified pip-boy which i didn't think there was anymore in existence, he was the best technician ever and my best friend since training camp, Natalie was about average, slim, red hair in a ponytail, blue eyes, and had grey robes with golen runes and a white staff that glows, she was fresh from the academy and was the top of her class so i don't exactly know much about her. The location we were going was an outpost on the outskirts of vernous, a reasearch facility specializing in energy and magical weaponry .To pass the time we made small talk on the way there,<br>\r\n\"Its amazing i got promoted to Captain eh Tech?\" i asked him<br>\r\n\"Yeah Viktor you are one of the best because of your skills and your sight\" He said<br>\r\n\"So what are we doing at this outpost?\" Natalie questioned<br>\r\n\"Its just routine check-up on their development, we don't exactly want anything to happen to their systems do we?\"I answered<br>\r\n\"I'll be speaking to the ones in charge of development, Tech will be checking systems to make sure the defence systems are okay and Natalie will be checking the quality and supply of the source of energy\"I said<br>\r\n Right when we landed i saw the outpost and it was very impressive, the soldiers were wearing white armor that looked very futuristic by my standards and looked wierd, they had orange visors so i couldn't see their faces, they had white pulse rifles with a blue energy eminatting from the side of their weapons so i guess that was the ammunition, the base was just amazing and so advanced and very white. The wall was the only thing not white and it was a thick titanium wall with guards stationed on heavy weaponry, behind the wall was artillery that could impress the boomers by the magnitude of it. The buildings had plasma windows and white walls which i am not sure what its made of, oh and there were hover tanks and jeeps here and there.<br>\r\n\"Wow the holy knights are damn advanced it goes over the limit of the other factions\"I said<br>\r\n\"Yeah its a shame that we can't share this with the rest of the world, of course that might lead to more conflict or peace its hard to say, oh for future refrences the ones with the things sticking out of them are Arch-Angels, they can fly and have plasma rifles normally, the ones with heavier armor are the elite guard with gauss rifles and plasma blades, the other soldiers are regular's with generic white armor with solar rifles, holy blades, and things like staffs\"Tech said<br>\r\n\"Don't we have jobs to do here?\"Natalie said<br>\r\n\"We do, i'll be inside while you two go somewhere\"I said <br>\r\nI walked inside the main building and walked towards the head researchers office to see that there were alot of scientist's running back and forth through the doors meaning it must be busy often in this area but thats off topic and i continued to the office until.... </span></div></div>",

When i reached outside i just stood there looking as the wall was torn to shreds and giant demonic shadow attacking the soldiers that are fighting hard against them, the things that i was seeing right now were nothing i ever saw in all the battles i have fought, the giant dark creatures had giant morbid axes and swords and were killing the infantry, i saw smaller darklings running and flying amok fighting the soldiers, the things looked very grotesque and evil with blood shot eyes like the giants. Both sides seemed at a stalemate with the enemies numbers getting cut down and evaporating into dark aura and the soldiers with artillery being slaughtered, the scene was a mess with destroyed defences, dead bodies strewn everywhere ripped apart, destroyed buildings with blazing infernos and among that mess i only thought of where my teammates are. I looked around me and saw that i was surronded by those flying and fast things to see a better look at them. The flying things had wings that looked weathered and old, the body was rotting and looked skeletal, the face looked like a demonic skull with sharp teeth and a long snout, the small fast things had blades for arms and legs or claws on the arms and legs but notherless both looked like a  combination of metal and biological based on the limbs and body, dark and metallic skeleton, the head had sharpnels of metal lodged inside and the teeth were sharp and metal. <br>\r\n\"Oh fuck me, well if you want a piece of me you will have to answer to my shotgun!\"I yelled when i pulled out my custom shotgun which was a spaz-12 but silver and has a scope and laser-dot. They came at me all at once and i shot and blew them off one by one until there were all gone and their bodies disappeared into black aura,<br>\r\n\"Jeez what the heck were tho-AH! my legs what the.........oh crap i forgot my flank!\"I said in pain while i look at the thing that took me out and it was one of the blade runners (My name for the dark runners) it was about to make the finishing blow when bursts of electricty came at it and killed it, i turned my head to see who it was and it was-</span></div></div>",

I grabbed my arm worrying about the metal pieces lodged into it, where the hell were the medics? I look behind me to see two regular soldiers, a male elf which seemed like a healer, and a anthro female fox who was a medic by the first aid sign on the chest.<br>\r\n\"You two get the captain into the infirmary, Vim you go with them he is in critical condition and needs to go into the auto-doc\" commanded the fox<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" both the soldiers said and then they carried Viktor in a portable plasma stretcher to the infirmary and the elf went with them healing Viktor on the go,<br>\r\n\"Let me see that arm\" said the fox, i held my arm out and she carefully pulled out the metal fragments, it hurted a little but not that much,<br>\r\n\"This place has gone to hell and those things are everywhere, so mine telling me your name?\" i asked \"Mine is tech\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Alyssa but i think that getting to know each other would make us to close to each other\" she said <br>\r\n\"Well then how well i repay you by removing the metal fragments out of my arm\" i joked<br>\r\n\"By not getting shot or stabbed on the way out\" she said bluntly, \"Okay i just removed all the pieces and i'm putting the gauss on your arm\" Just when she finished the wall was smashed opened and those dark runners came pouring out and charging,<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck no!\" i yelled, i then raised my free tesla gauntlet and fired at the hoard, \"Ah i wish i had my plasma rifle\" and then someone fired a volley of plasma and solar energy, i look back to see three regular soldiers with solar rifles and two elite guard with gauss rifles. Instead of death we recieved back-up that are very good and don't suck at aiming since we were right in the middle. When that finished i went with the soldiers and gave Alyssa a halo-tape,<br>\r\n\"Here give this to Viktor when he gets out or download it into the auto-doc, well see you later i am going to help fend off those things\" I said while running outside, i look back to see her running to the infirmary, i know Viktor is my best friend but i have to help defend the base from being run over.

I ran into the armory and grabbed different weapons off the shelves then Tech and Natalie came in looking like death just stared down at them,<br>\r\n\"The battle went very poorly I just never seen those kinds of creatures before and I have seen mutations and screwed up experiments that didn't came close from what I saw out there\" Said Tech in a tired voice<br>\r\n\"The aura and darkness eminating from those entities are nothing like I have encountered before, it is full of misery, pain, wrath, I can't imagine who has the power to create those beings into that image and I have fought arch necromancers and demons that didn't have the power to construct those things\" said Natalie in a worried tone,<br>\r\n\"I have been through hell when I was a nomad and traveled far and wide to see every creature and construct that existed, when i joined there was even more hell in fighting powerful foes and traveling to places I didn't know that existed or were only told in fairytales, but today a great legend has came back from the depths of the void to take over the world and I need you two to help me gather up the other factions to see if they are willing to help the world alliance, now pack up supplies, ammo, weapons, anything, this is going to be a long journey oh and Tech call up the caravan robotic horses, its about time i pulled that out of workshop\" i said <br>\r\n\"I'm guessing we're not using vehicles because they use gas and these horses are customed made to be durable, fast, and the power cell are made to last?\" Tech said,<br>\r\n\"Just call up the horses and we can gallop into the bloody sunset\" I said, and so we gathered anything that will be useful and we weren't being stingy on supplies, we went out into the open to see that the soldiers were gathering the dead, seeing to the wounded, and there was several soldiers breaking down the door to what i think was the research facility and no one was doing anything to stop it, damn those guys are mad. We went out the broken down wall to see out to the forest that was severly damaged and there were several dryads around caring for nature, i heard galloping coming toward us and i saw five horses (Stallions) stop near us. We got on the horses and started to ride off out of the forest and into the sunset into the grasslands with mountains far off in the background and the wind flowing pass quickly, this is the beginning of the mission that can change the world and the call of adventure, it is in the blood of a adventuring nomad.         </span></div></div>",

But back to the dessert of Ares, it was strange there was a dramatic change of scenery where it was grassland, to a long stretch or rocky terrain, to an endless dessert. We were just on the boundaries and I could see fossilized trees and other vegetation, abandoned buildings that look like sandstone and battle-worn, destroyed artillery, tanks, jeeps, planes, etc. that are rusted and worn-out, and there were several rock formations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place, the land is filled with the blood of war and the anguished souls of thousands, it...it makes me worried what is this place?\"Questioned Natalie with a shiver <br>\r\n\"The dessert of Ares, surprisingly, used to be the fifth largest rainforest in the world, it had amazing amount of magical capabilities, a vast amount of vegetation, luscious landscapes, large population of fauna, and had about 23 clans who were some of the best scavengers in the world but a war happened two destructive factions, the boomers and firebugs, the boomers had the largest and best explosive and artillery in the world, the firebugs were experts in anything related to fire, from fire magic to incendiary rounds, to flamethrowers, and to firebombs and unfortunately the forest was the final battleground between these two factions and the battle lasted for two months to finish and incenerated the rainforest, fortunately the 23 clans had underground passageways and tunnels with multiple entry ways, but that was over 50 years ago and the clans turned into one known as the dessert rats, the scalvengers who hid underground and came up to use the remenants of the war to survive. I am not exactly sure how they were found out but apparently they can make anything out of the most useless materials and make an effecetive weapon.\" answered Tech<br>\r\n\"That might be the reason why we need them, their amazing skill in jury-rigging\"I said, \"Now lets traverse this dessert of war!\" i yelled and we rode our horses into the dessert. 20 minutes have passed and the only things we saw were the same things, the fragments of the long war and the strange rock formations, its surprising the dessert rats have lived underground in these conditions for so long.........<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute you said these people lived underground right?\"I asked Tech<br>\r\n\"Yeah i did....oh I am an idiot for not thinking of that, Viktor use your metal, sonar, movement sight anything i'll use my pip-boys sonar to detect movement underground\"He said, first i used my metal detection vision which was a bad idea since all i saw was metal fragments everywhere interfereing with my vision, with my movement-detection sight i can see something underground coming towards us....fast, I look around to see spots where skeletons were are moving,<br>\r\n\"Oh no incoming!\"Tech yelled and then mongolion death-worms came up of the ground....3 of them and what made it worser was that they were corrupted/dark versions of the regular ones, instead of flesh it was scales, and bad surprise is that they were spitting out fireballs and acidshots out of their mouths, and while that occured I looked back to see the skeletons coming back from the dead, the skeletons weren't dark versions but they still had the boomers Flak armor and grenade launchers, and the firebugs fire-resistant armor with flame throwers and staffs, <br>\r\n\"Oh great now we have to deal with the undead boomers and firebugs....and there are 19 boomers and 16 firebugs well we are screwed.....wait what the....th-they are helping us?\"He said in confusion, I looked over to see that the skeletons weren't attacking us, they were actually helping us for once, but at that moment i heard someone but i couldn't tell where it was coming from, I looked for the source and saw that it was-</span></div></div>",

I went to an armor blacksmith which there was a male dwarf (I think) with blonde hair at the counter examining a big rifle an orc in the corner sharpening steel at a grindstone, and a cat person with brown fur (Which i don't know their species' name) working on a piece of armor on a work bench, <br>\r\n\"So what can i do yer' for\" said the dwarf in a heartly voice..still don't know the diffrence between male and female dwarfs <br>\r\n\"Can you fix up my armor it is kind of broken in several places\" I asked, i took off my armor and put on spare armor which was leather armor, then gave him the armor,<br>\r\n\"This armor seems very high-quality and customized, the broken areas are relatively easy to fix, so would that be what kind of currency, we also take trade\" The dwarf said<br>\r\n\"Hm...*I rumaged through my back pack\" would this laser pistol and sawed-off shotgun do?\" I asked   <br>\r\n\"The laser pistol i can use for parts and the sawed-off is perfect for a weapon i'm making, sure this will do, come back soon for the armor or we'll use it as scrape armor, Ur'im I have armor for you to fix!\"The dward yelled and the cat person looked away from his work bench, and headed toward him <br>\r\n\"This armor seems easy to fix with reinforced scrap-metal and melted bone, this is easy to fix\" The cat-person said in a intersted tone, then he ran back with the armor to his workbench. <br>\r\nI walked out of the blacksmiths shop and remebered where it was, i walked around the marketplace seeing more inhabitants than i thought there was, i was just walking past the training centers when i heard someone yelling inside the shooting range i checked inside to see who it was and there was Johnny shooting with his magnums at high speeds and reloading abnormally fast, and there was several marksmen and duelists awed at his skill. I walked over to him tapped him on the shoulder and had two magnums to my face,<br>\r\n\"Oh god damn it Viktor don't sneak up on me like that, I nearly blew your brain to the wall!\" He yelled <br>\r\n\"Honestly take off your gas mask it is kind of freaking me out a little, oh and I have a request for you\" I said <br>\r\n\"Oh my gas mask I forgot to take it off\"He said, when he took off his hood and gas mask Johnny looked quite young, had hazel but forlorn eyes, short black hair, and he had several scars across his forehead, and I am damn sure that he his ethnicity would be hispanic, \"Okay then what did you want to ask me?\" he questioned<br>\r\n\"Look do you want to join my team to see the world and save it?\" I asked him<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know really, I have lived in the underground since I was born, and I am not sure if I can just part with it, you know i'll meet up with you later after I figure out my decision for going\"He answered<br>\r\n\"Sure I understand if you don't want to leave, to leave your home and life-long friends, just meet me later somewhere if you made your decision, i'll be in the market place if you need me\" I said<br>\r\n\"To see the world or stay loyal to my dear friends...i hope i don't make a bad choice\"He said nervously<br>\r\n\"Everyone has a destiny and fate to create and fulfill, your decision might put you on track or change it forever, its your choice and I won't force you to join\"I said<br>\r\n\"Well see you later\"He said<br>\r\n\"Right after i get the sand out of my eyes\"I joked....             </span></div></div>",

In the room was a series of minecart systems and alot of tunnels and what I think are glow stone covering the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the underground express way minecart style and before you ask, how this works is that the tracks that are glowing yellow by the rails are supposed to give us a boost and how that works is that they are powered by redstone which is in abundant resource we have here\" Johnny said<br>\r\n\"Wait what is redstone and what the heck does this remind me of.....it seems familiar\"I said<br>\r\n\"Just get in the minecarts and i'll flip the switch...and by the way don't piss off the skeletons\"Johnny said<br>\r\nWe all jumped into the minecarts, Johnny was reading an old map on the wall which shows the extensive minecart system which he flipped several levers and we were on our way. The ride wasn't all that bad, well it was the first time I seen something like this and it was going faster than expected since it ended in about five minutes. We all walked out off the minecarts and they were sent back to who knows where and we just went up the stairs to see we were out on the boundary of the dessert.<br>\r\n\"Wait if you people had this why didn't you all leave?\"Tech questioned<br>\r\n\"Actually everyone knew about this and it was their decision to leave or not but either it was the amount of resources instilled in the sands or the people respecting their descendants its very varied.\"Johnny answered.<br>\r\n\"So Tech where are the horses?\"I asked<br>\r\n\"They are very close to our position just give me a moment and........now\"He said when five stallions just came over the kill quickly.<br>\r\n\"Well I hope you guys packed up your stuff because we are moving to Mono'lithos oros, home of the Royal Blacksmiths\"I said<br>\r\n\"The Royal Blacksmiths, they make some of the best armor and weapons in the world I could make some intresting things there\"Johnny said with awe<br>\r\nAfter that was settled we went along the divide toward the mountains it could take several days but we were confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took us approximately 3 days to make it to the mountain range but from the look of it it wasn't going to be easy to find the royal blacksmiths because according to Techs world map the Mono'lithos Oros mountain range is the one of the most dangerous and largest mountain ranges in the world. So out of all the paths to take we took the one based off of Techs mapping to be the best and safest one, usually Tech is right about things like these but this time I am not to sure. With our horses we trecked up the mountain and soon meeted something we didn't expect.....   </span></div></div>",

Well I just hope I don't find some of those answers soon. We were just walking through a overpass when there was alot of loud noise coming out of nowhere, we look around for the source but it was right under us and Natalie was standing on top of it, one of the monoliths came out of the ground and was charging up a ice attack,<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck us...Tech anything we need to know about these monliths?\"I asked<br>\r\n\"Besides the high-defence, high ice magic capabilities, and its weakness to fire and explosives, you better have some sort of ice-resistance because it is going to be a winter wonderland all up in th-\" Tech was cut off when the monolith fired its beam of ice at both of us and we dodged it, I took out my custom spaz-12 and loaded it with explosive ammunition and just repeadily reloaded and unloaded on the monolith, while Natalie was behind it firing fireballs from her staff and Tech was messing with his Tesla gloves and pip-boy...i'm guessing he was recalibrating his gloves because he probaly was going to do shit against the monolith. It didn't take long for the monolith<br>\r\nto go down into pieces. We continued on in there with more caution and less patience waiting for Johnny to come back from his scalvenging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later we were in a location where there was a semi-flat rocky soil area with a mountain hanging over head with a waterfall coming out of it making it to the bottom where we were and making a river right there, and there was a clear view on mountain range, it was both breath taking and a defintion of nature's finest, we heard galloping behind us to see that Johnny finally caught up with us with a bag full of material. <br>\r\n\"Hey guys I told you I can catch up and\"Johnny cut himself off to see the scenery, \"Wow the view is great and there's a waterfall over us....wait how is there water on the mountain and unless theres an unlimited resource of water up there or the water is defying gravity\"Johnny joked, but then we heard loud rumbing and the ground shaking, \"Wait what the heck is that?\"questioned Johnny, and then a large group of monoliths came juttering out of the ground around us.<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck its a trap!\"I yelled<br>\r\n\"More like a ambush and...incoming!\"Yelled Natalie, I look around me and saw that all of the were charging up ice magic and with the number of them and their incredible amount of magic power, we will be incased in an ice prison, I pulled out a grenade belt and just threw it at the group of monoliths and shot it with the shotgun and it caused a big break in their lines,<br>\r\n\"Now run!\"I yelled at my team and they all scrambled behind me through the monoliths firing at them while dodging their ice magic. This run was going well until we hit a dead end and we were about to be sent to the ice age. The monoliths were moving towards us somehow and more kept popping up from the ground, we all thought we were screwed until.......     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When we were prepared Natalie blasted a large stream of fire at the monoliths, me and Johnny were shooting rapidly at the monoliths, and Tech shot fire balls at the monoliths while the others were doing their own thing. This lasted for several minutes, and when the smoke and dust cleared out all there remained was just rubble, the embers from the fight were still floating in the air, and Johnny was on fire, which put an overkill on friendly fire<br>\r\n\"Johnny your on fire, and no not metaphorically your actually on fire\"I said, Johnny turned to look at me and he is not feeling it,<br>\r\n\"I know that, this is nothing compared to what I face in the dessert, heck my friends chili burns more than this!\"He joked<br>\r\n\"Okay then I am going to say thanks to the people that helped us\"I said<br>\r\n\"Hey..HEY!\"I yelled at the 5 people that helped us, all of them turned to look at me, \"By the way thanks for the assistance I am pretty sure we would have been over runned by how many there were\"I said<br>\r\n\"Hey its no problem, just doing whats right\"Said the orc<br>\r\n\"Bye the way how did you know we needed help?\"I asked<br>\r\n\"The elf over there sensed a large dispurstment of magical energy and we decided to check it out and then we saw you and your group being cornered by those monoliths\"Said the tiger anthro<br>\r\n\"Eh, names aren't necessary if we see each other only once\"Said the dwarf,<br>\r\n\"By the way any of you guys from the royalblacksmiths, we came to see them\"I asked<br>\r\n\"Well we actually came up here to train, and the guy in black armor isn't with us so ask him, well see you later, and don't get killed by something stupid!\"said the orc, and all of them exept the man in black armor left, I looked to see the other guys seemed in good condition, and I ran up to the black knight<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello are you part of the royalblacksmiths?\"I asked him<br>\r\n\"Yes of course I am, why do you think I am in full armor, in the mountains, with a giant dark sword?\"he answered roughly<br>\r\n\"Can you take us to your factions base?\"I asked <br>\r\n\"Yeah sure just follow me through this waterfall\"Said the Knight<br>\r\n\"Of course it had to be a waterfall, oh and guys get over here, this guy is going to lead us to the blacksmiths!\"I yelled over to them and they ran over to the waterfall where I was already inside it, the waterfall secret entrence was damp, illuminated with glowing crystals, and was bigger than I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had to travel close to the knight since he was in one hell of a hurry, plus the place was a maze which I am not sure how these people memorize the maze path but we were definitely getting closer since we ended up in a long tunnel with a piercing light at the end. At the end of the tunnel we were all blinded for a second but once we got a good look at the view it was amazing. It was a giant chamber or opening with several giant pillars holding the ceiling up, eight water falls encircling the chamer and it all leads to the center where it spreads more into small tunnels, the homes were made of stone and metal, the inhabitants were all wearing some form of armor and there were alot of diffrent armor, there were the distinct sounds of mining and tunneling inside the walls and I saw that there were several quaries around the place. and there was a giant building on the far side of town where there were glass panes with swords, hammers, pick-axes, fists, and other things. <br>\r\n\"Wow this place is one heck of a mining town\"Tech said<br>\r\n\"This place is damn heaven\"Johnny said with awe<br>\r\n\"Hm isn't this place known for making the best weapons, armor, and enchantments?\"Questioned Natalie<br>\r\n\"That is true miss, there is nothing in the world that beats our craftsmenship\"<br>\r\n\"How do you get the magical quality then?\"Natalie questioned, \"I see these peoples aura and I sense no kind of spiritual or magical power\" <br>\r\n\"We get the enchantment strength from the monoliths and make it our own, and those things are handy\"The knight said<br>\r\n\"Are the monoliths usually that hostile?\"I asked<br>\r\n\"Not really, unless you just pissed the entire nest off but they are usually docile, hm I wonder why\"The knight said <br>\r\n\"Are these monoliths senstive to magical disturbances?\"Tech asked<br>\r\n\"Yes they are, if there is a large magical disturbance in the world those monoliths go ballistic\"The knight said<br>\r\n\"Damn it, the faster we do this the less fear these people would have to live in\"I said<br>\r\n\"So I'm guessing I should lead you to the leaders\"The knight said<br>\r\n\"Now lets go\"I said, while we were walking across town to the giant building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town was just full of expiranced blacksmiths and it was very lively to with an intresting custom, it would be an intresting place to live in if it weren't for my mission. We entered the main hall of the blacksmiths and surprise, surprise there were people training in blacksmithing in one area, people training in melee weapons in one, people training in unarmed in another, and mining training, these were marked by the insignia on the door ways and we went upstairs to see the bar room by the looks of the door with liquor on it. We entered to see alot of people having the time of their lives, drinking and playing decks, and there were several people at the front where I assume were the leaders, when we were walking through the area I noticed that most of the people in the bar were dwarfs which wasn't really surprising. When we arrived at the table of leaders there were 4 people at the table drinking. One of them was a dwarf which had his back to us and was drinking his heart out, the guy had orange hair, had myrthil leggins and leather straps on his chest only and the guy had alot of muscle, one of them was a young human man who was sitting in front with blue eyes, blonde long hair, wearing adamante armor, and he had 5 swords sheathed on him, there was a female sitting on the right but I can't tell what race she is, she was very tall, was wearing stone armor with alot of runes that are black, and she had no weapons, and finally there was a orc with a hammer sitting on the right, he had golden armor.  <br>\r\n\"Say hello to the four leaders of the royalblacksmiths, Lantz, the anthro...something I forgot, Orioke' the orc, Honeydew the dwarf, and Matt the human, as you can tell these are the leaders of this place, and this faction is called the royalblacksmiths because of their skills in crafting and smithing, now this faction used to be four diffrent sets of classes best at what they do but they combined after a long time of pride and argument\"Said The knight,<br>\r\n\"Okay then thats enough Boreal\"Said Matt <br>\r\n\"Of course sir\"Said Boreal and he went to drinking,<br>\r\n\"Long story short can you join the alliance to defeat a ancient evil\"I asked<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, but on one condition, and one condition only\"Said Orioke <br>\r\n\"Yeah what is it, it could be anything\"I said<br>\r\n\"You have to beat us in_________\"  </span></div></div>",

I brought out my spaz-12 and started firing rapidly and there was a problem, when I started to get closer his blade all of his blades jewels were glowing and a rainbow aura surrounded the blade and a blast of all the jewels came at me, I dodged it but I looked back to see it had made a giant hole in the wall. <br>\r\n\"Holy hell these guys are tough, they aren't using magic and they are beating us were brute strength and finesse!\"I yelled <br>\r\n\"Oh easy for you to say I am getting *gets kicked in the groin* OW, why you little eat rapid fire!\"Johnny yelled and he fires and reloads 8 consequtive times for several seconds into one spot on Lantz's armor, knocking her back hard out of the arena and into the wall,<br>\r\n\"Okay I am definitely down\"Lantz said before fainting, <br>\r\n\"Okay I am ready to assist you guys and-\"Johnny was cut off by Tech<br>\r\n\"Oh help me then I am getting my ass chased by this LUNATIC NOW RUN!\"Tech yelled and ran while Johnny just ran with him still shooting at Honeydew, <br>\r\n\"You know with all their drinking they should be easier to beat!\"yelled natalie with several cut marks on her and Matt seemed to not give a single damn with the sand,<br>\r\n\"Ehr...you have got to be kidding, according to my preliminary scans of the leaders it appears their skills are begining to dull from all that drinking but also their aggresion has risen. Yet they can still talk without any drunken indictation\" Tech said and then he fell and got smacked clear out of the arena and out of the room by Honeydews hammer, <br>\r\n\"And he is out!\"Honeydew laughed and then got assaulted at close range by Johnny with alot of fury shooting, <br>\r\nI looked over to Natalie and she got a sword through her shoulder, and then Matt stopped swinging<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing your already done, now get out before you lose your arm\" Matt said and Natalie got out of the arena gripping her wounded shoulder, and then he looked at me while I was still shooting at orioke and dodging while he had his sword on the air jewel, \"Okay you are next, I am coming Orioke'!\"Matt and yelled and he charged at me with his blades, <br>\r\n\"Oh come on I am getting destroyed here!\"I yelled and then I got thrust stabbed by orioke's blade and repeadly got slashed by Matt, \"Oh that fucking hurts, Johnny what the hell is taking you I am getting owned here!\"I yelled more at Johnny and he just threw Honeydew out of the arena,<br>\r\n\"I just finished with this guy I am coming Viktor!\" He yelled and then he just pissed off Matt by shooting him in the back with phosphorous rounds,<br>\r\n\"Hey what the?!\"Matt said in surprise when he blew up, and surprisingly he went down, \"Ah that was a cheap shot!\"Matt yelled and he just scuttled out of the arena, now it was me and Johnny vs Orioke' and his blade of doom. <br>\r\n\"You may have defeated the others but you won't find me so easy to beat\"Orioke' yelled and his blade turned to the turqouise gem and his blade became ghostly, \" Try to beat my phantom blade, it is a unique blade made to ignore armor and used to cut your very soul\"Said Orioke' then he charged at us and both of us dodged his blade,<br>\r\n\"Uh if its a phantom blade do bullets go through it?\"Johnny questioned and he aimed at Orioke'<br>\r\n\"I guess\"I responded and Johnny repeadedly shot him but the ghost blade absorbed the bullets and flinged back phantom bullets,<br>\r\n\"Oh you have got to be kidding me, incoming!\"I yelled and both of dodged the bullets. <br>\r\n\"Any idea on how to beat him?\"Johnny questioned, and then I pulled out a binary sword and a indonesian blade and I gave Johnny the indonesian blade,<br>\r\n\"We beat him the old fasion way, now CHARGE!\"I yelled and we both came at him with our blades.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOrioke' was damn surprised to see what we did but not enough that he just froze, in fact he swung horizontally and Johnny jumped over it and did a downward slash on Orioke' but I got hit by the blade and it went past my armor, I gripped by abdomen in pain, the blade hurted like hell but Orioke' was paying attention to me and not Johnny and then Johnny struck struck the armor knocking Orioke' back and Johnny used that moment to pull out him dual magnums and shot armor-piercing rounds rapidly, and then Orioke went down. Everyone in the room suddenly went quiet, everyone had a shocked look on the faces, it was silent for a few seconds until the dwarven announcer yelled,<br>\r\n\"The leaders have lost and the challengers are the winners!\"He yelled and the drunks went into an outburst cheer. I walked towards Orioke', arm still on my abdomen and said,<br>\r\n\"I guess we will have your faction to help us all in our fight\", Orioke' then got up and looked me right in the eyes,<br>\r\n\"Yes your team is really strong and will get our factions strength, oh and by the way I am giving you a teammate as a sign of acceptance, Boreal get over here!\"Orioke' yelled and the dark knight came again,<br>\r\n\"Yes sir?\"Boreal questioned <br>\r\n\"I am giving you an assignment to go with this team and assist them on their journey\"Orioke' commanded<br>\r\n\"It would be an honor sir\"Said Boreal and he walked right up to me, \"So where should we go now?\"He questioned<br>\r\n\"Well right after we heal up we can move out to our next destination\"I answered, and then we all walk of the room with Natalie waiting outside bandaged and Tech bandaged on the head. <br>\r\n\"Viktor, both of us are ready by your side no matter our injuries and so forth, where is our next destination?\" Tech said <br>\r\n\"You guys are commited and there is no time to lose, the next destination is___________\" <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I sent a sizeable amount of soldiers to Sol, the city of light and the capital of the holy knights to help against an oncoming hoard of Akron's army. Now what I didn't expect was the amount of numbers there were and now they are all getting overrunned, now hurry I don't know how long they would last. Also there is a chance there would be other groups assisting since you were about the 8th one I contacted at the moment, that is if you get there\" Said Samson before the message was cut<br>\r\n\"Samson should really stop underestimating everything and how are we supposed to get there?\"I questioned, and then Boreal was contemplating about the situation,<br>\r\n\"The miner tunnelers, we can use them to drill our way to the city of light, the tunnelers are fast and durable and can be used in combat\"Boreal said<br>\r\n\"Okay good idea and our only one, TO THE TUNNELERS!\"I yelled and we all ran to the mining quarries. The miner tunnelers were worm-like machines that looked very worn from mining, the things had...rubbery things in them, alot of debris on it sides, several doors, and windows, and there was a drill on the end, Boreal went to one of the dwarven miners and then pointed to the tunneler saying something, then he went back to me,<br>\r\n\"Okay good news we can use the tunnelers and I got us several teams to back us up in the battle, theres no problems, theres no trick\" Boreal said and we all went inside the tunneler, the inside was more spacious than I thought and everything was bolted down, Boreal then went to the front to control the tunneler,<br>\r\n\"Hang on guys this will be a bumpy ride\"Boreal said and we all got in the chairs and strapped on.<br>\r\nWe went directly into the earth and all I see through the windows were rock, dirt, and occasionaly random ores but I couldn't tell because we were going so fast. <br>\r\nTo pass the time we all made conversation,<br>\r\n\"Hey Boreal what race are you and is that your actual name?\"I asked him and he was focused on driving,<br>\r\n\"I'm an Orc and yes Boreal is my name but I do not like it so just call me Dusk, its easier to remember and it matches my armor and blade\"Boreal said<br>\r\n\"Okay then Dusk, how long before we make it to Sol?\"I asked<br>\r\n\"About 25 mintues at the rate we are going and the distance from here\"Dusk said, then I looked at Tech<br>\r\n\"So how is this thing running and turning so quickly?\"I asked him<br>\r\n\"Well the tunnelers are made from really light, fine, and durable metal that allows alot of resistance against damage and gives it more aerodynamics, now it turns remarkaly well by what they used to connect the parts of the tunneler, which is bendable and durable material\"Tech said, and after that moment we all talked about the adventures they had before this all happened, Tech talked about him and his brother and how it went down by an accident, Natalie began to talk about her life story but we stopped her before she even began, Johnny talked about his life in the dessert and all his hardships, and I talked my old life as a nomad, and my lost family. We talked mostly about that before we got into our destination, <br>\r\n\"Tech what are their status?\"I asked him, and he checked his pip-boy for them,<br>\r\n\"Base, Sol, anyone what is your status?\"Tech said into the radio then there was alot of static then a voice, a female voice<br>\r\n\"Ah, took you long enough I thought we were going to be left for dead, hey where are you?\" Said the operator and Tech seems to have a wierd expression on his face<br>\r\n\"We are underground in tunnlers and we have several teams coming to assist you in battle. For some reason you sound like someone I met...you wouldn't happen to be a fox anthro named Alyssa would you?\" <br>\r\n\"Actually yes I am, wait you wouldn't happen to be-\"  <br>\r\n\"Incoming!\"The soldier yelled and there was a loud explosion, and Alyssa screamed in fear and the radio was cut,<br>\r\n\"Damn it when are we breaching the surface to help them?\" Tech question and the minute he said that we went flying out of the ground,<br>\r\n\"Shit too much speed, BRACE FOR IMPACT!\"Dusk yelled and we landed hard and I heard alot of screeching and war sounds.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe entire tunneler was wrecked and there were bodies of demons and undead inside of the tunneler, apparently we landed into a group of those things, there was still smoke and dust in the air so I couldn't see the battle field but I can distinctly hear the sounds of artilery fire, magic, and the sounds of different weapons filling the air, there were tons of yelling and explosions it was ridiculous, there were echoing roars throughout the field it was just chaos. I looked around to see who was still up and everyone was sort of okay, me, Dusk, and Tech were the only ones that somehow didn't have major injuries, Natalie and Johnny had giant gashes on their bodies and it looks like they couldn't fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke and dust cleared and I can see out of the ruined tunneler, there was just so many dragons and flying demons in the sky, so many demons and undead on the ground, so much death and destruction, the city of light, a humongous city with a gigantic angelic tower in the middle and many tall buildings, the city had powerful solar laser defences and a giant wall said to be unbreachable was beached, the holy knight soldiers were attacking vigourously with alot of aggression but they seem to be losing, even with the hover jets and saints (Basically a hover-copter but in a wierder shape and it shoots heated plasma and it can rebuild itself) with the heavy cannons and sphinxes (A wierd looking tank with plasma cannon and powerful defense, and it is glowing) it is still either ones matchers and it is a compleate devestation of a battle ground. <br>\r\n\"Damn there is so much destruction and blood spilt, its just utter annihilation of all things good, the power and army of Akron is just too much for the holy knights, Dusk where the hell are your tunneler teams?!\"I questioned, then there was a sudden increase in earth shaking and the ground started to crack, <br>\r\n\"Wait for it....and...NOW!\"Dusk yelled and 5 tunnelers came out of the ground (On the enemies side) and ran through alot of the darklings then stopped to reveal  a bunch of angry guys with melee weapons charging through attacking the dark army, <br>\r\n\"Holy hell those guys are strong and insane, wait what the, you managed to pull that out?\"I asked Dusk, and there was a release of rainbow energy,<br>\r\n\"Yes I got all four leaders to help, heck those guys love a challenge and don't give a crap about their injuries, besides I think they are already healed, more or less\" Dusk said, \"Hey why are we just standing here lets attack these bastards, attack!\"Dusk yelled and he ran and got on top of one of the dragons and stabbed his blade into it and they went into the air,<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\"I yelled and the entire team just fired at the large group of enemies, this is one hell of a battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of the battle Natalie was firing a compleate salvo of diffrent spells and just killed a bunch of monsters, several clerics and wizards went around her and did the same thing, Johnny jumped on top of one of the demons and used the vantage point from atop of the demon and shot up undead like a boss then he pretty much threw a grenade in the demons mouth and jumped off killing the demon in the most badass way, Tech adjusted his gloves to shoot holy blasts to kill alot of undead, and I just wanted to be a badass and went out charging into a group of dragons, grabbing on to one, hold on while shooting splinter grenades into dragons mouths which were effective and tons of enemies went down. With the assistance of leaders of the blacksmiths and their men and us acting like badasses and killing everything that managed to boost the soldiers will to fight, that and they didn't want to get outshined by a bunch of guys coming out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a battle of the legendary Light vs the darkness, the holy knights vs Lord Akrons army, yes it was a battle to brag about and to reminesce till your dead, but it wasn't the final battle, it was just small scale compared to what the final battle may turn up, but all of us aren't afraid of death, we have the will of those who are furious and have hope. We will slay those who stand on the path of darkness and we will continue what the ancestors of the past started. This battle is bloody and glorious with the souls of those who are commited and the will of those with faith and those who are not afraid to stray from the path they have chosen, wether they die or not depends on very little action and the amount of time left, will this battle escalate right now or wil this end today, I wondered. </span></div></div>",

There were tons of casualties on both sides. On the holy knights side there were tons of holy knights sprewn everywhere that were torn apart, crushed, and eaten, their vehicles that they used scattered the battle ground destroyed, and the city of light was partially destroyed and ablaze, on the side of darkness was hardly a casualty since the bodies of the minions started to disapate, their dark aura that controlled them started to fade into the air, the bodies turned to bone and dust and the souls of them left the bodies. <br>\r\n\"Akrons dark power is a danger to all, his power is said to be those of a demi-god, it is said in legend that he is immortal that he cannot be stopped thus he was sealed but now he is back to wreck havoc on this world of despair and war.

Now the shadowed lands is one of the most unknown lands in the world and the only info on the shadow lands is that it is home to the hidden, it is very dark since there is always a dark ominous cloud hovering over it, there was a lost civilization that was originally there due to the temples, it is a very dangerous land with preadtors and traps everywhere. We landed on the boundry of the shadow forest and had to pick out sepereate teams to see who stays on the saint and who goes into the forest and for a good reason. It has been known from over 20 accounts of diffrent teams that 12 dissapeared of the grid with their vehicle destroyed and no signs of a fight at all, the other 8 has reported being attacked from predators thought to be extinct, or according to what Tech readed on his pip-boy. The forest was extreamly dark and I could here all kinds of creatures even from the boundry of the forest. I took Alyssa and Johnny with me because Alyssa could heal one of us just in case we get attacked or get some sort of status effect, plus she could gather ant kind of reagreants or plants to use for potions or equipment, Johnny was with me for the fact that anything quick can come out of nowhere so Johnny will be the first to open fire for us to spot its location. Tech, Natalie, and Dusk were left behind for protection of the saint and backup in case things went down, plus Tech downloaded information on us so that if all of us were incapacitated he would know. All three of us entered the dark forest with weapons readied into the darkest forest of all time. For the travel part I had night-vision on (remember Viktor has the ability to see any vision through his own eyes) and my team mates had to pretty much stick close before getting lost in the dark. <br>\r\n\"Ugh it is damn dark in this forest, they don't call this place the shadow lands for nothing, how the hell does the hidden see in this darkness anyhow?\"Johnny questioned<br>\r\n\"I just realized something, why didn't we get flashlights, glowsticks, or anykind of light source?\"Alyssa questioned, I reached into my bag and pulled out glowsticks<br>\r\n\"Here, theres your light source, flashlights and lanterns might attract unwanted attention, these glowsticks will attract less attention since there are glowing mushrooms around and they don't do shit for light\"I said and we continued foward with me on point with the other two with glowsticks. <br>\r\nThe entire time through the forest there were all these ambiant noises of random birds and roars of diffrent creatures, but the entire time I thought we were being watched since we first entered the forest, I hope I was wrong and right, hoped it was the hidden faction that we needed to meet or wrong and it would be some sort of predator, but we continued on being cautious every second. Then the silence was broken, there was something coming towards us very quickly, and there was alot of them, it was______  </span></div></div>",

I could hear Johnny's magnums and it sounded like he was not hitting shit because it was so damn dark, I could also hear bottles breaking and all kinds of burning and wierd noises, I am guessing since Alyssa knows alot about healing and alchemy I am sure she is throwing bottles of something. The fight didn't last long and I heard both of them go down to the drown with a loud thud, someone picked me up off my feet and I think I was facing someone since I could hear...and smell them in front of them, jeez those guys stink,<br>\r\n\"You 3 are tressspasssers in the shadowed landsss, state your businessssss before we insert poison into you\"Said a male snake anthro, I think, <br>\r\n\"We are here to see the hidden leader, we need your help to fight Akron and his army of darkness\"I said, one of them removed my helmet and I think the snake was examining me, and he inserted something into me. <br>\r\n\"Hey what the hell did you do?!\"Johnny yelled and I could hear more fighting, but it was more physical with a fist fight and I heard a stabbing sound, but it is hard to hear since my hearing was being dulled and the blindness wasn't helping at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChange of POV to Tech---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\"I questioned and I looked at all the statuses of the team and It said that all of them were in a sleeping status, I looked over to Natalie and Dusk and both of them were watching the forest, \"Guys something happened in there, all of them are down we need to get in the forest!\"I yelled and both of them turned around,<br>\r\n\"No not all of us, both of you stay here I am going in myself and getting them out of whatever situation, don't worry about a thing I have seen darker and more dangerous things than this\"Dusk said and he began running into the forest, I knew the determination and grit he had even behind the helmet, he was not going to be stopped.<br>\r\n\"Should we be worried that our warrior that is supposed to tank all the damage when we get attacked left us?\"Natalie questioned and there were distant sounds of battle cries and roars of pain from whatever Dusk is attacking,<br>\r\n\"No I am sure that all of the predators and their mom are too focused on the psychotic warrior yelling and slashing\"I said and there was rustling in the bushes, \"Okay then I am wrong\" Then came a large group of dark and red-eyed velociraptors coming out of the bushes looking hungry, \"Oh thats what they meant by extinct predators....I am guessing those guys don't know what dinosaurs were\"I joked and I fired a volley of plasma and Natalie fired ice magic at the velociraptors,<br>\r\n\"I hate you Tech for the fact that you didn't mention dinosaurs before we went to the shadowed lands!\"Natalie yelled and she ran out of mana and resorted to smacking the velociraptors with her staff,<br>\r\n\"Didn't I say extinct predators? and where did all these things come from and how the hell did they get here?!\"I yelled and then I remembered to what they looked like, \"Oh shit these things are imbueded with dark power, still I will still be damned if there are actually dinosaurs here\"I said and I was shooting the last dark Velociraptor,<br>\r\n\"Is that all of them?\"Natalie asked and I checked my pip-boy sonar and saw a big target coming and heard roaring,<br>\r\n\"Yeah...no here comes a Tyrannosaurus Rex\"I said and a T-Rex came out of the trees, and of course it was imbueded with dark power and had the blood-shot eyes, exept this one had spikes coming out the head and back, \"Oh we are fucked\"I said and we both just fired, and thank god Natalie regained some mana but since this is a T-Rex I am damn sure we are half-screwed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitch POV to Dusk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just slashing and hacking through the plants and vicious creatures after me, of all my years of seeing diffrent creatures and magic I didn't think I would see a dinosaur....well technically they can be revived with necromancy but it is not perfect, but these were diffrent, yeah they were the ones you would see from the halo-taps and books exept these were infected with some sort of dark power and these had red-blood eyes. With a warrior in black armor with creatures with dark skin or scales, and the enviroment was verk dark, but still light enough to see SOMETHING it was very akward. I was running to see several bigger predators in front of me but these weren't infected with the dark powers the others had and these were actually alive without necro or magic,<br>\r\n\"Oh you have got to be kidding me, uh...please tell me that you are friendly-ish?\"I questioned and the bigger predators roared and charged passed me towards the dark dinos behind me, \"Okay then dark power vs wild...thats a new one..oh crap where the hell are those guys?\"I moved on foward in the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It was a damn pitch black in the murky waters so I used my night-vision to try to make it easier to travel through the underwater tunnels, but it did not help much since the water was damn murky. Almost a minute of swimming and I was starting to run out of air when I found air pockets in the walls, it really wasn't much but it would do. I repeated the process for around 10 minutes when I saw light breaking through the water, I turned off n-v and got out of the water to be standing in front of a wide stone hall way with multiple scratches and blood spatters on the wall, my eyes burned like hell from swimming in murky water but I'll live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, intresting this specimen has made it through the underwater test, fascinating, in any case try to pass the obstacle of your demise where many have failed and died\"Said a male in a creepy tone and I heard multiple mechanisms going off at once and the room turned into a deathtrap. There were just crushers on the floors and ceilings, fire jets scattering the area, poison dart traps littering the walls, spike traps on the floor, trap doors on the floor, clay soldiers with swords scatttered around the area, bladesaws moving in a sporadic movement and pattern, and the door was guarded by a guy with a wicked and demonic looking scythe.<br>\r\n\"Oh god I can see why people died here alot, who was the guy that designed this deathtrap!?\"I yelled and questioned<br>\r\n\"Are you going to pass the gautlet or face me and try to beat me with only your fists?\"Questioned the guard impatiently<br>\r\nI began cautiously tread the trap ridden room, wait for any openings, patterns, or flaws of the design as Tech always said,<br>\r\n\"In any puzzle, any design, and any creation there is always a flaw even if it is a split second\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen I remembered that I also remembered having a special scan sight where as it scanned creatures and a certain range of area and brings back info about them, everything. With the data collected it was being organized in my head for the right path and right timing, if I attempt to use the action and I am off by a single second I will be dead. The analyzing was done and I saw that there was a pattern in the movement of the traps and very slight flaws in the design, but I had to hurry and book it mainly because there were only one second openings, I readied for the right timing to move, waiting for the ceiling to go down and......NOW. I ran past the crusher and ran past the dart traps and fire jets as they were tailing me, when I reached the crushers and clay soldiers they were missing and got into the way of the crushes destroying them, the next obstacle the blade saws were hard to calculate since they were moving fast and there were running close into close proximities of each other, I continued to run barely avoiding the saws when one slashed through the armor a little and I made it to the final obstacle, the guard, well I hoped I didn't have to face him, and he seemed baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the...What the..Who the...well that was impressive, though you did kindof cheat with that sight of yours, I'll still take it\" The guard said <br>\r\n\"Can I pass through you now to talk to your leaders?\"I questioned and the guard stepped aside and I went through the door. <br>\r\nAmazingly I think I was in the sanctum of the Hidden since it was just a giant chamber with a giant tree stump in the middle, there were alot of species in black clothing or armor, and there was alot of glowing plants and glowing lanterns, I saw a anthro ocelot coming at me with a paper in her hands.<br>\r\n\"Congrats on making it past the death gautlet, not many ever pass through that, oh here this is the paper saying they will join the alliance, the freedom of your comrades, and we will give you a ally to join your quest oh and bye\"Said the Ocelot and everything started to de-materialize and everything went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up from the ground floor to see that the shadowed land forest seemed to get lighter and we can actually see something instead of darkness, I look over to see Johnny and Alyssa down on the ground, I heard someone yelling and it was Dusk, I couldn't exactly hear until he got closer,<br>\r\n\"Viktor, Alyssa, Johnny, Where the hell are you guys!?\"Yelled Dusk and he was coming out of the tree line,<br>\r\n\"We're over here, Johnny and Alyssa seem to be down but them seem okay\"I said and Dusk ran up to me with his blade out covered in black stuff,<br>\r\n\"We should get out of this place, its strange it seems this place just got brighter and-\" Dusk was looking at the paper I was holding\"Hey what is that?\"He questioned and I holded the paper up to my face,<br>\r\n\"Oh this, this is the Hiddens letter of peace, we have their assistance in the war so we can get out now, oh and by the way we might have a new member coming\"I said and Dusk seemed confused (But it was hard to tell since he had the helmet on) <br>\r\n\"Really? H-How did you get the Hidden to help us in such a short amount of time, wait how did you find them in the first place?\"Questioned Dusk<br>\r\n\"First of all they found us and second what do you mean, for me it was a long time like 30 minutes to an hour\"I responded<br>\r\n\"An hour!? Really? When your vitals said you all went down I came here to find you, that happened like 10 minutes ago!\"He yelled thinking I was crazy<br>\r\n\"Hm, just help me get these guys back into Saint and organinze our thoughts here.\"I said and I carried Johnny while Dusk carried Alyssa nad we walked through the shadow lands watching the prehistoric creatures not bother us and fighting the corrupted versions and walking through the Shadowed jungle without worrying on vision since it seemed to all clear up revealing the way out clear as sunshine, we made it out to the boundary of the jungle and saw__________   </span></div></div>",

Do you need assisstance?\"She questioned and she kept looking at the T-rex<br>\r\n\"Of course I need help my friend is in the belly of the beast\"I said and she reached out a hand to pull me up<br>\r\n\"Now lets go kill this thing\"She said and she conjured up a mystic spear and charged at the T-rex, I followed up charging a holy spell in my staff,<br>\r\n------------------------Back to the present <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I smell like shit and I am seriously hurting right now...oh please tell me I didn't go out the arse!\"Tech yelled and I chuckled under my breath<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Tech the T-rex is dead and we didn't have to cut you out\"I said with humor and I put Johnny on the ground and got Alyssa's satchel to see if there was anything that might work which were potions and a medkit, well good enough, I ran to Tech with the items and see if it worked at all,<br>\r\n\"Uh thanks Viktor and I really hope I don't die from the potions themselves since you know nothing on alchemy at all, but I can figure something out\"Tech said and I ran back to Natalie and the dark elf,<br>\r\n\"So you must be the member the hidden must have given us, what are your specialties and your ranking?\"I questioned and she immediately responded<br>\r\n\"My name is Renma Niza'ar, daughter of one of the Hidden leaders, a good assassin, I know alot about blades and allteration so I combined both, and I know alot about poison\" Renma said<br>\r\n\"Okay then just as long as you don't poison us in our sleep and steal our equipment we will be good friends\" I joked and I picked Johnny up over my shoulder \"Okay then get people on the saint and lets move to our next destination\"I said and all of us got on board with the unconscious back from the dead and Tech a bit beaten but good,<br>\r\n\"Ugh what happened?\"Johnny said in a dazed tone<br>\r\n\"Last time I remember was being ambushed by a group of people and...wait who is this?\"Alyssa questioned <br>\r\n\"Its a long story that I'll tell all of you on the way to our next faction...uh anyone flying this thing or do I have to fly it?\"I said and Tech just got into the pilot seat and started to fly it,<br>\r\n\"Alyssa your kindof still dazed from whatever happened in there and Viktor I am not letting you fly this thing, you may know how to ride horses and dragons but the only way I am letting you fly this thing is when your a kamakazi\" Tech joked and we were off to the next location.  </span></div></div>",

What are they doing here?\"I asked Quil and he flew to a nearby branch on a tree<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure really but I hope they don't try to steal the crystal or try to take over this land\"Quil said<br>\r\n\"I doubt it but warn the others, go to Shin and tell him about our guests I will welcome our guests to see if they are in peace or hostility\"I said and I was about to run through the forest with my bow lute, a lute that is in the shape of a bow butt still plays beautifully, when Quil flew in front of me<br>\r\n\"Wait, quick being reckless you foolish little boy, you don't know who these people are and your brother will pound you to a pulp if you go out alone and if those people are hostile\" <br>\r\n\"I am a wood elf that lives and protects his homeland and if these people are hostile then I will die trying to protect it, and shut it Quil I am not a little kid I am a teenager now move it\"I said and I continued to run through the treeline<br>\r\n\"Teenagers, always so rebellious\"Quil said as he flew the other way <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------Viktors POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm....I may be wrong but I think I hear a lute somewhere close\"I said as we were walking past a waterfall <br>\r\n\"Now how in the world can you tell from the flutes, orchestra, and other sounds around the forest?\" Dusk asked<br>\r\n\"Easy I used to play some instruments since I was young nomad\"I answered and we were walking through the treeline and into a clearing <br>\r\n\"I'm surprised we haven't seen any traps or inhabitants, lets just follow the sound of the lute, Viktor you lead\" Renma asked then I nodded and focused on where the sound was coming from<br>\r\n\"Thats odd its coming from......behind us?\"I questioned myself and I ran back towards the waterfall and looked for it but I couldn't tell where it was<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, behind the waterfall\" Renma said and she jumped toward the waterfall and through it \"I knew it there is a hidden passage here!\"She yelled and we all went to the passageway using the rocks at the sides. <br>\r\nThe inside was echoing the lute sound but it was still good and it was well illuminated so we went down further to see who is playing it and see if we can meet the runic whisperers leaders. When we went down further I noticed that the rune stones and rune symbols started to show up that actually illuminated the place in green,<br>\r\n\"This place has a wierd concentrated energy coming from further down\"Natalie said <br>\r\n\"Strange I can't translate what these runic symbols mean, does this mean these are actually symbols for music or is this a new language of some sort?\"Tech questioned himself<br>\r\n\"Wait I see someone\"I said and I was staring at a young wood elf sitting there with a strange looking lute and playing some very pretty music, the elf was wearing gold and green armor and had a quiver of arrows on his back, he looked young and had blonde long hair and he spoke while playing,<br>\r\n\"Tell me this strangers, why are you all here with all those weapons are you here to damage our home and take the heart of the forest?\"The wood elf questioned<br>\r\n\"No we are here for you leaders to-\"Natalie was saying before she got cut off<br>\r\n\"Oh so you are here to kill our leaders, the wise of our land, and what keeps us safe from harm!\"He yelled and his lute started to glow and the runes on the walls seem to glow even more<br>\r\n\"Quit assuming the worst and let us fin-\"Tech was saying before he got hit by a rune symbol, the wood elf generated a magical shield around him and musical symbols started to appear out of nowhere all in diffrent colors with diffrent effects<br>\r\n\"I have heard enough, now face the music\"He said as he pulled a string and he launched a volley of magic notes at us, there was one problem though, we can't dodge the music and we can't block or deflect them. <br>\r\n\"God fucking damn it what the hell we can't dodge these things and whatever we throw at the notes it goes right through them Tech some analysis here!\"I yelled and I got hit by several notes and everyone was just scattering<br>\r\n\"Okay we are getting our asses handed to us by one guy, oh and Viktor you should know that music can touch you but you can't touch music and aim for the damn source!\"Tech yelled and he got hit in the face by a red note \"Damn that burns!\" When Tech said that and every note pre-occupied with the others I ran up to the elf's shield and pulled out my shotgun and loarded special rounds in it.<br>\r\n\"Bullets? Ha, you can't really think that can break through this shield\"Said the elf with arrogance and I shot the shield severeal times and it broke so I grabbed the elf by the neck and the musical magic runes disappeared<br>\r\n\"What shield, now tell me this why did you attack us?\"I questioned the wood elf,<br>\r\n\"Because the other group you brought attacked us first!\"He yelled and I dropped him<br>\r\n\"What do you mean the other group?\"I questioned<br>\r\n\"Wait your not with them?\" He questioned in confusion \"The other group looked strange, they were all in black armor with blood-shot eyes, and they were attacking our friends and family, and some of them didn't look normal but more demonic\" <br>\r\n\"That is Akrons army of dark minions who destroy all that is good and we were here to meet your leaders when you strayed us off the beaten path\"I said <br>\r\n\"I am so sorry I just thought that you were another seperate group meant to cut off our escape if things went down, my name is Sargith and I can lead you to our leaders\" <br>\r\n\"Amazingly all is forgiven since you just proved that a youngling has that much power and that your faction will be a great addition to our cause, now tell me why you thought we were with them\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------Sargith POV before the fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was running toward the tunnel entrence when Quil was calling out to me,<br>\r\n\"Sargith there is a problem!\" and he landed on a tree branch<br>\r\n\"Yes what happened?\"I questioned out of worry<br>\r\n\"Shin and the others are being attacked by a large group of strange creatures, lets just say they didn't look normal but they all had blood-shot eyes, they had all black armor, and all of them looked more like demons but I wasn't sure, and since the group that came here had some members who were wearing black armor I think they are another group meant to cut us off if either of the members survive\" Quil said assuming everything<br>\r\n\"I am not sure whats going on but I will intercept or lure the other group and hope that we don't get the stories mixed up\"I said and ran towards the cave full of rage and worry, I just hope that doesn't cloud my judgement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------Viktors POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSargith told his story on why he attacked us and it was partially understandble, but we decided to ignore it to avoid an accident in losing the favor of a powerful faction like the whisperers. Then I saw an eagle coming down the tunnel and land on Sargiths shoulder<br>\r\n\"Hey guys this is my eagle Quil, Quil meet the guys that I attacked and weren't actually with the others\"Sargith said<br>\r\n\"Okay good so I hope all is forgiven and that your our allies\"Quil said<br>\r\n\"Holy shit a talking eagle\"Johnny said in awe<br>\r\n\"Yeah thats what everyone new says now we have a situation here _______________________________ </span></div></div>",

We made it outside and we were looking at a giant temple covered in moss, trees, and towers shooting magic arrows at the massive dark army, the dark army's infantry consisted of undead, corrupted soldiers, (I.E soldiers in black armor with weapons such as guns and blades) prehistoric, giants, dragons, and other assorted small demons flying. In the middle of the dark army I could see Ents and earth golems attacking the soldiers, in the air I could see gryphons attacking the airborn hostiles, and back at the walls I could see diffrent species with instruments launch magic notes at the enemy some actually show the magic trail or some instanty hitting them, and some players were using their magic instruments to actually support the allies and decrease the enemies defenses.<br>\r\n\"Wow this is just a compleate war, and Sargith your friends, your allies over there are literally playing intense war music while battling, that is amazing\" Natalie said<br>\r\n\"Yeah they do that sometimes, unfortunately we have to cut through the enemy lines to get to the temple\"Sargith said<br>\r\n\"Any other way besides suicide?\" Renma asked<br>\r\n\"Nope, not at all\"Sargith responded<br>\r\n\"That is okay with me\"Dusk said as he pulled out his jet black blade \"Now try to keep up\" <br>\r\n\"Hold on just let me give you some support there\"Sargith said and he played a furious tone on his lute and a splash of notes appeared on Dusk<br>\r\n\"Okay now you can charge foward\"Sargith said and we all just prepared for the worst, preping our attacks, weapons, etc. and then we all charged after Dusk. <br>\r\nDusk was just a maniac, he was just swinging his blade around slicing and dicing enemies that came to close, he sliced undead in half, bodies flew in all directions, blood sprayed over the battle field, and occasionaly a dead body would hit one of us. While he did that we were all just shooting and killing everything that got in our path. I was shooting guys with my custom spaz-12 which was loaded with armor-piercing rounds that teared through enemies, Natalie was mainly using holy magic which was quite effective excpecially when the enemies were dark and the staff was a angel staff thing, Johnny was firing to his hearts content and used a varied set of ammunition that demolished them, Renma was moving fast across the field quickly hacking and slashing the undeads heads, taking out the giants quickly , and piercing through the prehistoric creatures and grounded dragons with her mystical shadow blades, she was very deadly, Tech was firing a volley of fire and elecricity from his gloves at everything, apparently he did some extream calibrations to the glove to do that, Alyssa actually had a weapon, a specialized laser rifle that shoots a continuous white laser beam, that I assume is holy or solar power, that doesn't pierce through enemies but does alot of damage considering the amount of enemies dying to the thing, and Sargith was playing a vigorous tone on his lute that I think made us stronger just from the fact that there were red notes bursting from us. After several minutes of carnage through the army we made it to the wall and the gates opened quickly,<br>\r\n\"Don't stand there get the heck inside before they go through the wall!\"Yelled on of the guards and we all just stormed in and the gates close quickly, one of the guards came up to us, it was a female wood elf in robes with a harp,<br>\r\n\"I saw your little performance down there with those dark creatures, it was amazing and we could really use the help, and unfotunately some of the creatures breached the wall and are currently inside the temple but we can't spare the troops to go inside and help the inside guards\"Said the elf<br>\r\n\"Wait how did they get inside?\"Questioned Sargith<br>\r\n\"That is what we don't know\"The elf said<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have to seperate, Dusk, Renma, Johnny and Natalie do you guys mind helping the soldiers take care of the minions?\"I asked them<br>\r\n\"The spirit of fighting is still running through my blood!\"Dusk yelled<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say Viktor\"Natalie said <br>\r\n\"Just as long Dusk doesn't slice me in half I'll be glad to fight\"Renma joked <br>\r\n\"It is time to unleash a bullet storm on these bastards\"Johnny said in rage<br>\r\n\"Okay it is time to save a faction, everyone to your battle stations!\"I yelled, the team I sent to fight the army went outside the wall and are fighting to their hearts content, while my team went inside to see who the intruders were. <br>\r\nThe inside of the temple was very nice with decor, trees, moss, and the bodies of the guards defending the place that were all torn up with their insides splattered on teh walls and across the floor. <br>\r\n\"Damn whatever was in here was brutal!\"Tech yelled and then there was a very demonic laughing and voice<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha ha, you tiny little weakling, you all shall perish, you all will die under the power of my blade, now open the door to the earth crystal!\" <br>\r\n\"Never, in the order and honor of th-ARGH!\"Said a guard with an agonizing scream then the sound of a sickening crush<br>\r\n\"Damn where the hell is the earth crystal!\" I yelled and Sargith ran to the right where a trail of destruction lay,<br>\r\n\"This way, hurry!\"He yelled and we al followed. At the area where the earth crystal is supposed to be defended, it was a gigantic chamber full of overgrown vines and trees and in the middle lay a giant crystal that glowed green and defended by a mystical shield, I looked to see the body of the guard and the being who attacked,________________<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You dare interfere in my masters work!? You dare ensure the wrath of one of his elite guards!?\" Yelled the figure <br>\r\n\"And you dare to take the heart of life, the earth crystal?\"I joked and then he got even more mad and unleashed a dark energy from his scythe \"Oh shit!\"I yelled for a split second as we all took cover from the attack and it hit the wall creating alot of smoke into the air, we all cough from the stench of rotting flesh and smoke,<br>\r\n\"Tech anaylsis, what the hell is this guy?\"I asked him and he checked his pip-boy<br>\r\n\"Uh....oh shit this can't be right\" He said<br>\r\n\"What?\"I questioned<br>\r\n\"This guy is named Moric Nekros, it says here that he is a expert on necromancy and did alot of experiments on dead things and turned them into weapons or his pets\"<br>\r\n\"Oh shit I would hate to see what his pets look like\"I joked and then I heard a roar behind us, but I can't see what it was, then I heard someone screaming<br>\r\n\"Ah holy shit what the hell is that thing!\" Sargith yelled then I heard the sound of an impact which was Sargith geting hit by something which I figure he was sent flying, when the smoke cleared I looked to see a dragon shaped creature except it was a mixture of undead and machine, to be more exact a green and black mechanical body with the tail, 4 legs, and the head which is a zombified dragon head. <br>\r\n\"Go my pet! Go and feed on these fools flesh and devour their souls!\"Moric yelled and he got back to draining the crystals energy<br>\r\n\"Great.......well Sargith is down, we have to take on a twisted pet dragon, and there is only 3 of us to fight this thing, me, you, and Alyssa, well Tech I hope you made more recalibrations to your gloves because we will need it, and Alyssa are you going to help out Sargith?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I am, after all I'm the one that keeps you alive through the stupid shit we go through, oh and here take my laser rifle you may need it\" Then she ran to Sargiths body to inspect the damage, amazing how I still don't know if she is a magic healer or a medic healer. <br>\r\n\"Well Tech the quicker we take this thing down the faster we can kill Moric, ready?\"I asked him<br>\r\n\"Ready since boot camp\"He responded and I saw his gloves glowing with the holy or solar energy he used during the charge, I guess he learned that during the war at Sol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of us charged into the smoke spraying and praying into the hallway, hoping that this will be over quick and hoping that the others fighting the war outside were doing okay. The minute the first volley of 12.Gauge and solar power hit the dragon it got even more pissed and it swung its tail at both of us, Tech was sane person so naturally he ducked, but I was insane and I wanted it to be over quickly so I blocked the massive tail, pulled out my gunblade that I hardly ever use and impaled it into the mechanical tail, surprisingly it was effective enough to make the thing roar in pain, and when its mouth was opened I used Alyssa's laser rifle and it went down with a hole through its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! now lets get Moric before he drains all the earth crystals power\" Both of us turned back into the chamber to fight Moric, but then the ground rumbled and arms started to shoot out of the ground, both rotten and bone,<br>\r\n\"Oh right a necromancer\"Tech said and he preped his plasma rifle to fight the undead,<br>\r\n\"I am ahead of you Tech\"I said as I switched to my spaz-12 \"Well Tech this is like the time where we were in the land of the dead\"<br>\r\n\"Damn it Viktor save the war stories for another time, right now the dead is rising again to beat our asses!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we were talking the zombies and skeletons were out of the ground and there were alot of them with assorted armor and weapons, one of them screeched and all of them recklessly charged at us and both of us were shooting rapidly, not letting the dead get near us, and there were limbs, blood, and moans of pain coming from the undead we were shooting up to where they should be, just like old times when both of us were rookies and we always got into situations worser than this but overall we covered each others backs all they way no matter what, this is the power of friendship but I hope it is enough to defeat anyone who stands in the way. After the hallway was clear of undead there was the stench of rotten flesh leftover<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets hurry before Moric finishes draining the crystal and the stench kills us!\"Tech yelled and he ran back into the chamber, I followed after him. <br>\r\nThe chamber to fight Moric, it seems we were running out of time due to the condition of the plants seem to wittle and fade into ash and grey, the crystals glow is starting to fade and Morics evil laugh keeps cresending louder. We were about to fight him when I heard familiar voices echoing from the hallway,<br>\r\n\"Hey guys we just fough the entire army outside and we are coming to help you!\"Yelled Johnny<br>\r\n\"Uh, where are they!?\"Questioned Dusk<br>\r\n\"Follow the trail of destruction!\"Yelled Natalie \"Usually these guys leave some sort of path\" <br>\r\nThen I spotted them running around the corner and making their way back to us, and then Alyssa and Sargith came running after them whihc meant Sargith was healed, or was able to fight again, <br>\r\n\"No time reunions we have to kill Moric before he kills the forest, now attack!\"I yelled and we all just charged into the chamber </span></div></div>",

You insolent pest's I am going to!-\" I didn't let him finish his sentence and shot him in green eye \"AH! I will make you pay for that!\"<br>\r\n\"How exactly? We outnumber you\" I said arrogantly and with pride just to piss him off even further <br>\r\n\"You dare challenge me!?\" He questioned <br>\r\n\"I shot you in the back and then the eye, of course I challenge you\" I said then shot him again in the chest<br>\r\n\"YOU WILL ALL SUFFER!\" He yelled and green orb's of dark energy were coming out of his hands \"DEAD ROULETTE!\" He yelled and everything was white, <br>\r\n\"Wait what the hell is happening?\" Dusk questioned<br>\r\n\"Well this cannot be good\" Renma said blankly<br>\r\n\"Damn, who's betting we are dead?\" Johnny asked<br>\r\n\"This fog, something's not right\" Natalie said<br>\r\n\"What was your first clue and-\" Tech was saying until there was a loud banging then alot of poofing<br>\r\n\"Wait what just happened?\" I said and everything went silent, no one was saying anything \"Guys?\" Then the fog cleared up and there was no one in the room but a silhouette in the middle of the room with red demonic eye's, \"Who the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n\"I am your death\"The silhouette said blankly <br>\r\n\"And I am the guy that will kill you, bring it on!\" <br>\r\n\"As..you..wish!\" The silhouette yelled and pulled a giant scary, morbid, and large blade out of nowhere,<br>\r\n\"Ah.....shit\" <br>\r\n\"Storm of blades!\" Then many small vortex's appeared all over the area and dark swords were coming out of them,<br>\r\n\"Of course\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching POV to Tech <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog had cleared and none of my comrades seem to be around but I saw Moric in the middle laughing his heart out (If he had one) <br>\r\n\"What have you done with the others!?\" I questioned in anger<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, I just sent your friends to Akron's captains and they might all die, and unfortunately for you I might steal your soul or better yet make you my slave and pit you against your former teammates\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up Moric, and let's fight\" I activated my gloves and orb's of concentrated electricity flowed to them, if my calculations are correct I might be able to stun Moric long enough to unleash a barrage of fire and elecrical assault's <br>\r\n\"Agreed\" He then impaled the ground with his scythe and green energy was flowing through the ground below \"Earth Coffin\" then I was encased in stone <br>\r\n\"Oh goddammit! Ah screw it, magnetic electrical storm!\" I unleashed a powerful rush of electrical energy in an enclosed space that allowed a more concentrated attack to break the stone jail, it was good that I had the electrical armour or I would have suicided, the electricity was bouncing off the stone wall's and were gaining more kinetic energy as time went on and soon the electricity broke the coffin creating a large dome of electricity that spreaded out across the chamber hitting Moric hard and knocking him down, but he was still standing, \"You know, for being an elite guard of Akron, I should have expected more\"<br>\r\n\"You're a fool, soon you aren't going to fight me, but another\"<br>\r\n\"And what does that mean?\" I said but then there was a bright flash and when I regained my vision Moric wasn't there but a large ice-like creature standing there with several large lacerations and scratches, and it looked pissed off, and then I realized what Dead Roulette meant, the move made us switch place's and revolve around diffrent bosses until the one who used it dies. The ice creature charged at me and I was damn ready to fight again, but who was fighting Moric? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitch to Renma<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" I questioned \"Oh no, great it's him, well this is going to be bad'<br>\r\n\"Bring it on little elf so that I can drain your soul dry\" <br>\r\n\"Fine, I have faced worser enemies than you\" The moment I finished his sinister scythe glowed ominously green <br>\r\n\"Acid Razor!\" He unleashed a volley of green magic, to counter I quickly summoned a magical shield and the magic attack impacted hard, but it didn't breach the shield \"Now it's my turn\" While I was still under fire I conjured a shadow spear in my free hand and threw it at Moric which he dispersed with his scythe (But shadow fragments were still lingering) <br>\r\n\"Did you really think that would work on me?\" <br>\r\n\"Nope, this is\" The lingering shadow fragment's turned into small sharp knive's and impaled Moric from every which way, but it didn't seem to do much damage, <br>\r\n\"Just a parlor trick, eternal rot!\" Moric made a multitude of purple and green bubble's floating in mid-air and then he launched them, I tried to dodge them but there was just too many to dodge and one hit me hard in the chest and sent me flying across the chamber, I did not feel good at all, it felt like my inside was rotting, and Moric was laughing and was about to finish it when there was a flash of light, \"Oh darn, the roulette is so random, hm, I wonder who's next\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitch to Dusk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another bright light and I wasn't finish fighting the dragon, when my vision cleared, Moric was just standing there<br>\r\n\"Ah...the orc, well this will be interesting\" <br>\r\n\"Shut up, finally, I have foe that will test my fury! WARRIOR'S BLOOD!\" I yelled and all I saw was red and Moric's form popped out as white <br>\r\n\"Great, exo-steel!\" Moric yelled and his bone cloak became hardened but that was no match for my strength, I assault Moric with a barrage of sword slash's and even my own fist and was bringing him down hard that is until I saw the green fog surrounding him, \"Acid blitz!\" The green fog quickly spreaded out and knocked me back into the wall, I looked up to see that Moric was charging fast at me with his scythe and I used my blade to block him then we ended up countering each other with our own blades,<br>\r\n\"This is how true warriors fight! Now time to end it!\" I roared a guttural yell \"Blade of rage!\" The blade I welded glowed fiercely that stunned Moric and then I took the moment to impale the blade through Moric's eye, but when I though it was over the same green fog that was seeping out of Moric was apparently, his spirit essence since I saw a single green gem floating in the air with the green spirit essence and it looked like it was escaping through the open entrence <br>\r\n\"We will finish this again\" Moric said while he was going through the hallway, <br>\r\n\"Get back here you coward!\" I yelled, but then there was a bright flash of light again and everyone came back, ehr, sort of since all of them were battle damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitch to Viktor <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter defeating the slime creature there was another flash of light but when my vision cleared all my teammate's were back, damaged, but back. <br>\r\n\"Hey, what the hell happened to you guys?\" I asked all of them <br>\r\n\"I just got impaled with swords all around\" Johnny said with multiple impalement's in his body and his entire arm covered in blood <br>\r\n\"Hold on, let me heal that arm\" Alyssa said, she went to Johnny and began healing him with the glowing healing magic, while she herself was hurting pretty badly with all the laceration's on her, \"By the way, I got attacked by an ice creature\" <br>\r\n\"Lucky you! I GOT VORED AGAIN BY A DRAGON!\" Tech yelled and I could tell since he smell badly with several burn marks <br>\r\n\"Heh, I took care of Moric all right, ugh I have a headache and I have battle markings all around, but otherwise okay\" Dusk said <br>\r\n\"You are crazy Dusk, I got mauled by a demonic hell hound\" Renma said with bite and scratch marks all over her <br>\r\n\"I..hate...magma creatures\" Sargith said with even more burn mark's on him and Skye has alot of soot on him <br>\r\n\"If I see another Gargoyle it will be too soon\" Natalie said with her robe torn and ripped up everywhere <br>\r\n\"Before anyone ask's I got swallowed by slime\" I said with the black and smelling gunk covering my entire body \"Okay, it look's like we are all good right now, good thing we aren't dead, okay guy's let's just rest up until tomorrow, we have a big day ahead of us.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, QUICK RECAP on what happened in the duration: After the group took care of the necromancer Moric and saved the earth crystal, and the army of darkness defeated, for now, the leader of the runic whisperer's who was more than glad to join the Alliance, let us stay for the night to heal up and restock. To unwind from the war, Dusk and Johnny wrestled until Dusk nearly chocked Johnny to death, Tech was making recalibration's with his tesla glove using the magic of the forest in which I was sure that Alyssa spent time with him in his room, they are so boyfriend and girlfriend, Renma and Natalie hanged out with the inhabitant's of the forest seeing how they used their magic and instrumental skill's, Sargith and Skye officially agreed to join the group after several hour's arguing with his parents and brother, and finally I basically adjusted my shotgun and tested out vision's I hardly tried, which some of the team thought I was being a pervert and Tech and Alyssa thought I was spying on them and whacked me in the head, hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all enterered the Saint and were preparing to lift off when Tech pinged me in on which faction to go next, <br>\r\n\"Well Tech, the next one we are going is the-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Deadman quick draw!\u201d Everything started to slow down except me, I pulled out my revolvers and started shooting the axe trying to reflect it or at least divert its aim then I switched my attention to the psycho and shot several holes through him and then everything went back to normal speed \u201cQuick! Go! Run! Whatever just-!\u201d The guy that attacked us came charging towards us, fast, and we were in a small corridor, yeah we are screwed.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor's POV <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were stuck in a chasm with red crystal thing's growing out of everywhere and there were robot-scorpion's shooting us with laser, stinger things and we were stuck in a shack,<br>\r\n\"You had to piss off every robo-scopion in the area didn't you?\" I said to Dusk who was bleeding in the chest area <br>\r\n\"Heh, you were the idiot that shot the red barrels\" Dusk joked and winched of the pain<br>\r\n\"You saw the guy's that were gunning us down, they were literally everywhere! And-\" I was saying until there was an explosion and a loud rumbling sound <br>\r\n\"Now what the hell was that?\" Dusk questioned <br>\r\n\"Hold on\" I said and I used my thermal vision to see what was outside and it was a big thing, I assumed it was a tank \"I think it's a tank\" <br>\r\n\"What kind of tank?\" Dusk questioned, and then the entire shack was blown up and we lost the cover but we can see what it was and it was a tank, a black tank with blue energy flowing through it, at the barrel I can see that it was charging plasma and was ready to kill us, \"Will that answer's my question, so, this is a good day to die\" <br>\r\n\"I though I was going to die of laughter when I see Tech and Alyssa have a marriage\" I still joked in the face of danger<br>\r\n\"True...true...so when should we run?\" The tank fired and the plasma projectile impacted near us with burning plasma bit\u2019s flying everywhere  <br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? Screw it!\u201d I grabbed Dusk\u2019s blade and <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Dusk said in surprise, I quickly loaded in highly-explosive rounds into my shotgun and charged the tank with the blade hanging back behind me and my shotgun firing, this is one of the worst idea\u2019s I have ever came up with <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTech\u2019s POV<br>\r\nBoth of us were in the living quarter\u2019s of the inhabitant\u2019s which looked like any other generic neighborhood, but inside a dome. <br>\r\n\u201cThis place is damn dark and empty\u201d Alyssa said as she was searching one of the houses <br>\r\n\u201cI know, there is no possible way that there would be a portal here\u201d I responded while I was outside, and then I saw a dog house and there was something in it \u201cHey what is-?\u201d Then a dog came out, it looked strange due to the cranium dome on it \u201cUh, good doggy?\u201d Then the dog sonic-barked me clear across to the other side <br>\r\n\u201cTech what was that?!\u201d Alyssa questioned, and then I just ran into a random house <br>\r\n\u201cI just pissed off the neighbor\u2019s dog and it wants to eat my face!\" After I finished I felt something rumbling and then the sound of something heavy crashing against the ground \u201cUh, what the fuck is that?!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cTech, how much do you hate getting vored?\u201d The rumbling heavy sound was getting closer  <br>\r\n\u201cOh god, what is outside?\u201d Then I heard a loud and heavy breathing sound, I looked out the window and saw a wall of grey and black fur \u201cOh, you have got to be kidding me, I hate my damn luck, and where the hell did this thing come from!?\u201d I yelled and the entire top floor was just ripped off by the mammoth wolf\u2019s teeth and its saliva just dripped on me \u201cWho\u2019s brilliant idea was it to make this thing!?\u201d Then I just saw a wall of pink flesh \u201cOh crap! Nope not now! Lighting Cage!\u201d I slammed my fists into the ground and a field of electricity surrounded me, there is no way in heck that I was getting out <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie\u2019s POV <br>\r\nIt was a bad idea to go into some sort of tunnel system because we are hiding behind an almost demolished concrete cover while being under fire from turrets and robotic guards with saws and lasers,<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Sargith, times like these I would choke you to death and burn your pet eagle into a chef\u2019s delight, but we have more pressing matter\u2019s at hand!\u201d I said while a laser just went past my head<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Why can\u2019t you use your magic?\u201d Sargith questioned in a panicked state <br>\r\n\u201cYou are an idiot, don\u2019t you remember that thing that sapped my power!?\u201d I yelled louder over the sounds of the battle <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, around the time one of those things broke my lute! And you know what\u2019s even worse?\u201d Sargith asked<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could possibly be worse than the predicament we are already in?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat I am going to die a virgin, Quil is going to be eaten by those savages, and we are going to die!\u201d Sargith said, panicking even more <br>\r\n\u201cIf your panic counts as a weapon we can kill these guys!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I forget) when I pulled the trigger *Jamming sound and sparks* <br>\r\n\u201cOh what the?\u201d I checked to see what the problem was and the nexus focus lens and solar cell were gone \u201cWho? What? When? Johnny what did you do!?\u201d I yelled in rage because Johnny messed with the equipment somehow,<br>\r\n \u201cAlyssa what happened!?\u201d Tech yelled in fear and pain \u201cAnd what is that buzzing sound and-oh what the hell!?\u201d I looked out the window and saw that the limbs of the giant dog were being violently ripped out and there was just a bloodbath. Then when the body dropped to its side; a teal, ghostly figure was standing over the stomach area and was cutting it open with a strange looking blade<br>\r\n \u201cHey what do you think you\u2019re doing!?\u201dI yelled over to the figure<br>\r\n \u201cWell, we wouldn\u2019t want your friend dying to the acid of some sadistic freak of science, now would we?!\u201d The male figure was still cutting the stomach, releasing a very large quantity amount of blood before he pulled Tech out of the stomach, <br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Tech said, his skin was partially burnt/melted and he was red all over, and he was coughing and gagging from the stench of the dog<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOV of Sargith <br>\r\nI was hyperventilating, I was very much stressed, and I had no clue what to do without anyway to fight, for being from an area that is peaceful and docile this was just too much,<br>\r\n \u201cThis is just ludicrous and ridiculous that this is happening!\u201d I was yelling over the laser firing over our heads, <br>\r\n\u201cYou know Sargith; with all the commotion you are rambling about, I am sure that you attracted all the enemies in this area and the ones that are dead\u201d Natalie was saying when there was a giant explosion, <br>\r\n\u201cOh gosh, do these robots have artillery or explosives!?\u201d I yelled and the shooting stopped and there were only the sounds of electricity crackling, I looked over the cover and saw that there was a figure in mystic looking teal armor and the person was throwing orbs of energy at the robots and they were exploding, <br>\r\n\u201cGet the heck out of here! Go to the crash site, the others will meat you there!\u201d The figure said with extreme urgency and we just got out before the place was swarmed, <br>\r\n\u201cWell I definitely didn\u2019t see that coming\u201d I remarked and we just walked away like nothing happened, and Quil came back, but with several injuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOV Viktor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile of walking with Dusk on my back who is damn heavy and following the spirit fig mage we managed to get back to the crash site with a portal open right there and the other members of the group with the soldiers who helped saved our asses from nasty ass experiments and enemies, then all the soldiers moved inside to the portal but the aether and fig spirits who I figure might be the commanders, <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, all of you better explain why you are looking for us\u201d The fig spirit asked <br>\r\n\u201cBefore we launch you into the underworld, otherworld, or any of the worlds that involves death because you basically wasted our time\u201d The aether spirit said harshly<br>\r\n\u201cWow, isn\u2019t that harsh, well-err-what\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked<br>\r\n\u201cI am Zar\u2019keil and that is Liy\u2019Yuon\u201d The aether spirit responded<br>\r\n\u201cOkay two names that I cannot pronounce in the life of me, we were looking for you because we need assistance in the war against the army of darkness\u201d I said to Zar\u2019keil <br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, we are also being affected by the army of darkness from the dream realm and from other realms, and it is disrupting the balance\u201d Zar\u2019Keil responded  <br>\r\n\u201cWe might be able to help you, but you have to gain our trust through our rite of passage, and that we are just a branch of the realm drifters\u201d Liy\u2019Yuon said<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bastard, well at least there were a lot of squads dispatched to who knows how many factions, so does the rite of passage involve an extremely long gauntlet that will kill us or does it involve the spiritual outlook of ourselves\u201d I asked both of them, and Zar\u2019Keil answered <br>\r\n\u201cNeither, our rite of passage is very different from others, and will involve your memories\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI do not like where this is going Viktor, so when does it start?\u201d Tech questioned<br>\r\n\u201cRight when you enter the portal, don\u2019t worry we won\u2019t take your equipment, and you won\u2019t receive injuries\u2026physically\u201d Liy\u2019Yuon said<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d Natalie questioned <br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just enter the portal and get this over with\u201d Renma said blankly and we all enter the portal, it felt damn odd and there was just all kinds of colors flashing all over the place, it was enough to give you an epilepsy, but when it was over I saw that there was no one near me and that I was in-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The duration of the rite of passage will only be focused on Viktor because I am too lazy to make a play-by-play on everyone\u2019s condition and current situation)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I have arrived at my destination, it was somewhere in some sort of large city due to the amount of large buildings and number of cars but something didn\u2019t feel right. There was some sort of mist or fog covering the entire area and I used a life-force detection sight to search the entire area for a single soul, nothing. I traversed the fog blindly and found a diner; I entered it which had a single person sitting in the corner staring right at me like he was waiting and I recognized who it was, Zawel Leunder, or by his nickname Trick. Trick is a Caucasian male with short black hair, about averaged height of a human, and had black eyes; he was wearing a regular light combat suit and had a magnum-rifle on the side of his seat (A custom sniper rifle which is basically a .44 or .357 magnum with a scope, elongated barrel, and a really large suppressor covering the barrel) what made him special was his skill in calculating angles to the last degree, which meant he was a great sniper and he always won in billiards with one stroke. <br>\r\n\u201cAh, hello there Viktor, it\u2019s some nice weather we are having\u201d Trick joked while he drank his coffee <br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember this mist Viktor?\u201d Trick questioned and he sipped more of his coffee <br>\r\n\u201cI think so, what the hell is this anyway?\u201d I questioned him <br>\r\n\u201cThat is the problem, the mist is being caused by one of our old friends, and I suppose you remember Gazure Arielle\u201d Trick said, Gazure was a person with a curse, one that changed his biology to be extremely unique from others.  <br>\r\n\u201cSo is it just the one guy or are there others?\u201d I asked him who then stared out the window,<br>\r\n\u201cThere are two more that you have to beat, Xeilia Pariv, as you remember she is the one who has the book that see\u2019s all and the other one\u2026its Simon Guise, whose nightmares come true\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell shit, the mist doesn\u2019t help at all\u201d When we were talking I could feel like someone was watching us<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When Zawel and Viktor were talking in the diner they didn\u2019t notice the presence watching over them, they didn\u2019t know what demons await them. Simon is still trapped in his room cringing in the corner with his book on the desk whispering incoherently and Gazure is still suffering from the curse at the tower. If they are successful everyone would have a happy ending, but in war\u2026there are no such thing as a happy ending as someone will die in the end. Even though for being the book of fate it still can be avoided with the right choice and the right path. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zawel was talking about some random nonsense I looked out the window and saw something in the mist,<br>\r\n\u201cZawel?\u201d I said and he didn\u2019t listen \u201cZawel shut the hell up and get ready to fight!\u201d Both of us readied our weapons and looked out the window, I could hear the sounds of something buzzing or humming loudly until a giant insect perched on the window screen, it looked very unnatural and gross. <br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s new, but it doesn\u2019t seem Simon nightmare-like\u201d Zawel said and more insects came along on the window \u201cStill not Simon-like\u201d Then something smashed through the window, both of us looked at the figure that crashed through and it was just pitch-black on all fours, small spikes coming out of the things\u2019 back, long claws on what I assume are paws or something, and it didn\u2019t have eyes, just a mouth full of black sharp teeth and a long tongue. \u201cOkay\u2026now that is Simon!\" Both of us open fired on the thing, blasting off body parts and bits of it which splattered on the ceiling and walls, but that didn\u2019t do anything since the parts that fell off turned into beetle-like things and just began morphing into its original shape, that and the noise attracted the insects inside which swarmed the place and we had to evacuate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running a fair distance away from the diner in the mist we stopped to rest in a grocery store, <br>\r\n\u201cZawel, you are a figment of my memory, you should know where the 3 people are that I am supposed to fight\u201d I said while sitting by the door and Zawel was staring out the window <br>\r\n\u201cActually I do, Gazure is in the tower, and Simon is in the suburbs and for Xeilia we just have to wait for her\u201d Zawel went out the door and walked to somewhere \u201cWhat are you waiting for? We are going to fight Gazure first, otherwise we are wandering blind!\u201d I followed him to the tower\u2026where ever that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The two heroes, one a part from a distant memory and one trapped in his own, move to the tower where they face the one behind the mist, Gazure. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of us made it to what appears to be some sort of square with the shape of the roads twisting, the benches, trees, and the big clock tower thing with Gazure sitting on the top of it coughing up smoke. Gazure was extremely pale; he had long grey hair, black soulless eyes, was tall and slim, and he wore a trench coat. <br>\r\n\u201cGazure! Come down here to fight us!\u201d I yelled over to him and he dropped down from the clock tower coughing up more smoke <br>\r\n\u201cIt is about time you got here *Cough* hold on\u201d Gazure said and he lifted his arm into the air \u201cDisperse\u201d The impenetrable mist in the square cleared away and it made a wall around the entire area, I suppose that this was the battle area \u201cNow lets see what you *Cough* GOT!\u201d Gazure sprayed his black smoke to blind us <br>\r\n\u201cYou know Gazure, you should know that I still have my vision, the smoke isn\u2019t going to work!\u201d I yelled and loaded some shells into the shotgun <br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to have forgotten me Viktor *Cough* I have more where that came from *Cough* Tar Blitz!\u201d he spitted out black sludge which when I shot didn\u2019t affect it at all, instead it disintegrated and melted the environment around me and eventually struck me in the leg burning through my armor, I gritted my teeth in pain and clutched my leg, <br>\r\n\u201cShit Gazure, what the hell!?\u201d I yelled and shot regular rounds at Gazure which hit him, but the wounds inflicted on him started to release miasma, \u201cOh yeah, I forgot that you have-\u201c <br>\r\n\u201cToxic cloud\u201d The gas seeping out of his body came out at force and went straight for me, I didn\u2019t have time to react and the miasma burned right through my armor and made me felt like my insides were melting. \u201cAre you done yet Viktor? *Cough* you know that miasma runs through my veins *Cough* and that you cannot beat my ability so easily *Cough* what can you do?\u201d Gazure said while he was walking towards me and taunting me. That was when I remembered a weakness to his ability, \u201cTime to die!\u201d He breathed in deeply to unleash his special move \u201cBlack pl-AUGH!\u201d I griped his throat hard and started beating his face in with my fists,<br>\r\n\u201cGazure, do you give up now? Because I just don\u2019t have the heart to kill you even if you are a memory\u201d I was saying when he started dissipating into black smoke \u201cWait what the? Okay not the weirdest thing I have seen, but at least the mist is gone\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell, Gazure could never take a blunt attack for anything\" Trick said <br>\r\n\u201cNow where did you go when I was fighting Smokey the damn bear?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI told you, I am just the guide, besides I am not your babysitter. Oh and there has been one complication\u201d Trick said with some worry in his voice<br>\r\n\u201cGreat what is it this time?\u201d Then I noticed that the area was changing, it was becoming more ruined, sinister, and it started to turn dark.  \u201cCrap, what the hell is happening?\u201d I questioned him<br>\r\n\u201cSimon is coming, well see you later if you are left with any pieces left\u201d Trick said as he disappeared in thin air. All I can do was to wait for Simon, whatever horrible nightmare he became to fight me. That was when I heard a guttural roaring coming from somewhere, <br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, where the hell is he?\u201d Then I heard a gunshot being fired behind me, I turned around and saw a man with a bloodied grey hoodie and black jeans, (face not shown) with a shotgun held at the hip with the creature that attacked me in the diner and another one that looks similar to it, but feebler and with wings. If that wasn\u2019t Simon I didn\u2019t know anything, \u201cSimon, I swear if you attack me with you nightmares-\u201cSimon pointed at me and his two guards attacked me \u201cFuck me\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Viktor did battle with the two creatures, but he seemed to be at a wits end when he realized that both of the creatures had the regeneration power and that they kept juggling him with their endless assaults and double team tactics. No matter what he tried, no matter how much ammo he wastes into the creatures, and no matter how good at fighting he is he is being held at a corner. That was when he remembers that it was HIS memories and was at a corner to try anything, he thought of the first thing that came into mind and then two figures started to appear in front of him that were willing to help. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I tried to remember my friends that I have battled and knew that they were strong and then wouldn\u2019t you know; the two people I thought of were Gray heart and Mason. Gray heart is an anthro gray wolf with a full-light ranger armor (Basically a more elite-looking version of a generic soldier\u2019s armor and gray colored) and a dual leader tactical sword, (Basically like a tactical knife, but out-fitted to be long as a sword and keeping its original design plus there is two instead of one) and there was Mason, an orc with solid full-iron armor and an assortment of blunt weapons, IE Maces and hammers.  <br>\r\n\u201cAh, hello Viktor\u201d Gray heart said and he looked at the two creatures \u201cOh what the hell!?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what they are, but it is a good time to smash things!\u201d Mason just charged right in and smacked the ground creature down and Gray heart jumped high and impaled the flying creature which it flew trying to shake him off, but he was hanging on hard. <br>\r\n\u201cYou got to love those guys\u201d I said and I stared back at Simon who was just standing there with the riot shotgun over his shoulder<br>\r\n\u201cAh, your memories vs. my nightmares, I should have seen that coming, no matter, you still have to beat me\u201d Me and Simon pointed our shotguns at each other and started shooting from a long range. The fight wasn\u2019t anything special; it was a challenge to see who would last longer, both of us were clearly out of range to hit each other so the bullets spreaded out, missing us by an inch. But as we got closer we felt each others bullets hit us in different areas, from what I saw from Simon, he wasn\u2019t bleeding out but merely his nightmare essence spilling out, as for I, the armor could only do so much when I felt pain all over my body, but I just kept firing as I didn\u2019t have time to feel pain or bleed. Occasionally we would stop firing to just reload our guns and then fight again, that is until we were at point blank and both of our shotguns were out of shells. At that point we just did an unarmed fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The fight between Simon Guise and Viktor Diriantz was also nothing special. Simon kept dodging Viktor\u2019s punches and rapidly struck him in certain area\u2019s to disable him, but the armor he worse softened the punches plus he didn\u2019t care. Viktor was getting peeved that Simon was basically running circles around him and even when he hit him it didn\u2019t seem to do much. Although in their match they didn\u2019t notice what is coming to them in the sky </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh shit! Incoming!\u201d I looked up and saw the flying creature dive bombing towards us with Gray Heart still hanging on, before I could react they impacted between me and Simons fight. There was dust everywhere and parts of the creature who is regenerating, on the ground next to me I found one of Gray\u2019s blades, I picked it up and tried to find Simon with the aura sensing vision where if there was a dark aura it was him. It didn\u2019t take long to find him because he was faced down on the ground; I kicked him over and was ready to impale him through the heart when I said <br>\r\n\u201cAny last words?\u201d Simon still had no face and he was bleeding out his aura <br>\r\n\u201cSimon says nothing, but fear\u201d I stabbed him through the heart and there was just a loud and heart-wrenching guttural scream of pain in which the creatures that he summoned turned to stone and then to dust. The area afflicted with his appearance on the scene was returning to normal and the sun was shining through the dark skies. The two that helped me waved good-bye and then disappeared. I looked back to Simon\u2019s body that is no longer bleeding essence but instead, blood. There was a journal in his hand which I didn\u2019t see before and I saw his face, it was very pale, his eyes had no soul and his hair is sapped of its color. Simon stopped breathing and then his body turned to stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thus the mist walker and the nightmare were defeated by both and Trick appeared next to Viktor to talk about the next memory to fight, and that means it is my turn. I closed the book and began to get out of the library to fight Viktor. I know what will happen; I am not getting out in one piece. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I defeated two of them and Xeilia is the last one, any tips on how to handle her?\u201d I asked Trick<br>\r\n\u201cDO NOT DIE, that is my tip\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThanks, so when is she coming?\u201d Then where the clock tower was, a pentagram appeared below it which glowed violet and then it just turned the clock tower violet which destroyed it in an instant. <br>\r\n\u201cNow, oh and you are fucked\u201d Trick disappeared and Xeilia appeared where the clock tower was destroyed. Xeilia is a night elf so of course she would have the purple skin, silver-white hair and amber colored eyes. She was wearing a violet robe/cloak that had mystic runes on them plus it covered her head to toe which she also had a mask covering her mouth and the mystic tome book thing in her arms. <br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026the final person I have to beat and it had to be you\u201d I said to her \u201cGoddamn it all, which person would counter her abilities?\u201d I thought to myself <br>\r\n\u201cI know, from fate will yield, you will fall here\u201d Xeilia said, damn her voice is so soft and soothing and I really hope that doesn\u2019t distract me. <br>\r\n\u201cXeilia, your book may know the fate of others, but I have the soul and spirit to defeat it\u201d I said with confidence<br>\r\n\u201cWe shall see\u201d Her voice got more serious and yellow pentagrams appeared sporadically across the area \u201cFallen stars!\u201d very quick flashes erupted down from the skies and impacted the ground heavily releasing very powerful and bright lights and knocked me back hard into a building across the entire way. I was hurt badly, I gripped myself on the arm because I no longer felt it and there as just blood dripping everywhere and my armor ahs been reduced to shambles. <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, think!\u201d I told myself as I gripped my own head \u201cWhich person or people can beat her, which\u2026OF COURSE!\u201d I had an idea and thought about the person perfect to beat her, the person who is damn over-powered and a part of the wanderer\u2019s...Shauk Pricaur. When I remembered him he was standing right over me and he lent a hand,<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNeed help there old friend?\u201d he questioned and I got up myself <br>\r\n\u201cJust help me beat her\u201d I look at Shauk, I forgot what race he was and his crystallized white armor covering his entire body only covers it more, he had a crystal prism blade that is long and elegantly shining, and he was damn ready to fight Xeilia and then Trick came up behind me<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I remember this guy\u201d He said in delight <br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, why did you give us the option to take people from our past to help fight with us, not that I am complaining\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou cannot rely only on yourself, but you cannot rely on others to do it all\u201d He responded<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, thanks wise old man\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cShut up and watch the fireworks\u201d I saw Shauk meet up Xeilia on the battle grounds <br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, mind-\u201c <br>\r\n\u201cTaking us on the roof? Sure\u201d We just magically appeared on the roof to see the damn action, the thing about Shauk that makes him OP is the fact that his armor has an amazing armor rating against magic and physical and if a substantial amount of energy hits his blade he flings it back at the attacker 10 fold. This man (of something) is the ultimate counter-fighter, but he can be beaten. I couldn\u2019t tell what they were talking about, but all I know is that Xeilia summoned something from the skies and was a gigantic angelic blade from heaven <br>\r\n\u201cNow that is overkill\u201d I commented then it impacted directly on Shauk which he was actually was holding the giant blade back with his own and then the blade was absorbed into his prism blade and he unleashed a bright rainbow of energy at Xeilia which not only destroyed her, but it basically took out half the city in a straight line, both of us were speechless and Shauk yelled<br>\r\n\u201cMy work is done!\u201d He disappeared and both of us were staring the destruction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Viktor, this one was kind of overpowered for you so it won\u2019t go against you, now it is time for you to beat me\u201d He said and we instant transmission to an area of the city that wasn\u2019t ravaged, I looked around to find Trick, but he wasn\u2019t anywhere, <br>\r\n\u201cOkay Viktor, this is a test of survival, try to survive my onslaught of attacks for 2 minutes or let\u2019s see if you can find me, ready? Go!\u201d His yell echoed through the empty streets. <br>\r\n\u201cThis would be easier if my armor wasn\u2019t-\u201cA shot rang out and hit my in the arm before I even finished \u201cScrewed\u2026well this is bullcrap\" Long story short I did survive the onslaught of bullets that keep rebounding towards me no matter where I ran or hid. Apparently Trick was at a vantage point that oversaw everything so he was able to get me. <br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations! You survived the first passage, now there is a couple more to go!\u201d Trick said and I groaned <br>\r\n\u201cCouple more areas to fight or a couple more people?\u201d I questioned and I was damn tired and still in pain, and he still ignored it <br>\r\n\u201cMore areas to fight more people, speaking of, all of your friends went through their passage and here are the ones who lost, Alyssa and Sargith. Renma, Dusk, Tech, Natalie and Johnny passed their passage and are moving on to their next area, which would be a team battle with your friend Tech and the others a randomized order.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo why me and Tech the ones not randomized?\u201d I asked and I was still in pain from all of the shots I taken <br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you basically had the same list of friends so why not? Oh and don\u2019t worry about your friends who lost, they are helping out the guys in the real world and worry not about your armor and condition, it will all be okay\u2026right now\u201d There was a sudden flash of light and I arrived at- <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Doc, which is his initial for Dimitri Oravice Circen, but we call him doc for laughs and giggles and coincidentally that his specialty. He is white with a green and blue eye, black medium hair; he is about averaged height and is wearing a brown hard lab coat and a red scarf around his neck, what he has for weapons are a bunch of bottles and syringes under his lab coat. Gabriel is a very muscular, tall black person with black short hair, red eyes, and wears a full-stone armor with red runes plus a giant ham-axe (Hammer + Axe hybrid) imbedded with fire runes and rage.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the forest passage of both your memories of where two of you with a bunch of your friends trained here several times and beaten the living crap out of each other\u201d Doc said <br>\r\n\u201cRules in this area are that you cannot remember any past friends so you have no support at all\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, where are we battling for the first match?\u201d Tech questioned <br>\r\n\u201cThe training ground\u201d Doc answered and there was another sudden flash. Both of us ended up at the old training ground where there were just dummy posts scattered around the area, targets, craters, charred bodies and trees.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTech was looking at some of the dummies that were battle damaged \u201cHuh, I wonder if this is a hint on what we are fighting first\u201d Then I heard something whirring and charging <br>\r\n\u201cWait what the-?\u201d Then I saw something glowing red in the tree line and it was aimed right at the unsuspecting Tech \u201cTech, watch it, behind us!\u201d I yelled over to him, he looked back and saw the red glare of the weapon and then the bullet rain of the weapon coming right at him, but he thankfully got out of the way and the bullets made mincemeat of the dummies, targets, and the trees. Tech was just yelling at the amount of destruction the weapon caused and imagined what would have happened to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, bloody hell, I missed the target. Ah, I have to stop frickin\u2019 spray n\u2019 pray\u2019n\u201d Said a cocky sounding voice and I figured out who it was, Gunny, and low and behold he came out of the tree line. Gunny was below average height, human, had black eyes, brown short hair, wore a full forest-camo suit with armor and had the devil rifle (A fully automatic weapon that is big, red, black, and has a lot of mechanisms specifically for fast-shooting, reducing recoil, and increasing damage to turn regular bullets into heated death bringers) <br>\r\n\u201cWait aren\u2019t there suppose to be two of you?\u201d I asked and then I heard a whistling sound \u201cThat is Lau\u2019 Zen isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said blankly<br>\r\n\u201cAre panda\u2019s black and white?\u201d Gunny questioned, it was true, Lau\u2019 Zen is a panda that was a heavy weapons specialist, but sometimes his aim is very off. <br>\r\n\u201cTech, do you take the heavy weapons specialist or the commando?\u201d I asked him and Gunny was just grinning sadistically <br>\r\n\u201c\u2026is that a trick question?\u201d Then another artillery shot landed in the tree line \u201cUh\u2026good luck with the commando!\u201d Tech just ran into the woods while I am facing the commando *Boom* and avoiding the artillery at the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Viktor!\u201d Gunny said in a sing-song voice, I look at him and his weapon started to glow more brilliantly red, I ran into the tree line to avoid some of the shots \u201cSay hello to my little friend, Hellfire!\u201d He just opened fire into the tree line completely annihilating everything in the way, the bullets just melted through everything and I was just running through the tree line firing slugs at him, but from my point it wasn\u2019t going to do much.  <br>\r\n\u201cAhahahahah\u2026wait where the dickens you go?\u201d He questioned, apparently he was enjoying firing so much he lost track of what he was firing \u201cOh bugger all\u201d I was hiding behind a target and I heard still heard the explosions, but it was far of in the distance, even with the trees I could see electricity flying into the air. It must be one heck of a fight and then I heard something rustling, I readied my weapon and saw it was just a deer. <br>\r\n\u201cWow, random ass fauna. Wait a minute\u201d I had an idea and I fired a shot near the deer\u2019s leg and it ran throughout the tree line, I just hope he fell for it and from the look on his face he did. <br>\r\n\u201cThere you are! Eat hot lead, it is hunting season!\u201d He opened fired again; damn that weapon has a lot of ammo. While he was distracted with the deer, I snuck around and crept silently behind him until he realized it wasn\u2019t a deer. <br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute, that\u2019s a bloody deer what the-?\u201d I quickly shot him in the back 4 times; he hit the ground and was bleeding out quickly<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you cheeky little bugger, I should\u2019ve known goddammit! Screw my bad sight!\u201d He was reaching for his weapon and I shot his arm which it was not longer attached to him \u201cCome on you bastard, finish me!\u201d I was aiming at his head when I heard artillery falling down; I look up to see it coming down hard, I dived for cover as Gunny yelled \u201cOh bloody hell! This is fucking friendly f-\u201cI just heard an impact, explosion, and the sounds of gore and blood splattering all around. I got looked up after the explosion and saw the only thing left there was his weapon and alot of pieces of his body. <br>\r\n\u201cNow that is how you end it, with a bang, now rest in peace Gunny\u2026rest in pieces, dammit I keep forgetting this is not real!\u201d I checked to see the condition of Tech through the radio, \u201cHey Tech, did you defeat Lau Zen?\u201d There was crackling, but I heard his voice<br>\r\n\u201cIf I have burns all over me and that he martyrdom himself, yes I defeated him and thanks for asking for my condition\u201d Tech joked and there was another flash and this time we were at a waterhole (All with the waterfall, river leading off, rocks covering the area, and trees in the background)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember this place; we used to take breaks here, screw around with the local wildlife, and I remember the time one of the guys accidently froze the place and everyone used his face to break the ice\u201d Tech said, feeling nostalgic for the good old days. <br>\r\n\u201cI would hate to see who we are fighting\u201d I retorted until I heard rustling in the woods and a figure flying over head \u201cScrew my sarcasm\u201d Then the figure landed and the one hiding in the wood work came out of hiding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The one that was hiding was a female wood elf in an elite forest ranger robe (Basically a female version of links outfit plus a face mask) was Zaire Reis: She was slim, had purple-dark eyes, and had blonde hair. The one that landed was Regis Plasmateur, an insectoid looking person that is tall with all the insect-looking armor, mask and four wings. But in reality he is really a hybrid of an insect and I think human. <br>\r\n\u201cOh I remember these guys\u2026oh crap I remember these guys, well this is going to be extremely annoying\u201d I said to myself and Zaire just brought out a mystic bow, fired up, and then the single arrow shattered into a wall of mystic arrows and Regis was screeching very loudly that were making our ears pop. Both of us were cupping our ears in pain, \u201cTech, any ideas?! I yelled over to him and he quickly let go of his ears and pounded the ground with electricity <br>\r\n\u201cThunder dome!\u201d A dome of electricity surrounded us blocking some of the arrows and most of the hyper-sound<br>\r\n\u201cTech\u2026have I ever said how useful you are?\u201d I asked him and he was focusing on keeping the dome on \u201cWell I fucking love you bro\u2026no gay crap\u201d Then the dome started fluctuating <br>\r\n\u201cThunder shock!\u201d The dome instantly dispersed spreading in a wide area \u201cWait, Viktor what did you say? I was partially deaf from Regis\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing\u2026just yelling out orders\u201d I looked at where the two were attacking us from and saw that both were temporarily stunned \u201cI take the ranger and you zap the bug?\u201d I asked him and he nodded \u201cAlright then!\u201d Tech went over to Regis and began zapping him while I went over to the tree line and searched the area with a thermal vision. That was when I got shot in the back in the arrow <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, is that all you got\u201d I was taunting her until there was a humming sound \u201cHm? What is- AUGH!\u201d I was forced down hard into the ground \u201cScrew gravity arrows or whatever the arrow was!\u201d I was slowly getting up when I heard a twang sound and then I felt a very hard force knocking me back into a tree, I immediately held my head up and saw an arrow heading right for me, I immediately got my shotgun and blasted the thing in mid-air, but then it released some sort of poison cloud and it was still heading for me, I rolled out of the way and it hit the tree, melting it away. \u201cWell this is going to suck a lot\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I heard an explosion, I looked around to see what that was and it was explosive impact arrows. I was literally just running and dodging the arrows because I did not want to blow up and I had no clue where she was, even with the thermal vision. \u201cOkay then, life detection?\u201d I switched to the life detection and everything just glowed. For fucks sake this is getting annoying! I just stopped caring and loaded random types of shells into the shotgun \u201cYou want to play hardball? I'll give you overkill!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I randomly shot throughout the forest random shells which things were lit on fire, things froze, and others were reduced to nothing. I reloaded and fired then repeated the process when I accidentally fired several splinter shells (Splinter shells were special ammunition that had angled lead parts that bounced off everything until it ran out of velocity or durability. These were banned in several military installations for massive amounts of friendly fire incidents.) And then everything went to hell. The splinters were bouncing off of everything, some hitting me and brutally injuring me, some went through wood and rock like it was butter, and then I heard someone yell in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I was going to check up if Zaire was dead or not until I heard someone yelling in the sky, I looked up and it was just an electrical light show with Tech on Regis\u2019s back and zapping him and Regis is flying erratically shocking Tech with his own electricity. I assumed that he needed help getting him down since it looked like he was doing nothing, so I loaded in a single slug shot and took aim. I aimed carefully and leaded the target, I fired and fortunately I somehow hit Regis and he was going down, unfortunatley Tech was with him so...damn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the crash site where Regis landed, Tech was just sitting on a rock and he was nursing a bullet hole in his side. <br>\r\n\u201cNice shooting, for the love of all that is mighty I didn\u2019t need help, I had it all under control!\u201d Tech said with a bit annoyance and anger in his voice <br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, Regis had electricity resistance to his armor and he was countering your electricity with his own?\u201d I questioned<br>\r\n\u201cThat about covers it, so I suppose your done with your battle?\u201d He asked<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, I accidentally shot several splinter shells and everything went to shit and then I heard a howl of pain\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI am not going to ask why you had a splinter shell, speaking of which next time you decide to pull off a shell roulette that is unoriginal, make sure you don\u2019t have destructive ammunition in your pocket!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo, when are we changing scenes?\u201d Then there was a flash and we were at a steep cliff over looking an ocean \u201cOk, never mind\u201d The sun was setting and the brilliant reflection off the water gives even more peace. This is the same cliff where some of us would watch nature\u2019s beauty until one of us grows bored of it and launches the explosives.  Speaking of which since this was the last match before we fight Doc and Gabriel.  I just wondered who we would face, then I noticed the person sitting at the cliff</span></div></div>",

It was definitely female, she had long purple hair, seemed short, wore a full black outfit and she had 4 blades strapped to her<br>\r\n\u201cTech refresh my memory, I forgot who that is\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat is Jai\u2019sai Korosu\"<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, I would love to see how good she fights, hold on I am going to come up to her\u201d I went up to Jai who was watching the sunset and was completely ignoring me \u201cHey Jai, it is time to fight us\u201d She was quiet until she sighed <br>\r\n\u201cYou two aren\u2019t worth the time or the effort\u201d She said blankly <br>\r\n\u201cI thought all the memories were supposed to fight us\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct, but I am different because it is a waste of my time\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo how are we supposed to pass through you?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThis is how\u201d One of her blades started glowing black and purple \u201cDemon rise 8th legion\u201d Her blade unsheathed itself and dove itself into the ground making black vortex\u2019s on the ground with black creatures emerging from them \u201cTry to survive\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short a bunch of demon-like enemies came out to fight us whom most were generic soldiers with melee weapons and long-range weapons while there was a few that were more special and annoying to take down\u2026oh and Tech was smothered by a giant black blob.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe demon soldiers that attacked us were all slain with their blood covering the battle area, their bodies ripped to shreds or burned from electrocution, Jai didn\u2019t even care about what happened and Tech was covered in black gunk.  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this stuff?\u201d Tech said in disgust while he was wiping the black gunk off his armor <br>\r\n\u201cWell congrats on beating the minor demons, they were useless anyway\u201d All the demons blood and bodies evaporated into black mist \u201cNow lets see how you handle this, Echoed mirror, 1st soul\u201d The second blade glowed teal and blue as two pentagrams appeared on the ground and 2 figures emerged.  What I noticed about the two figures is that they were ethereal and they basically had the same weapons and armors as us, just without the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to look at the distance and the two doppelgangers attacked us and we attacked back, but there was a problem, we kept canceling each other out making a large stalemate.  <br>\r\n\u201cHey Tech, you mind stunning this guy for me?!\u201d I yelled over seeing that I was fist fighting him to the edge with Tech and his double throwing electric balls at each other, canceling each other out. <br>\r\n\u201cSure, right after you shoot this guy!\u201d I quickly drawed my shotgun and shot Tech\u2019s double as Tech zapped my double with electricity. Both were temporarily stunned so we took our chance to attack, I kicked my double off the ledge and Tech just zapped his until it died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very long, speaking of which try this one on for size, Clan of fire: 2nd chapter\u201d Jai said as her 3rd blade glowed red and yellow.  The things that were summoned was a couple flame atronach, several fire golems, several magma lizards and a ton of fire skeletons\u201cOh you have got to be kidding me! KNOCK THEM OFF THE LEDGE!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long story short, the summoning were a bastard to beat due to how many of them, but we managed to send many of them off the ledge. Although the ones that were to heavy or stubborn to knock off were kind of a bastard to beat due to either their massive defense or that they moved so much that we couldn\u2019t aim for crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time, don\u2019t use another summoning to attack us!\u201d I yelled at her \u201cSeriously we just need to beat you and that will be it\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you have one more summoning to beat\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThank you! Jeez!\u201d Her final blade glowed brilliantly white<br>\r\n\u201cDragon heart, 5th winter 2nd rise\u201d Then I heard a very loud roar followed by a giant arctic dragon. <br>\r\n\u201cThat thing better not eat me\u201d Tech said as he prepared for the worst and I loaded incendiary shells into my shotgun. The dragon then landed behind Jai and roared right in our faces, then the dragon breathed out a frost breathe that was as cold as winter. Speaking of winter I was completely frozen to my neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap this is cold!\u201d I yelled out and I tried to move anything which it didn\u2019t work and I fell over to the ground still frozen \u201cUh, sorry Tech, but I am currently unavailable right now. If you want to leave a message, do it after the scream of not feeling your own balls\u2026OH MY FUCKING GOD! AHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cAh, screw me then!\u201d Tech yelled out and then the battle started with him yelling out moves, tons of electricity, and roaring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most of the battle I did not see anything since my face was on the ground, but I heard alot of generic battle stuff <br>\r\n\u201cHey Tech are you done with that dragon yet? I am tired at looking at ground for the next 3 hours!\u201d I then heard a loud gulping sound from the dragon and muffled shouting \u201cOh that doesn\u2019t sound good\u201d I also heard something rumbling and electricity crackling \u201cOh wait a minute\u201d I heard a loud dispersion of electricity behind me and I am pretty damn sure some of the dragons parts landed near my head and on my back.<br>\r\n\u201cThank god I got out of that dragons stomach! Jeez I smell like shit *Groans* Okay Viktor I am going to break you out of your ice prison\u201d I heard Tech come up behind me and he began smashing the ice off.<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations on beating the dragon, but unfortunately your princess is in another castle\u201d I joked and I got out of my prison \u201cThanks\u201d I went up behind Jai and was very pissed \u201cOkay Jai, did we win?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026actually you sort of did, but those weren\u2019t me and you haven\u2019t beaten me yet so technically you didn\u2019t beat me, but since I called forfeit because both of you are a waste of my time\u201d She then stood up and jumped off the cliff <br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026that was anti-climatic\u201d Tech said and then Doc and Gabriel came up from the tree line<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, that means you have to fight us next\u201d Gabriel said <br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, are both of you ready to fight?\u201d Doc questioned <br>\r\n\u201cYes we are!\u201d Both of us yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, now give us a second\u201d Gabriel said as both of them back away. <br>\r\n\u201cINTERNAL COMBUSTION!\u201d Gabriel yelled out as he slammed his fist together engulfing himself in fire <br>\r\nDoc pulled out a syringe and inserted it in his arm which he looked very twitchy and shaky \u201cReady!\u201d Doc said very quickly. When Doc ran he was just a blur and he went between us, took Tech and went back in the tree line<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh damn\u201d I said and Gabriel tackled me down to the ground and began to punch me in the face with his fist\u2019s of fury. I tried to kick him off, but it didn\u2019t work as he was just very heavy and continued relentlessly with the barrage of fiery fists of doom. That was when something exploded between us knocking both of us back, Gabriel was sent flying into the trees while I was launched near over to the cliff. I just assumed that there was a grenade on my belt that was ignited by Gabriel\u2019s fire, either that or a shell went off as you know ammunition can be set off by fire. I quickly got up and readied my shotgun by loading cryo rounds to try to counter his raging fire, which I just saw his internal combustion ignite even hotter and he was charging with his hammer over him ready to smash me. I rapidly shot the cryo rounds into him which it did something, but he didn\u2019t seem to care as he continued to charge towards me very quickly. That was when I got a very crazy idea so I went over the Cliffside and held on to the side of it, well I hope it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cViktor, you are not getting out that easily! Gabriel roared as he actually went over the cliff and went into the deep water below which created a lot of steam. I climbed back up and began running into the forest to help Tech. <br>\r\n\u201cGood thing he can't swim\u201d I thought to myself as I got to the edge of the forest and I saw a fireball coming straight for me, I ducked and saw that Tech was running which he bumped into me very hard and we both went down. \u201cTech where\u2019s the fire?\u201d I asked him<br>\r\n\u201cComing straight for us!\u201d Tech yelled as we both got up quickly and prepared to fight whatever Doc injected into himself <br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he inject into himself?\u201d I asked <br>\r\n\u201cA lot of eve-hypo\u2019s!\u201d Tech responded <br>\r\n\u201cEve-hypos? Wait don\u2019t tell me-\u201cDoc came out of the forest line and I could see what he did to himself. The guy that used to be this scrawny chemical expert was now a hulking brute with veins popping out and tons of different powers and energies flowing through him \u201cAh\u2026shit\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry this won\u2019t hurt a bit!\u201d His voice has gotten more deformed and distorted \u201cIt will hurt like hell!\u201d Doc charged straight for us and both of us were bashed into the forest. I hit a tree with so much force that I was sure that my spine snapped, for Tech I have no clue where he went. Doc was stomping towards me and I got my shotgun and unloaded on him, it seemed to do something, but he didn\u2019t seem to care as his arms were engulfed inflames and was about to smash me down when I loaded in a splinter round in my shotgun<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, I'm an expert!\u201d I fired the splinter round\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the splinter storm that almost killed me I looked up to see that Doc got completely screwed over by the looks of how shredded open his entire body was, it was basically just a hulking ravaged corpse that was eaten by a pack of buzzards and wolves. Yet there hasn\u2019t been an indication that we were done.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Tech! Form up on my position ASAP!\u201d I yelled out and he immediately came out with several wounds on him <br>\r\n\u201cDammit Viktor, friendly fire\u201d Tech yelled out in a pissed off tone<br>\r\n\u201cAh shut up, either your dead or your alive with gunshot wounds\u201d I said and he stared at me blankly. Then there was another flash, this time it was in a city covered by snow and ice...</span></div></div>",

There is a chance that you may encounter people the other person hasn't met yet. Also there is a high chance of death since all of them are one of the harder opponents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, so we are now fighting people who are now even stronger\" Tech said <br>\r\n\"Well, this is one way to practice fighting\" I said as both of us walked in a random direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nI watched from the rooftops, hiding from sight as both went in the direction of the clock tower; let\u2019s see how they fare against them<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked right into the city square to see what you would normally see in a square, frozen  trees, frozen operating clock tower, and all the generic central furniture that is frozen. <br>\r\n\u201cNow why the hell would there be these things be here?\u201d I questioned <br>\r\n\u201cSpecial plants that can live in the freezing cold, I think this is just for aesthetics\u201d Tech responded as the clock tower began to ring its bell which sounded very horrendous <br>\r\n\u201cThat clock tower might as well be the final boss!\u201d I said when I noticed something strange about the clock; the number 12 was glowing red \u201cTech do clock towers do that?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing that's the number of guys we have to fight, well isn\u2019t this going to be absolute bull?\u201d Then suddenly the entire area was graying out and it seems time has stopped, then there was a static noise and crackling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTick-tock, your time is almost up, maybe its time you meet some old friends\u201d A disembodied voice said as 12 figures that are clouded by darkness appeared around the clock tower<br>\r\n\u201cWell here we go again, this time there are 12 of them\u201d I said as 2 shadows dispersed leaving 2 people that had the same weapons and armors as me and Tech, except they were red \u201cYou know sometimes I hate doppelgangers, but I think this is a bit to much\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you calling doppelgangers?\u201d The red Viktor questioned <br>\r\n\u201cWe are better versions of you, stronger, faster, and smarter!\u201d The red Tech said <br>\r\n\u201cI think the term evil versions fit the description just right\u201d Tech responded<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just fight!\u201d I yelled and took a shot at my double that took the shot, but didn\u2019t seem to care<br>\r\n\u201cWas that supposed to hurt?\u201d He questioned \u201cOur turn\u201d My double pointed his shotgun at me and it glowed a blood-red color as Techs double charged an attack and red electricity sparked all over the ground as I loaded in random shotgun shells and Tech charged his attack, then we let everything light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRed Dawn!\u201d My double shot a series of red lasers at us<br>\r\n\u201cThis is overkill, I swear\" I quickly unloaded different shotgun shells into their path<br>\r\n\u201cZeus Maelstrom!\u201d Techs double literally made a red electrical tornado<br>\r\n\u201cThunder dome!\u201d Tech made an electrical barrier around us and I stopped firing to see that some of the lasers went through and nearly hit us, the tornado came into contact and the electrical barrier turned red for some reason \u201cUh oh\u201d Tech said <br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess\u2026\u201d I said <br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the positive and negative electrical currents aren't compatible\" we were then electricuted and it hurt like hell as it practically cooked our insides and gave us electrical brain trauma, we are not going to walk this off\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the onslaught of attacks we got up with an excruciating pain running through our bodies, which was the electricity stunning us every where. I looked around to see that the entire area was annihilated and reduced to cinders from that single moment. The two opposites that launched their attacks didn\u2019t even have a scratch on them <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d My opposite questioned \u201cYou are still alive?! Tech you weak-ass son of a bitch, your attack didn\u2019t finish them off!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cMy attack?! Well excuse me, but my attack actually did something!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, absolute shit!\u201d <br>\r\nI was laughing a little, mainly because I just realized that when these two were either opposites or evil versions, either way it seems that they don\u2019t work well with each other. That was when they pulled arms at each other and fought. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Tech\u201d I poked his body and he twitched a little <br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Did we win or are we dead?\u201d He questioned <br>\r\n\u201cNo look, these guys are actually fighting each other\u201d We both look to see that Viktor was hitting Tech in the face with his shotgun and Tech grabbed his shotgun and electrocuted him <br>\r\n\u201cIt takes all kinds, speaking of let me just check my pack-\u201cI said<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually just remember you had that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I haven\u2019t been using this at all\u201d I basically just loaded my shotgun, checked what weapons I had and inventory for other things \u201cNow let me see, different blades, mines, grenades, rpg\" <br>\r\n\u201cWow spacious back-pack\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI know, you know what I\u2019ll end it right now\u201d I grabbed the rpg and aimed at the two opponents, who were still fighting each other. I fired and hoped it hit, but then my opposite punched Tech's opposite down to catch the rpg projectile with both his hands \"What the heck?\"  <br>\r\n\"Hey! Do not shoot us while we are fighting each other!\" My opposite yelled in a fit of rage as he threw the RPG round into a building \"Tech! Get up, let's kick these guy's asses...Tech?\" He kicked Tech's body only to see that he was not moving \"Oh, well shit, well in that case, bring it on!\" My opposite grabbed his shotgun from the ground and cocked it <br>\r\n\"Its been on\" I said and both of us aimed our shotguns at each other and fired. The massive difference between the two was that I fired regular rounds while his actually fires lasers. \"Oh crap!\" Me and Tech just ran for cover as my double just focused-fired on me. I returned fire as I was running between the avalible cover that didn't provide much protection against lasers. While I was doing that I saw that Tech was circling around to hit him behind the back. At the moment that my double began to reload, Tech charged from behind and got on his back, in which he was electricuting him all to heck while I ran at him at front to deliver a execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As I was running at him, he got out of his stun and threw Tech off his back and slammed him onto the ground, he immediately focused his attention to me which my barrel was right in his face. <br>\r\n\"And now, it has been done\" I fired endlessly into my opposite, which he kept being knocked back by the force of my shotgun and by the amount of distant between us just made it all the deadlier. He hit the ground, but he was somehow still alive. I walked up to him to see that he was bleeding out quickly, to end it I slammed the butt of my shotgun into his helmet which not only went through it, but also his skull. I ran back to Tech to help him up to see a massive wound to where my double had hit him \"Are you okay Tech?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, just fine\" He responded. Then the clocked tower rang and a deep voice said <br>\r\n\"That's two down, only ten to go!\u201d The Clock tower ticked down to 10 and it grew brighter and redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more shadows dispersed to fight us, now this cannot be good. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So just to recap, the ones who lost were Sargith, Alyssa, Johnny, and Renma. Natalie, Dusk, Viktor and Tech are still inside their own minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n ------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Johnny lost he immediately went back through the portal that led to the big empty...well before that he took his allies weapons and then went out *Don't ask how*. Since he is a scavenger and doesn't waste anything he stripped the saint of material, he went through buildings and obtained different material and weapons, at the places where his allies fought he obtained material from things like the giant plasma tank and the hoard of robots and screwed up experiments. In the main building which would be the tallest structure in the area he went to the closest thing that resembled a workbench of sorts and laid out all the materials he got and the weapons he stole from the others. <br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's see here...Alyssa's laser cannon thing is missing it's lens (Which he stole) and with this lens from the plasma tank and the parts from the saint...Damage increased by 90%, recoil down by 20%, Sargith's weird guitar-thing with material from the dream world with the strong steel-alloy from those douche-bots...durability up by 110% to magical input by 90%, Viktor's shotgun with the material of the saint, scrap metal and the parts from a experimental spreader-weapon...damage up by 150%, range 40%, reduced recoil by 10% and reduced spread by 10% well he is going to be happy about this, Natalie's staff...um...should I even bother upgrading this...ah whatever... from material of the dream world...magical input increased by 110% and melee damage by 50%, Tech's gloves with the electronic and metal scraps he has electrical potency to increase by 105% and melee damage increase by 40% with an added special function that he would just love if in close quarters, Renma's assassin's blades with this alloy I found in a building, penetration by 50% and damage by 110% and there is Dusk's blade...material from the plasma tank and plasma blades I found should work...well that looks different, damage up by 200%, weight down by 50%, and intimidation up by 100%...oh right I forgot about myself...my magnums have an increased boring ability by 70%, damage by 100%...alright then time to go back ho- oh crap\" There was now douche-bots at the front door, Johnny grabbed a weapon and prepared to fight again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa, Renma, and Sargith were wandering the forest to admire the scenery, <br>\r\n\"So...\" Alyssa said \"How is everyone?\" <br>\r\n\"Fine\" Renma replied<br>\r\n\"I'm good\" Sargith replied<br>\r\n\"How did you guys get defeated?\" <br>\r\n\"I was mauled by a tree\" Sargith said <br>\r\n\"I underestimated Johnny's leader\" Renma replied<br>\r\n\"I was beaten by an old friend mine\" Alyssa said to them <br>\r\n\"You know\" Sargith said \"When I first joined I did not expect to see this, I mean at first I kind of panicked back at the empty because I did not expect to meet that so soon\" <br>\r\n\"You should've expected it\" Renma said coldly \"In this world there is the expected and unexpected, I always expect for the unexpected to happen like that fight I lost\" <br>\r\n\"So Renma, why did you join?\" <br>\r\n\"Me? Well It wasn't my intention to go, it was by my faction that I be a sign of alliance that I joined, what about you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...my faction is already aligned with the alliance, I just joined because...\"<br>\r\n\"You like Tech?\" Sargith answered for her <br>\r\n\"What?! No!\" <br>\r\n\"Come on, admit it, do you like him or not?<br>\r\n\"Did Viktor put you up to this? I don't like him like that\"<br>\r\n\"So...you love him like that?\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" <br>\r\n\"Wait, where's my weapons?\" Renma questioned herself and both of them just realized that their weapons were also gone \"Did those mischievous fairies do this?\" <br>\r\n\"When in doubt, always blame Johnny\" Alyssa said <br>\r\n\"Yeah, he probably got them somehow\" Sargith said <br>\r\n\"I swear, one of these days that habit is going to kill us\" Renma said <br>\r\n\"So, guessing game, which faction do you think Natalie belongs in?\" Alyssa questioned<br>\r\n\"Probably the Ancients\" Sargith replied<br>\r\n\"Viktor?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe the splinter cell hunter division\" Renma replied<br>\r\n\"Now what about Tech?\" Sargith and Renma were sort of stumped <br>\r\n\"I'm assuming he belongs to the BIA\" Renma said <br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably, but he looks like he was from another faction\" Sargith said <br>\r\n\"So...looks like we have to look toward the sky for this one\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Later ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...it\" The man in the trench coat and wrapped face said as he died in a cloud of darkness and the clock had reached down to 1 <br>\r\n\"Finally we can be finished with this!\" Viktor said with relief <br>\r\n\"This was a hard one, now let's not die at the final boss, right partner?\" Tech questioned <br>\r\n\"Right\" Both of them looked around to see what came next, but no one was appearing \"So what, are we fighting the cold now?\" Then a figure appeared from atop the clock tower and he jumped down to the ground, making a large impact crated \"oh crap\" The person who jumped down was wearing a jade wolf mask, he wore a royal green cloak, brown boots, and had an assortment of gun blades on him <br>\r\n\"Oh shit...not this guy!\" Tech said in shock<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's him...it's\" <br>\r\n\"Teacher, I know Melchior's appearance any where\" Tech said <br>\r\n\"Ah yes, you remembered the one that taught many, you managed to beat all of those individuals and I congratulate you for that, but at one time I fought all of you at once and defeated all of you, will you even lay a finger on me this time?\" <br>\r\n\"...\" Both Viktor and Tech stayed silent and stared at Melchior <br>\r\n\"It is impressive you've made it this far, it's even more impressive you managed to defeat Bishop, but can you match up to me, that is the question\" <br>\r\n\"Well, we won't give up because you are our Teacher\" Viktor said <br>\r\n\"And we will try even if the odds are against us\" Tech said <br>\r\n\"Ah-ha ha ha ha, there's the two pupils I taught, now show me your strength\" Melchior pulled out two shotgun swords while Tech and Viktor took a battle stance... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Holy crap!\" Johnny yelled as he dived through the portal as a hoard of douche-bots were shooting at him, which the portal closed in time for the robots to not deal that much damage. He lay on the ground heavily breathing since he was running like no tomorrow and with the amount of weapons he had on him his stamina was that much drained, also he was hit several times, but when running from killer robots that type of pain can be ignored. <br>\r\n\"Hey!\" A high-pitched voice said, which you all know what this is \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah...I'm good\" He replied \"Can you do me a favor?\" <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Give these weapons to my friends and I need some heals!\" <br>\r\n\"Sure!\" So a bunch of fairies came along and grabbed the weapons to give to their owners and Johnny got his healing, what happens now is very coincidental... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alyssa, Renma, and Sargith were walking through the forest, they were attacked by a large group of floating head souls...which was not only questionable, but also unfortunate since they don't have weapons...yet <br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of-!\" Sargith yelled <br>\r\n\"Wandering souls...how original\" Renma said <br>\r\n\"This is a really bad time without our weapons!\" Alyssa said when a group of fairies came out of nowhere, dropped the weapons, and then just scurried off. All 3 of them were surprised to see that happening and they weren't complaining as they picked up their weapons and noticed some significant difference in their combat efficiency <br>\r\n\"Anyone notice how much these guys are going down easier than expected?\" Sargith questioned as musical notes were being stabbed into souls <br>\r\n\"Sort of\" Alyssa said as she blasted away 5 souls <br>\r\n\"Could be a placebo, they might be weak or our equipment has been improved\" Renma replied as she stabbed a soul between the eyes \"Also, you shouldn't say that as something could always-\" Then a bolt of magic quickly came out of the thicket and struck the ground beneath her and she was sent flying into a tree, knocking her out. After that the souls stopped attacking and retreated back into the thicket.  <br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Alyssa questioned as a cloaked figure came out of the thicket creepily laughing, which there was orbs of light surrounding it \"Who the heck are you?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm no one!\" The figure replied as the orbs became an assortment of weapons and they came at both of them<br>\r\n\"Well we're screwed\" Sargith said blankly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Natalie and Dusk's match (Haven't seen these two in a while eh?) they were basically fighting a giant mystical golem that was covered in yellow runic symbols and was using it's own weapons which were gigantic, of course, and they were fighting in an ancient temple. Also it was smashing it's axe onto Dusk who was blocking it while Natalie was using magic on it, <br>\r\n\"Damn it Natalie, try harder!\" Dusk yelled as his legs were now becoming part of the ground <br>\r\n\"I can't! This thing is too strong!\" Natalie replied \"You try doing this, oh mighty tank!\" <br>\r\n\"To busy blocking this thing to do that, oh mighty mage!\" Then Dusk's blade transformed and Natalie sensed a sudden difference in her staff \"What just happened?!\" <br>\r\n\"We got an upgrade, that's what happened!\" Then from her staff she had summoned a magical red sawblade and threw it at the golem...which still did nothing \"Damn it!\" <br>\r\n\"Now my turn!\" Dusk dodged the Golems attack and charged, which he was moving slightly faster than before and his swinging was faster, which when the blade made contact it actually did damage \"I love this thing already!\" Natalie just sighed and thought, <br>\r\n\"I'm useless right now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match versus Melchior wasn't going well. He was known for being one of the greatest swordsman that ever lived and he had the skill to prove it by fighting Tech and Viktor. Not only was he blocking all of their attacks, but he was countering and reflecting them. If Viktor tried to go against him with his own blades they would be tossed aside, if Tech attacked with electricity Melchior would block it, any type of projectile thrown was reflected or blocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all this effort, they still didn't even scratch the guy once, that is how great he is at fighting. <br>\r\n\"We can't even touch this guy\" Tech said out of breathe <br>\r\n\"Well, that shouldn't be surprising, but we also have improved since then and even still...\" Viktor said when their weapons changed, but they didn't changed in appearance and they weren't aware of it. \"So, one last try before we get killed?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure, it's not like we have a choice, might as well be glory\" Both of them nodded at each other and prepared once more, Viktor loaded in slugs and strapped grenades to his side as Tech charged for another fury of electro-balls<br>\r\n\"Ah, one last time eh?\" Melchior questioned \"The will to continue is strong in these two\" and then he thought \"I wonder if they noticed that their weapons have changed\" Both of them attacked and charged, firing what they had left... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Johnny is back into the big empty even with his last encounter with the hoard of robots, at least he isn't being encumbered by the weapons he bought with him. He is currently fixing the saint and progress is going well. The only problem that is both good and bad in their own ways? He is still being attacked by robots, good thing is that he has more material to work with and he knows how to make bullets plus with the AI in the robots, if he is lucky and with all the time he got from observing the technical stuff Tech does (And other places unmentioned) he might make some reprogramming, but since technology is not his strong point and jury-rigging is, there is bound to be motion sensor turrets somewhere. </span></div></div>",

He looked over to Tech who had a mystical cloud hovering over his head and was still fighting Melchior alone and then he woke up, except he jolted up and landed on the ground. Well that must've been one heck of a hit to do that <br>\r\n\"Ouch\" Was the only thing that came out of him <br>\r\n\"So, what happened to you?\" Viktor questioned as he saw Natalie and Dusk still in bed \"Hope those guys are doing better\" <br>\r\n\"There should never be that many swords in one man and live\" Was what Tech responded with \"How did being sliced in 5 pieces go?\" <br>\r\n\"Horribly\" <br>\r\n\"Of course\" Then that moment was broken when Dusk suddenly got up yelling, <br>\r\n\"I just defeated a legendary guardian!\" Which was enough to wake the dead and make their souls come back to them. Natalie soon hot up, saying<br>\r\n\"I was completely worthless in that last battle...I'm ashamed of myself...\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then\" Viktor stated \"What do we do now?\" Then three figures had came in through the door, the two soldiers that helped them while they were in the big empty, Zar-keil and Liy-Kuon with the one in the middle being female and looking more official and purple <br>\r\n\"I would like to congratulate you in passing the trials\" The female said \"My name is Lilanea Ae-Inanna, the leader of this branch of the dream wanderer's\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet your acquaintance\" Viktor said, trying to sound more refined \"I believe since you looked deep into our minds for information of our past's you our names already\" <br>\r\n\"Indeed, I do\" She replied \"I would like to that you two for accomplishing the trials successfully\" She referred to Natalie and Dusk \"And you two\" Referring to Viktor and Tech \"You have spirit and willpower, I know you are strong and even against a foe like that you still continued, I admire that\" All of them went outside to announce to news of the new alliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they went outside, Alyssa, Renma, and Sargith came up to them. <br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys done?\" Sargith questioned \"I mean, successfully completing the trials?\"<br>\r\n\"Me and Tech didn't finish, but we were close\" Viktor replied <br>\r\n\"But me and Natalie over here did, right?\" Dusk questioned, but saw that Natalie still had her head down and remained silent <br>\r\n\"That's great!\" Alyssa said <br>\r\n\"Well, just a few more to go\" Renma said <br>\r\n\"Now that we are acquainted\" Lilanea said \"Everyone, hear me out!\" Then suddenly every single member stopped what they were doing and listened \"From this day forth, we are now allies with the Alliance, from this branch to others, we should convince our brothers and sisters in arms to join in on the fight, now good day!\" Everyone got back to what they were doing \"Okay then, now with that established\" She bowed \"I'll be off then\" She went out in a random direction with her two guards following closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a portal opened, revealing that Johnny was the one coming out <br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" He said and waved \"I see that you're out, did you fail or win?\"<br>\r\n\"Let's not do this again\" Viktor replied \"Overall we have accomplished our goal, now to the next one...\"<br>\r\n\"Before you say anything\" Johnny interrupted \"But I need some help activating the saint, I mostly repaired it, I just need a certain person that knows technology\" <br>\r\n\"You actually repaired the saint?\" Alyssa questioned <br>\r\n\"Mostly\" Johnny replied <br>\r\n\"Okay then\" Tech said \"Lead the way\" Everyone went through the portal and while Tech and Johnny were repairing the saint, everyone else were defending them as the robots were still pissed off for no absolute reason. Well good thing everyone was here to fight them off. When the Saint was fully-functional everyone got onto it and just got out without any questions...okay maybe except one <br>\r\n\"Wait a minute\" Tech said \"Wasn't there a- Then a EMP pulse hit the saint and it was going down...again\" While everyone braced for impact a portal appeared in front of them, they went through it, and they crashed into the middle of an ocean <br>\r\n\"Hey look, we're alive!

I was known for being a badass and insane psychopath, this time I am just insane. All of them were breathing fire, ice, electricity you name it but the good thing about the Tesla warriors fighter jets, borrowed from the Aeolus nomads and Vronto Warriors our allies, is that they generate a wind tunnel around them that can deflect or bounce back certain attacks, that was pretty much the only thing keeping me from being touched from dragon breath, the only problem was that I didn't take in account that some of the dragons would actually ram into the jet and they did and with their size that did more damage so I went down ablaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may have been K.I.A but I managed to kill enough dragons and stall them long enough for my squad to get reinforcements, but they found my crashed jet and charred body, well that sucks. Amazing how the afterlife lets you keep your weapons and armor...pretty wierd but no one is getting my weapon. That little fight happened about 10 years ago and I am still a ghost, alot has happened since then like I heard alot of news from other factions like on the Aeolus Nomads there was a little accident concerning one of the Captains losing a son during a malfunction, several accidents between factions which led to several battles, and within others it just went to hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently over the years I have found my self a construct that was in good condition. Well when I entered the body it felt better than I thought and felt kindof physical instead of ectoplasmic for once. I am pretty sure that my figure would be the usual yellow eyes, yellow cracks or symbols on the body, and what ever they were wearing as armor showed on the stone. On my travels I met a anthro male hammerhead shark named Lor' Azel, a good guy, he was really good at rifles, and he usually headbutted things, the guy was the kind to head straight towards trouble and disregard anything, there was also a female dark elf named Alek' Keel, I figured the first time I meet her she would be a magic user but I was close enough as she actually uses shadow bows and weapons but I also should have figured since she had black armor.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWe just entered a city, the name is unspecified since there are all kinds of activity, as always there are all kinds of species wandering around, many from diffrent factions with diffrent weaponry, and there are those guys with diffrent looking vehicles from whatever they are from, but still the place is just modern with several futuristic buildings here and there. We entered a pub to try to find a job as some sort of mercenary or some shit since well a hammerhead shark, a dark elf assasin, and a electrical construct, sure they would be perfect for mercenary work. We just sat there and drank (Except me since well, I am a construct) and told about stories of our long years of adventuring and slaying diffrent creatures and all that generic crap.

Even though the sirens can be obviously heard, everyone continued fighting as the local law enforcement's strength had been lacking lately and most people could over-power them depending on each sides equipment and experiance. But for some reason this seemed different and I think I might figure out why in the next few minutes. <br>\r\n\"Hey Zaph!\" Lor called over the radio <br>\r\n\"What?\" I questioned <br>\r\n\"I can see the riot van's coming in and the riot police seem very serious\" <br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" <br>\r\n\"Well I see that they are standing in a line formation with riot shields and those guys are holding small guns, the rest of the group are hiding behind them with automatics and longguns, also a anthro bloodhound just got on top of one of the riot vans with a bullhorn\"<br>\r\n\"Everyone stop fighting!\" The bloodhound yelled on the bullhorn yelled and every single person stopped fighting to look at the group of riot police \"Now, surrender now and we won't hurt you...much\" <br>\r\n\"Ah fuck you!\" Someone in the group yelled and everyone took focus on the riot police and opened fired with whatever they had, except me and probably a couple other guys as we strayed away from the group to watch from a distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a entire volley of lead, fire, and explosives on the group of riot police was finished, an entire cloud of smoke was left and people waited to see what had become of them. \"Did you think that would be effective?\" The bloodhound on the bullhorn questioned as he laughed afterwards \"My men can take more punishment than any of you half-wit mercenaries, boomers, and firebugs.I don't care who you are, you are all dead!\" The entire riot police force opened fired through the smoke and the opposing group returned fire only to be taken down quickly by the bulletstorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke had cleared from both sides and I could see that the riot line was not broken and the people who fought them were all dead, the fire, explosive, and a massive group of fighters with various specialities were all shot down by the riot police, wow its no wonder why that man ran. The line broke formation as the riot police got back into their vans and drove off. <br>\r\n\"Hey, anyone alive?\" I questioned on the radio and there was just static \"Come on, were you guys that dumb to stay in the fight?\" <br>\r\n\"Not at all\" Alek responded \"I was hiding in a building behind those riot police, quite a impressive bunch for taking out that many fighters\" <br>\r\n\"Good for you, I was practically in the crossfire in the bulletstorm!\" Lor said with some anger in his tone<br>\r\n\"Well your alive and I don't care how much you have to headbutt something, do that after you get a drink, speaking of, anyone know a good bar or pub that isn't covered and riddled with dead bodies, bullets, and fire?\" </span></div></div>",

To defend 1 of 10 demonic energy core's that drive the power of darkness from other dimensions to this one, to bring beings from the deepest evil and dark worlds known to exist. The sounds of the final battle to determine the will of the light and the strength of the darkness was at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Arkanos was waiting for the intruder's, at the end of the giant corridor to the demonic energy core, the giant door's were forced down and a dozen soldiers with assorted weapons charged in, following a human in heavy armor with a large tower shield and a large blade. Arkanos clapped slowly as he commended the strength of the commander and the soldiers for making it as far down as they did. <br>\r\n\"I commend to you for making it this far, but at this moment you will die where you stand\" Arkanos said as he unsheathed his blade and pointed it at the commander <br>\r\n\"I will not die where I stand, I will kill all where I stand\" The commander said as she slammed her shield down into the ground and held her sword proud <br>\r\n\"Let's see about that\" The energy core started pulsating and dark portals started to appear everywhere around the group that charged in. The soldiers weren't fazed in the slightest as all of them prepared for the worst. Then a horde of zombie-like creatures with white glowing eyes came out of the portals and stormed the group with overwhelming numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly 2 soldiers and the commander remained as they were completely covered in the blood of the zombies. Large piles of bodies are sprawled all over the corridor floor's and the soldiers who fought valiently were torn to shreds. <br>\r\n\"I see you have beaten the zombies, that takes some skill, now you have to pass through me first\" The two soldiers brought their weapons up, but the commander moved her arm to signal them to back away <br>\r\n\"No, this one is mine\" The commander took her shield from the ground and walked toward Arkanos <br>\r\n\"So, may I ask your name, so that I may remember this victory as the one that helped my master?\" <br>\r\n\"Avila Quin, I already know your name Arkanos the XII, the great knight of the order, hero of the reach, and son of Galiant the white. How the mighty have fallen\"<br>\r\n\"And how the weak die\" Arkanos charged with his blade foward and Avila raised her shield high. The two soldiers that survived stayed at the sidelines killing demons that tried to interfere in the battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two fighters, both fought with the limit to their ability, with Avila's reputation being true to its word and Arkanos tiring himself out with all the heavy swings he was taking. He continued until he was at the point he had wasted all his energy on an opponent that didn't even move from her spot, which the opponent being female was an even more devestating blow to his defeat. <br>\r\n\"You finished now?\" Avila questioned as Arkanos impaled the ground with his blade and began walking backwards toward the demonic energy core <br>\r\n\"No...I will finish this and prove that I am the strongest, this is just a set-back as your strategy was one of great cowardice, now don't die before I fight you again!\" Arkanos turned and jumped into the demonic energy core.<br>\r\n\"What a fool\" Avila said as she pulled out a rune-inscribed bomb and threw it into the core, in which it raptured into itself as it dissolved into a cloud of black aura. As she did that the two soldiers were still fighting off the demons<br>\r\n\"Avila, we need some help over here!\" One soldier said as there were even more portals opening, most likely from other core's<br>\r\n\"Get behind me!\" Avila commanded as both left their spots and got behind Avila as the shield to protect them and as them the protectors. <br>\r\n\"Okay you two, you better be as good as you say you are because this is not going to be an easy escape\" Then a large hoard of demons charged with a blasting roar that could be heard throughout the entire underground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Arkanos, he had just entered a world of eternal darkness, where the sun never rises, and all that is left is the remnants of its inhabitants. <br>\r\n\"I have time to rise again and to kill all who stand alive\" Arkanos said as a giant serpent creature came out of the ground breathing fire </span></div></div>",

And then came a dark portal that appeared behind him, but he gave no heed to it as 10 heavily armoured corrupted soldiers came marching out into a line formation with a red and black robed figure with a mask came behind them. <br>\r\n\"Arkanos, the knight of dread\" The figure spoke with a throaty voice \"After an innumerable amount of time since our lord has fallen, he has returned and has begun a new war against the entire world once more. Times have changed and our enemies have new technology, new arts of magic, and now everyone is seperated into individual factions. This is a golden oppurtunity for our rule to flourish\" <br>\r\n\"Is that all you wanted to say?\" Arkanos questioned <br>\r\n\"No, these soldiers are to see how strong you have become\"<br>\r\n\"Is that all? These soldiers are dead men\" All the soldiers brought up their giant black swords as Arkanos brought up his own blade. This one that was not his, but one found in a castle that was imbued with some ancient power that another remnant of the old world. The blade itself was black and greyed with an ominous white light, the hilt imbued with an unknown red jewel and the craftsmanship for a legend. With one swing he completely obliterated all the soldiers leaving nothing, but merely just their armor as the sword absorbed their being and then the sword stopped glowing.<br>\r\n\"Interesting, it seems the great knight has gotten his hands on a powerful artifact.

With a large amount of soldiers, mounted minigun turrets and cannons covering the outer wall and interior. This base was made to offer assistance and protection to a science facility near its location, which in a few moments that protection might not even be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArkanos just strolled towards the winterglade's gate as several darkwatch soldiers (which to remind everyone are wearing black armor with a cross in the center of their chest with guns that have some sort of blade attached to them) approached him with great caution.<br>\r\n\"Identify yourself!\" One soldier said <br>\r\n\"What ever happened to shoot first and double tap later?\" Another soldier questioned<br>\r\n\"Everyone shut up, I have a bad feeling about this\" Another soldier said. Suddenly something in the outpost blew up, which was Arkanos's cue to start his massacre. He immediately pulled his blade out of his sheath and sliced everyone in front of him in half, some being thrown into the wall. He entered the outpost to see that there were just a hoard of all sorts of creatures coming out of nowhere, which they are all being destroyed by the darkwatch forces. <br>\r\n\"They are all to weak!\" Arkanos roared as his sword grew with a red glow and he swung his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sides were caught in Arkanos's attack as most of them died from the initial attack and those who survived died from the loss of blood or simply didn't want to face the dread knight's blade and killed themselves. As it seemed that all were dead, someone had came up to the front gate to see all the dead bodies and the monstrosity that was Arkanos. This person was dressed in a trench coat with black boots, black gloves and his face was covered in some ninja wrappings with red glasses.  <br>\r\n\"Well I'd be damned, everyone in the front is dead here\" The man has said \"Well at least the others at the other side are still alive, I think\" Then he picked up a radio that was in his trenchcoat \"Hey, anyone alive?\" There was feedback, but someone responded<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, all hostiles killed. We are heading at the front ga- holy shit! What the fuck is th-\" Then the transmission ended right there and the air filled with sounds of a battle<br>\r\n\"Hm...so...let the sound of a battle be our melody\" The man said as he pulled out a shotgun with a blade at its hilt \"Come on, I'll show you what true strength is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, both had charged at each other. With the man shooting his shotgun, which didn't seem to faze Arkanos one bit, and as a sign of relishing the fun in battling, Arkanos didn't try to kill the man instantly. </span></div></div>",

You have spent weeks in a dark room with low lighting while being strapped to a examination table (Heavily mind you with chains, metallic head plate, and all the limbs are seperated to avoid any kind of release of some kind) and being injected with multiple syringes full of unknown chemicals which made you feel pain like no other. It felt like someone was electrocuting you with a tesla coil while being shoved into an incinerator. It was endless with all the experimentations, but today they had made a mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsychokinetics route- Basically psychological powers, VERY powerful psychological powers. Plus you know how people make gestures with their hands and pretend they are squishing a persons head or crushing their bodies completely? Well this is exactly the case and even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike always the twisted scientists have injected you with something new everyday, except this time it was diffrent. Your vision started to change as it started to distort into diffrent colors, your mind felt like it was being torn apart and your entire body felt an extreme amount of pressure built into it. You screamed out loud and the scientists plugged their ears in pain as the scream was blood-curdling and sharply high.<br>\r\n\"Ah what the hell?!\" One scientist yelled<br>\r\n\"Dammit, quick get the-\" The other scientists' head exploded and the other one fell to the ground as blood came out of his ears. You were heavily breathing as you just saw two scientists die from your scream alone, you wanted to get out badly and as you were focusing on getting out the bindings that restrained you was torn off violently as it slammed against the ground, making impact marks on them.<br>\r\n\"After all that time...I can finally get out...now where the hell am I?\" You were walking towards the door and you tried to open it to no avail \"I wonder...\" You ran back and pointed at the door like a gun \"BANG!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarms blared out as a female announcer said \"WARNING, WARNING. Test subject #1336 in wing W24 has escaped, all security proceed with extreme caution!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve route: Bioshock refrence! Also the scientists are idiots! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again the scientists are back to inject even more painful syringes in you, it is a surprise you're still even alive, either from willpower or the sadistic scientists keeping you alive, either way you are still trapped. This time you notice that the scientists brought in a blue glowing substance <br>\r\n\"Are you sure this a good idea?\" The assistant questioned<br>\r\n\"Nope, not at all!\" The scientist responded as he injected you with it<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the experimental chemical?\"<br>\r\n\"yes it is!\" <br>\r\n\"What are the effects of it again?\"<br>\r\n\"Unknown, so lets stand back in case this person explodes!\" Both the scientists ran to a safe distance as you felt a mysterious new strength coursing through your veins. For once instead of pain you get the bliss of power and are ready to take on everyone in this sick place. <br>\r\n\"The test subject isn't screaming sir\" The assistance said <br>\r\n\"Maybe it died, hell I don't know, just\" As the scientist was talking your arms turned into a blazing inferno and melted through the bindings \"Oh what in the hell?!\" You jumped off the examination table and looked at them with the most intimidating stare that they wished killed them, you pointed your hand at both of them and snaped your fingers, both of them turned into screaming torches as they went out into the open hall and security guards and scientists watched the show. An alarm was rung and security were going on your position. Let them have it, LET THEM ALL HAVE IT. (note that fire isn't your only power. There is also a wind and ice attack, more can be unlocked through the base by injecting more chemicals in you.)</span></div></div>",

They fell with a slimy and dusgusting thud as they rolled slightly leaving a blood trail. In one hallway (The hallway is very wide for some reason) there was a security team, outfitted with shields, heavy armor, and assault rifles and they went in a line formation. <br>\r\n\"Sir, what are your orders?!\" One security guard yelled<br>\r\n\"Take no survivors!\" A gruff voice yelled on the radio and all of them fired. You put your hand out front and a invisible shield stopped the bullet storm in mid-flight and the security guards were baffled <br>\r\n\"Oh good lord, I fucking hate my job!\" One man yelled<br>\r\n\"I hate the scientists!\" Another retorted as you launch the bullets back at speeds breaking the sound barrier, regular bullets would've reflected off the shields, but these didn't and the bullets sliced through the line like swiss cheese and most of the guards were killed. The ones who survived just ran the opposite direction as you swung your arm, making a gust of force travel through the hallway quickly, one that ravaged the hallway to pieces as those who were too slow were slashed apart before they could even scream of pain. The hallway was non-existant, as nothing was recognizeable and the corpses were no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a security guard looking through the camera's to see the horror the test subject caused. The people watching with you felt fear for the last time and decided to get out now when they had the chance. You and several guys continued to watch when the test subject looked up to the security camera and said<br>\r\n\"I know you all saw that and now you can go to hell\" You notice that his eyes grew white and that it meant you were dead before you cold react to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person sitting at the screen had their head exploded into bits as all of us screamed in shock and horror, we were about to leave the door when someone stopped us. It was the head of security. The head of security was big as he had on an eclipse black heavy armor with a black helmet, and red single-bio tech over his left eye and the rest of his face covered in bandages, his weapons were a minigun, binary blade, and a electro-cannon. This man has killed more rogue test subjects than any one else and many of them were dangerous.<br>\r\n\"Now where are you guards going?\" he questioned and we were even more terrified <br>\r\n\"Trying to escape with our lives!\" One said <br>\r\n\"Escape? There is no escape from your duties, just look at my blade\" It was covered in blood, it was fresh and still dripping \"Want to see?\" We all looked out the doorframe to see all the other guards that left were all sliced apart with faces showing horror. \"now, any questions?\" <br>\r\n\"Sir, no sir!\" We all responded, we were more terrified of him than anyone else. We all grabbed out armor and weapons and followed him, we were walking into the gates of hell at this point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore guards came, and more corpses followed as you walked down a hall that wasn't destroyed and slammed guards and panicking scientists alike into the walls leaivng bloody messes.

JUST FIRE!\" The security head barked and everyone opened fire, but the bullets merely went past him.<br>\r\n\"What the hell is he?!\" A guard yelled and some of them retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Auditor summoned a large demonic looking blade and charged foward towards the line of guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get up you lazy prick\" The auditor said and you got up to feel a strong pain in your chest<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" You questioned<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, I just killed everyone\" You look back to see that there were many guards sliced apart and a large guy with a blade shoved through his head \"So are you going to take me up on that offer?\" He questioned again <br>\r\n\"Let me think for a moment...\"</span></div></div>",

You were bringing down the pursuers by using your psychological power like a gun or just knocking them into buildings with a flick of a wrist. \"Vincent, these guys aren't giving up in the slightest! We need some goddamn- ARGH!\" One of the black hawk's just shot your left arm off and you dropped to the ground, screaming, and grabbing the now severly bleeding arm <br>\r\n\"Hey, what happened?\" Vincent looked back to see you on the ground without a left arm \"Damn! Sorry, but I am not a medic. Here take this medi-pack and do whatever while I keep us moving!\" Vincent dropped the medi-pack on your chest and got back to driving \"Oh my fucking god they have rocket launchers!\" Vincent started swerving all over the road, followed by explosions all over the place. While he was doing that, you got into the medi-pack and saw some basic equipment: Bandages, medical syringes, bottles of something, and a medical sewing kit. <br>\r\n\"I don't even know what some of is, there isn't even any labels\" You grab a random syringe and injected it into your arm. The pain was gone, but you started dozing off \"Oh, I think that-\" You instantly fall unconscious, not from blood loss, but the chemical inside of the syringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou being unconscious was gone unnoticed by Vincent the entire time, as he was too busy driving. Suddenly the radio came back on <br>\r\n\"Hey, what the hell is going on there?\" A male question \"It sounds like World War 3 over there\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, its nothing. Just about 1,000 people in jeeps and black hawks shooting at me!\" Vincent yelled as the jeep was hit by a rocket \"And I have a test subject here with me who doesn't want to rip my heart out, also I need a medic\" <br>\r\n\"Just tell us your location soldier\" <br>\r\n\"Sector F.O.R.D\" <br>\r\n\"Its your lucky day, we are near your location. Now hang tight Vincent\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, get over here .50, before I end up like the rest of my team!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after the transmission was sent, a small group of jeeps came out of nowhere guns a blazing at the large group of pursuers. It just turned into a street war very quickly. <br>\r\n\"Thank god, hey 50, thanks for the assistance\" <br>\r\n\"Ah shut up, just repay me back when we return to the bar and you can get me a drink, eh brother?\" <br>\r\n\"I know that drill. Speaking of, where's that medic?\" <br>\r\n\"You'll get it when we finish fighting all these bastards!\" Vincent just drove as 50's men were massacaring the large group of pursuer's. The battle was even furthered with the large amount of guards posted in the city, along with the seemingly endless amount of reinforcements that keep coming. <br>\r\n\"These guys keep coming!\" 50 yelled as he was firing his .50 Cal off the back of his jeep <br>\r\n\"That's what happens when you piss of one of the Big wigs of the Nexus, am I right?\" <br>\r\n\"Duely noted, I still think we are dragging this battle too long. Hey Hod, you read me?\" 50 said into his radio  <br>\r\n\"Read you sir\" <br>\r\n\"Blast these bastards behind us to kingdom come!\"<br>\r\n\"Already ahead of you sir...uh you might want to drive faster!\" The entire group of jeeps sped up faster as several large missiles came down from the skies and destroyed the remaining enemies<br>\r\n\"Status report\" 50 said <br>\r\n\"9 wounded and 6 dead\" A soldier said as the convoy left the city, that is now on fire from the missiles. <br>\r\n\"Okay men, lets get the hell out of here\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the convoy of jeeps were riding to their destination and a medic was tending to your wound, with you still unconscious, lets just hope nothing happens on the road. But of course something will always go wrong. </span></div></div>",

Thier breath ability is a high-pressure stream of either freezing water or hot water, either way it still hurts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIce: Resides in the cold wasteland of Antartica and other places where it is cold. The ice dragon scales are white and light blue and the ice dragons breath ability is of course a very cold blast of ice or snow which can freeze you solidly or slow you down. These dragons are slower than their faster counter-parts because of the cold where it can harden their wings and scales but that is actually a good thing because the freezing cold has hardened their scales and wings so that they have a better outer shell against attacks meaning they have more defence and durability with speed reduction. Now if the cold can hinder the wings that they harden that means they can't fly, thats actually wrong because due to adaptation their wings have became light as a feather but with the hardness of stone, don't argue with genetics. </span></div></div>",

The scale color of these dragons are usually a mix of tan, yellow and light brown. What makes these dragons special are that they can either breathe out fire or sand which the sand part...don't even ask and the sand burns and has some status effects. The size of dessert dragons is below average, meaning they are small to dragon size standards which makes them faster than their larger counter-parts, and their special power is sand manipulation to attack enemies. </span></div></div>",

The diffrence between the demonic dragons and the dragons infected with the dark energy that is Akron is that the demonic dragons are not all evil, yeah there are evil dragons, but they look evil thats the point. The breathe power of a demonic dragon is a stream of dark aura and fire, the power of a demonic dragon is a large variation of shadow magic and shapeshifting (But to only some sort of humanoid) so the demonic dragon is like a evolution from a dark dragon but they get more shunned by societies and factions, but the powers are damn cool. </span></div></div>",

Now the ancient soldiers usual armor are either bone armor, rusted metal armor that is glowing yellow, or if they're mage types, they have the grey, yellow, dusty robes with runes. <br>\r\n\"Shut up Ulker, I'm here because I get to dig up holes and find some ancient valuables that I might find and sell them to someone!\" A dwarf responded to Ulker, most of the diggers were dwarfs which they hoped they didn't go to far in this time, most of the guards/soldiers were orcs and some anthro bulls and hippos, heck younever know when something attacks us, and many of the researchers were just elfs and halflings mainly because of their intelligence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours they made it to their destination at night, the Manta ruins were in a secluded valley, hidden by massive cliff faces and overgrow. Everyone disembarked their vehicles, setted up camp, and began excavating/searching the site while fighting some of the random hostile creatures running about and some undead Manta soldiers/spirits whom were tougher than they thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCybil departed from her assigned group and decided to look at some ruins by herself, and when she did, she found something interesting</span></div></div>",

What the heck happened here!?\" Runic questioned himself as he saw the city in ruins and smelled others wandering about, but they smelled diffrent than what he normally used to. By using a mind map readout he could see far beyond his line of sight and saw soldiers in bone and foreign armor with strange weapons he had never seen before and by extending his vision even further he saw others near the city boundaries using technology and giant metal things that he never saw before \"What the- Who in the world are these people and how long was I out?\" He searched the city and saw there were more searching the ruins and several more inside the temple examing the annihilators sealing barrier \"What?! No, not there!\" He immediatley went out of mind map and ran as fast as he could across the ruins towards the temple, but not without scaring a couple guards and scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Scientist's POV (Race and gender unspecified) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just looking at a few weapon artifacts when suddenly a blue figure ran past my view, it scared the living crap out of me since I though the guards killed every hostile around, I guess they missed a few.

Guards!\" <br>\r\n\"What?\" A grumby rough voice replied <br>\r\n\"There are still things in here!\" The scientist said in a scared tone <br>\r\n\"What? Impossible, we had guys check out for lifeforms and then we went out of our way to kill them, are you sure you didn't see a hallucination?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes I'm sure!\" <br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll have guys check on your position\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Cybil <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were mage's trying to figure out how to deactivate the barrier to move it for transport <br>\r\n\"Are you sure that this is a good idea?\" Cybil questioned <br>\r\n\"Yes, even if this thing is hostile we can easily take it out and restrain it, imagine the fame we would get!\" One mage responded as we all waited, guards on standby and other more for restrainment.

The 8 kegs stacked, 4 for each team, had transparent sides do peole could tell who was winning. <br>\r\n10 minutes have passed and neither members on each seems to lit up. According to the barrel levels both teams are into the third keg and Johnny's team seems to be winning, but then Matt and Johnny tapped out and fell to the floor,<br>\r\n\"Ugh....to much damn alcohol overload...I should lay in bed for a week...ugh\"Matt said<br>\r\n\"Right back at ya'..I am not the sharpened and metally reinforced like I thought I was\"Johnny said, and it was up to Lerosin and Draj' to finish the job. After 5 minutes the opposing team seems to make up for lost time and tied with Johnnys team. Both teams were on the last keg and It could be anyones finish and then at that point Draj' fell down from drinking too much,<br>\r\n\"Ah jeez, *coughs a huge amount of fire* great I think I just screwed over my fire-glands, hey Lerosin, make sure you damn win *passes out*\" Draj' said drunkenly<br>\r\nAnd now its the final stretch and Lerosin is double timing it by drinking twice his original speed, and the other two were hurrying but then Lantz just fell down from drunkeness which whatever she is saying is gibberish and slurring. Now Lerosin Vs. Honeydew, two hardened drawfs and drunks who the heck will win, with just a sliver just left in each barrels and...boom! both dwarfs have passed from drunkenness at the same time and the contents of the barrels with the duration, it has been decided that Lerosin won by just a sip. But unfortunately due to over drinking all the members were so drunk that they literally had to be in bed for a week, and then Orioke' walked out of his office,<br>\r\n\"Hey Matt I got...a..new...sword..for..you?\"Orioke' said slowly, \"So what the hell did I miss?\"He joked <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Isn't that right Anders?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes it is Tech\" I shrieked in surprise of the guy coming out of nowhere, Anders was wearing very casual wear, and he had a screen for a head which is creepy.<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did you come from...and what are you?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm...everwhere and this screen head is actually just something you can put on and off\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah just don't give me that bullcrap again\" He then had a troll face on his screen and of course it said \"U mad bro?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of...just turn this on Tech before-\" The portal suddenly came on, the portal was swirling slowly with multiple colored blocks that looked like it'd give you an epilepsy, then Anders kicked me into it, I fell into the blocky abyss yelling \"God fucking dammit Anders!\"<br>\r\n\"You mad bro?\"<br>\r\n\"AH!!!!!!! Fuck you Anders!\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, your mad Viktor, your mad\" I fell at the bottom with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up with a splintering headache, I was laying in my back watching the sky while the wind was blowing on the grassy fields and the sky's blocky sun and clouds an-<br>\r\n\"Wait blocky clouds and sun?\"I Said to myself as I stood up on my feet to take hold of my bearings, I was definetely in the minecraft world with all the tall hills of dirt blocks, trees, ponds, and random animals and caves.<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the view Viktor?\" Questioned Tech behind me, I looked to see him and Anders with those blocky characters with their skins, Tech had the electrical technician gear that is blue, yellow, and golden while Anders had the casual clothes and TV head. I was pretty sure I had a skin which probaly looked like someone from mass effect, goddamn gamers. <br>\r\n\"Tech, are you in the game with me or are you on the computer outside the portal?\"<br>\r\n\"Outside the portal talking through skype\"<br>\r\n\"And why am I here?\"<br>\r\n\"Just to test the gamer portal, it works like a charm\"Anders answered \"And I am also on skype\"<br>\r\n\"So what the heck do you gamers do in this thing?\" I Questioned both of them while a cow was poking me behind the back \"Leave me alone you stupide cow!\"I yelled and I punched it then it ran away quickly \"Oh no you don't!\" I ran after the cow jumping and punching while Tech was giving instructions<br>\r\n\"Okay then, first things first, we need some wood, then stone, and then a house before we get killed by the enemies\" He was done by the time I killed the cow, he dropped some wierd green orbs, I didn't exactly need to pick them up as I kind of absorbed the orbs, I felt like I learned something,<br>\r\n\"Oh yay you just got experiance points, now lets collect some wood and ores\"Said Anders as he pulled out a iron shovel and he dug straight down, I wonder how he got that shovel<br>\r\n\"Okay then Anders, well Viktor, we have used this server for quite a while now and there are alot of people on it right now so just go towards those trees and punch them down\" <br>\r\n\"Alright seems easy enough...wait did you just said punch-?\" Tech was already gone and was building a house on the hillside using stone, \"Okay then\" I walked towards the trees, which there was quite a few there, and I was punching the wood until I got a block and then I was confused why the tree wasn't going down, \"Hey Tech why isn't this tree falling?\" I asked him, I looked over to see he already made a base for the house...which seemed it was going to be a large one<br>\r\n\"That is the logic in video games, you don't question them\" He was saying while he was building<br>\r\n\"So anyway the trees can fall?\"<br>\r\n\"Not unless you have a mod, and we don't have the mod installed\"<br>\r\n\"Then what mod do we have installed?\"<br>\r\n\"The creeps and weirds, mo'creepers, Tekkit pack, Yog Box, Ugocraft, and a whole mess of other mods\"<br>\r\n\"Anything I should be-\" I was saying until a wierd jingle was playing, it sounded like a theifs jingle, before I could react my wood was gone and a theif was running away, \"Hey get the heck back here with my wood!\" I chased after him up a steep dirt hill, when I got to the top there was a weird green thing standing right there with a rather creepy face thing, \"Hey Tech! What are the guys that are green with creepy faces?\"<br>\r\n\"Those are creepers! They explode when they get close, why?\" When he finished that the creeper walked right in front of me and he was hissing,<br>\r\n\"That'sssss a nice character ssssskin you have there, it would be a sssshame if anything happen to it\" He exploded and I was launched backwards hitting the ground hard dying. <br>\r\n\"Oh for fucks sake I died!\" I yelled and I was looking at a loading screen \"What kind of bullcrap is this?\" I spawned back to see that Anders was back with alot of ore and Tech was finished with the house, it looked nice for a stone and blocky house, good cobble roof, glass panes, and dogs, how they did it so fast and where they got the dogs from, I have no clue.<br>\r\n\"Hey Viktor wheres the wood I told you to get?\" Questioned Anders<br>\r\n\"A theif stole it and then I got blown up by a creeper then fell to my death\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah that happens sometimes, and now welcome to my blocky abode\" Tech said and we entered it seeing that the house looked well made with alot of things. <br>\r\n\"Well this place looks cozy, how many floors are there?\" I asked and Tech went to what looks like an alchemy thing but I didn't know crap<br>\r\n\"About 4 floors, 3 up top and one basement, I am planning to add more soon\" And then I saw white things coming down from outside the window<br>\r\n\"Huh looks like it is snowing\" I said<br>\r\n\"Well no shit\" Anders said and he went down to the basement through the trapdoor <br>\r\n\"So Tech anything I should be worried about in minecraft?\" <br>\r\n\"Well with all the mods and players in here I am guessing the only things we should be worried about are griefers, creepers, and Tornadoes\" He said while he was on the furnace<br>\r\n\"Okay then that is reassuring, so are there any players near us?\" I asked<br>\r\n\"There are only a couple people around us so we should be good, now lets go into the bed\" Tech said and he went upstairs <br>\r\n\"Did someone say bed?\" Anders asked \"Don't worry guys I'll be up in just a sec. I am busy doing *ssssss* Oh Fuck no!\" I heard an explosion and there was a message appearing saying Anders was killed by 133769creeper, <br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" I asked myself and I went down stairs to see a wall of Tnt in the way, \"What the hell is this?\" Then I heard something lit, the Tnt was detonated, \"Oh shit\" I ran back upstairs and went to the door, but the minute I went outside I heard a werewolf \"Oh I hate my luck\" I looked around to see where it was and then I looked up to see a werewolf jumping down from the roof, I dodged it and just ran since I didn't have a weapon, while that happened I heard a series of explosions and then I saw Tnt coming up from the ground and from the house that Tech made, and then I got a screen in my face saying \"You have been disconnected\" The next thing I know I was launched from the portal and faceplanted onto the grassland. <br>\r\n\"Damn it, I hate playing video games that I don't know shit about\" <br>\r\n\"Uh Viktor?\" Asked Tech<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Remember when I said the portal was a gate between the gaming world and the real world?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Well..\" Then I heard a howling<br>\r\n\"Oh you have got to be kidding me!\" I yelled and got up instantly, I took out my silver shotgun and took aim at the blood thirsty werewolf<br>\r\n\"Regular bullets don't have much as much affect to werewolves as silver bulltets!\" Anders yelled and he was just standing there <br>\r\n\"Bullets? Who said anything about bullets?\" I then flipped the shotgun, holding it by the barrel and was ready to bludgeon the werewolf son of a bitch back where he came from, when he came close he tried to swing but I dodged and smacked him hard in the chest and sent him flying towards the portal, but it came short, I ran up to the werewolf who is still recovering and I just beated the living crap out of it using my fists and gun, then I lifted the heavy sucker and threw him back into the portal. <br>\r\n\"Damn Viktor, just damn\" Anders said with the happy smile face on his screen<br>\r\n\"Hey I don't enjoy playing video games, but I enjoy beating them, now Tech the next time you try that portal bullshit on me again, make sure it is on something with a little more action\" <br>\r\n\"Like Modern warfare or call of duty?\" <br>\r\n\"Tech......you might want to run and I am giving you a 3 second head start\"<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\"<br>\r\n\"1\" Tech started to recalibrate the portal<br>\r\n\"2\" Tech finished recalibrating the portal and was preparing to jump into it <br>\r\n\"3!\" Tech jumped inside the portal, \"Now where the hell did that guy run to?\" I looked at the screen and saw that he setted the place into Battlefield 3 \"Ah Tech you always know what I needed, but quit trolling me with bullcrap like that, hey Anders, mind looking out for us from the outside?\" <br>\r\n\"No problem\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then\" I jumped into the portal into Battlefield 3 which will be a blast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is just a background check if anyone is confused about this story in anyway which is highly possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy there are guns and magic: <br>\r\nWell in terms of use, people who use guns are those who don't have any affinity for or with magic and those who use magic are not usually interested in guns, but there has been combinations of guns with magic creating powerful weapons. Now there isn't that much of a diffrence between magic and guns for several reasons. Both can use up their own mana or ammuntion and have to avoid using them until their mana restores/find ammo on the attacker, magic has lighting, fire, ice, poison and all that stuff, guns have incendiary rounds, electical ammunition, (What? It is a fantasy and anything can happen) explosive ammunition, armour piercing, and other things, both have various types of their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragons and aircraft:<br>\r\nDragons and aircraft, why should both exist? Well there is a very simple answer for that. Those who choose to be in the skies in aircraft are those who think the dragon they are riding will eat them, drop them, or turn them into a burnt, frozen, melted, etc corpse, plus they have the longer range, diverse weaponry, and the aircraft is very replaceable (That is until they run out of ammo). Those who ride dragons are people who want to be one with flow and have a bond with the creature they are flying, plus those people have alot more trust and guts. Dragon riders are very strong and hard to beat with the ability of the dragons immense strength, breathe, and maybe magic, but there is several backdrops, dragons are more harder to replace, there is the bond between the rider and dragon, (Which if one receives damage the other will feel it too, or was it the rider receives damage and the dragon feels it? Eh, I forget, but whatever your knowledge is) and when the aircraft takes up fuel (Or in some cases an alternate source of energy) the dragon takes up alot of things and needs all kinds of responsibility if you know what I mean...and no erotic bc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe many, many, diverse weapons. <br>\r\nWhy the hell are there guys that are specifically on guns, energy weapons, and other long range weapons, but the others have only melee? Well that is just the way of their location. Now based on the location, heritage, origins, and own agenda's, the way of their weapons are changed. Like in area's where it is more modern, there are guns and few melee. Area's like in mountains is where people usually make blades and blunt. Area's where it is either a desert, ruined city, or detroit, people salvege anything they can to make weapons. Places where it is mass genocide, graveyard, and the land of dead, people have bone weapons. I think I proven my point, but there are advantages in the weapon and area. Guns, energy weapons, Etc. Need ammunition to be of use and when they are out of ammo they have to resort to the melee which isn't effective at times unless they practice in situations like those, those who use melee have practiced and adapted to be be quick, fast, effective, and probaly have the ability to reflect/block bullets and lasers. People who have scavenged have the imagination to combine weapons to make awesome weapons or even household items into badass weapons. This also includes the armor and technology. Plus it is not fun with COD guns all over the damn place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck is with the races?<br>\r\nAll the humanoid races, anthro races, and even the spirit races? Well it wouldn't be interesting with all the same race, now wouldn't it? And the spirits? Well I watch too much skyrim and a butt ton of syfy things relating to ghosts and the paranormal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...what made the factions so far apart:<br>\r\nWar...war never changes which screwed the living crap of the world and now it is all segregated. While some are good, bad and neutral, it sometimes works out between some factions who combined their works from similiar agenda's and weaponry. There is still the fact of the many battles of entire races between races and faction vs faction that tore the earth a new one and a half. Examples such as the dragon anthros and dragons thought they were superior than their counter parts, (Which there was alot of them, but not the whole race) those who are hungry for power take over smaller factions, but then get crushed by even bigger ones, and sometimse the giant rivalry's between legendary factions such as the boomers vs the Firebugs which they turn everything ino dust. Otherwise it turns into fallout which actually happened in this story's history, speaking of which what time did I set this story? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow well the races treat each other<br>\r\nIn some places it is all neutral ground, in some places they don't accept certain races based on history, in some places they welcome freedom to all, and in some places it is SHOOT THESE FUCKING GUYS BEFORE I GIVE A DAMN AND SHOOT THEM WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER!@#$#T@^&amp; RAGE <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many factions are there, exactly? <br>\r\nWell, since I based it off of fallouts own faction process where apparently, every military, city, village, gang, family, and children club counts as a faction of some sort, there is more factions than the amount of bs people can say on the internet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs the story only based on earth?<br>\r\nNo actually, there are factions that traverse through realms, factions that are in space, and there is a 99.69% chance that there may be an alien faction, but there is a low chance of that happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is with the massive gaps of technology between certain factions?<br>\r\nremember, there was an actual fallout and it took a long time to get out of (Yes it happened on 2012...now stfu about it being the end of the world, it will not happen unless a drunk person in a nuclear war head silo presses the \"Nuke the whole world Trololololololol\" button, then the world will end\") Still, remember there are people and cultures in our time that are still in the 3rd world and old ways, and this is what it is. The primitive, modern, advanced, and other things, but they still have their advantages and weaknesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this random typing is probably over, but I may edit it. MAYBE <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: I forgot to mention a couple things. <br>\r\nMedical and healing magic <br>\r\nThere is the modern medicine (Or in some cases known as alchemy) and healing magic and both have their own uses. While the healing magic quickly heals the one afflicted with wounds and such, it only goes so far. Only those with enough experiance can properly treat people who have broken bones and more dreadful injuries. While modern medicine (Or alchemy in some places) slowly heals the one afflicted it has more varied uses in preventing illnesses, curing them, and have a more varied board on what they can do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirits...uh if there are spirits shouldn't they be everywhere?<br>\r\nThere are rules everywhere, especially the spirits. The area of where the person originally died is where that person is trapped in unless the armor, weapon, or objects of any importance is moved somewhere then they move with them. For a spirit to move freely amongst the world they must be in a construct, a artificial body for them to move and live in. Spirits could also be ensnared in certain objects for their essence or for their help in later uses. Of course ther reason that spirits aren't everywhere scaring the living crap out of everywhere is that you cannot see them (Unless you have a good enough magical sense), but they still have the paranormal interference and crap, they might have already been put to rest, and for a spirit to show themselves they must either have a very powerful will or they are forced against their will by someone sadistic or evil. Speaking of which the spirit can be affected by both magical and physical attacks, but they just have a high physical resistence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNames<br>\r\nThe reason that some peoples name are so unique and random is because I want to add some diversity and uniqueness...now it wouldn't be interesting to have names that are normal right? Seriously you can put in random names ro normal names...it wouldn't exactly matter in some places. </span></div></div>",

This is basically saying these people are veteran fighters. <br>\r\nKnown areas: Like I said, they can and could be anywhere <br>\r\nComplication: The only complication is, if you are trying to enter someplace with a guardian standing right there, then you better be good at fighting or at least have 10 guys with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanshee<br>\r\nSpecialty: Sound <br>\r\nSignificance: The banshee's are specialist's at sound attacks, meaning you will go deaf or get blasted away by the sounwaves. <br>\r\nKnown area: Usually at a place with the words scream, sound, and banshee in it. <br>\r\nComplication: Wear some good earplugs or being deaf would work against these Banshee's, although the repercussions is another matter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDovahkiin (What? You didn't see this coming?) <br>\r\nSpecialty: The voice<br>\r\nSignificance: With the blood of a dragon, these people have the ability of those of the dragon, the voice. FUS RO DAH! And now with the extra info. There are actually people in here who do not have the voice, but have the alternative Dovah cannons which is a large weapon that can have similar firepower to the voice. <br>\r\nKnown area: Either in random places or somewhere near dragons <br>\r\nComplication: Would a ballgag block the voice? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thats the end of this chapter, for now probably*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Claw<br>\r\nSpecialty: Manipulation <br>\r\nSignificance: Has been terrorizing cities since fallout. The Red Claw has a enormous army that are well-trained and undyingly loyal due to the parasite that are injected into them...so basically mindless slaves that's only existence is to fight <br>\r\nKnown places: The red desert, red canyons, and red bunkers...NOTICE THE RED<br>\r\nComplication: Remember that they are mindless fighters, so even if you place a mine right in front of them they will walk on it like idiots...although they might still be alive.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">It is the year 2104 on earth, there is magic, technology, mystical creatures, and anthros and it is seperated into factions that believe in their own technologies and abilities. There is a dark being called Akron who originally started his invasion of earth thousands of years ago and now he is stronger and has a more powerful army. You are either a part of Akrons forces or a member of a faction on earth which raises the question, who's side are you on?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n1. You can curse but don't over do it <br>\r\n2. Just as long as you don't over-do it, blood and gore accepted <br>\r\n3. When making characters or factions, be descriptive and adding some sort of background is optional <br>\r\n4. Weird fetish or sex not allowed visually, them making the sounds on the other hand is more acceptable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT* If you still don't understand the faction setting's, it is similiar to Fallout's faction's, as in Gang's, military, and even location's with populace count as faction's, rather odd but hey I based the faction system off of Fallout (And sometimes it can get confusing, and some factions have cities under their mark) <br>\r\nEdit 11/1/12: EXACTLY 2000 views, yippe get out the margaritas!@<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add chapters  <br>\r\n </td>",
