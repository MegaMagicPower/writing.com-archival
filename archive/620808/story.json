Around his neck was a golden Millenuem item, with a clock in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Yugi...I've come a long way to see you,\" said the sranger, showing he had a duel disk strapped to his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger's hood lifted enough for Yugi to barely make out the stranger's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not tell you much, but my name is Alex,\" said the stranger. \"I wish to duel with you to see if you truely are Yugi. This duel will be by Battle City Rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi merged minds with Yami Yugi, and turned into the taller pharoh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I accept your duel,\" said Yami Yugi, as the stranger gave him a dueling disk. \"I'll start by playing Beta the Magnet Warrior (1700/1600) in attack mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi's rock creature appeared from the disk, ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...nice try.

I never even heard of that monster!\" thought Yami Yugi in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fierce-looking catmorph knight, drabbed in armor and holding a huge sword, appeared from the disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat Knight! Attack with your Chivalry Blade!\" shouted Alex, before Cat Knight charged and slashed Yugi's Beta, dropping his LPs to 3800. \"I'll end my turn by laying one card face down,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami Yugi looked at his hand, knowing he had nothing there that could defeat the Cat Knight, but he had something that could defend against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lay one monster face down and end my turn!\" shouted Yami Yugi. \"My Giant Soldier of Stone (1300/2000), which I put down, has a defense of 2000, while that Cat Knight of his only has an attack of 1900,\" thought Yami Yugi with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex drew his next card, and said, \"I play my Golem Dragon (1500/1900) in attack mode,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another mysterious monster!

Next on my list is that annoying boy and his puzzle.} Bakura then glared straight ahead as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{I think two is plenty,} Ryou said. {Especially since you can't use one of them. {And--}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Shh!} Bakura said suddenly holding one finger up to Ryou.

Then, finally, once Yugi spotted the men in cloaks did he switch his attention to the feeling of the other item. He was almost ecstatic by this point.

This must be that fool's deck that I stole the clothes from... All well, can't do anything about it now. besides I see a pretty good strategy right here.\" thinks Yami Bakura with an evil sneer. \"I summon Mad Sword beast (1400/1200) in attack mode and play one card face down.

The beast attacks and destroys Newdoria. \"And thank to it's special effect, the differece between my monster's attack and your monster's defense are deducted from your life points.\" says Yami Bakura as Yami Meriks LP depletes to 3400. \"Yes, but my moster's effect kick in now. When my moster is sent to the grave as a result of battle, I can select one moster on the field and destroy it, and since your Mad Sword beast is the only one, I choose it.\" says Yami Merik smugly. With that the Mad Sword Beast is gone. \"Now, I play Twin-Headed Wolf (1500/1000) in attack mode. Attack my Twin-Headed Wolf!\" orders Yami Merik. It attacks and Yami Bakura's LPs fall to 2500. \"Then I'll play one card face down and end my turn.\" says Yami Merik. \"Alright then, I play Giant Rat (1400/1450) in Attack mode, then I play my face down magic card Shield &amp; Sword. Which switches our monster's attack and defense points. Now my Giant Rat, attack!\" The Giant Rat attacks and destroys the Twin-Headed Wolf, dropping Yami Meriks LPs to 2950. \"But that's not all Merik. I activate the magic card Reasoning. Here is how it works. You call a card level I pick up (not draw) cards from the top of my deck until I've picked up a monster. If the monster is the correct level, then I discard it and all the others to my grave. But if it isn't, then I get to summon the monster to the field while the others still go to the grave.\" explains Yami Bakura. \"Fine. I pick level 5.\" responds Yami Merik with a distasteful look that showed he was quite irritated. \"Ah, a little getting a little irritated I see...\" says Yami Bakura with a smirk as he picks up 8 cards all together to fide a monster. He looked at it and smiled evilly. \"Well this will irritate you even more.\" he says as he dramatically reviels Judge Man (level 6) (2200/1500). Merik growls as the Judge Man takes the field. \"Now Judge Man Attack Merik directly!\" orders Yami Bakura with authority. Judge Man does and Yami Merik LPs drop to 750. \"Ha ha ha! It's over Merik. You've already lost. You might as well just hand over your Millenium Rod and your god card now and if you do I'll spare your soul.\" offers Yami Bakura as he laughs at Yami Merik. \"Are you finished? I'd like to get back to my plans some time today.\" says Yami Merik withouy fear. \"You ignorant... fine I'll lay one card face down and end my turn.\" says Yami Bakura irritated at Yami Merik's lack of fear. \"And it will be your last. Now first I play The Fiend Megacyber. As you know, his effect allows me to summon him to the field when you have two or more monsters that me. Then I'll use him to destroy that pathetic rat of yours. Now Attack!\" The Fiend Megacyber attacks and destroys Yami Bakura's Giant Rat and drops his points to 1700. \"Yes, but my rats special ability allows me to summon another earth type monster with 1500 or less to the field in attack position and I choose Wandering Mummy.\" says Yami Bakura summoning Wandering Mummy in attack position and smirks thinking he's outsmarted Yami Merik. \"Go ahead, he can't help you know. Ha ha ha! Next I play the magic card Monster reborn and bring back my Twin-Headed Wolf. Then I play the Magic Card Dian Keto The Cure Master and gain 1000 Life Points (1750). The I'll sacrifice 800 life points to play the Magic Card Premature Burial and bring back my Newdoria. And now to end this battle!...\" announces Yami Merik. Yami Bakura realizes what Yami Meril is going to do and says, \"wait one second Merik. You can't summon a monster and tribute in the same turn.\" \"That's true and that's why I'm going to use my Trap Card, Pyro Clock Of Destiny to move the turn count by 1 full turn.

He remeber's his face down card and something else. \"I may not be winning this Duel Merick, but I sure as heck am not losing either! You've activated my Trap Card...\" Yami Bakura starts to say before being interupted by Yami Merik. \"Ha! traps don't work on the gods you fool!\" says Merik confidently. \"Maybe not on the gods, but on you they do! I activate Attack and Receive which takes 700 Life Points and 300 for every one in my grave and thanks to my Reasoning card earlier I just happen to have one there. That means you lose 1000 life points and since your life points are only 950, we've got our selves a draw, so it looks like we're back to stage one.\" says Bakura not happy with the ending, but did take some comfort in the fact he wasn't going to lose his soul since the shadows only take losers and not people who stalemate. But now what? They were back at stage one. \"Maybe not.\" says Yami Merik in a more friendly voice. \"You managed to nearly defeat me using unfamiliar cards. I know this because I notice the way you acted when you saw the cards in your hand and saw the rare hunter robe you're wearing and figured you must taken it from one of them and grabbed their cards instead of your own. No one among my rare hunters can say they dueled against someone using unfamiliar cards and had it end like this, especially not one whose faced me.\" says Yami Merik more friendly than ever. \"So thats why you seemed so confident.\" says Yami Bakura a little impressed Yami Merik could tell all that from a simple facial expression. \"Think about this, your after the Millenium Items, while I'm after the God cards. What do you say we form a partnership of sorts. If you help me win the other two God cards from Yugi and Seto, then I'll give you my Millenium Rod and not only that, but if you get paired against Yugi, it will give you the opportunity to obtain his Millenium Puzzle, but even if you don't get paired against him and I do and defeat Yugi you will still obtain the Puzzle as long as you defeat Seto. So what do you say? Is the enemy of my enemy my friend. If not, just walk out that door and no one will stop you. Unless you want to try it me again.\" says Yami Merik seriously. Yami Bakura wasn't about to fight Yami Merik until he could figure out a way to defeat him, but Yami Merik's offer did sound good. He thought to himself,\"Should I take his offer? It would make thing a bit easier...\" Just then Ryou Bakura spoke after awakening in the middle of the shadow duel and argued, \"No, it might be a trick. What if he tries something? I'm not into you stealing these Millenium Items, but I don't feel right about him. I think we should remain alone at this. If you walk out that door I'll... I'll help you, even though I don't really want to.\" offers Ryou Bakura saddly. Yami Bakura thought to himself, \"Hmm it would make it easier for me if this brat is willing and he might be right. What if he does try something?\" Yami Bakura wasn't sure what to do. Finally he decides to...</span></div></div>",

Ha ha ha ha ha!\" orders Merik with an evil laugh. Yami Bakura thought about his next move. He see's the Kuriboh in his hand and a few other cards. He grins as he begins his move. \"I sacrifice my Kuriboh to reduse the battle damage I'd receive from your Wiged Dragon to 0.\" says Yami Bakura with a smirk of condidence. \"So you stopped my attack this turn. Your only delaying the inevitable. Go ahead take you last pathetic turn.\" says Yami Merik still full of himself. Yami Bakura draws his card. \"Bingo!\" thinks Yami Bakura to himself. \"First I play the Magic Card Pot Of Greed and drw two cards.\" he says drawing two cards. \"Now I play the Ritual Card Black Luster Ritual and sacrifice The Rock Spirit and Battle Ox from my hand and summon... The Black Luster Soldier (3000/2500). <br>\r\n\"Ha! Incase you haven't noticed my monster is still more powerful.\" says Yami Merik with a laugh. \"You did't let me finish.\" says Yami Bakura with an evil grin. That put a potatoe in Yami Merik's tale pipe.<br>\r\n\"Then I play the Magic Card Gift of the Martyr. All I have to do is send my a monster such as Judge Man to the graveyard and select one monster on the field such as Black Luster Soldier and I can increase the attack of the selected monster by the attack of the monster I sent to the grave until the end phase of the turn the card is activated.\" explains Bukura with the most wicked of grins. Once the process is complete the Black Luster Soldier is now at an amazing 5200 attack points. \"Ha! Even if he manages to defeat Ra I'll mearly bring him back in his Phoenix form next turn.\" thinks Yami Merik deviously. \"Don't think I've forgotten about your life points. You see, I still have one card in my hand and this card is the end of the duel! Now I equipt my Black Luster Soldier with the Lightning Blade to increase his attack by 800 more point for a grand total of 6000.\" says Yami Bakura with an evil look in his eye. \"Now my Black Luster Soldier, send his beast to the grave and his pathetic soul to Shadows! Muha ha ha ha ha ha!\" orders Yami Bakura with a maniacal laugh which made Yami Merik's seem like a child's. Black Luster Soldier attack and gives Yami Marik and his beast a taste of all 6000 points. When the Black Luster Soldier hit The Winged Dragon, Ra exploded in flames. \"No! This... can't... be. Oh well, the real Marek will go to the shadows and I'll be free to...\" before Yami Merik could finish, Yami Bakura spoke up, \"Oh no. Your the one who wanted to duel me and that means your the one going to the Shadows!\" as he spoke, Yami Bakura placed a hand on each side of his Millenium Ring and closed his eyes. At the word going he opens his eyes which are totally white and the cone shaped pointers of the ring pointed at Yami Merik and the beams combine into one and like a bullet it goes straight threw Mareks head leaving the body unharmed, but pushing Yami Marek out. Yami Marek is then consumed by the shadows as Yami Bakura laughs wickedly. The real Merik and his body fall to the ground unconscious. Yami Bakura mearly walks over Pick up the Millenium Rod and the Winged Dragon Of Ra. \"I can use this agaist the Pharaoh and his friends. Ha and to think I used some random guys deck.\" thinks Yami Bakura to himself smugly. He put the card in the deck. Suddenly a young woman enters the room. She was quite beautiful and was dressed like an egyptian in white and gold. She had black hair and sapphire blue eyes. Yami Bakura guessed she was about 20 years old, but he was more interested in the Necklace she was wearing. \"Who are you?\" asked Yami Bakura in a demanding way. \"I am Ishizu Ishtar, Merik's older sister.\" she said as she went over to her brother, nelt down, and touched his forehead. Her necklace glowed for a moment, then faded. \"The sprit who had been pocessing my brother is gone. You have done my family a great sevice. Thank you.\" she says very greatfully as she stood and bowed her head respectfully. She was almost in tears. \"Ha, I was just came here for the Millenium Rod and he stood in my way, so I got rid of him.\" said Yami Bakura coldly. \"Either way, thank you.\" she says bowing her head again. \"If you really want to thank me, then hand over you Millenium Necklace.\" says Yami Bakura in an almost threatening manner. \"If that is your desire, you may have it. It no longer works for me and I was to give this to the Pharaoh, but my brother is more important to me than this Necklace. Here take it as a token of my appreciation.\" says Ishizu taking off the necklace and handing it to Yami Bakura. Yami Bakura takes off the robes and puts the Millenium necklace into his pocket while placing the Millenium Rod into his belt. Suddenly a tall man with a black ponytail, emerald green eyes, and a strange tattoo on his face busts into the room. \"Master Merik!\" the mans yells out after seeing his Master on the ground out cold. \"It's alright Odion. He's just drained.\" says Ishizu. \"Ishizu did you beat Master Merik?\" asks Odion. Ishizu shook her head and said, \"No Odion, it was our friend here.\" she said gesturing toward Yami Bakura. \"You must be a powerful duelist if you defeated Master Marik. You have my thanks also.\" says Odion bowing to him. Then as he was leaving, he saw Ishizu take off Meriks robe and flipped him gently onto his back. It was only a quick glimps, but Yami Bakura has a photographic memory and saw the Ancient script on Merik's back. \"So thats what these god cards are used for. Well this just got more interesting.\" thinks Yami Bakura. \"What did it say?\" asks Ryou Bakura having woken in the middle of Yami Bakura's duel. Yami Bakura didn't bother answering him and mearly smirked evilly as he left. \"Here I come Pharaoh ready or not.\" thinks Yami Bakura to himself with an Evil smirk. \"What should I do now? I guess I should probebly go to Battle City and participate in that Tournament Seto Kaiba is holding.\" Yami Bakura thinks to himself. That's exactly what he does. A few days later the tournament goes off (and since since Merik isn't a threat, the rare hunter's never take Joey's Red Eyes) with out a hitch. Yami Bakura mostly goes against weakling as regular Bakura. (At the end it's the same line up exept Merik, Ishizu, and Odion enter as themselves so they can face the Pharaoh and test his power. Of course this time the line up of who faces who is different) It turns out that the matches are as follows: Seto Vs. Ishizu winner=Seto, Yugi Vs. Merik winner=Yugi (he learn about god cards and their connection here and hears Bakura the new threat),Joey Vs. Odion winner= Joey (somehow), and finally Mai Valentine Vs. Bakura...</span></div></div>",
