But Claire couldn't do anything more than taking a sunbath at the beach, thought that she tried to help the camp by her way. Being pregnant didn't mean she was useless, and she intented to prove it. But today, there were nothing she could really do.  So she took a nap at the beach, when something's strange happenned : she felt like a presence all around her. It was not her companions, it was something different, she couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the meantime, a man being too curious about the \"giant visitors\" coming from the sky was walking around a giant blonde and pregnant woman. His friends warned him to not approach any giant, but it was useless. And now he looked at a giant beautiful woman sleeping on the sand, wondering what to do.</span></div></div>",
