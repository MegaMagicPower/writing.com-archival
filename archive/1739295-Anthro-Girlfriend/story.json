A voice comes over the shops speaker store closing in 3 minutes which makes you go into a full sprint and you aren't being very careful. In a mad dash around a corner you run straight into a girl unfortunately for you you go flying into a shelf knocking over tim cans and nearly being knocked out as you hit your head on a metal part of the shelf.

You then see a shopping basket sitting in the empty isle and think it must be hers and there's only a minute left until the store closes which you decide would be a good idea to pay for her shopping as an apology.

Then you set the bag of food that held all her food and a coke and sandwich for you. Just taking a small break you start to decide what you should do with her, it would be a bad idea to leave her to find help even though it was a good neighborhood. You decide to wait for her to wake up before you did anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bench you pull out your coke and sandwich. Opening the coke you look up at the stars and take a big sip, and then you remove the sandwich from its case. It was a tuna fish sandwich; you look over at the girl sitting next to you and wonder how hard you hit her for her to still be out cold. No sooner had you thought that you see her start to stir. You bite into the sandwich and watch her slowly wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her eyes and starts to rub the back of her head, as she touches her head she says \u201c owww\u201d. Then she looked up and saw me looking at her eating my sandwich and remembers that she needed to buy food tonight. With this thought she got up and started to run to the shop, only to notice the shutter was already down and she was without food. Seeing this I grabbed the bag and walked up to her. She looked sad and hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI called out from behind her and told her that there was no need to worry because I got her food right here gesturing to the bag. She turned around to look at me and asked why I bought her food? I replied with\u201d well I knocked you down by accident which knocked both of us out, when I came to you were still out cold so to make it up to you I bought your food for you.\u201d She looked at me skeptically like I had ulterior motives. But decided that I meant her no harm and was sincere in my apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed a little and walked over to me. As she walked I noticed how beautiful she looked with the moon light shining on her face I then noticed a slight move in her pants by the back of her leg I assumed it was her tail seeing as she was a catgirl.  I handed her the bag and she looked in and smiled. It was a little cold outside a gust of cold air blew making us both shiver a little. She thanked me as started to head out in the direction of the bus stop. I called out to her and asked if she would like a ride? Gesturing to my car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and looked at me, she looked to my car then to the bus stop and decided that you car might be a better option then riding the bus to hide her \u201cdifferences\u201d and accepted walking back to you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I tried not to pry and to let her offer up information on her own, but I was consumed with curiosity. She was the most fascinating girl I'd ever met.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My name is Analisse,\" she blurted when we finally parked. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's been nice meeting you, Analisse.

Although, our time knowing each other had been short, my mind was already engulfed in thoughts of her. As I drove away I began thinking of what we could do on Friday. It was only three days away and I had to make this outing perfect; I had to know more about her, but where would I take her?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You keep thinking about your blue painted house and thinking your mums gone mad. After a few minutes of introducing everyone your parents seemed to like Kira though they seemed to think the cat features was a practical joke. They were talking about how you met here and she started telling them about how you were shopping and ran into her at closing time... They found it funny but didn't seem to believe it. Then they started talking about family and decided that they should meet her parents. Kira says that she will find out when her parents can meet them and you say goodbye and leave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl seemed to be you're age, yet for all intensive purposes she was a squirrel, a squirrel who had a large chest pressing against a pink baby t and a pair of shorts but still a squirrel. She had a large bushy brown tail coming out of the back of her pants and it went up to her hair, the exact reverse of her brown hair which flowed down her back. Her whole body was covered in brown fur and instead of hands and feet she had 2 pairs of cute paws. You bent over and examined her face, it was very squirlish with a cute little nose in the middle, a small mouth that you knew could open quite large and big eyes. You picked up the items that were knocked out of her carrier; walnuts, peanuts, almonds. You stopped and laughed to yourself, \"heh girls love nuts\" before going back to you're work. The girl actually stirs once you were about halfway done and she stares at you picking them up and she dives forward \"leave those alone, do you know how hard it is to hold onto so many nuts\" she says. You lost it, you fell over laughing till there were tears streaming down you're face, you composed yourself after a few seconds and said \"relax I bumped into you and i'm trying to help you collect you're things.\" She nods and you soon have all the nuts back in the carrier you follow her up to the front and she puts her things down and before she can do anything you mix you're things with hers and then reach over and swipe your card paying for the lot before she can react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that?\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran into you hard enough to knock you out, it's the least I could do\" you reply picking out you're things. You start walking and you feel something grab you, you turn and it's the squirrel girl, \"I, never got to thank you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to\" you say but reaching you're hand out you say \"i'm Alex.\" She shakes you're hand, \"i'm Tammy, Tammy squirrel\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whatcha need all the nuts for?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to eat them obviously, I mean you can't sleep outside without some sort of protection\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, well you see, i'm homeless, I would have bought those through foodstamps if you hadn't paid\" she says. She turns to walk away and you grab her, \"come on\" you say pulling her behind you. Thankfully she doesn't protest and just silently follows you, you head home, thankfully you're job as a tech intern paid quite well so you could afford a small house. You unlock the door and Tammy thankfully follows you inside. She looks around oohing and aahing at stuff before jumping on the couch and bouncing up and down \"wheee\" she says as her small frame flies into the air. She composes herself and looks at you, \"why'd you bring me here\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're living with me from now on\" you say walking into the kitchen with her following and you put you're groceries away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she says looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you said you're homeless, well now you have a home\" you say. Tammy tries to talk for a few seconds but can't eventually she just walks up and hugs you \"thank you so much\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I mean what kind of guy sees a girl in trouble and just leaves her\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you also didn't make fun of me, because i'm a squirrel\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I, I think you look quite cute actually\" you say. Tammy blushes and lets go, \"shoo go watch tv or something and i'll make us some food\" you say. She reluctantly nods and you hear you're tv turn on. You wren't much of a cook so you basically just made mac and cheese but when you served it on you're small table Tammy dug right in, she quickly finished her plate and asked for seconds which you gave her. You smiled as she ate, she usually filled her cheeks and looking for somewhere to hide the food but you kept assuring her she didn't need to hide it as no one was gonna steal it. Finally the meal was done and she laid back content \"I haven't eaten like that in a while\" she sighs, you nod \"how long have you been, you know homeless?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since my mother died when I was little\" Tammy says. You're heart aches as she says this, you stand up, walk over and hug her, \"Tammy you can stay here as long as you want, my house is you're house\" you say. Tammy turns to you and much to you're suprise she starts sniffling then full on crying and she buries her head into you're shoulder \"thank you\" she sniffles. Not knowing what else to do you gently stroke her back and you hold her tight, after a minute she stops and stares at you \"why are you being so nice to me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're just way too cute to leave alone, that and you're part squirrel, I well really like squirrels\" you say. Tammy smiles and stands up \"umm do you have somewhere I could take a shower?\" she asks. You nod and lead her to the bathroom, \"towels are right on the door\" you say. Tammy nods and shuts the bathroom door, and as soon as you heard the shower start you had to go and watch some tv to restrain yourself. You watched a show about squirrels on the nature channel and you were actually quite suprised as Tammy took a shower that lasted a whole half an hour. You heard the bathroom door open and her pad across the floor, \"whatcha watching\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a nature show\" you say freezing as you turn around. Tammy was standing there in nothing but a blue towel and you could somewhat see her chest the thing absorbed so much water. You pried yourself away and said, \"why aren't you wearing any clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My other ones got wet when I took my shower\" she says making you wonder what she did in there. You quickly run to you're room and grab some shirts and pants putting them down on the couch you say \"i'll be back in a second.\" You grab you're wallet and run out to the nearest clothing store, ignoring the looks you knew you were gonna get you bought a package of panties, ran back home and gave them along with the clothes to Tammy. \"You stay here and get changed, i'll go wash you're clothes\" you say. You went into the bathroom and found it a wreck, there was water sprayed everywhere, thankfully you easily found her clothes in a heap and you just threw them into the washing machine. You find Tammy sitting on the couch wearing one of you're white t-shirts and a pair of sweats, although you could see she kept figetting. You laughed and she stared at you, \"it's not funny, my tail's all bunched up\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab some scissor and cut tail holes into each of the 5 sets of pants, \"these are yours now\" you say handing them to her with the shirts. Tammy pushes her tail through the hole and sighs as it comes out, she turns to you with a huge grin on her face. \"Oooh you're such a nice guy\" she says hugging you. You gently hugged her back although it was weird as she wasn't wearing a bra. You put aside a little corner in you're room for her clothes and you stayed up together watching tv. Finally around 10:00 she yawned and you smiled, running into you're room you grabbed an old birthday present you're grandmother gave you after you changed into you're pajamas. For some reason on you're 16th birthday you're grandmother thought you were a girl so she gave you a pair of womens pajamas complete with it's own set of lace underwear, needless to say you'd never live down the embarassment of returning them so you just hid them away. You grab them and run back out handing them to Tammy and she started to undress right in front of you. You ran out of the room and came back and found her wearing them thankfully underwear and all as you couldn't see it, you put the clothes she wore with the others and she followed you into the bedroom. She laid down in bed and you shut off the lights and went to leave the room. \"Where are you going?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna sleep on the couch, you don't let a stranger sleep with you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're not a stranger, you're my knight in shining armor\" Tammy says. You smiled at the imagery and she pressed on \"please\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you reply. You laid down in bed as far away from her as you could and you turned away from her. Tammy in respones moved closer and wrapped herself around you're back, sighing you turn over and wrap you're arms around her. You're suprised for a second as she kisses you on the lips and giggles, \"that's a little thank you\" she says before burying her head into you're shoulder and falling asleep. You hugged her once before falling asleep yourself.</span></div></div>",

You slowly open you're eyes to see brown fur surrounding you, you slowly move backwards and look up, Tammy had somehow unbuttoned her pajama top in the night and invariably hugged you to her. You quickly buttoned the shirt back up praying that she woulnd't wake up and you breathed a sigh of relief as you hooked the last button. As soon as you did however Tammy started to squirm and she grabbed you pulling you close, \"hehe i've got you acorn\" she mutters in her sleep. By now you were totally trapped, you knew you weren't getting out without waking her so you did the one thing you could think of. You reached over and started to tickle her, she started giggling and she slowly opened her eyes, she looked around quickly obviously disoriented but once she saw you're face she settled right down. She smiled at you and said \"hello acorn, do you like touching a girl's clothes\" you looked at her shocked and she giggles. \"Of course I was up, i've been up for 10 minutes waiting for you\" she continues. \"I...uh need to go make some breakfast\" you say flaring red, Tammy hugs you \"don't worry I don't mind, you saved me after all and all i've got to repay you with is this\" she says indicating her body. You shake you're head and kiss her lightly on the cheek and then the lips \"you're company is all I need\" you say and this time Tammy flares red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets you go and you stand up \"bacon ok with you?\" you ask and she nods. You pad through you''re house, thankfully you didn't have classes till 10 and it was only 8. You grabbed some clothes, had a quick shower and got dressed before heading into the kitchen. It only took you 5 minutes to make the bacon and you put it on a plate and carried it back to Tammy, as you expected you found her curled up in you're bed surrounded in her tail. You tap her shoulder and she raises her head and hungrily eyes the bacon, she wolfs it down and then looks at you, \"why are you dressed?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i've got university today, so i'm going to need you to watch the house while i'm gone\" you say. Tammy nods and sighs, \"what's wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're leaving me\" she complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a few hours\" you reply. Tammy nods but still stares at you, \"you better come back\" she says hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy I live here of course i'm coming back, besides you're here now and nothing will keep me away\" you say. Tammy snuggles against you before standing up, stretching, and yawning. She goes into the bathroom and you heard the shower turn on. You lounge around for another few minutes before heading out to the university so you'd have some time to think. As you walked along you think \"well i've easily got the money to support us both, man I was not expecting this when I went shopping.\" The university campus wasn't much to speak of, there was only around 200 students which was really small as it was a specialized school. You headed to you're first class with gusto and by lunch you're one friend at the school John Thompson noticed. He ran up and slapped you across the back, \"hey man what's happening?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, ran into a girl at the grocery store\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind ex that kind of thing?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean I actually ran into her\" you reply, John spends the next 5 minutes laughing at you before he stops. \"So then what?\" he asks. \"I paid for her stuff and that's it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can I come over and hang\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a good idea\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, 2 bachelors on their own atleast we'll be able to drink our women troubles away\" John says. Before you could answer he was running in the opposite direction \"see you at the end of class\" he yelled. You sighed \"how the hell did that just happen\" you think. You were anxious the whole next 2 classes but you were able to keep it from showing. You ran to the university's gates and found John waiting there. He meets you at the gate and you both head to you're house. You are greeted by the sound of the shower as you enter, you freeze knowing Tammy already took one, you head into the kitchen and find a large amount of seeds scattered everywhere. John walks up behind you and you freeze as you hear Tammy's voice say \"oh you're home\" and John turns to you. You see the bathroom door open and you tackle him, \"what the hell\" he yells and freezes as he sees Tammy and you jump in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" John asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, i'd like you to meet my new housemate Tammy\" you say and you freeze as you felt Tammy hug you're back and somewhat hide behind you. She sticks her head out from behind you and says \"hello.\" You turn to her, \"Tammy i'd like you to meet my best friend John, and John if you're staring i'll kill you\" you say. John looks away and starts whistling, \"Tammy did you do this?\" you ask looking at the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanted to suprise you, but the bag wouldn't open and...\" Tammy looks down and you sigh. \"I'll clean it up, go get changed in the bedroom\" you say. Tammy nods and goes to get changed, as you grab a broom John walks up to you \"so uh when did you meet a squirrel chick?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday, she's the one I ran into\" you reply, \"I learned she was homeless so I couldn't let her sleep in the cold, and well now my home is hers\" you reply sweeping up seeds. John nods and says \"dang but she is one hot piece of\" \"don't you dare finish that sentence\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and why not\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already claimed that cute squirrel butt\" you reply jokingly but you freeze as Tammy walks in wearing a pair of blue jeans and one of you're over sized long sleeve shirts. \"What was that?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..uh...I\" you couldn't really answer and John was already on the floor laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that you said about my butt\" Tammy says walking up, \"something about it being cute and you claiming it\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well John was making a remark and..\" you couldn't really defend yourself but much to you're suprise Tammy giggles and leans on you \"of course it's yours\"  she says. You stare at her shocked and she pushes you, \"you're feeding me and giving me a place to stay the least I can stand is a few comments.\" she says. Then she looks up at you and says \"although you can claim me right now if you wish\" she says. John stares at you and you look at Tammy, \"uh how?\" you ask. She taps her lips \"right here\" she says every prince awakens and claims their princess with a kiss\" she says. You almost laughed out loud but thought better of it, you lean down and kiss her, Tammy jumps up and wraps her legs around you kissing you back forcefully. You staggered back but were able to keep you're balance and she detatched herself and smiled at you, \"well now you're stuck with me, cute butt and all\" she says. John by now was staring at you both open mouthed and before you can stop him he says \"do you have a sister?\" You glare at him and Tammy laughs, \"no but if I did i'd introduce her to you\" she says. Tammy walks into the living room and lays out on the couch and John whispers \"damn man do I envy you.\"</span></div></div>",

Tammy sits up on the couch \"where's he going?\" she asks. You shrug \"I really don't know\" you reply. Tammy gets up off the couch \"so you spent all day at college \"what'd ya learn?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer stuff mostly, not very much that someone who wasn't interested would know about\" you reply. Tammy stares at you for a few seconds before sighing \"I had a great day too, thanks for asking\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh sorry Tammy, I'm still not fully used to the whole housemate thing\" you reply. Tammy sidles up next to you \"it's alright, but my day was good\" she says. You smile at her and give her a small hug \"well that's great, you didn't uh make a mess while I was gone and just clean it up did you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo, alright a small one, the bag wouldn't give me my nuts\" she says as you both walked over to the couch and sat down. Tammy cuddled up with you laying her head down on your chest, \"look Tammy how about I get a pair of scissors and just leave those out\" you say. Tammy stares at you for a bit before sighing \"fine, I'm kind of sick of picking up spilled nuts\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile \"so you did eat right?\" you ask. Tammy nods and you sigh \"that's good, I don't want you to starve\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only a few hours, I wouldn't starve\" Tammy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, but you'd still be hungry and nothing sucks more then being hungry and not being able to get at food when it's right there right?\" you ask. Tammy nods and you quickly realized that she probably knew that feeling a lot better then you first thought. You gently petted Tammy's head and she moved up you until her head was nestled in your shoulder and she gently hugged your side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, for everything\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned so the the 2 of you were face to face \"Tammy I already told you it's alright\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that....your not the first person who's been nice to me\" Tammy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I thought you wanted...that from me, it's what the others always wanted\" she replies. You stared at Tammy eye to eye and asked her \"are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was able to put it behind me, mostly by hurting the people who hurt me\" she says. You swear you remembered a bunch of assault cases over the last 2 years although the assaulted were always older wealthier men so people thought it was just a rash of very unsuccesful burglaries and the men never said any different. You wrapped your arms around Tammy \"Tammy I will never ask you to do anything like that, but if I ever do call the authorities\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you'll be arrested\" she says staring at you wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her, you had really gotten attached to her in just the last 24 hours \"yeah but I'll maybe spend a day in jail, your safety is more important \" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy stares at you for a few seconds before she looks off into the distance before quickly standing up and running into the bedroom slamming the door shut. You quickly get up and open the door to find Tammy staring at you a look of primal fear and tears in her eyes \"that's, \"sniff\" what they all said\" she says staring at you fear evident in her voice. You slowly walk forward and she moves backward shivering, \"what the hell did they do to her\" you think as you stare at the squirrel who had just a few minute ago been so bubbly and cheerful. You turn and shut the door and you hear soft sobbing come from behind the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back into your living room and just watch tv for half an hour, you walk back to your bedroom and you slowly open the bedroom door. Curled up in her tail was Tammy, she lifts her head and shivers a bit, you turn the lights on and slowly walk up and sit down next to her, she actually shivers as you touch her. \"If I ever meet the people who took advantage of her I'll...\" your thoughts trailed off as Tammy looked up at you her fear filled eyes meeting yours. You did the one thing you could think of, you hugged her tightly making sure she couldn't run you gently started to sing an old lullaby your mother sang to calm you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver so slowly Tammy stopped fidgetting and she stared at you for a second before she started crying hugging you so tightly that she momentarily knocked the breath out of you. You hugged her back just letting her cry out all the pain she had suffered. After a few minutes she stops and looks away from you \".....sorry you had to take in such a broken girl\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently turn her head and kiss her gently, \"your not broken, your a perfectly lovable, cute squirrel, all those guys who hurt you will never do it again, I won't allow it\" you say. You smiled at her \"besides, it's not like I'm without my faults\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy stares at you stunned \"what faults could you have?\" she asks. You smiled at her and moved past her reaching past her pulling out a cardboard box, you pick it up and hand it to her \"here, open it\" you say. Tammy slowly opens the box and gasps as she sees that it was full of porn magazines, but not just any type of porn magazine, ones that catered to furries and anthro lovers. She stared at you shocked \"so is that why you took me in? Am I just some sex thing to you?\" she asks on the verge of tears again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would i have shown you that if you were?\" you reply holding back tears yourself. She stares at you for a few seconds before looking around, \"Alex can we make a deal?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to tell you something, but you have to burn these\" she says holding up the box. You nod and take the box outside to the small fire put you had in the pittance the city called a back yard. You struck a match and threw it onto the magazines before walking back into the house, you found Tammy still sitting on your bed watching the magazines burn out the window. She smiles as you enter the room and runs up and hugs you \"thank you\" she whispers. You hug her back \"so what did you want to tell me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need those magazines anymore as you have the real thing\" she says. You stared at Tammy and you could still see fear in Tammy's eyes, you smiled and sat her down \"you know Tammy I can wait until your totally okay with this\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy stares at you stunned \"but I thought most guys were...\" you shushed her with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was that kind of guy Tammy, you would have found yourself in my house instead of on the supermarket floor, or in a lot worse scenario, look Ms squirrley I honestly don't know how you did it as I just met you yesterday but I think I'm falling for you, so you have as long as you need\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy jsut stares at you stunned before kissing you slowly, the kiss slowly turning into making out, after a minute of you stroking her tail and her furry assets pushing on your chest Tammy moves back and says</span></div></div>",

I'd like my tails to be fluffy, I like it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo question her remark, you start brushing her tail. Tammy giggles, tries to grab your hands, eventually being successful, and says, \"Stop, I'm really ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" you ask. To go against her question, you start going up against her, tickling her in every way possible. she starts laughing uncontrollably and starts to run away from you. Luckily because of her energy and agility, Tammy is a bit further from your reach. Soon, she gets on the couch and you accidentally tackle her, then pinning her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou share a few laughs, then it dies down.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stared down at the girl who you hit, and froze at what you saw. Not only was a skinny pink tail twitching under her body, every inch of her that you could see was covered in gray fur. She looked attractive enough, probably 5ft 5 with a very petite build, her chest was a set of firm B-cups as they pressed lightly against a blue wool sweater. She was wearing some quite thick clothes for the middle of spring as she was also wearing jeans and a baseball cap. You gently lifted up one of her eyelids and confirmed that she was alive as well as having very beautiful hazel eyes. You then lifted the cap and 2 large rounded mouse ears sprang up, her small pink nose twitched as she lay there moving 2 sets of 3 whiskers on either side of her face. After a minute she sat up groaning \"oww my head\" she says, she notices you holding the cap and grabs it \"ummm, I'm sorry, I must seem very weird\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile \"nah, you look quite cute, need a hand?\" you say offering her yours. She nods and takes it and you help her back up, thankfully none of her goods fell out and you quickly grab one of those instant tv meals on the way up to the till. You go first and wait outside the store for the mouse girl, she pays for her things and walks out. She looks at you and the tv dinner \"is that all your getting?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a university student and well I'm not the best at cooking\" you say. She smiles \"well isn't that a coincidence I'm a university student,, but I can cook\" she says. You hold out a hand and she shakes \"Alex\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzan, Suzan Nibbles\" she says, you can't help it you giggle as you hear her last name and she smiles \"yeah it's bad I know\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about, ya know running into you\" you say. Susan smiles \"so is that really all your having for dinner?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah\" you reply blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head and pulls out a pen and a notepad, quickly she writes an address and hands you the paper. \"This is my home address, I always make a bit too much for dinner, you can, come over and have some if you want\" she says. You stare at her stunned for a second \"sure I'll be there\" you say. She nods \"good I normally eat around 6:00\" she says before turning around and running off. It didn't take you long to put your instant dinner away, get dressed and showered and well presentable in a black shirt with matching black pants. You just lazed around till about 5:45 and then set off arriving at Susan's place at 5:59. You pace for a minute before ringing the doorbell, you hear footsteps and Susan opens the door however she looks a lot different from before. She's wearing a black cocktail dress that showed a small bit of furred cleavage and went down to her knees forming a small skirt, there were also small diamond studded earrings in her ears. She smiles \"well are you going to come in?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your reverie, \"oh sorry\" you say walking in, Her house seemed to just be a bungalow the living room of the house being right next to the main hallway. The hall led forward and Susan headed right into the kitchen so you assumed left went to the bathroom and bedroom. You entered a very clean kitchen with 2 places all set up and a small flower arrangment set up. You smile as you sit down and so does Susan \"this is a bit fancy for \"a little extra food\" don't you think?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan blushes \"alright, not many guys ignore the fact that I'm a mousette, so this is more a dinner date\" she says smiling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh \"that's fine with me, didn't think I'd ever get a date with a girl as cute as you\" you say before digging in. Susan just sits there for a second before digging in herself, you pause after you swallow your first bite \"this is really good, what is it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a cheese souffle\" Susan replies. You nod and go back to eating, the table was quiet as the both of you ate and Susan quickly cleaned the plates, it seems you 2 weren't hitting it off very well. You look at Susan \"do you want to move to the living room? these chairs aren't that good for the back\" you say. Susan nods and she honestly looked at you with worry \"wow this really must not happen very often\" you think. You sit down on the couch and Susan sits next to you, you just sit like that in silence for a few seconds before she sighs. \"I'm sorry, I know I must not be very attractive and I'm wasting your time\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sat there stunned for a few seconds I mean you thought you had low self-esteem because you were a nerd but this was pretty bad. You slowly lay one arm around her and give a small squeeze \"your not wasting my time, and your right your not the sexiest girl I've ever seen, but your adorable and very cute\" you say. You giggled as Susan's whiskers brushed against your face and then laid your head down on your shoulder. You laid your head against hers and started to gently stroke her back \"don't be so hard on yourself, your a very nice girl, besides you've got more courage than me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't think I could have asked you over for dinner\" you say. Susan giggles \"it's not that hard\" she says. You laugh \"well I guess for you it's not, but normally I'm a very shy person\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and that's why you run into girls with your cart\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an honest mistake\" you say seperating from her annoyed but you freeze as you see she's smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you like about me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Uh....I don't know, your tail's quite cute, so are your ears, well really your just a really cute girl, your fur's warm and comfy, oh and your nice\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice?\" she replies obviously a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean I hit you hard enough to knock you out momentarily, most people would have bitched me out or had me arrested ro something, but you didn't do anything, hell you even invited me to dinner, so your a nice girl\" you say a large smile on your face. Suprising you a tinge of red appears under the gray fur and Susan looks at you for a second, \"so you like me?' she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your very cute, I don't care that your a mousette, that just makes you better, your one of a kind\" you say. Susan snuggled against you \"you are single aren't you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as i know\" you reply and get a playful punch in the shoulder for it. \"So, um...can I be your girlfriend?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, give me a second\" you say sitting in a thinking pose \"of course you can\" you say. Susan hugged you tightly her head laying against your chest, \"thank you\" she whispers. You hug her back \"no problem, although can we have most of the dates here, my place is kind of a mess, and well really nothing more than a small apartment\" you say. Susan nods \"fine but you better bring the ingredients for dinner next time\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever you need\" you reply. The two of you hugged again and you got up \"well I guess I better be going\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soon?\" Susan asks honestly bothered by the fact you had only stayed for like an hour. You smile \"tell you what, let's have the next date tomorrow, sound good?\" you ask. Susan nods and blows you a kiss \"well then I expect to see you here tomorrow at 6:00\" she says. You nod and head home floating on cloud nine as you had never expected things to turn out like this when you woke up this morning.</span></div></div>",

Tits bigger than her head under a green sweater and an ass stuffed inside a jean skirt, with cheeks double the size of basketballs. Meanwhile, a big pair of owl rimmed glasses sat on her cute face and a soft, black, curvy bowl cut framed it, adding some cuteness to her sexiness, but that wasn't what got your attention, as a thick, fluffy tail curled around you instinctively.<br>\r\nHer fur black with a single, solid, white stripe that came from the edge of her tail and underneath her hair, it was obvious she was an anthro, a skunk to be precise.

The smell wasn't something that could be coming from someone's digestive tract; rather, it was more a kin to several sewage plants that are overloaded with rotten dairy products.<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" You coughed heavily, much to her surprise and embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"How!?\" \"Because I enjoyed your farts!\" You reply, now  you're the one that's embarrassed.<br>\r\nA look of confusion comes across her blushing face and she comes closer to you for inspection. After studying your face for a while, she lifts her leg up and another explosive fart roars out of her rump, though not as long as her first one.<br>\r\n\"I guess you also got a fart fetish too,\" she said, blushing madly, though a smile was on her face, and you raise an eyebrow questioningly.<br>\r\n\"I love farting, despite it being embarrassing in public,\" she quickly adds in.<br>\r\n\"Say, how about we hang out some time, Miss...\" You ask, realizing you haven't gotten her name.<br>\r\n\"Stacy, and I would love to,\" the skunkess answers and you both exchange numbers.<br>\r\nHappy that you got a cutie's number, you take a couple of steps home before she calls out to you.<br>\r\n\"Wait! Can I stay with you for a while?\" She asks, her face frantic as she holds her phone up and a video of a burning building is displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a week after Stacy's place has burned down and she lost everything there, but it didn't take long before you two became girlfriend/boyfriend. Waking up, you see two big, black, furry cheeks with a white stripe narrowing down to an anus in front of you and you brace for impact. The butthole opens up to release an incredibly powerful fart, filling your lungs with dairy based gas.<br>\r\n\"Morning, sleepyhead~! Enjoyed my gift?\" Stacy asked, jumping off the bed and pulling up some panties that will turn into a thong later, her ass jiggling like mad.<br>\r\n\"Morning sexy,\" you reply, admiring the view as you try to take in as much oxygen as possible.<br>\r\n\"Breakfast is on the table,\" Stacy said, adjusting her yellow shirt before she leaves the room and you start your morning ritual, though it was delayed because of Stacy bombing the bathroom heavily.<br>\r\nHeading to the kitchen, you see Stacy playing some video games on her knees as she drop some room rumblers, her butt and thighs completely covering everything below the knees. A knock on the door takes your eyes off her and you go to it, opening it up for her...</span></div></div>",

The busty skunk smiled as she saw Stacy and ran towards her for a hug as her long hair waved behind before settling above her tail.<br>\r\n\"Mom?

Would you like some, Miss...\" You asked, and Stacy's mom smiled back.<br>\r\n\"Call me When, Jeff. Just some coffee for us. It may take a while for us to agree,\" she said, before returning her attention back to her husband.<br>\r\nDoing what you said you would do, you noticed that their were speaking with their farts instead of their mouths, an amusing thing if it weren't for the fact that it highly stunk. Once completed with your tasks, you delivered the drinks, where they to be wrapping things up.<br>\r\n\"Jeff,\" Barry snarled, before a small poot from Gwen made him remove his snarl and he continued on.<br>\r\n\"We came to a decision, and even you started dating my little girl, I...\"</span></div></div>",

You put your arms under her and pick her up. Surprisingly, she was very light, considering her size. You then quickly make your way to your house. Once inside, you lay her in the couch, which was a little too small, but you managed to get her on it comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, you see her starting to wake up. She rubs her eyes and stretches a bit, however, when she takes her surroundings in and realizes she is not in the forest anymore, what is her reaction?</span></div></div>",

Up to that you even walk closer to get a better look at the female anthro. You realized a few things that you wouldn't have expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was covered in a thin layer of gray fur. She didn't have a muzzle, but her mouth was open enough to see what she had sharp teeth and a nose looking like a wolf. Her tail was for some reason smooth and looked brushed. She had legs like a human, but paws for feet. As well as the arms, only they had hands. Every inch of her was covered in fur. She had a nice figure, one that almost anyone would look for. Her hair was just below her shoulders, gray as well, while her ears are sicking out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of anthropomorphism, but this is ridiculous!\" you exclaim. You looked around and see that there is even more rustling. Up to that you hear some talking and quiet yelling. Something about hunting \"that\" wolf. Hey, humans are animals as well, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get her out of here. She's probably the one they're looking for.\" It should be possible, after all its an entire forest that people can hunt in. You only come to this place occasionally because its peaceful most of the time. You grab her and realize that she's unusually light for her weight. You run to your car without being noticed and wait for the forest wonder to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of getting her properly seated, heck, you try doing this and see how easy it is, she finally wakes up, with some fidgeting, saying, \"Ah! Don't kill me! Don't kill me!\" She breathes really fast before figuring out where she was. \"Where... where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the forest,\" you reply. \"You must have hit yourself pretty hard. And what was going on back there? I heard quite a fuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its that same damn time of year again,\" she says, \"hunting season and I'm the main catch, just because of the way I look. (gasp) Let me guess, you're with them as well and taking me away and proceed as planned, right?\" She quivers and prepares to run with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? Does I look like a hunter?\" After all, you're dressed in every day casual clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female wolf eyes you carefully, and sees that you have a sedan instead of a pickup. \"Oh. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. As a matter of fact, you don't need to worry anymore anyway. If you want, I can take you away from this forest, save you from all these people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you really would?\" she asks, all enamoured with the fact. You nod and she stands up and hugs you tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take me away!\" she whispers strongly. You tell her to get in the back so no one would suspect anything when someone comes up. She obliges and does what you say. When you leave the forest grounds, you stop at a nearby parking lot and tell her, \"It's safe now, you can come out.\" She does and moves up to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I should've asked you before, but what's your name?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply, \"I'm Michael, and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sally, and by the way, thanks for taking me out of there. You had no idea how bad I had it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI probably couldn't imagine it either.

Please, Michael, I'm begging you!\" She starts crying with a lot of tears falling down. Your most biggest weakness: flat-out begging like this. \"You don't know what the world is like out there. You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was too hard to ignore her plea from. All the sadness she mentioned, all the tears...

After a minute of kissing, Sally releases and goes back a bit. \"I'm sorry.\" She even blushes lightly somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I liked it.\" Starting up the car, you say, \"Alright. Let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you drive to your house in from a suburban area. It's mostly secluded since there aren't any interruptions from anyone. You pulled up in your driveway and look around to see if anyone could be watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Sally,\" you whisper, \"we're gonna have to move fast. No one is exactly accustomed to seeing a wolf like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why else do you think I'm the rare catch in hunting seasons?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. No wonder.\" Luckily, no one came out, or saw from any window what was going on. You get in with no trouble and relax. \"Well, we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive,\" Sally states. She takes a tour around and is really impressed by the antiques you have. She even goes into the rooms. She stops and looks inside your bedroom, looking at how clean you have things. But when she's done, she comes back with one question...</span></div></div>",

She starts squirming and moaning as her passion builds.  She finally looks back at you and firmly and passionately say,\" I need you in me now\". Without hesitation you stand up and aim you throbbing hard-on into her waiting sex.  She thrusts back as you thrust forward and you both start to hump each other like two wild animals in heat.

You shot what feels like gallons of semen into your new sex partner as she stands there shivering and shaking.  As you both come down from your sexual  excitement she wraps her lovely tail around you and bends back to kiss you passionately.  You look into her eyes and decide to give her the most passionate kiss you can.  You two stay in your kiss until she looks up alarmed and says,\" the ribs\". You two quickly seperate and head for the oven.  Luckily it was a false alarm,some grease just splashed out of the pan.  She says I smelled something burning and I thought it was supper.

You smile and grab her hand and lead her to the bed room.  As you close the door and turn around , she wraps her arms around you and gives you a very sexy and passionate kiss.  Not that you complain any about having a very sexy looking vixen show so much interest in you.  You slowly walk her to the bed and set her down.  You take off her top and start to play with her breast and kiss on her nipple as she pulls your head in closer to her chest.  You take your free hand and start to massage her free breast as you pay close attention to her other breast with the greatest care of a well known and skilled lover.  Continuing as you hear her heart beat quicken her breathing increase and her muffled gasps and moans increase as you pay close attention to her luscious breasts.  You finally pull off and go back to french kissing her as you stand her up to finish undressing her.  Your hands slowly work into the waist of her panties and you slowly help her lower them to the floor as you kiss her body on the way down.  As her panties hit the floor you look up eye to eye with the most delicious fur covered pussy you have ever seen.  You can't resist and decide to let your tongue have a taste. As your tongue touches her sex, she moans with delight. You dive deeper, licking like a mad man the whole way till you whole face is buried it her box.  She starts grinding and wiggling as your tongue explores her inner most secret.  You can tell she is close to orgasm as she moans louder and starts to moving her hips more, and then she tenses up and you are rewarded with the most delicious of sexual nectars from her body.  You grab onto her firm ass cheeks to help steady her as you continue to lick up your new treat.  After you have finished gobbling up all of her juices,  you stand and kiss her again.  Then with the speed of a cheetah, she spins you around and pushes you to the bed.  At first you are alarmed but soon aroused as you look into her lust filled eyes and see her smile.  She slowly pulls your shorts down over the huge bulge that has been tenting it since the living room.  </span></div></div>",

Then without warning She pushes you backwards onto the bed.   Startled but surprised, you look up and see your lust filled partner gazing back at you.  She bends down and starts licking your balls, carefully lapping at every inch she can reach with her course tongue.  The sensation is unlike any you have ever felt with your ex.  She smiles after a few minutes and slowly crawls up over you.  She then starts licking and kissing your neck while her hand starts stroking your manhood.  After a few minutes and a passionate kiss, she lowers her self onto your throbbing cock.  She slowly lets it push past her pussy lips and enter her very wet sex cavern.  You try to hump up to speed the torture along and she glares at you and says \" let me enjoy this, I usually just get raped by the group hunters and dumped back in the woods.  I want to make you feel the love you have given me with your kindness.\"  You nod and she continues to lower herself till your loins are fully together.  She slowly rises until your cock is about to come out of her love box, then she lowers back down.  Ever so slowly, she starts to pick up speed.  Up and down and up and down she goes riding you like a porn star with no cares to what is going on around her.  She bends down and kisses you again while still moving her hips on your cock.  You both french kiss and you start to thrust up while she is thrusting down.  She starts to get close to her orgasm and she leans back up and doubles her assault on your cock.  You try to match her speed but soon just decide to let it go and enjoy the ride.   She starts moaning louder and louder as her body starts to tense.  She is near the end.  Without any warning she tenses and starts to shake and almost howl as you try to reach your own orgasm.   You continue to thrust the best you can till you finally fill her womb with your seed.   She collapses on you and you roll her onto side with you in tow.  You kiss her and she smiles and says \"Thank you. You have no idea how good it felt for me to be in control for once.\"   You smile and blush and say \" your welcome\".

She reads your note and  starts trying to get the house cleaned for you.   She figures it is the least she can do since you saved her.  She sweeps and does the dishes before deciding to raid the fridge. She finally settles down with her lunch and watches some t.v.  After your shift is done you head home feeling beat but kind of excited and worried, after all you did leave an anthro wolf girl at your house all alone for the whole day.

It is then you realize that she only has your ex's teddy's and panties to wear around the house.  Not a bad combo but she needs some clothes.   You decide to go online and find her some outfits.  She wakes up and finds you at the computer and asks what you are doing.  \"I'm getting you some outfits so you don't have to wear my ex's old clothes\", you exclaim.  She smiles and says,\" I didn't hear any complaints last night.\"  You just smile at her and go about shopping.   You find her some jeans and a few shirts, lucky for you she is similar in size to your ex.  You ask her to come over and pick out some outfits she likes and also her underwear.  She smiles and says,\" so what am I a build a slut doll to you now?\"   You are a little shocked but find it funny.  \"Maybe but I still think you should look your best since we are together now.\"  She smiles and sits besides you.  After what seems like hours of shopping and joking around you finally have her some clothes she can be proud of.  \"Well looks like they will be here in a week and until then I guess you will have to wear What My ex left.\"  \" Are you sure I need to dress, cause I figured you would rather have me walk around in the nude.\"  You blush but decide to it is best for her to try and stay clothed during the day.  After lunch, Sally slips into an old pair of shorts and a loose tank top.  \" She could look hot in a potato sack,\" you think to yourself.    You try and find a show to watch to take your mind off of just stripping her naked and ravaging her there in the living room.  She wonders over with a couple of drinks and sits down besides you.  Finally you find a show that is half way interesting.  She leans in and snuggles up to your side. You can't help but notice the top doesn't hide much as you look over at her.  You try to look away but my god is she hot for a vixen.  About that time she places her hand on your ever rising crotch.  She tries to act like she doesn't feel the swelling boner in you pants.  You try and get back into watching the show  but she starts rubbing at you pants.

This continues for a few minutes, you fondling and pinching and her slowly speeding up her groping till finally she can't take it anymore and unzips your pants.   Sally strokes your rock hard member and licks her lips but to your surprise she stands up.  Surprisingly she pulls her shorts to the side and  guides your cock into her dripping honey hole.

You made your way through the small crowd gathered around the cage, working your way to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the cage, you can see its contents:  A slightly-pudgy orange vixen.  She's about five feet tall, with a white throat, underbelly, and inner thighs.  And true to the doorman's word, she did not look happy.  It seemed she was trying her hardest to pretend she was somewhere else, lying on the dirty floor with her back to all of the people, even as they called to her.  Once in a while, she'd tuck her legs into her chest, whimper softly, or roll onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only times she'd engage the \"audience\" is when she smelled food.  Even though people weren't allowed to bring food into the tent, they did anyway.  Either the doorman simply didn't notice, or didn't care.  One such man in a blue shirt smuggled in a corn-dog, which the vixen took notice of, sniffing the air pensively and turning toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-corn-dog..?\" she squeaked.  The man simply raised an eyebrow at her as he raised the carnival cuisine in question to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" he answered.  \"What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I...  Have it?  I'm hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like they feed you enough already.\"  You glance over at the corner of the cage at what appears to be a food-bowl; it's empty, and has been so for who knows how long.  You also note a few bits of debris left over from other bits of food she's managed to get others to part with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...  I'm hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I paid five dollars for this corn-dog.  I'm not giving it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeeeeeeease?\" she whimpered, dropping to her knees and groveling.  \"I'm <i>starving</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man began waving the corn-dog in front of her.  \"You want this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached outside the bars of her cage, pawing at it.  A din rose among the crowd, and she shrank back.  \"Y-yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...  What do you want me to do?\"  She absolutely didn't like where this was going, and neither did you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down.  Get down on all fours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...  Okay.\"  She wasn't particularly thrilled with the request, but you were slightly relieved by the lack of molestation.  She did as she was told, dropping to her hand-paws and staring up at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower.\"  The vixen obeyed, her chest hovering closer to the cage's floor.  \"<i>Lower,</i> I said.  I want you <i>kissing</i> that floor, Tubs.\"  Her muzzle made contact with metal just a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir...\" came her slightly-muffled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Pfffft.</i>  Pathetic.  Here's your damn food, you <i>animal</i>.\"  He punctuated his last remark by throwing the corn-battered hot-dog at her exposed back, smearing mustard as it rolled downwards.  The crowd laughed at this display.  You didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...\"  Her eyes watered a bit as she reached for her reward and immediately began devouring it.  The crowd cheered as she finished.  She winced at the outburst, but finished the last bits of meat in a few seconds, only to begin chewing on the empty stick and wipe the mustard off of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sorry sight, indeed, and you didn't really want to see any more.  You couldn't really leave her, though...</span></div></div>",

You don't have to wait long, though, as they all begin to wander over to the other cage, where its resident seems a bit more active.  With nobody watching the fox, you decide to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's already gone back to ignoring all of the people in the tent, but you try to strike up a conversation anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get no answer from the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  You try again.  No answer.  She's either willfully ignoring you or she's in her own little world.  \"Hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what will get her to talk, though.  You leave the tent, and return with five funnel-cakes; probably a lot more than you needed to get her to talk, but there probably wasn't any harm in overfeeding her.  You and the doorman exchange glances as you re-enter, but he doesn't say anything.  The fox is still alone, and still lying quietly.  As you approach, she begins sniffing the air as she rolls over.  You've certainly got her attention, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funnel-cakes?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of funnel-cakes...\"  She's visibly salivating, which you find sort of cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod again, chuckling.  \"It is.  Five of 'em.  Do you want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  That was the most excited you'd seen her all day, but she quickly returned to her sullen demeanor.  \"What do I have to do..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.  Here you go.\"  You slip a piece of fried dough halfway through the iron bars, and she greedily pulls it through the rest of the way.  She giggles as she raises it to her mouth and takes a big bite, chewing loudly.  She finishes it in twenty seconds flat, and belches shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you again and cocks her head.  You smile and slip her another.  \"<i>Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou</i>...\"  She tears into the next one with equal gusto, and you slip another one through the bars for when she's finished.  She snatches it from your hand before she's done with her current one, holding it aloft in her paw as she pops the last bit of her second cake into her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like funnel-cakes?\"  She nods vigorously as she chews through her third.  You can see why she's so chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" she says between bites.  \"Love 'em.  Although, I guess I like just about anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you like them.\"  You nibble on one of the remaining cakes as she finishes hers.  \"What's your name?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name..?  I...\"  She stops eating to think, but just shakes her head in frustration.  \"I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...  You don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she sighs.  She begins playing with a tag on the collar you didn't realize she was wearing.  You take a closer look at the tag, only seeing the letter \"T\" emblazoned on it.  You wonder what it means, but quickly realize that it stands for the owner of the circus:  Thomas Timmens.  \"I guess you can call me 'Tea.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, 'Tea.'  Where did you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The forest...\"  An annoyingly-vague answer, but if she doesn't know her own name, you doubt she'd be able to name the forest she came from.  \"I used to live in a little den in the woods.  Now I don't...\"  You can see she doesn't like talking about this, as she begins to sniffle.  You slip her the last uneaten funnel-cake to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that...\"  You carry on with small-talk, as you tell her about yourself, where you live, what you do...  Her end of the conversation only seems to consist of acknowledgments of your statements mixed in with a summary of all of the foods she's eaten here at the circus.  Not the most riveting conversationalist, but you're happy that she seems happy.  You slip her the remains of the funnel-cake you'd been eating, which she's just as excited to accept, and turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" she asks through a mouthful of fried dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been nice talking to you, but I've gotta go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" she sighs.  \"Well, it's been nice talking to you, too.\"  She looks down at the last of her funnel-cake, but instead of eating it, she tosses it in her bowl.  As you walk away, she cries out, \"Come back and see me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you have business to attend to...</span></div></div>",

She doesn't seem to hear you, and only moves when she hears the key turning in the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooooo...\" she moans.  \"Please, don't hurt me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jolt, she turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, 'Me.'

The sun's been going down for the past hour, now, and everyone's either gone home or headed to the main tent to see the big show; this break-out couldn't have been better timed, and you probably don't need to be running so fast.  On the other hand, there certainly wouldn't be much point in dawdling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour car's on the other side of the lot from the entrance; you couldn't find better parking, earlier.  You're just thankful that you remember where it is and nobody's around to see you carrying away circus property.  You make your way to your beat-up blue car and open one of the back-doors, ushering the nervous vixen inside.  You instruct her to lie on the seats so that nobody sees her as you drive home.  She quietly obeys, and you strap her in with the seat-belts as best you can.  The pudgy orange fox is visibly uncomfortable, squirming against her new confines, but there's nothing you can do about it beside pat her head and lightly console her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I don't like this...\" she whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, girl, but there's not a lot I can do about that...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop in the driver's seat, and put the key in the ignition.  She whines even louder as the car comes to life, but you hush her as you drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to keep her calm with idle conversation, but you don't seem to find much to talk about, having already exhausted such fodder during your first meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settle on discussing her future, hoping she sees it as brightly as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...  You're out of there, now,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" she says half-heartedly.  You're not sure if she's simply nervous from the car-ride or if she's actually regretting leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think we're going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I don't know...\"  She's...  Afraid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, home.  My house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both remain silent for a few minutes.  You look into the back-seat every once in a while at your passenger.  She's trembling slightly and closing her eyes.  You sigh as you bring your attention back to the road.  Not that there's anything all that interesting aside from a few billboards and some bushes on the side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm going to hurt you?\" you ask, frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  No, I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, now...  All I wanted to do was get you out of that cage.  You're safe now, safe from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That part of your life is over and done, with a new chapter just beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm not sure where you want that to go...\"  You glance to the back-seat, and manage to lock eyes with the vixen for just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\"  She looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  In the meantime, you'll stay with me until you figure out where you wanna go.  You'll be safe, have somewhere warm to sleep, and plenty to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat?\"  She sounded excited at that part, which made you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, plenty.  We just gotta get home...  We're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've just come upon the city limits, and you're well on your way to your street.  A few blocks later, and you're in front of your house, pulling into the driveway.  It's not a very stately house:  The unadorned siding is a stark white, and within its cramped walls were only a few rooms containing the necessities of life.  It's rather impressive for a young man such as yourself to have a house, regardless of its size...  And remarkably convenient for smuggling a stolen fox, especially when you don't have any roommates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are:  Home, sweet home,\" you say as you open the car-door in the back to let Tea out.  As you undo her buckles, she practically leaps from the seats and onto the path.  To your relief, that's as far as she goes; she's not going to run, and she seems to trust you enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home...\" she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home.\"  You nod at her as you take her arm and begin stepping up the walk.  She follows you, staring ahead.  You hope she'll warm to the idea of living with you, just as much as you hope you'll be able to get used to having a <i>very</i> dependent roommate.  Whether or not the two of you do, though, it's just the way it's going to have to be.  Whether she sees herself as your roommate, your pet, or your captive...  She's a \"fugitive,\" and somebody's going to come looking for her once they realize she's gone.  They'll take her back to the circus, or worse, and she certainly wouldn't like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've only got a few yards to your front door, but no bushes or shrubs to hide the two of you.  Hopefully nobody sees you...</span></div></div>",

You look over your shoulder at the street to make extra-sure that nobody's watching, and unlock your door.  The pudgy vixen is ushered inside first, and you follow, closing the door behind you.  Tea takes a moment to survey her new living space while you close some blinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door opens into your rather spartan living room, housing an ugly old sofa and a small television with assorted electronics surrounding it.  Besides these two most essential elements, there's a couple of posters on the walls...  And a lamp in the corner, next to a window.  The floor is covered in light-gray carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen is conjoined to the living room to the right of the door, cutting off the carpet and giving way to plain linoleum tile.  It's got just about everything a kitchen should have, including a stove and refrigerator, with a counter between the two.  Atop the counter sit a microwave and a toaster, and above those are some cupboards.  At the far end of the kitchen, next to the refrigerator, is a closed door; this is the pantry.  Opposite the wall from the counter is a small dining table, with two plastic chairs at opposite ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the living room and the kitchen is the hallway, into which the living room's carpet continues.  There are five doors along the walls:  Two each on the left and right walls, with a single door at the back.  The back door is simply a coat closet; not much to note there.  The door on the right closest to it leads to the bathroom, with the door closest the kitchen leading to the laundry room.  The door on the left closest the coat closet leads into your bedroom.  The last door leads to a spare room which you've not figured out what to do with.  All walls in the house are painted a stark white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea looks somewhat impressed by her new digs; being that she used to live in a small metal cage, however, it probably doesn't take much to impress her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um...  Yeah, this is my house...\" you say, embarrassed.  \"So...  First thing's first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get you settled in...  Perhaps you'd like to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a bit, but...  Maybe you'd like to take a shower?\"  You didn't want to say anything, but the fox smelled a bit gamey.  You're not a snob when it comes to cleanliness, but given the way she'd been living, it might be nice if she was bathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shower..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...  Follow me.\"  Oh, dear.  It looks like you'll have to explain to her how she bathes.  You lead her to your bathroom and open the door, revealing teal walls and blue tile.  A toilet sat closest to the door, with a white sink in a bathroom counter right next to it.  At the back of the room was a combination bath/shower, with some blue polka-dot curtains allowing for privacy.  \"See, I need you to step into the bathtub, there...\"  She obeyed, padding across the bathroom floor and into your cream-colored bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see, there's a knob there, on the wall.  Just turn it, and water will come out of that shower-head...  You get all wet, and then you rub that bar of soap all over your body...  And then let the water rinse it off, rubbing yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Yeah, I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they never bathe you at the circus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen blushed at the question.  \"They just sprayed me with a hose and threw soapy water on me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...  We don't do that, here.  If you know what to do, I'll be in the kitchen.  There's a towel on the rack right there; just holler if you need anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, you were in the kitchen, putting some water on the stove to boil.  You figured that tonight would be a good night for some store-brand macaroni-and-cheese.  After you got a blue box down from the cupboard, you went to check on Tea, who was just wandering out of the bathroom draped in a green towel, sopping wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done...\" the fox said, shivering.  \"It's so cold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...  Just step back into the bathroom; you're dripping all over the carpet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay.  Let me help you get dry...\"  You head into the bathroom to fetch the hair-dryer from one of the drawers in the counter and plug it in.  The noise scares the pudgy vixen as it roars to life, but she seems to like the feel of hot air blowing against her fur, softly moaning as it makes its way down her body.  As you finish, you instruct her to wrap the towel around her waist, above her tail, and lead her to the kitchen.  \"Just sit down, and I'll finish making dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Tea smiled at the thought of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes, a couple pats of butter, and quarter-cup of milk later, dinner was ready.  You take a couple bowls down from the cupboard and pour half of the pot into one of them.  You set the full bowl in front of the vixen, and before you have a chance to get her a spoon, she's already dove into muzzle-first, eating it like a...  Well, an animal.  You watch with mild amusement as she slurps up the steaming hot yellow glop, finishing the bowl in only a couple minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to get you a spoon...\" you say, flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox doesn't say anything, simply looking down at her empty bowl in what appeared to be shame.  \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, it's alright...\"  You start dishing yourself the rest of the macaroni and take a seat opposite the orange vixen.  \"Did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...  Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" you respond, through a mouthful of pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sit in silence for a bit; you're eating your meal, and Tea is intently watching you do so while licking her chops to get whatever residual cheese sauce is staining them.  You manage to finish half of your bowl before a loud gurgling emanates from your dining companion across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...  It's just my stomach...\" she says, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and sigh, silently pushing the rest of your macaroni toward her, which she happily accepts.  This time, she makes a point of using the spoon, shoveling in pasta as quickly as it allows her.  Once more, she's through her food in only a couple of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" you say as you get up to load all of the dirty dishes into the dishwasher.  \"Let's just head over to the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox silently follows you over to the sofa, leaving her wet towel behind on the seat.  You motion for her to sit down, and she falls back into the ragged piece of seating, with you following suit.  You don't really have a lot to talk about, so you'll let the television distract the two of you, turning on the set and switching over to some sitcom.  You'd zone out, but you're having more fun watching Tea, who is transfixed on the screen, as if she's studying some piece of forgotten lore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs two characters on-screen get a bit romantic, she begins looking a bit uncomfortable.  The female of the two characters slowly lowers her head into the male's lap; the vixen surprises you by following suit.  You chuckle, which seems to shock her upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  I'm...  I'm sorry,\" she says, flustered.  \"I'm just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright.  Shhh.  Lie down,\" you say, gesturing to your lap.  She gingerly lowers herself back onto your lap, now looking quite uncomfortable.  \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm...  I'm fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start stroking her neck, which makes her tense up at first, but she seems to relax a second or two later, so you keep going.  Her eyes start to flutter shut, so you turn off the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for saving me...\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, sweetheart...\" you coo back.  \"You think you're gonna like it here?..  For now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gettin' sleepy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"</span></div></div>",

You're not entirely sure what you're going to do about sleeping arrangements...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you figure the fox won't mind sleeping on the couch, if only just for tonight.  You slip out from under Tea as gently as you can and go to fetch some spare bedding from the hall closet.  You return to the living room to find a somewhat-more-alert Tea waiting for you, peering over the back of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have there?\" she asks sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a blanket and a couple of pillows, girl.  Here, feel them,\" you say as you hand her a plain white pillow in a plain white pillowcase.  She squeezes it in her arms and nuzzles it, reveling in its softness (at least, softness compared to a metal surface), and you surprise her by draping a blue blanket over her.  She's momentarily startled, squeaking a bit, but moans as she begins feeling the warmth of her cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I like these...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\"  You place the other pillow on the couch behind her, and head off down the hallway to get ready for bed, yourself.  \"Goodnight, Tea,\" you whisper as you turn out the lights in the living room.

Your teeth are cared for, your body clean...  And you've changed into something a bit more comfortable:  A pair of pajama bottoms but no shirt.  There's nothing left to do but crawl into bed.  You open your bedroom door and step inside.  Like the rest of your house, it's rather small, and not particularly impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a queen-sized bed in the corner, just a couple feet from the door.  The bed itself isn't particularly elaborate; it's barely more than a mattress with legs.  A royal blue comforter is spread across it, with slightly-lighter blue bedsheets underneath.  You've got a couple of pillows at the head of the bed, both the same color as the ones you gave to the fox in the living room.  A nightstand sits beside the bed, holding a lamp and a digital clock.  On the opposite wall from the bed is a modest desk setup that houses your computer and a cup full of pens.  The \"fanciest\" piece of furniture you own sits beside the desk:  A wardrobe, housing what little clothing you choose to own.  The same carpet that runs throughout your living room and hallway is laid on the floor in here.  The only thing you've got on your walls is a poster next to the door; a lack of windows in this room makes the walls look especially bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically fling yourself onto your bed; it's been a full day, and you're more than ready to end it.  All is dark, your bed is soft and warm, and you're drifting off to sleep...  Until you hear some scratching at your door.  In your half-awake state, you're not entirely sure what that would be.  Something starts jostling the doorknob, and you get a little worried.  You turn on the lamp just in time for the door to fly open, revealing a thick, dark figure standing in the doorway.  You shout, and it squeaks back, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  It's just Tea, clutching a pillow.  You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I...\" she stutters.  \"I'm--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say, more brusquely than you would otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...  I'm sorry!  I'm scared...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of..?  Of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's dark!  I don't like the dark...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you do at the circus?  I imagine you must have coped <i>somehow</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I didn't!\"  In the lamp-light, you can see tears forming in the fox's golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.  \"So...  What do we do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitates for a moment before answering.  \"...  Can I sleep in here?  Please?  I feel safe with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot entirely sure how to react to that, you acquiesce.  \"Sure, just...  Wait here.  I'll get the rest of your bedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander out to the living room and groggily snatch up her pillow and blanket from the couch, and return to your room to find the pudgy orange vixen curled up on the floor, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...  Get up.  I'm not making you sleep on the floor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...  I'm really sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, it's fine...  Just...  Get in bed.\"  The fox does as she's told, and you toss her bedding to her.  She promptly tucks a pillow behind her back and head, and places one between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just tired...\"  You climb into bed beside her, trying to get yourself comfortable again.  You're used to having this bed all to yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you regret it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regret what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saving me...\"  She sniffles, and you sigh.  You stroke her neck reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sweetheart...  Of course I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\"  Tea places an arm over your bare chest and leans in closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen pecks you on the cheek; a tiny, tender kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-goodnight...\"  You scoot a bit closer to Tea and embrace her.  She gasps, but doesn't resist.  In fact, she responds by leaning into you and putting her muzzle on your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure about letting her sleep in your bed with you, but...  This isn't so bad.  She's like a big, warm body pillow mixed with a plush toy.  Her overall thickness made her quite soft, and the sound of her breathing soothed you.  You pull the covers over the two of you, and you both drift off to sleep, the grateful vixen lying peacefully in your arms.</span></div></div>",

It seems you've woken up just in time.  On near-instinct, your arm shoots over to the \"shut up\" button on top of it, and you're rewarded with silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, near-silence...  A light breathing in your ear reminds you that you shared a bed with a plump vixen last night.  Tea's muzzle parts just an inch to release a tiny yawn, but she's still sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're quite awake, though; no more sleep for you.  You turn on your lamp and roll out of bed, careful not to disturb the fox.  Before you start your day, though, you contemplate waking Tea up.  She's so cute; you'd hate to wake her.  But...  You get the feeling she's just going to start panicking if she wakes up by herself and there's nobody there with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to err on the side of caution, and just wake her up now.  You put your hand on her orange-furred shoulder and rouse her as gently as you can manage.  Despite that, though, she dramatically awakens with a gasp, her eyes shooting open and darting about the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?!\" she cries.  Well, it looks like she was just going to panic, anyway; maybe you <i>should</i> have let her sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea...\" you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?  Wh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Tea.</b>  Calm down...  You're in my bed.  Remember..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-  Um.

You're safe, nobody's going to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\"  She absent-mindedly clutches the tag of the collar that she's been wearing this entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to get rid of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly reach toward her neck, careful not to startle her, as you finger the collar's clasp at the back of her neck.  With a bit of fiddling, the clasp pops loose, and the collar falls to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?  You're not a part of that circus, anymore.  You don't have to wear that collar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...  Th-thank you...\"  She begins feeling her bare neck, spending quite a bit of time tracing the matted fur once covered by nylon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go ahead and destroy this, later.  Right now, though, I'll just put it in my wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, just wait right here.

But...  That means I'll be alone,\" she whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to face her.  She's sitting upright in your bed, intently looking at you.  Her eyes are beginning to tear a bit, and you can't help but feel guilty.  However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about that.  I've gotta go to work, and I can't take you with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine, girl.  Here, let's go get you something to eat.\"  Tea becomes noticeably perkier at the mention of food, and you smile.  You quickly pull your shirt on, followed by a pair of socks and some slacks, and begin heading out the bedroom door, motioning for the plump vixen to follow.  Like an excitable puppy, she practically leaps from the bed to your side, and you both proceed to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what you'd fix for the two of you this morning.  It'd be nice to welcome the fox to her new home with a stack of pancakes and some fried eggs and bacon, but...  That takes effort, and you're pretty sure she'd be just as impressed with a bowl of cereal.  That's <i>your</i> general breakfast fare, anyway.  You fetch a couple of ceramic bowls from the cupboard, and place them at the table, where Tea has already seated herself.  A couple of spoons soon sit in each bowl, and next comes a heaping serving of off-brand Corn Flakes.  You head for the refrigerator to get the milk, but a loud crunching behind you tells you that Tea's already started shoveling dry cereal into her muzzle.  You fetch the milk and bring it to the table, watching Tea struggle to chew the tough flakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea, you gotta eat them with milk...\"  The vixen finishes chewing and swallows hard, turning to look at you in confusion as you pour milk on her corn flakes.  \"Just let that sit for a moment, and it'll soften them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh as you begin pouring milk on your own corn flakes, taking a seat opposite the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...  Sleep well?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" the vixen answers, eyeing her breakfast.  \"When can I..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few more seconds...\"  An awkward silence follows, punctuated by a gurgle from Tea's empty stomach.  \"Okay.  Now you can eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen wastes no time diving into the cereal, taking heaping spoonful after heaping spoonful to her eager muzzle.  She looks like she's barely chewing between each bite, and it worries you a bit...  But before you can say anything, she's finished her bowl, looking at you and pleading with her eyes for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay...  But try to go a bit slower this time, alright?  You're gonna choke if you keep eating like that.\"  You pour her another bowl, and sit back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\"  She only takes marginally longer to finish her second bowl, but luckily, she doesn't ask for more, instead content to drink the leftover milk in the bowl.  You finish your own cereal, and take the empty bowls to the sink, rinse them out, and leave them for a proper washing later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...  I've gotta get going, soon...\" you say.  \"Are you going to be okay all alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you will.  You've just gotta keep yourself occupied.  Maybe watch some television?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lead her over to the couch and lay her down, turning on the television and hand her the remote, showing her what few buttons she'd need to operate it.  She half-heartedly nods at each instruction, and as you head out the front door, Tea still looks incredibly apprehensive, watching you as much as she's watching the television set.  You close the door and hope for the best as you head to your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nYou return home several hours later after a full day at work, exhausted.

Did you miss me?\" You ask in a playful tone.To your surprise, Tea wasn't startled or surprised in any way.<br>\r\n\"You're back! You were gone forever! I thought you were never coming back but you're back! I'm so happy!\" Replied Tea, as her tail swayed rapidly. She then proceeded to lick your face wildly, causing you to blush. After a few seconds Tea realized what she was doing and stopped, blushing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry. I didn't mean to lick you.\" Tea looked away in an attempt to hide her blush.\" Soooo. How was work?\"<br>\r\n\"It was fine. Just a regular day at the office.\" At this point you start to head towards your room to change into clothes that felt more comfortable. When you returned to Tea, you sit next to her on the couch as you surf through some channels to find something that interests both of you. You eventually settle on a romantic film. Throughout the film, the main lovers were shown hiding each other's feelings for one another until the end when they admit their feelings and live happily ever after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the movie's over. What do you want for dinner Tea!\" Tea immediately perked her head in your direction.<br>\r\n\"Food! What are we gonna eat! I can't wait to eat! I haven't eaten anything since you left earlier today! I'll eat just about anything right now!\"<br>\r\n'I think you'd eat anything anytime' you thought in your head. You were so tired from working today that you didn't want to make anything.<br>\r\n\"Hey Tea, think you're in the mood for some pizza?\" Tea proceeded to run up to you and hugged you.<br>\r\n\"I want pizza please!\" You call the local pizzeria and ordered two large meat lovers pizza. After hanging up you went back to the couch with Tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Tea. When the pizza arrives go into the kitchen. We can't let anyone see you. Got it?\" Tea nods as you both turn your attention to the television. Tea moves closer to you and you wrap your arm around her. For some reason being with Tea made you happier than normal. You shrugged the thought and decided to deal it later. Soon after there's a knock at the door. Tea proceeds to hide in the kitchen while you go to pay for the pizza. Afterwards Tea comes out and starts devouring the pizza without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's got to go easy on all the food. I'm pretty sure all this eating is going to catch up with her someday. Oh well, if she's happy then I guess it's alright.' You then proceed to grab a slice yourself and eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes pass and all of the pizza is gone. Granted Tea ate nearly everything. As she finishes the final slice, she pats her bloated stomach in satisfaction. A soft moan then escapes her muzzle.<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone had fun.\"<br>\r\n\"I sure did. I've never eaten that much pizza in one sitting. It was delicious. I am starting to get tired though.\"<br>\r\n\"Why don't you start heading towards the bedroom and I'll be there in a bit.\" Tea nods and makes her way towards the bedroom as you proceed to take a shower. Afterwards you put on your regular sleep attire and hop into bed. Tea then leans closer towards you as you do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for all you've been doing for me.

Do we have a lot of anything in the refrigerator?\" You responded: \"Yes we do, we have plenty of eggs, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, ham, bacon, and cheese. I could make an omelette for us to share? We would each get half of the omelette. Does that sound good to you Tea?\" Tea responded: \"sure, that sounds amazing! I really wish my mother was here to meet you though, she definitely would have thanked you for what you did.\" A few minutes later you said while cutting the omelette in half: \"Breakfast is served.\" Unbekownst to them one of her mother's anthropomorphic rabbit spies was keeping tabs on them using their exceptional hearing. She would report to her master who had saved not only her life but the lives of her entire family.(life debt) While Tea's mother had no qualms with eating non sentient prey as they wrere not their own person just an animal. She absolutely loathes the Idea of hunting sentient prey as they are more than just an animal they are their own person, a beautiful, wonderful life form with emotions, relationships, memories, a personality, and dreams. (Like Rose Quartz she saw beauty in everything, unlike Rose Quartz she understands emotions well) The spy then hops off to her master to report what she has heard. Tea's mother responds: \"So my daughter wishes for me to meet the man who rescued her from the circus, the man who she loves. Excellent, I would love to meet him! How long will it take to walk there?\" \"You should arrive at noon if you leave now master. Apparently he is looking up on the internet how to make a Ragu, I can only surmise that is what he will make for dinner. However he did not mumble the type of meat he would use.\" She responded: \"Excellent they will be completely free by the end of this year because by then the circus will have completely forgotten her! Is what your sisters told me. Then you will no longer have to serve me, as that is what my plan was the moment you and your sisters pledged to serve me of their own volition. You and your sisters are each their own person, and deserve to be free, I could not bare the thought of you serving me for your entire lives. That does not mean you and your sisters will never see me again, what it means is that once you and your sisters are free, we will still keep in touch. I never thought of you or your sisters as servants, I always thought of you all as friends.\" She grabs her rain jacket, some boots, and an umbrella before leaving to go meet the love of her daughter's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she arrive just fine or does she colapse from exhaustion on his doorstep?</span></div></div>",

Scarlet: \"You must be the man who freed my daughter from the circus of that wretched man. Your the man whom my daughter loves. Thank you for all you have done for her, it is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Scarlet Rose Redfox.\" *Tea hugs her mother crying tears of joy and her mother returns the embrace.* Scarlet: \"The day they took you, I was going to give you a name that day, it was Teanna. The day after they took you there was a forest fire I saved the lives of an entire family of sentient anthro prey animals, they were rabbits. The many young does pledged their lives to serve me for saving their family have helped me keep tabs on you ever since, praying for your freedom. After the fire our old den was no more so I had to adapt to city life it was hard at first but then I ran into a member of the P.E.T.A who took pity on me and the family of rabbits and gave us more then enough money we would need to purchase a citizenship. Then I adopted an orphan boy and later found out he was the heir to a massive fortune. Next thing I knew it we were living in a mansion. You will-\" *Her phone rang, she removed it from her coat pocket and answered. Scarlet: \"Hello.\" Andrew: \"Mom great news Jessica has finished compiling the recordings of every thing they have done to Teanna on to a single flash drive. All we need to do is give it to P.E.T.A then they'll show it to the authorities and the ringleader will be sent to jail for the rest of his life and that cirrcus will be no more, Teanna will be free. Also the anthro dragoness that the cirrcus caged, I ran into her at the store. Her name is Seraphina, I'm in love.\" Scarlet: \"That's wonderful son. Love you bye.\"  Andrew: \"Bye Mom.\" *The phone was on loudspeaker so we heard it all. Jessica had sent Scarlet a text Jessica: \"Just left to hand the flash drive to the member of P.E.T.A that helped us years ago. I'll be there in 3 hours, then Teanna will be free.\" Scarlet showed us the text. Teanna was overjoyed.* Teanna: \"This is wonderful I can be out in public with Blake. I can enjoy life never again living in fear. Isn't this wonderful Blake? *She smells something cooking* What is it that your cooking? We just ate lunch.\" \"It's for dinner, tonight I'm making a ragu. The meat is a surprise.\" Teanna: \"Okay.\" \"Today is the day your freedom is complete. That is indeed wonderful.\" *We kissed.* Scarlet: \"You've grown into a fine young vixen. I'm so proud of you Teanna. Here is the money you will need to purchase a citizenship. *Scarlet then whispers in my ear.* And here is the money you will need to purchase an engagement ring and a wedding ring. I'll pay for the wedding, the wedding cake, the honeymoon, and the bigger house.\" *I just nodded. Teanna was so happy. She had seen plenty of romantic movies on TV learning of weddings, she wanted one soon. And on second thought perhaps she will wait till the honeymoon to make love, and start a family of her own.* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater it was dinner time. Do you propose a toast to Teanna's freedom and have wine? Or no alcohol and just toast with water in wine glasses?</span></div></div>",

Well, all sorts of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has been the room that's collected all of the junk you never found a place for in the rest of the house.  Niche kitchen appliances you received as housewarming presents that you couldn't fit in the kitchen?  They're in here, right beneath the window.  A life-sized cardboard cutout of some mook from a B-list science-fiction film?  Right by the door.  A secondhand ottoman that you picked up off the side of the road, thought \"Gosh, this'd go great in my living room,\" and then realized it wouldn't?  That's where the kitchen appliances are sitting.  Anything that came into your life that you couldn't conveniently place found it's way here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pile of clothes is sitting at the foot of an upturned mattress, strewn about and leading underneath.  Taking a closer look, you notice the white tip of a bushy, orange tail peeking out from beneath a wrinkled flannel shirt.  You sigh with both exasperation and relief, picking up the shirt and revealing the rest of a fox's tail.  You knock on the wall and sternly say her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Tea.</i>  Come out.\"  You hear a small yawn as the fox's tail shivers and retreats into the cavern under that mattress.  The mattress wobbles a bit as something shifts underneath.  Soon, Tea's face comes into view, popping out of her little hidey-hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?..  Oh!  You're back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm back.  What are you doing in here?  I've been looking for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea winces and you feel a bit bad.  \"I was hiding, but then I fell asleep, I guess...  I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh again.  \"Well...  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're mad at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not mad, I'm-  <i>I mean</i>, why were you hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  There...  There was a knock at the front door, and I got scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...  Okay, then.  You're alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  I found this room, and it's great!  Look at all this stuff!\"  The fox disappears back under the mattress with surprising grace and emerges with an armful of discovered \"treasures.\"  Most of it appears to be little toys you played with as a kid.  Your parents wanted to donate them to a thrift store, but you saved a box of them...  And then promptly abandoned them in this room.  She shows you a slinky, a die-cast metal car of a make you can't immediately name, a couple sock puppets of what might be a monkey and a raccoon, and a plush toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plush toy, however, wasn't from your childhood.  It was a gift from a former girlfriend, an adorable little orange fox with bright green eyes, a button nose, cute little sewn-on smile and an overstuffed belly...  Not completely unlike the orange vixen currently holding it and fawning over it.  You didn't really want to see it anymore, but it didn't seem right to just throw it away.  And now, it's back, being help up to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't he just precious?\" Tea squeals as she presses it to her chest.  In spite of yourself, you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.  You like him?\"  You'd explain to her the plush toy's significance, but...  Does it really matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmhmmm.  He's absolutely perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea's eyes light up.  \"Really?!  <i>Thankyouthankyouthankyou!</i>\"  The fox bounces up and down excitedly, wobbling her abundant curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course.  You're welcome.\"  You place a hand on her shoulder to calm her down and lead her out of the room.  Maybe you'll feel better about the toy fox now that it doesn't belong to you.  \"Well...  I'm home now.  What do you want to do?\"  The vixen thinks a moment, and says...</span></div></div>",

Standing in front of you, it's clear that she's nearly nine feet tall, but the cow-woman isn't huge in just height alone: She is, for lack of a more polite term, <i>stacked</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs is to be expected of a cow, the woman's breasts are massive, each one easily a little more than three times as large as your head, yet displaying none of the stiffness you've long come to associate with breast implants. The cow-girl's tremendous tits stick out proudly in front of her like a shelf, resting atop a fairly sizable gut and counterbalanced by thick meaty thighs, wide hips, and a round, soft ass just a little bit smaller than her immense mammaries. Really, her entire figure can be summed up as 'thick' - her quite top-heavy hourglass figure, barely contained by a set of large overalls, is nicely padded out with a not-so-insignificant layer of fat, but with forearms thicker around than your thighs, there's not a doubt in your mind that this woman is strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides her figure and height, the next thing you notice about the woman are her features. Thin brown fur covers her titanic form, and a bovine tail swishes through the air from just above her immense ass. Her legs end not in feet, but in cloven hooves, and her hands each have three thick fingers and a thumb, all tipped with blunt hoof-like nails. Her face is unmistakably bovine, but there are still quite a few distinctly human details - from her eyes to the way said eyes are positioned on her head, the smoothness of her features, and the mane of messy reddish-brown hair that tumbles down the back of her neck to between her shoulder blades from underneath her cowboy hat. A pair of horns curve upwards from underneath the edges of said hat, completing the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you gon' say somethin'?\" The woman asks playfully, her voice having a distinctive Southern twang to it; you swear that she leans down a little bit as she says that, giving you a better view of her incredibly deep cleavage. \"What's th' matter? Cat got your tongue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-oh! U-uh, hi.\" You manage to stammer out, mentally kicking yourself for such a lame opening line as you desperately try to keep your eyes locked with her yellow-green ones. \"Um, I'm [your name here], and, um, I'm here for the job opening here?\"<br>\r\nThe bovine beauty's eyes light up, and she smiles winningly. \"Oh, shoot, yeah, that's you! Lemme introduce mahself; name's Mabel, and ah run this little ol' place! Pleased to meet'cha!\" She offers one large hand to shake, which you tentatively accept. When she shakes your hand, you feel like your arm's about to be torn out of its socket.<br>\r\n\"Well, anyways, follow me, [Your name]; ah've got the paperwork out already.\" She turns and ushers you back through the door she came out of; with more than a little trepidation, you follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>15 minutes later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that looks like everything.\" Mabel says with a smile as your name on the last form. \"Consider yerself an official employee of Aurochs Acres!\" She rises from her chair (Which is much too small for her to sit in) and helps you up out of yours. \"So, big guy, like you just read in th' contract, you're not exactly here t' do anythin' specific; your job for th' day will depend on what needs doin' 'round here. If you want, ah could give you a tour of th' whole place, introduce ya to your new coworkers, or you could just get to work immediately. So, what do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

She smiles and reaches out her fur covered hand to welcome you to your new job.  \"My name is Sheena Castle and welcome to my farm.\"   You slowly snap out of your teenage lust filled dreams and start to think rationally.  \"Do you  have any questions before I show you around and give you your duties?\"  \"Just two, How much does the job pay and what time do you want me here each day?\"  She tells you you are to be here around 7AM each morning and that she understands if you are a little late due to your commute but don't abuse it.  \"As far as the pay it will start at $12 an hour on a trial bases but if I feel you are doing a good job, I'll raise it as needed.\"  You shrug your head and smile.  \"Well lets walk you around and show you the farm.\"   You quickly fall in behind her as she walks out the door.  She maybe wearing a plaid shirt and overalls but she still has a body to die for.  As you two tour your new job, you have to avoid staring at this hot vixen too much as she tries to tell you your expected job and show you where everything is at.  In between walking between the various barns  and fields, you can't help but glance at the best ass you have ever seen, even if it does have a long blonde tail sticking out from above it.  You can't help but get mesmerized by the way it swishes back and forth as she gracefully walks slightly ahead of you.  After what seems like hours you two finally end up back at the house.  She offers you a drink and you accept.  \"Ok, if you feel comfortable with everything you can start tomorrow\" she says as she smiles back at you.  \"Don't worry about remembering everything  I just showed you, I'll have Margaret my head helper work with you for the first month until you get used to everything on the farm.\"   You look at her and say \"Margaret?\"   Sheena respond with \"Oh sorry she is out getting the weekly feed supplies so I'll introduce you to her tomorrow.\"  You nod slightly and shake her hand again.  You head home with visions of the hottest female you have ever looked at running through your head.</span></div></div>",

This Heavy Neuroscape Transfer device stood up thirty feet, it's pipes pumping nutrients into the development chamber. \"Consciousness upload 23%, Body 99% stable.\" Assistant Ms. Hork said to me calmly through the intercom, watching through the tall blast windows. Trial &amp; error in the Creation process was the factor that made me waste thirty-five years making her, but the benefits may be great- this consciousness has been brewing knowledge known &amp; <i>possibly</i> unknown for thirty years, starting from a basic platform of slowly self-improving software I just slapped together one day.. A name is not needed until it works, which Im hoping finally will, she is just called 'She'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process was an interest to science, through ten layers of a blast window I could see a bright blue humanoid figure spinning &amp; being formed as if string was fusing into a organic being. Gamma radiation was let off at 7mSv now, the meters read. At my age of fifty-six I see no reason to worry of damage with my medical &amp; the rather short-term exposure, the only problems I have are a aching back sometimes sore legs, somehow.. Good medical can't cover soreness. <br>\r\n\"Consciousness upload.. 37% Body 99.5% stable, initiating organic molecular injector &amp; modifier for She.\" Hork was hawked over by our seven CEO's today, the head of their Board had not come..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..Though approval was low to give She control over her physcial body, it was ethically the best to do as to not trap that mind in a body not for it. <br>\r\nThe bright blue through the window would darken to a deep aqua, the shape of the humanoid rapidly changing. From the feet there were four arced two-inch claws, one protruding back for support as the leg arched up. Calves went on to look muscular, her thighs.. Her hips, it's a her, are wide &amp; go up to a muscular-appearing chest- She looks to be making her own genitalia, I.. Wouldn't expect less, being so eager to become organic. A <i>tail</i> was forming.. A round one, maybe becoming four feet long &amp; looking to be very smooth, them the light obscured what I could see.<br>\r\n\"Consciousness upload 62% Body.. 100% stable, MIM successful, initiating revitalization molecules.\" I stepped back from the monitor &amp; the glass as the machine whirred, usually during this part, the chamber creating She.. 01-28 exploded, making those 'Shes' fuse back into the original, a very tedious, financially &amp; emotionally stressing process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consciousness transfer 88%, RM taking effect, Body 100% stable..\" Well.. It looks like this is working! The machine seemed to burst out 14mSv as it's inside was spinning rapidly, then with a loud 'bang &amp; shuffle' noise, it's whirring began to stop, the light slowly fading. <br>\r\n\"Transfer complete....Vitals.. 222 BPM, Body temperature 105\u00b0F, to the Creation Chamber's 750\u00b0F. Heat isolation from She's form successful, height recorded being six-foot-ten.\" It worked. I don't know why She is taking such an obviously unique form, but it worked! <i>Years</i> of reassurance for She, barely making deadlines, tedious repairs &amp; basically begging the Board finally paid off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open it.

She walked with such grace and a cute wiggle. I often gawked at her, staring, until she noticed me, and that was when my relationship with her took a turn toward being better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebra worked along side of me at the city zoo, she the veterinarian, and me a lowly caretaker, cleaner, and feeder of our many beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went to lunch, sat across the table from each the other, and talked, she mostly telling of what she wanted from a relationship, if we had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened and got giddy, as just told all of my male ideals about what for me was a perfect woman, and that made her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe decided as why wait, and met that evening after work, she inviting me to her house, or more a smaller zoo in the rural countryside. After arriving to her house, she first led me to see her private zoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA barn, with corrals, pens, strong pens made horse high, bull strong, and hog tight. I met then Barney, he a mature American Bison; he was huge, but especially tame, was her pet. Deb entered the corral and Barney watching her, he meandered to her, rubbing his great head at her tummy, before a quick move as he gave a black tongue lick at her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb laughed, and said to Barney, \"Shame on you, you know better, as I have you leased from next week and for several weeks to work as a herd sire for another farm!\" Odd, I thought, as why to talk to, or explain of plans to an animal, but the news of her plans caused the big bull to gain about a six inch arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur next pet was a male Pronghorn deer, Sam stood a ways away, and acted as if unfriendly of his owner. \"He still holds bad memories of me,\" Deb said, as she tossed into the pen a quarter bale of hay for her deer to munch. \"We had our fun times of a rather personal relationship, what he recalls as dislikes was of me, oh well!\"</span></div></div>",

She took to leading me from the corral fence toward her house. I felt a bond beginning, as if she was interested in me, as much I hoped like I wanted a meaningful relationship; not just a few hot nights and a quick farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we entered her quaint early American style house, it had a covered rear porch what was almost as large as the front porch. Her house I had Googled, told of it as built in 1928, the barn the same year. Entering her house the smells of what was baking filled the air, as I stood and looked at the strange wall papering done all around on the kitchen walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maps,\" I said aloud, \"You wall papered your kitchen and eating nook with maps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, the maps were old, they came from my sailboat, I like to go sailing a lot; you knew I took two months of vacation, well I went sailing the Great Lakes. As here is much of Lake Michigan, as this wall is Lake Superior, Lake Huron here, and Lake Erie the stormy lake. I sail out the locks and tried my skills at the Atlantic ocean, but almost lost my life trying to face a Nor'easter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that fiasco, I decided to stay closer to home.\" Debra said, she telling I had a female ship captain on my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA oven timer rang and the dinner was ready. I wondered what a Veterinarian vegetarian would fix for her guest. As the 9 x 13 dish came from the oven, I knew it to be a vegetarian style Lasagna.   Cheese, Kale, Cottage cheese, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and a thick layer of Parmesan cheese mixed with Parsley, plus some dinner rolls, real butter, and to drink, what else, a glass of skim milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ate, we talked, I told her most of my past, but left out the parts where I felt I had failed to do my utmost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb told of her college years and of being an orphan, was adopted by a nice couple, who resided in Moscow, Idaho. They were retired school teachers and home schooled her, teaching her manners and how to live in society. She took her S.A.T. and entered the University of Wyoming with a four year fully paid scholarship. Her donor was a rather recluse man who resided in Montana, he being a Veterinarian as well Genetic Physicist. As Debra spent her summer seasonal break working as an understudy on projects for governments and other philanthropist types.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor as she continually referred to be her boss and financial donor, came onto her, or tried to make love to her, and when she said a polite, \"No thanks,\" he became outraged, as almost physical, but was stopped by his partner, a Professor Beaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Beaker was married and had a daughter that by what Deb said of the girl, she looked like a Playboy magazine model. The Professor lived nearby the scientific retreat, it a huge farm with some 38,000 acres surrounding the main office, the laboratory, and then seven barns,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta Beaker was a Blonde, and that Deb said was not just a hair color, but a state of mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb did not care to be near Greta, she being silly and often mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb suddenly ceased her talking about where she spent her summer vacation, and worked her way back to where she traveled. I liked to travel, and told of the many train trips I took, as much boring her with details about railroads and what happens there, until she suggested we retire to the sun porch. Her house had a three season porch what faced due west, and caught the evening rays of many glorious sunsets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb served me a tall glass of wine, as she sat near but not too close, did sip at her glass filled with a dark red wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried not to talk about where we worked, or about her duties, but Deb kept changing the subjects, stressing to suggest she liked to tinker with the experimental studies done at the Montana facility of a company Sunrise Genetic Research. S.G.R. as Deb then began to tell about, did a study using prisoner inmate volunteers. Although the volunteers came from South America, and none knew anything as how to speak or understand English. They just accepted what became their daily duties, seemingly glad to being fed, given proper clothing, and not need to worry about their getting executed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTough, rough, gruff men, most were of the very hairy type, muscular brutes, they often gawked at Deb as if thinking of evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb carried on her conversing, as obvious she was envious of her boss the Doc and she really liked Professor Beaker. As she then shed a tear and her nose became runny, she was emotional about something she had witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked about what she felt was so terrible, and she fought verbally with me, not wanting to enter the subject she seemed as upset to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Deb said, \"It was of Greta and her poking her nosy nose where she had no real understanding of the project being studied.\" Blubbering and in tears, Deb spun a story of scientific magic, dealing with Greta and her being sexually molested by one of the volunteer prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man came upon her as would a beast!\" Deb said, and she described more, as in morbid details. The man a hairy muscular brute, he was in his second month of genetic testing, when he broke through the security, saw then Greta, and like a wild beast he carried her to the hay barn where he..., they did it several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had tainted semen,\" Deb yelped, as she cried, telling that what he spent inside of Greta, worked to cause her to see physical changes, drastic, metabolic transitions, as the Doctor decided to incarcerate Greta into a secure holding cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeb became so upset, she dropped her wine glass and really became angered, but not at me, as if more infuriated by what happened to Greta, \"Poor, poor Greta...!\" As then Debra fainted, fell down over her coffee table, hitting the wooden floor with a dull thud. I rushed to be of aid, and found my date as out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoisted Debra into my arms and thought to lay her on her bed. As I bust past the door to her bedroom, turning on the room light with my elbow, I stood again as amazed. I laid Deb on her bed, tending to her as I would a person having fainted, I began to unbutton her blouse as ease the pressure on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat amazed me more as about the room, were a dozen or so framed photos of split images, to the left was the photo of a well attired man, and to the right was a photo of an animal. I continued to lessen the snugness of Deb's clothing, when I saw something that made my blood run cold...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah..., oh I fainted..., hey, what do you think you are doing?\" Debra said, as she yelped aloud when she noticed her blouse as unbuttoned and her slacks were removed, leaving her as partially exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No big trouble here, you never heard of the idea when a person faints o loosen their clothing, to help blood flow?\" I said, as my reasoning seemed to calm her, but she had another reason for disliking of her clothes as loosened. My friendly date for that evening had as a distinct part of her anatomy, a full body pelt of fur covering her from shoulders to her petite feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat keen style of underwear if I say so, as i bet you stay warm when the cold winds blow!\" I said, in as much to chide as to want for her to explain her being furry all over her body, upper arms, legs and feet. Deb had white colored fur on the front of her torso, and the nicest breasts I ever saw, covered in fur with puckered, aroused nipples being blacker than the ace of spades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs left on her, her panties covered her privates, but from her furry buttocks to along her sleek legs, Deb had a pelt of rusty brown fur. Her back and maybe other places had the same reddish brown color of fur, as noted when she sat up, I would swear I saw her panties move as if a tail had wiggled when she sat at the side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would suppose you want to hear an explanation.\" Deb said, as the tone of her voice held a sense of remorse for needing to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no need, as some cute and very lovable girls have a full body pelt of fur, as I think it would work to enhance their relationship, given time and if they become really involved as friendly.\" I said, as placating her, wanting to know, but giving her a slim reason to beg out and not tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greta, as after she was molested by that brute experiment volunteer, Professor Beaker broke to her the new that the semen spewed inside of her was tainted by the experimental serums given the man. Greta became as a person easily aroused, and she changed, her whole personality, and came onto me as might a gay nymphomaniac. I let her orally pleasure her desires, as if to calm her back to thinking rationally, but her morals slipped, and she, we traded bodily juices, to where I became infected from her wild ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI informed Professor Beaker of what had happened and he did some blood tests to check if I had the same vile disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he told me about the prisoner who had molested Greta, and of what he would with time, or during four months become, the man would changed physically, until he was a male, Pronghorn deer. When he finalized his changes, Professor Beaker then sold the Deer to a zoo, as if he were a real specimen of that breed of animal. In essence he served as a volunteering experiment subject, and lived then as would a Pronghorn herd sire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta took about the same span of four months as she changed, becoming a Pronghorn doe deer. As before she lost her ability to communicate, she requested she be sold to the same zoo, and have her mated by that horny male Pronghorn sire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor worked hard at filtering my blood clean of the Reformation Serum. I was named as from a scientific joke from biblical verses, Doctor Haun named his process, as a pun joke. I guess from what Professor Beaker did for me as to me, my being only as furry is better than what Doctor Haun wanted to do. He heard about my problem and was more than ready to inoculate me with his serums and make of me a doe Pronghorn, as sell me to the highest bidding zoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, I wear the skin and furry pelt of a Pronghorn deer. It was until tonight as my secret, and yours as well, I hope!\" Deb said, as she explained why she left her working for the Doctor, and his lucrative paying employment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had placated her to explain the how and the why she was as a furry person, but that left me wondering if she and I could be more than just friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" Debra said, she looking up at me, and my face having no special expression as to what I might be thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I have loved you since the first time we met, and wanted to be closer to you for a long while. As now this revelation, to me it does not matter, as I am in love with the person I met, knew, and felt a sense of love. You ask as of me to keep your secret, as much why should I want to humiliate the person for who I feel love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf by our mutual feelings, one for the other, that I am a help to you with coping, keeping our secret as private, gives me even more reasons to love you, as I want you to love me. Oh, and know this, that when I say love my meaning is not just that of a sexual attraction. If you would as well love me, my hope is to make our relationship as of a permanent, a lifetime form of companionship.\" I told Deb, as she listened, but did not show the sense of glee what I expected or hoped she might feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you do not know of yet, is that I must return once each year to pay a visit to Professor Beaker, and have him inject me with the anti-cell inhibitor, what works as to nullify the otherwise continuing effects of what Greta infected into me. As part of life, the Professor is getting old and in due time will retire from the research laboratory. When that happens, my supply of inhibitor will dry up, and the infection I hold within me shall grow, as go rampant, causing me to change, and become then as a Pronghorn doe deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that time will come, as I could make it happen sooner, if just by not going to get my injection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd and crazy as it mat sound to you, but something in me, as more than a wish or thought, but there lurks an urge. I hold an urge to want for becoming as is a deer. I know that if Greta had not done to me what she did and infecting me, I would never have wished, wanted to become as is an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe as humans have many forms of illnesses, and by being changed into an animal, the amount of illness or injuries increases dramatically. Animals have no idea about personal hygiene, they feel jealousy and bite hunks out of a near companion. They fight, kick, butt heads, and try in any way how to deter a foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnow this, I am not a virgin. although I did not give up being a virgin of my own will, but from Doctor Haun's son I lost my hymen. To know the Doctor is to know a man with an ego driven by the pride of his discoveries. His children have a sense of social specialty, they are rich and spoiled. Terrance and Tina are both human, but might as well be as animals, from the ways they treat others, as both are vicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrance was and is vicious enough for him to enter Laboratory 7, the House of Pain,\" the volunteers learned to call, as refer to it when someone goes there they never come out the same door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Haun was her title and name as far as I ever heard or knew. As the story goes, Terrance wanted to venture into town and see a jazz show. His mother said no, and because her son was so willful, she needed to lock him inside his bedroom for that night, lest he escape and do as he pleased. I did hear that Mrs. Haun referred to Terrance as her bullheaded son. He took that to heart and though his hatred, he took from Lab seven a vial of Reformation serum and tainted his mother's afternoon tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReformation serum is as usually given in a large dose to a volunteer or subject, causing their bodies to become infected. Those so infected get other injections every other day until their changing begins skeletal transitions. Mrs. Haun never got that far, as she noted her infection, showing her changed self to her husband, and he then, injected her with the full term dose. He could have done for her what the good Professor Beaker does for me, but that Haun family ego got in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rumor around the research farm, that Doctor Haun was so spiteful of his test subjects, that when his wife became in partial ways like a Red Angus cow, he divorced her is an easy, non-legal fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy having heard of what became from that kind and generous woman, got me later to thinking that one day I might just not go for my yearly injection and let science take its course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke of your loving me so know this, as our relationship can only go just to where we hold hands and kiss, we cannot have sex, as your entering me there would give you my infection. As well the good Professor does what he does for me as he feels apologetic, but would he do the same for you if infected, of that I do not know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sex, hmm..., to me that is part of a permanent relationship. However, and as much as your being furry and maybe someday change into the form of a Pronghorn deer, when that begins, then we shall enjoy our sexual selves, and I shall go with you!\" I said, and at that point in our relationship, Debra smiled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Gitonga, and you always wanted to live a normal life. Find a normal career, find a normal wife, settle down in a normal house and have normal children. But life never really turns out like you expect it. So when you did end up meeting Zakia, the only girl you\u2019d want as your wife, she had one trait that was the opposite of \u2018normal\u2019; she was a hyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew up in Nairobi national park, where most of the anthros in your city are content to live out their lives, free from the discrimination and drudgery of civilized society. Zakia was a little more ambitious than that, though; fascinated by the human\u2019s lifestyle, she aggressively pursued an education and moved downtown as soon as she could. Despite the fact that anthros weren\u2019t even allowed to set foot in most businesses, with her dedication, she currently has a job as a personal trainer. It wasn\u2019t much, but it let her break free from the kibera slums and move to syokimau, where the two of you first met. You\u2019ll never forget those few days together. She certainly made an impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s a\u2026 big woman, to say the least. Apparently, it\u2019s natural for female hyenas to be stronger than the males, and it showed. She naturally had the proportions of a bodybuilder; with thick, muscular arms and legs, wide, toned thighs, and perfectly sculpted abs which were visible even through her thick fur. She was even a few inches taller than you. At first, she didn\u2019t really know her own strength; as indicated by the time you had to go to the hospital after she accidentally hugged you too tightly. Since that incident, she\u2019s been exceedingly gentle with you, growing almost protective as the months drift by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was truly a one-of-a-kind sort of gal; incredibly strong, tough and independent, while also having a sensitive side. She was honest and reliable too, dedicated to a simple and happy relationship, without any mind games or passive-aggressiveness. Whenever the two of you had an argument, it was always calm and reasonable, and she always tried to see things from your point of view. Above all, she was just fun to be around, and somehow always coaxed you out of your shell and made you see life through a different lens. All these qualities made you fall in love with her, despite the fact that she was so\u2026 abnormal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, interspecies relationships were not exactly popular. You can always see people giving you and Zakia dirty or confused looks as you walked by. People seem to stereotype Zakia as an untamed beast, and you as some kind of pervert with a hyena fetish. Your parents approved least of all; your father about disowned you on the spot. You didn\u2019t really have anybody in the way of friends. Truly, you and Zakia were alone together, shunned by society, with only eachother to confide in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re a sight for sore eyes, mpenzi,\u201d</b></span> she says, stumbling through the front door with a frown on her face. You worked from home as a graphic designer, leaving Zakia to go out and deal with workplace bullshit. Like a dopey puppy dog, you were always right there at the front door whenever she came home from work, eager to ease her frustrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cBad day?\u201d</b> You ask from the kitchen as she stomps into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYou could say so,\u201d</b></span> she grumbled. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cNew manager said he was worried I might not \u2018fit in\u2019 in an office environment. Worried I might be a danger to my coworkers.\u201d</b></span> Immediately upon walking in, Zakia wasted no time taking off her uncomfortably workplace attire. Clothes combined with fur was just uncomfortable, you see, so most anthros chose to go nude if at all possible. The \u2018wild\u2019 anthros, and those in preserves, could waltz around naked as they please, but in the cities, anthros unfortunately had to wear clothes. Zakia liked to lounge around the apartment naked, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly weren\u2019t complaining. You enjoyed seeing every curve of her thick, toned hips. In comparison, her breasts were downright small, but impressively perky. You were once a little confused and turned off by her muscular, furry body\u2026 but every day, you gradually find her more and more gorgeous and unique. She crashes on the couch with a groan. <b>\u201cA danger?\u201d</b> You ask. <b>\u201cWhy would <i>you</i> be a danger?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cHell if I know. He said something about rabies\u2026\u201d</b></span> She vents loudly. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cJust because I\u2019m a hyena, that asshole thinks I should be huntin\u2019 antelopes on the serengeti or some shit. He probably wants to put a muzzle on me.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI think I know what might brighten your spirits\u2026\u201d</b> You finally emerge from the kitchen, carrying something. She smiles when you lay a tray down on the table in front of her, offering freshly-prepared pilaf and beef stew with a glass of bhang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let's out that familiar, cute little laugh of surprise and gratitude. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cOh, you\u2019re an <i>angel</i>,\u201d</b></span> she says, a big grin on her face. Your timing couldn\u2019t have been better. You settle down on the couch by the nude hyena, cuddling and watching television while she chows down. Almost immediately, she forgets all about the troubles of the day as you chat and laugh together, melting into each other's arms. With her size and musculature, she always takes charge in any of your cuddling endeavours, sometimes holding you in her arms like an oversized teddy bear. Eventually, though, you noticed her starting to get restless. <span class=\"cdorange\"><b>\u201cYou know, we should go somewhere. Like, really go somewhere. I\u2019m tired of lounging around the apartment.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m down,\u201d</b> you nod. <b>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</b></span></div></div>",
