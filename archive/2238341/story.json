        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is my first interactive so I hope it goes well. I like shrinking and giantess material but not big on getting too intimate. In this story, characters from Nickelodeon's \"The Loud House\" and \"The Casagrandes\" get shrunken down to tiny size or grow gigantic. They have micro adventures <i>anywhere</i> in the show's universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook here to see any of their designs along with the background characters:<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theloudhouse.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Females\" target=\"_blank\">https://theloudhouse.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Females</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Rules:</b></u><br>\r\n1. Shrinking males and females are allowed. Minimum Shrinking size = 1 inch<br>\r\n2. Giantess only, NO giant males. Giantess Maximum size = 5000 feet<br>\r\n3. Interaction is F/F or F/M only.<br>\r\n4. Please use proper grammar and spelling.<br>\r\n5. First choose who shrinks and then specify where they are shrunk.<br>\r\n6. Keep the giantesses unaware for the most part until stated otherwise.<br>\r\n7. Characters are indestructible and cannot die.<br>\r\n8. No one sentence chapters, unless it's an important choice.<br>\r\n9. Do not end the story too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>ALLOWED:</b></u><br>\r\n1. Stomping on shrunken characters.<br>\r\n2. Soft Vore only.<br>\r\n3. Any body entrance is fine (Mouth, Ears, or Nose).<br>\r\n4. Endosomatophilia (traveling through giantess bodies).<br>\r\n5. Unaware giantess.<br>\r\n6. In between breasts.<br>\r\n7. Hair forest (Hair on head not in private area).<br>\r\n8. Gentle Giantess.<br>\r\n9. Romance with F/M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>NOT ALLOWED:</b></u><br>\r\n1. Blood and Gore.<br>\r\n2. Scat.<br>\r\n3. Sex.<br>\r\n4. Toilet stuff.<br>\r\n5. Hard Vore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add in any other characters that aren't on the list. I will start the first one off to show you how I want it. Enjoy!</td>",
