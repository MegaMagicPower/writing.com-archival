I'm sorry I don't have so much time to be with you and take care of you, so I'm bringing you to the daycare again.'' Laen started. You nod. ''I understand, Laen. But how long are you gonna be away?'' you said trough telepathy to him. ''Well, it could be a week to a month long.'' he said. You look down, sadly. ''But hey, wouldn't it be fun too see new and maybe your old playmates again?'' he quickly tried to cheer you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. ''I guess.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready before you knew it, you and Laen were inside the Daycare. ''Miss Rose, I've come to bring an old friend.'' The old lady behind the counter looks up. ''Hey.. is that you Laen? And Rade! You guys have grown so much!'' the old lady answers. You walk up to the counter, and the lady let you in. ''I'll pay you back when I come back, Rose. I can't miss my flight now. Oh, and hey, Rade?'' You look up to Laen who puts out his fist. You look at his fist and you brofisted him, ofcourse minding your spike on your paw, because that would hurt. ''Bye, Laen..'' you looked sad. ''Bye, Rade..'' you look at Laen who walks out of the door, which he closes behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now now, Rade. Come on, let's take you to the field. He'll be back in no time, I promise!'' Old Lady Rose said. You nod and smile. Old Lady Rose, as sweet and caring as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to the huge field the daycare, all kinds of Pokemon, skipping happily around, playing with each other, some laying around like lazy cushions, and ditto's.

He is a nice guy, but is somewhat clumsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Zane, and you poke him awake. You notice the Zangoose suddenly waking up. You lean a little forward. ''Hey, buddy. Remember me? It's me, Rade!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZane fully wakes up now, and notices your presence. ''Huh.. is that really you, Rade?'' You nod, happily. ''Oh, man! It has been forever man! Come sit down.'' he says, and pulls you to the ground. You lose balance and fall onto the lap of Zane. You blush. ''Still as clumsy as ever, right?'' you grin. Zane becomes red. ''Yeah, sorry..'' you both laugh, and you start sitting next to him. ''How's things here?'' you ask him. ''Oh, the usual.. You?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you happily converse and catch up with each other, until something breaks your conversation.</span></div></div>",

He's an Machoke who's known for both being the strongest in the daycare and just really plainly being an dumbass. When he was an Machop and you were still an Riolu, he was already hitting on you. Too bad he's still too dumb too see that you're a guy and not a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Long time no see, baby. Hey, why are you with this jackass and not with me?'' He smirks and lifts you from the ground. Zane tries to stop him from grabbing you but he simply just pushes him away. When you stand on the ground he quickly grasps both your buttcheeks and hold you close to him. ''Hey.. your ass has gotten improvement too! You grow sexier by the minute, babe.'' You blush and give him a good punch on his cheeck, so he lets go of you. You take your distance. ''For the last time, I'm a GUY, not a girl, dumbass!'' you say to the Machoke. Khe doesn't look very happy. ''I'll get you.. no matter what..'' He quickly dashes forward and..</span></div></div>",

Looks like Khe dragged you here. Speaking about Khe, he was in front of you. Naked, with his butt right in front of you. He's got an great ass, though. No doubting that. You notice him flexing. You look around you, and you quietly try to stand up and find a way out of there. You notice the cave exit and tip-toe your way over there. ''Hey, now. Where do you think you're going, babe? You feel two arms firmly grabbing your middle and throwing you back into the hay. You try to get back up, but you're weak right now, so it you can't do much. Machoke quickly jumps directly ONTO you. ''Now now.. let's not be too hasty, shall we?'' He turns you around, and placed his hands onto your buttocks. Oh well, he will be dissapointed when he sees no more than one hole, though. So he'll probably leave you alone then. He then spreads your buttocks. ''Oh, so you haven't been lying. But hey, psst.. did I tell you? I like men too.'' he said. This shocked you, you thought he was straight all along! This doesn't look good. You gasp in for air for an call for help, when you notice that the Machoke firmly grasps your neck. ''Try to call for help and I will make SURE this is gonna hurt.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis looked bad. Real bad. You felt the dick of the Machoke onto one of your buttcheeks, and you notice him starting to rub it off on your buttock. </span></div></div>",

He looked furious. ''Get. Off. Rade.'' he commanded. ''Whoa, bro. We're only trying to have a good time here.'' He then walks up to Zane, trying to fuck with him. Zane quickly pushed Khe against the wall. He then quickly grabbed his throat and held it's sharp claw to it. ''Dare touch Rade again, and I swear I will slit your throat!'' Zane screamed. You noticed the Machoke starting to whimper of fear. ''S-sorry, m-man.. I-I won't.. I p-promise..'' he said, gasping for air. Zane let go of the Machoke. He then walked up to you and picked you off the ground and carried you like you were nothing. ''Are you all right, Rade?'' he asked. You blush. You hug him tightly. ''I'm kinda weak though..'' you said, quickly letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZane walked out of the cave, straight to the nearest Chansey. ''Hey.. could you heal this guy, please?'' Zane asked the Chansey. He placed you onto the ground. Chansey started slowly healing you with softboiled, and you slowly regain your health back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of healing, you start to feel better, and you try to stand up, when you notice Zane reaching out his hand. ''Stand up, Rade.'' he said, smiling at you. You blush, and take on his hand. ''Thanks for getting me out of this mess, Zane.'' you smile at him. You start thinking.. It's been some time with Zane and you now.. But something has been bothering you now..</span></div></div>",

This seems like an appropriate moment. You start to face the Chansey. ''Thank you for healing me, Chansey.'' you start bowing down, and you hold your tail up high so Zane can have a good look at your ass, and also teasing him a bit. You look behind you, and you notice him staring and blushing. You grin. He's interested all right. ''Hey, Zane.. Looking for something?'' you say while you hold a paw on one of your buttcheeks. ''W-wha? I-I.. uhm.. No.. I mean..'' he stutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking to him as attractively as possible, swaying your hips left and right. Zane started getting even more nervous. You stand in front of him now. ''Relax, Zane.. Be honest with me now.. are you in love with me?'' you say. ''Y-yeah.. s-sorry I-I never t-told you.. I a-actually a-always liked you.. you've got such an nice ass, man..'' he confesses, and starts to calm down. You smile at him. ''C'mere now!'' he says, and suddenly dashes for you, he then started kissing your lips. You're surprised, but quickly give in to the Zangoose and let him lead the kiss. After a few seconds of kissing, you hear him breathing heavily, and you were also yourself. ''H-hey.. you're a pretty good kisser, Zane..'' you say. ''T-thanks..'' he says. He starts grinning and getting horny. You feel his cock against your crotch, and you feel his paws grasping your butt tightly.</span></div></div>",

''That can be arranged.'' he says, letting go off you and quickly turning around, bowing forward and spreading his buttcheeks. You blush. ''Man.. you've got an big ass. And that's not a bad thing..'' you snicker. You slowly put your head inbetween Zane's buttocks. Zane let loose of his buttocks and trapped your head inbetween his buttocks. ''Heh, heh.. gotcha, you sneaky naughty Lucario..'' he grins. You smile. His buttocks felt pretty comfortable. Soft, warm and nice. You start to smell the smell coming out of Zane's anus though, but to your surprise, it smells pretty sweet. ''Nice ass, man.. Smells nice too.'' you say. Zane blushed. ''Thanks, Rade.. Now, let's get you out of there.'' he said, and pulled his buttcheeks aside, so you could remove your head. You backed off again, and purposely knock over Zane now. ''H-hey!'' he stutters. You began sitting on his somewhat fat belly, with your butt to his sight of vision, teasing him. ''Oh, you wanna play it like this, huh?'' he says, and bumped his belly up so you landed straight onto his face now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you left a fart onto his face. ''Oh.. s-sorry, Zane.'' you apologize. ''Sorry? This smells amazing, bro!'' he says. You suddenly felt a warm thick tongue licking your anus. You start moaning. ''Ohh, Zane.. you're a natural, aren't you?'' you ask, while you feel your cock becoming harder and harder with every lick. ''Oh, don't worry, this is just the beginning..'' he smirks. He then penetrated your anus with his wet tongue to make it wet and good for the anal later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of licking, it was time for the real deal! Zane pushed you off him. ''Hey, Rade. Let's begin gently, shall we?'' he said, presenting his cock in front of him. ''Take a seat.'' he smirks. You look at the big penis. ''Oh.. I'm not sure if that will fit, Zane..'' you say, worrying. ''Don't worry, we'll see how far it gets! You can do it.'' he smiles gently at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then started to ''take a seat'' with Zane, and let yourself sink in. ''Hng.. I.. Zane.. it's..'' you look at Zane. ''Don't worry.. you can do it.. almost there..'' he said. You then suddenly stopped, and noticed you took it all! ''Good job, Rade! Now, can I go a little rough with you now?'' he says. ''Uhm.. not too rough, Zane.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZane started to let himself fall forward, and you both got in a good position. ''I'm ready, Zane..'' you say. ''Don't worry.. We'll take this nice and easy, okay?'' he says, and slowly starts to slide his penis in and out your anus. You started moaning. Zane eventually went faster and faster. You loved every bit of the humps Zane gave, and moaned as hard as you could. You felt the throbbing cock in your anus, and, man, it felt good! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you hear Zane mumbling.. ''I.. Rade.. I'm gonna.. cum..'' he said, and you also felt like cumming at the same moment. Zane began cumming into your ass, and you felt the warm fluid traveling trough your anus and up a little, you started cumming too, and cummed right onto Zane. He started going slower, and then took his penis out of your anus, and let himself fall next to you, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh.. man.. that was.. good..'' he said. You nod, also breathing heavily. You start laying right next to him, and you hugged him. ''Thanks, Zane.. so.. does this mean we're boyfriends now?'' you ask. ''Nah, you're my girlfriend.'' he snickers. You smile. ''No denying that I'm the female in the relationship now.'' you both laughed. You started feeling sleepy.</span></div></div>",

You only got 2 tickets.. will.. Will Jenna go with you?'' you ask, hoping for him to say no. Jenna is Laen's bitchy girlfriend, to you, it feels like she could dump Laen any day for anyone else, you really hated her. ''No, she won't be coming, unfortunately. She says she's going to be busy this week, and the tickets are gonna expire soon, so, why not take you with me?'' You jump up excited, and hug your master gratefully. ''This will be so sweet!'' you say happily. Master Laen also happily embraced you, and released you again. ''All right, we're going to leave tommorow, pack your things and wake up early tommorow, okay?'' Master Laen said. ''Okay.'' you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked off. Man, it has been such a long time since you and Master Laen has spent quality time together.. You quickly pack your things and get to sleep early, since it was already pretty late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you both woke up early, and went to the airline together. After the long and usual shit-wait at the airlines, you both finally got to your airplane, and you both sit of tiredness from standing in line all day. ''Man, waiting at the airport sucks balls.. jeez..'' Laen complained. ''At least we're here, Master. Just try to relax.'' you say, as you relax yourself, letting yourself slide into the most lazy position, with both your hands on the chairsides. ''Yeah.. At least we're in.'' he said, as he was about to lay his hand on the prop you were leaning on, but didn't notice your hand there. You felt his hand on your paw, and looked to the side to your master. ''Weird, this prop feels pretty fluffy and nice compared to other flightseats.'' Laen said. ''Uh, Master.. that's my paw.'' you chuckle. ''Wh-wha?!'' he said, quickly letting go of your paw. ''S-sorry, I wasn't paying attention.'' he said, blushing. ''N-no, it's okay.. accidents happen..'' you say. You can't lie about feeling nice about this.. It was quiet for a minute, but everything soon went back to normal, and you conversed the whole flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Airplane arrives after quite some time, and you both scurried off to the hotel you booked, and checked in. You got your keys, and went to your room. You both enter the room, and you look at all the cool luxury. A bath, a menu for room service, and almost everything was covered in gold and red fabric. Even the double bed! ...wait, Double bed..? Your heart starts racing. Oh, man.. you're supposed to sleep with Master Laen in one bed? You blush.<br>\r\n''A double bed..? That's weird.. Hold up, let me ask at the infortmation booth..'' he said, as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for a few minutes, he's still not here.. that's when..</span></div></div>",
