She had the front of a magestic eagle, and the back of a ferocious lion. Her talons, sharp enough to slice through rock, cleaned so the shined in the sun. She had upon her head long orange hair that fell down upon her shoulders. With her deep amber eyes she observed her catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleeping, tucked away beneath one of her wings, was a human sleeping peacefully. Whitewing smiled, the human looked so peaceful and cute to her. Dressed darkly he would be intimidating to other humans, with his coat slightly too big for him, but she though it made the human cute. The human, like her, had orange hair, but a much darker shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing thought most humans where reasonably cute, being about one quarter her size. She hadnt approached one in over 500 years, but she suddenly got an urge to see one recently. When she saw this one, alone and sleeping, she just couldnt help herself. She was slightly ashamed of herself for kidnapping him while he slept, knowing how scared he would be when he woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasnt even sure what she was going to do with the human. If the human tried to run would she stop him and hold him here against his will, or let him go? She thought that since she had caught him, her subconcious would view him as part of her treasure, so she would not let him leave easily. She had considered eating him once or twice, but she didnt want to, she had been alone for many years and it wasnt the humans fault he was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing thought back to just hours ago, when she had plucked this human from his bed while he slept. Being careful not to wake him she had carefully walked back to her cave in a nearby tunnel system. She then had laid down upon one of her many mounds of treasure, ranging from gold and silver, to other things like shads of differnt coloured glass, or discarded mobiles, basically if it was shiny she would take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had laid the human onto her side and pinned him to her side with her wing. Keeping him there as he slept. She quickly looked back to the human when he suddenly moved...</span></div></div>",

Whitewing felt him feeling her feathers with his hands, a look of confusion spread across the humans face. He glanced around and caught sight of Whitewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing saw the look of confusion turn to one of fear. She smiled awkwardly and muttered. \"Umm... hello...hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human quickly escaped from beneath her wing, and began running towards the exit. Whitewing knew she couldnt let him go, he would probably get lost in the tunnel system without her help, and he was her possession now. She ran past him and blocked the exit, she saw the human stop and begin looking for another exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing began to walk towards the human, slowly, to intimidate him. \"Where do you think your going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human backed away. \"Wh-Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing continues to advance, closing the gap between them because she had a long stride. \"I am Whitewing, now I can either be your friend or I could be quite mean... I would prefer the first option but you seem to be against that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looks up at her scared. \"Please just dont hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing pinned the human to the floor with one of her front talons, careful not to hurt him though. he lowers her head so that she is eye to eye with the human. \"The rules here are, you belong to me, like all of the treasure here I plan to hoard you as I do so this gold and silver, since I caught you, you will either be my treasure, or prey. You will do as I say when I say and wint attempt to escape. Follow these rules and we will get along fine. Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human nods quickly, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing decides to go easy on him now, feeling she may have scared him a little much. She pulls her talon off him, when she sees he isnt moving she curls around him purring softly. \"Sorry about that, but I have to be sure you know the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human doesnt respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing giggles a little. \"Hehe i'm glad you understand the rule, but you dont need to ask to do simple things, like talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human mumbles. \"Why did you kidnap me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitewing thinks for a moment. \"I guess it was a spur of the moment kinda thing, you seeI have been alone for 500 years, and when I saw you I couldnt help myself.\" She giggles. \"Hehe you know, I am quite happy you understand the rules, and a little dissapointed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" The human asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you look cute enough to eat.\" She giggles nuzzling the human playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human smiles a little, Whitewing sees this, glad she had made him calmer. \"Now, I'm Whitewing, and you can think of me as either your new parent or guardian, or your owner, I know that seems a little unfair but thats all I'm offering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human thinks for a minute. \"Well... I'm Claz and I choose...</span></div></div>",

Didn't you had your previous family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaz then lowers his eyes and his expression changed to a depressed one. Noticing this, Nightwing quickly appologises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I shuldn't have asked. You don't need to tell me if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's okay. You didn't knew. My mother died when I had 10 years. When she died, father became enraged and started to beat me every time he got angry. Because of that, I grew to hate and distrust not only him, but everyone. Everytime somebody tried to aproach me, I avoided them, yelled at them and in some cases injured them. 2 years later, I couldn't stand it anymore so I ran away from that place and raised myself from then on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... I had no idea you had such a sad past.\", said Nightwing with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then why didn't you tried to run away or fight against me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because near you, I feel diferent. I feel safe. Like I felt when I was in mother's embrace. You're the first one I trust in all this years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. That made me really happy. I promess you. I will be the best mother you ever had. Now come here my child. It's time to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two returned to the pile of gold you where on before and Nightwing places her wins on you, and so you drift to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the moon shone above, Claz sat in the backyard of the orphanage and stared into the forest that stood across the large field of grass. He came here often, finding the forest calming, and a good distraction to his rather lonely orphan life. He sighed and looked at the gathered trees, enjoying the quiet night, but also planning to head back inside any minute now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he looked at the forest, he noticed something that made him pause, and decide to stay out a bit longer. Something big was moving amongst the trees. Something huge, the size of a building, its shape concealed in the shadows of the forest. Claz stood up quickly, but stayed rooted to the spot. He was partially scared but also partially curious about what this giant shape could be. It was at least two stories tall, but could well have been bigger. He stared at it as it came out of the trees and finally moved into the moonlight, revealing its form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared in shock at the sight of a giant walking statue made of grey stone, over three stories tall, of a young woman about his own age. The statue was able to move just like a human, but its movement appeared quite slow and methodical. This also applied to the statue's hair, which went down to the shoulders and seemed to flow and move like real hair, only slower. Claz also noticed with some embarrassment that the statue was nude, but the statue lacked any lewd details.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOne detail it did have, however, was a pair of glowing red eyes, and a big red glowing symbol on the forehead. Claz seemed to recall having heard about things like this--living statues animated by drawing those symbols on them. They were known as golems, and served their creators. At least, that's what he thought he had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem approached him, the ground shaking with each step, its red eyes focused on him. He looked up at it, terror rooting him to the spot despite having made up his mind that he preferred to run. The golem finally got within a dozen feet of him, and looked down with a blank expression at the terrified teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claz?\" a deep yet feminine voice echoed. It sounded like it was in the boy's head, and the statue did not move its--or, rather, her--lips. She seemed to be able to speak telepathically. Claz stared up at the statue, who repeated her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded slowly. Unsure of where this was going, he just stayed in place and prepared to run. The golem suddenly crouched down, resting her arms on her knees and continuing to stare blankly at the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Looking for... You,\" the telepathic voice said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaz was confused by those words, but he still wanted to run now, not caring about why this giant living statue wanted him. But despite his fear, he could not bring himself to do so. Something about this golem had paralyzed him. Even as she reached for him with a stone hand, he stood still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem's hand reached him, and her fingers curled around him. They were made of stone, and thus hard and cold, making her grasp very uncomfortable to be in. But Claz remained motionless, allowing the giant living statue to get a firm grip around him, encasing his torso and pinning his arms to his sides. The golem then slowly stood up straight again, lifting the boy towards her face as she rose. He did not squirm or struggle, despite her grasp on him being painfully tight, and he instead just stared into her glowing red eyes as she brought him within inches of her expressionless stone face. They met each other's gaze for a few seconds, then the golem lowered the boy to her midriff and turned, holding him tightly as she walked bad into the woods and into the shadows from whence she came.</span></div></div>",

Her nanny had just banned her from going out to see her friends for, from Sue's perspective, no reason. Sure there was a pandemic out there, but her friends weren't sick, so what was the big deal? Why should she have a nanny at this point anyway? She was sixteen, she could take care of herself, right? Whatever the case, she was going to have a serious discussion with her father once he returned home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue walked around the garden for a while to cool off and think. She was so lost in thought, that she didn't notice the new statue in the garden until she was right up next to it. Sue snapped out of her trance and got a good look at the new statue. It was quite large, at least thirty feet. Father had purchased a lot of large statues, but this one knocks them all out of the park in size. It was shaped as a nude woman, missing any lewd details, but still had a curvy figure and long flowing hair. It was standing straight up and looking forward, a strange pose for a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue's eyes lit up, startling Sue. Then the statue's head turned down to look at her, causing Sue to fall on her back. Before she could comprehend what she was seeing, the statue reached down and grabbed the girl around the waist. Sue screamed for only a moment before the statue covered up her mouth and took her out of the garden.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David sat on down on the ground and leaned against a large bolder. he was getting tired again and he needed to rest his leg. David was nineteen years old. He was slightly above average height for his age and wasn't the most muscular of people. Though he looked skinny, he was still physically fit and good in a sword fight. He had black hair that was thick and unruly. His eyes were blue and had a quite handsome face. He definitely did not look like a peasant. That's not to say that all peasants aren't handsome, it's just they are more likely to be filthy and covered in disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took out one of his canteens of water and drink from it. Though the water wasn't the best of shape cramped up in that canteen, it was still refreshing to David as he drank the rest of its contents. After the drink, David looked around. He was in a large forest and no longer on the path. The forest was dense and trees were very large and old. Behind him and the boulder was a large cliff with a rocky wall. David judged that he was probably getting close to the mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a terrible pain coursed through his leg and his winced in pain. David slowly and carefully rolled up his pant leg. There he saw his injured leg. The wound was long and pretty deep. The wound definitely wasn't getting any better and looked terrible. It was getting to a point that David was beginning to fear that the wound may kill him. David sighed and put the pant leg back down. There was nothing he could do about it. He knew nothing of medicine and the closest town wouldn't help him. The bounty posters for his head already arrived at that town and it was desperate men wanting money from that town which caused his injured leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled with anger as he recalled the events that had started it all. He had been a prince to a great king. The kingdom was going well. It was prosperous and bountiful. A kingdom he thought he would one day own after his father's death. When David was fifteen, the crops began to die and many unfortunate events began to occur. Many terrible and unexplainable things. One group of men who always wanted to gain control of the kingdom took this chance to accuse David's father of the events and turned his people against him. David's entire family was slaughtered with only him making it out of the castle alive. However, those men still wanted his death and put a bounty on David's head. Now David is a wander, unable to prove his and his father's innocence in order to reclaim the kingdom that was lost to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid knew his wound wouldn't heal on its own and he didn't have much time. David got up and walked through the forest once again. He heard from the town that there was something in the forest, something that they feared. The creature that they called a fox demon lived in the forest. It knew magic and at the moment, it was David's only hope for survival. David hoped that the town only called it a demon because it was scary and they didn't understand it. However, David knew he had to be ready for anything, in case the creature was as evil as the town said it was. <i>\"Hopefully, it won't be evil and will be an intelligent creature that will be willing to help me, but I've never heard of an intelligent animal that wasn't a monster,\"</i> David shivered as he thought this, <i>\"Even if it's evil and I kill it, it must have some sort of possession that will heal my leg. Otherwise, I'm doomed to die in this forest.\"</i>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid continued to walk, his leg aching with each step. He could feel the wound worsening as it tingled as the pain increased in radius. David began to sweat and his skin grew clammy. David assumed it was because of the injure, but his mouth was becoming dry and longed for water. However, the last canteen he had emptied was last last bit of water he had with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, David heard the trickling of water. David hurried in the direction, despite his protesting leg. David found himself in a clearing where there was a small river about ten feet in width. David didn't look around to see if any animals or people were there. All he cared about was getting some water down his parched throat. David hurried to the river, but he stumbled and his leg would support him any longer. David fell on his stomach and his leg became numb. David began to crawl to the river desperate for a drink. As his crawled, the edges of his vision began to fade and the blackness continued to cave in on his eyes. Before he could reach the river, he blacked out and collapsed in an unconscious state with his had about a foot away from the river.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David was slowly regaining consciousness. He couldn't sense anything as first, only blackness. But eventually, he began pulling himself out of the darkness in his mind and began to feel and sense again. He had been worried that the blackness would have been the end of him and he was dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was slowly beginning to sense his surroundings again. One of the first things he noticed was that he was lying on his back. Either his unconscious body turned over itself, or something turned his body over. Thinking that it was impossible to turn over when one is out cold, David began realizing that the possibility of someone turning him over was more possible. This worried David, because he began to fear that he was no longer alone. Even if there was a possibility that the person could help him, he still feared what the person might do. Ever since his family was killed and a bounty had been put on his head, David hadn't lived in a trustworthy world. He hadn't been able to trust anyone ever since those two events occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen David felt something nudging his side, it confirmed that he was no longer alone. He just didn't know if it was more of a bad thing or a good thing to be alone with someone in such a weak state. The nudges weren't constant, but they were in constant intervals. It seemed like the person was trying to wake David up and trying to do this while nudging his side. He wondered if this was the contact that was slowly waking him up from the black out. Strange, the object that was nudging him did not feel like a hand at all. It was way too large to be a hand and too oddly shaped. It almost felt like he was being nudged by width of a sword, though it was much too large to be a sword either. It was more like the width of a crate or larger. By the shape of the surface that was nudging him, it was long and rounded out like a cylinder shape, or so David believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could no longer just stay lying on the ground. He had to confront this person and figure out what was happening. David began to try and sit up, but before he could get his head a few inches off the ground, he began to feel his world spin as he got dizzy. His eyes were closed, so he could not see the dizzy world, but his body felt it. David groaned as he put his head back down on the grassy ground. He didn't want to be in such a weak state. He wouldn't be able to use his sword and wouldn't be able to defend himself if the person he was with should decide to kill him. He was defenseless and at the person's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're awake. I've been trying to wake you for a long time, but you didn't respond,\" a female voice informed David, \"You look like you're badly hurt and in no condition to try and even sit up yet.\" The female's voice was actually filled with concern and kindness. It sounded as if there was absolutely no evil intentions. It was the first time in four years that he heard a voice that actually seemed to care about his well being. The nurturing in the female's voice reminded David of his mother. However, he knew this being wasn't being motherly. It was more like she had found an injured person and couldn't bring herself just to leave him for dead. This was a good thing though. At least there was a higher chance that the person would be willing to help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one very strange thing about the woman's voice however. It sounded like it was a girl about his own age. However, the voice seemed much louder than it normally should be. She sounded like she was talking at a normal tone, but it seemed so much louder than a normal tone. Plus her voice sounded deep, yet still sounded like it was a normal young woman's voice. David wondered if this meant there was something strange about the girl or that his eyes were impaired and not working right because of his weakened state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what's h-happening to me?\" David just barely managed to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're burning up and you seem very sick. Do you know what could have caused this?\" the female questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... intend... to help me?\" David asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just let someone die when I can do something to stop it,\" the female explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... know who I... am?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know who you are. I know little of what goes on outside this forest. Why? Should I know you?\" the female asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn't know who David was. David knew that he shouldn't risk telling her who he was. He feared that she might let him die if she knew he had a bounty on his head. He knew that he couldn't tell her. At least, not until he knew he could trust her or he had the strength to fend her off. \"I was stabbed in the leg,\" David decided to avoid her question by answering her first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt both pant legs crawl up his legs, but felt no hand forcing them up. He knew the person was examining his wounded leg, but she said nothing as she examined it. Then she told him, \"You were poisoned by Basilisk venom. You're lucky you've survived this long. Your attackers must have ended up using the venom of a very young basilisk. Otherwise, you would have died in seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explained why the town had been so shocked to see David survive the stab and escape. \"Can you heal me?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a high enough level of healing magic to destroy the poison. However, I think I can use my telekinesis to pull the poison out of your body,\" the female stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleka what?\" David questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can move things with my mind. I think I can do this with the poison,\" the female informed David, \"The poison's already in your veins slowly crawling to your heart. Your veins are the tubes in your body that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carry my blood... I know,\" David finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have an education. You mustn't be a commoner than. Are you of nobility?\" the female questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be,\" David answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to try getting the poison out now. It might hurt though. The poison will be going against the blood current,\" the female informed David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no \"might hurt\" about it. David soon found himself in more pain than he had ever been in before. He could feel the poison as it pushed against his blood and through the small veins under his skin. David clenched his eyes and teeth as he breathed heavily in pain. It felt like an eternity of pain, but eventually, the poison reached his leg and escaped out of the wound. David's muscles collapsed and he let out a long sigh of relief. The wound on David's leg suddenly healed up and he felt much better. Though, his strength was still weakened, but nothing a long rest could heal up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are healed, but you need to rest to get your strength back. I will take you back to your home. I will carry you with my telekinesis,\" the female informed David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt himself lifted in the air. He could feel nothing beneath him, but his body was supported as if there was a glass surface beneath him he could not feel. The female kept him in a lying position and it felt as though he was being carried in a stretcher. It was the strangest sensation he every felt. He was on nothing at all, yet lying in a firm position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid began drifting to sleep. The slight breeze of his body moving forward through the air with the person who found him was making him sleepy. David didn't want to fall asleep, though. He had been in a world full of people he couldn't trust for many years. He still wasn't ready to trust someone with his life, even if this young woman didn't know who he was and was willing to heal him just because he was in trouble. He wanted to keep conscious and make sure he'd be safe with this mysterious woman, but he couldn't keep awake. He was too tired and needed the rest to replenish his energy. He lost consciousness once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he end up waking up to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David once more began to regain consciousness. He continued to keep his eyes closed as he tried to use his other senses. For one, he realized he was no longer in the air and he was on something solid. He wasn't in a full lying position though. Instead, he was sitting with his back and head resting against something. His butt and legs felt that they were on a hard and rocky ground while his back and head rested on something more comfortable. The surface he was on was firm yet soft and comfortable. Warmth also radiated from the surface, warming his entire body. The strange surface was also covered in something. David brushed his hand against the surface behind him and it felt like very soft and thick fur just as soft as the fur coats his mother used to wear. He began to wonder if he was on some sort of bed made out of furs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to hear anything, but very little was making noises. He was definitely not in the open forest anymore otherwise he would have heard birds or some sort of animal at the least. The air smelled and tasted funny as he breathed it in. He wondered where he could possibly be. Eventually he began detecting another sound. It sounded like deep breathing, the type of breathing a person does when they're deep in sleep. At first, David thought it was he own breathing, but soon realized it was the sound of a different set of breathing. <i>\"It must just be the girl that saved me,\"</i> David told himself, <i>\"Now, let's see where I am.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid opened his eyes but only saw darkness surrounding him. David was confused and wondered why everything was dark. <i>\"Was I blinded?\"</i> David wondered. He lifted his hand to his eyes and could see the outline of his hand. <i>\"No, it's just very dark in here,\"</i> David concluded. David recalled all the facts he had compiled as he had woke up. The ground was rocky, there were virtually no sounds, the air seemed funny, and the place was pitch black. <i>\"I'm in a cave, but what am I doing here? The girl said she was bringing me to her home. Does she live in a cave? or did something happen while I was asleep. What's going on?\"</i> David questioned in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, David noticed something very strange. He hadn't noticed it before because he was too focused on trying to figure out where he was, but now it seemed obvious to him. The surface he was leaning against was moving! The fur covered surface he leaned against pushed him and then pulled inwards in a rhythmic pattern. It seemed like it was expanding and deflating in a pattern. In the same pattern as the breathing David was hearing. <i>\"This isn't some strange bed of furs. It's a giant creature that's sleeping and still alive!\"</i> David realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quickly rose to his feet and turned to face what he was lying on. It was still very hard to see anything, but he saw some of the creature's outline. It was also a little easier since its fur seemed to be pure white. David wondered what the creature was and where the girl had gone. <i>\"Did this creature come across us, eat the girl, and then bring my here to save me for another meal?\"</i> David asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took out his sword and held the hilt with two hands. David then proceeded to back away from the large creature. David walked carefully, not wanting to wake the creature. However, he made a mistake. He thought the creature was lying down on its stomach in a straight line, but in truth, the creature was curled up in a C-like shape. David ended up tripping over the creature's muzzle as he backed away. When his foot kicked the muzzle, the creature woke up with a startle. The creature quickly whimpered and quickly shot its head upward, just as David was falling over it. The muzzle hit David as it lifted and David's body flipped in the air and his front side hit the ground. As he tried to recover from the daze, he realized that he had lost his sword in the commotion. David continued to lie on the ground as his eyes darted around in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the darkness disintegrated as light filled the entire cave room. David had to close his eyes from the sudden brightness. However, once his eyes were ready, he opened them and finally saw what the creature was. The creature was a very large creature, and was about forty-five feet tall from the ground up to the top of its ears on all fours. It looked exactly like a fox. Except it was a giant and had three tails instead of one. The giant fox creature's fur was pure white. This was the creature living in the forest that the town's people called a demonic fox. Though, it didn't look demonic in any way. They probably called it a demon only because it was very large and they didn't understand it. David hadn't even heard of such a creature as this one. The giant fox sat like a dog would sit and it had one of its front paws on its muzzle and rubbing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the creature was distracted, David found his sword and picked it up. David soon had himself in a readied fighting position in case the giant fox creature should attack. \"Stay back beast,\" David demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox creature stopped rubbing its muzzle and looked down at David. The fox creature looked a little puzzled and saddened. To David's utter amazement, the fox's muzzle opened and said, \"Is that how you humans thank your host?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was so shocked and surprised that he had nearly dropped his sword when he heard the fox talk in a female voice. \"H-Host?\" David questioned too shocked to think of anything else to ask at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am the one who brought you here after all, and kept you here till you were healed,\" the fox replied, \"I see that you've recovered quite well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid recognized the voice to be the voice of the girl, or what he had thought was a girl. \"You're... you're the one that healed me?\" David questioned in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was the one who took out the poison and healed your leg. If I knew I was going to be hit after doing so, I wouldn't have,\" the fox creature replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was shocked that such a creature saved his life. This was a very large and possibly very powerful magic user. It is also a fox and probably still had animal instincts as well as its sentient nature. It was a creature that could be seen as a monster with just one look. Why would something save someone like David? Such a large animal seemed like it would only see humans as a meal and nothing more. Yet, this one saved his life. \"Why did you save me?\" David questioned, not lowing his sword of guard down one moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you. I just couldn't let to die. You needed help and I was the only one that could help you. Is it so hard to believe I'd have felt too much guilt if I left you and let you die?\" the giant fox replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're\u2026 you're\u2026\" David argued, trying to find the right way to describe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A monster?\" the fox finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say that you're not the same species as me,\" David informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still a way of calling me a monster,\" the fox creature stated, \"Why should it matter if we're different species. We are both sentient and intelligent beings. That makes our minds more alike than you realize. It would be murder to let another sentient being die when one can do something to stop it. Because you are a sentient being and you were in trouble, I had to do my best to help. I would never harm a sentient being unless I had reason to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had never thought about that before. It did seem wrong to harm another creature that could think the same way a human did. Maybe the fox creature saw all sentient beings as equals and just couldn't let David die. However, David was still having a little trouble trusting the fox creature and kept in a fighting stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you still don\u2019t trust me. It's understandable,\" the fox creature sighed, \"Must humans see my species as monsters. It doesn't help that we're so large of creatures. If it helps, I can make myself smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can shrink yourself?\" David questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I usually make myself the size of a normal fox when confronting humans so they don't fear me, but I was normal size for you so that you could rest against me,\" the fox creature answered, \"I can do a great number of other things with altering my body. I can make myself my normal fox-like self; I can turn myself into a human or anything in between human and fox. I tend to stay as a fox of half way between a fox and a human. Becoming human is just a disguise, a mask. I want people to like me for who I am, not what I can turn into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you? I've never heard of such a creature as you,\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox creature answered, \"I'm not surprise. Not many of my species travel this far from our homeland in the East. You humans call us kitsunes, but I do have a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Kiko. What about yours?\" Kiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" David answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiko lied down on her stomach and placed her head on the ground. \"Do you still have troubles trusting me?\" Kiko questioned, \"Have I not proven to you yet that I'm not a monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid thought carefully. The kitsune had not done any harm to him yet and did nothing to him while he was resting and vulnerable. In fact, the kitsune had healed him and brought him to her cave so that he could rest and heal. She seemed sincere when she said that she helped because she couldn't just let him die. David put his sword away, but didn\u2019t relax too much, in case it was a trick. Even when there was so much reasoning to trust a person, David still had trust issues. He had been alone for the last few years with no one to rely on but himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m sorry,\" David apologized, \"I have troubles trusting people, even my own kind. You have healed me and been a good host to me, caring for my needs. I thank you for that.\" David took a few steps forward and bowed a little. \"Is there something I can do to repay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could stay with me for a while longer,\" Kiko suggested, \"There are no more of my kind in this forest and the only sentient beings around these parts are humans. Unfortunately, humans think I'm a monster and attack or run away from me. It gets pretty lonely out here.\" Kiko's expression became blank as if in a deep trance. \"Very lonely,\" she muttered as she thought about the lonely life in the forest without any friends or anyone to talk to.</span></div></div>",
