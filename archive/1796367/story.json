Unrolling it on the table in front of you, you smooth out the edges with your fingers. Your colleagues look at you skeptically as it curls up again, so you grab a nearby phone book and slam it onto the sheet of paper's corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, so this is the living room,\" you explain, pointing to the largest room on the blueprint. It's quite empty, with only a table, a sofa, and a television as furniture. It was sparse enough that you wouldn't have to worry about bumping into anything and waking anyone.<br>\r\n\"We'll be entering into here via the window, because the scientist's bedroom is on the opposite side of the house. Therefore it will be more likely that she won't hear us,\" you explain, gauging the reactions of the room with a furtive glance at your fellow criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Max,\" someone suddenly cuts in, \"wouldn't she have some kind of alarm system?\"<br>\r\nYou don't like being interrupted, but now is not the time to be stressed, so you brush it off. <br>\r\n\"I was getting to that part,\" you reply in a mildly annoyed tone. \"As I was saying, that's where you come in, Luis,\" you tell the person sitting opposite you. \"The house doesn't have a very complex alarm system, so all you'll have to do is open a hatch about 15 meters from the house and cut a few wires. That will prevent the scientist from--\"<br>\r\n\"Julie,\" the man cuts in again. \"Her name is Julie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God-damnit, will you shut up for just one second!?\" you yell, slamming your fist down on the desk. The man's coffee mug rattles and he shoots you a look of disdain, which is followed by a brief silence. Paul had never been the most patient of people. In fact, the only reason you kept him on the team was because he was a very proficient in stealth burglary, not having been caught once. <br>\r\n\"Jeez, I'm sorry,\" you apologize after getting unpleasant looks from the other two. \"Look, we need to be very careful with this whole operation. I'm not sure what this formula does, but I'v heard it has the ability to shrink people. The discovery of the century, right? So we need to get our hands on it before this woman... I mean, Julie, puts it to use. So I don't mean anything by it if I'm behaving too tensely...\" you trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not even too sure of the operation yourself. There are four in your group, including yourself. There's Luis, a relaxed and chilled out guy, who is known for his expertise when it comes to disarming alarm systems. Unfortunately he's deaf out of his left ear, which is why he is rarely involved in directly robbing places. Then there's Paul, the new guy. He's very young and enthusiastic, but doesn't know when to shut his mouth. The next guy is Chris, who is the tactical brains of the group. Nobody dislikes him, although sometimes it's hard to understand his speech through his thick New York accent. It was an eclectic group, to be sure, but that had its pros and cons, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, there's you. Max McDaniel, also known as \"the tech guy\" by the other group members. Your job is usually to get the blueprints for the target building and figure out how the security systems work. Together the four of you make a good team, but this is simply huge. One screw-up could mean lifetime in jail, or possibly even worse. Not much is known about the corporation behind the creation of the mysterious formula, except they seem to have some kind of sinister hold over the government that gives them access to every legal avenue in existence. This made your work hold very high stakes, but this was desperation. Each and every man involved needed this to succeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>The whole world has flipped upside down</i>, Max mused mentally as his foggy vision began to clear. The events leading up to this moment had become extremely muddled in his brain. It might have been repression or just a side effect, but he did recall a few things. The burglary had been going without a hitch until they actually got their hands on the serum. That was when everything had gone to hell. The whole group had been shocked, and in the disarray their plan had fallen to pieces. Max wasn't sure if the serum was merely unstable, or if it had been some sort of built-in defense against robbery, but he did know the obvious... it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer enormity of everything around him shook Max to the core. He'd always thought of shrinking as existing in fantasy or sci-fi. Movie magic and all of that. Hell, he'd never even considered how it might be to actually experience it until now. Looking around at the gigantic living quarters, he know had a deep respect and fear for the power he'd tried to harness for his own ends. Even so, he could only imagine what the Corporation intended to use their newly developed serum for. It couldn't be good. But now was not the time to dwell on that. He was in terrible danger, and something else had just dawned on him... he didn't know where the other three members of the team were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax decided to take a look around and to establish a base. If anything went wrong, he could just retreat and hide out there. Also, along the way he'd look for his allies. they couldn't be far, could they? He figured he'd trek toward the imposing artifice closest to him -- the living room couch. Although there was no trouble in sight, Max knew that at the size he calculated himself to be (approximately one half of an inch), he was no match for the resident of the house: Julie. A shiver ran up his spine as he thought of that. He'd taken quite a risk in taking this job, but there was still hope of escape if he could just gather his wits and survive.</span></div></div>",

Finally her work would be able to help people. She had been hired to create a serum with the ability to shrink people and organic tissue, and it offered so many possibilities in the medicinal world. Tumours would no longer be an issue, simply being shrunk by the direct injection of the chemical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully hung her lab coat onto a hanger, pulled off her suit and threw it into the bin labelled \"Used\". She then exited the lab, and headed to the nearest bathroom for a shower. She switched on her stereo as she did so, turning it up to block out the sounds of the highway outside. The relaxing sounds of Aphex Twin embraced her as she pulled off her clothes and stepped under the spray from the shower. Once she was thouroughly washed and dried, she pulled on a pair of jeans and a white t-shirt, slipped her feet into a pair of white converse and headed into the living room to see if there were any good movies on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie made a detour to the kitchen to grab some chips, a spicy dip and a bottle of wine. <i>I can't wait to finally just curl up on the couch and watch a movie,</i> she thought to herself. <i>This is the first night in months that I don't have more calculations to be fretting over!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waltzed into the living room, placed the chips and the bottle of wine onto the table, switched on the television and sat down onto the sofa.

The ideaof an earthquake was the first thing that popped into his head, but he realized the foolishness of that thought. It had to have been the resident of the house approaching. Max never could've fathomed how much tremorous noise a person's footfalls would make as he perceived them. He knew this would be one of the most difficult things to cope with at his diminutive size. But there was about to be an even bigger suprise -- no pun intended, seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mind behind the serum herself now strolled into the living room. She was like a towering collosus: nothing like he'd have expected from her file that gave her height as 5'4\". But at Max's current size, that was more than immense. Julie, the scientist they had desperately been trying to avoid before, was now even more of a threat. He deafening footfalls rose in decibels as she drew closer to Max, and he scuttled away like a cockroach after the light is turned on. Taking refuge behind the sofa leg, he heard the woman take a seat on her couch, her shining bare feet filling his view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the television going on startled Max as well as he soaked all of this chaos in. From his worm's eye view, he could just barely see a bottle of what appeared to be Julie's wine being set down, along with a bowl of something. He was simply too low in vantage to make out what it was. As much as Max regretted coming to terms with it, he would have to reveal himself if he nurtured any hope of returning to normal size. Maybe he could figure something out after that, assuming he succeeded in contacting her and she helped him. It was a tangled mess of What Ifs.</span></div></div>",

The truth of the matter was Max didn't have the means to find them at this point. He needed Julie's help, even if she had initially been an enemy in his view. He needed friends in, er, high places. Cycling through the options in his head, Max looked around at the cards he'd been dealt. There was the table, where he could hopefully get some sustenance or the scientist's attention, and there was also the floor route, where Julie's discarded Converse had fallen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was more than a little intimidated by the massive pair of bare feet that lay before him, but he had to swallow his fear if he was to accomplish anything. After all, they were just feet, right? True, they had the tremendous crushing power to reduce him to a bloody smear, but at least they weren't moving, or worse, descending. He could just use them as a baselift, and once he felt secure he could attempt signaling Julie. there was really nothing to it as long as he didn't allow his apprehension to grapple for the best of him. Max inhaled deeply and hesitantly trudged toward the white monolith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wasn't sure why way would be the best to approach this, but it seemed like the same idea as trying to climb a ramp. He wouldn't climb from the side, just like a foot, he'd go for the lowest point. In this case, it was the toes. Circling around from the heel to in front of the toes, Max felt smaller than he'd ever been. He wasn't even as tall as some of Julie's toes. Even so, he tried to block these thoughts, as they would only detract from his mission. Gripping one toe in order to hoist himself up, Max hoped he wasn't disturbing her too much, since now would not be a good time for her to move.</span></div></div>",

She loved the tarantino movies and never missed a single one if she was free. As the music built in a crescendo and the openings credits ended, she moved forwards to the edge of her seat, rolling onto the ball of her feet. Reaching for her wine, she poured a generous amount into her glass and took a long sip, washing it around her mouth. She had a \"cheap\" taste in wine, preferring the aromas and sensual tastes of a 7$ bottle to a 40$ one. Hohever she wouldn't stoop as low as to buy cartons of wine. There are some things that a scientist simply should not do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen, Samuel L. Jackson continued to talk with his partner about giving his boss a foot massage.

Just as Max had triumphantly reached the top of Julie's foot, feeling like he had just conquered more than a fear, the Pulp Fiction theme began to play on TV. Although he had noticed the scientist easing slightly out of her chair in over to reach her wine, but he hadn't expected her foot to move along with that action. Unprepared for the sudden shift, Max felt gravity, no longer an ally, tug at him and send him toppling downward. His back scraped against one of Julie's toenails as he fell, causing a searing pain to travel through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was then sent sprawling down a few inches to the rug floor again. At least the landing wasn't as bad. Just a matter of inches, the fall was like dropping 20 feet. If it had been something other than a fuzzy rug to break his fall, it wouldn't have been nearly as pretty for Max. His mind was boggled out how such an absent-minded movement could tear up his world. He was jarred from those thoughts, however, as he saw an even greater peril descending on him as his surroundings grew dark \u2014 Julie's bare sole was coming back down! In desperation, Max started to roll across the rug, but was hopelessly tangled in its fibers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the futility in trying to get away now, as the foot was just a couple seconds from enveloping him in its eclipsing terror, Max instinctly lifted up his arms as if to hold back the onslaught of pale skin. Once he felt the firm yet malleable skin, however, he knew this would do him no good. Unexpectedly, he was pressed into the carpet a bit more as the foot settled on him, but he didn't not feeling an extraordinary amount of pain. Her sole was only lightly resting on him at the moment, seeing as he was in the arch of the foot. Fortune must have been smiling on Max indeed.</span></div></div>",

She sighed in relief as she felt the weight and pressure of the project being lifted from her shoulders. Focusing on one of the tenser moments of the film, Julie blocked out the world, immersing herself in the movie. She followed Jackson's \"Righteous Man\" speech, speaking the words as he did, following each movement, analyzing the scene.<br>\r\nShe was vaguely aware of a slight tickle underneath her sole. She ignored it at first, but it grew into a monumentous itch which she was unable to bear. Raising her foot from the floor, she lowered her hand, vigorously scratching at her foot with her nails, kneading her sole with her fingers and thumb. Finally relieving the itch, she curled her legs up underneath her, sitting on her feet to warm them up. Her feet were often cold due to bad circulation, and she often got itchy or numb feet, so she paid little notice to it.</span></div></div>",

Her glossly toenails showed you your own reflection as they hovered over you, trying to eradicate \"the itch\" their master felt. In a breathless scream, you assume that this will be the end.

You hadn't been able to make it very far, unfortunately, and you are swept up by the motion of Julie's ring finger, caught on the underside of the gigantic hand's knuckle. You're nearly immobilized by the display as she pulls her feet up and tucks them in snugly beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now lay winded on the couch cushion before her. Splayed on your back, you have an even better view than ever before of the titaness. Her toes are poking out from under her, and as she brought her hands back to her side you had been dropped casually to the sofa seat.

He was, of course, powerless againt the onslaught of weight and power, and he felt himself cave. Blaring signals of pain reached Max's brain, and he desperately writhed beneath the bare foot. His mind was reeling, but all he could think of was retaliation. At some points it seemed as if he could squeeze out... but then came the patting. Julie pressed down firmly, giving it an extra oomph that finally broke Max's fragile body. Now he could feel a warm, tingling sensation as blood oozed from his stomach and lower torso, which were now nothing more than a smear beneath the woman. Crying out in breathless agony, Max crumpled beneath the unwitting executioner, his mission at last complete.</span></div></div>",

Hell, he even spearheaded the damn operation. He had a gift for seeing things at a logical level, even though these were less than logical circumstances, to put it mildly. He observed the layout of his surroundings, looking for what could be the easiest and least risky alternative to act on. Going to the feet of the scientist was a no-go for sure. What would she do if she found him there, crawling like some groveling insect at her feet? Crush him without a second thought, that's what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. If he had to do this on his own, he knew just the thing. Max approached the table leg that was right beside his position on the couch. He stealhtily trekked over to it, surmising that it must be one of those stand up TV-dinner tables that a lot of people had in their houses. That meant there was a relatively thin wooden leg he could climb -- the one he now stood at the base of. Perfectly suited for climbing, seeing as it had ornamental grooves all the way up the height of it. Smiling at his luck, Max tested the lowest groove, finding it to be somewhat easy to climb onto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, he had mastered the scaling. It was simple. Just foot-hand, foot-hand. Sure beat attempting suicide at the feet of that colossal woman. He knew they were easily-scared creatures, women. Probably would just shriek and stamp him out if he didn't approach her at eye level. From there, she could hopefully recognize him well enough to see that he was human, and not some household pest. With the tabletop now finally upon him, Max hoisted himself up and looked around, wondering which point he should try to attract Julie's attention from, rationally of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was key information, seeing as he wanted to be found as soon as possible. Even though the bowl itself seemed like an imposing structure in its own right, there was no way he was going to just wait here like a sitting duck and not take the initiative. Striding over to the bowl, Max found the surface of the tabletop to be surprisingly rough for what appeared to be a smooth surface at normal vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his new size, Max could now see every imperfection in the wood that he'd never have noticed before. But that was nothing of importance compared to his mission. The bowl was of course curved, being smallest at the bottom. This made it difficult to scale. Fortunately, all of Max's gear had shrunk with him, so he was not helpless in the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had used a grappling hook to enter the house in the first place, and had kept it on him post-shrinking for just such an opportunity. He hadn't found any practical use for it on the way up the table, so now seemed like as good a time as any. After giving it a few complete swings for good measure, Max hooked the bowl's ridge on his second try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugging at the strong cord, Max validated its security. Now all he had to do was push his way up using his legs, and he'd be homefree. However, his eyebrows furrowed as Max realized that he could spot Julie moving in his peripheral vision. It was now or never, though. If he were to abort now, she might mistake him for a crawling bug or something -- putting him in a very dangerous position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to reach the top and wave at her or something. Do something distinctly human, before his chance was lost for good. Suddenly, pon reaching the bowl's ridge, Max's hasty climbing made him lose his footing. Crying out in a probably inaudible voice, Max lost his grip on the hook as it tumbled into the bowl with him, landing a good distance away. Landing on a chip, Max felt his whole body shake upon hitting the ridged surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It couldn't have been more than thirty seconds that passed before he saw the sum of his fear... Julie's titanic hand hovering over the bowl. At his size, he couldn't help but imagine these body parts as entities of their own, only remotely controlled by the scientist herself. Of course this wasn't true, but it was how he rationalized his awful luck. He scrambled backward, only causing his chip to tilt at a more severe angle. The shadow eclipsed all light above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was grabbed within a few more desperates seconds of retreat. He was pinched between a chip and the ball of Julie's palm. Although it immobilized him for the meantime, it wasn't excruciating or anything. Max almost had the thought that he should count his blessings, before he realized that the worst was yet to come. The chip was being lifted to her mouth -- of course! How had he been blind to this before! This whole idea had been madness. It was a mechanical movement for Julie; just moving her hand to her mouth. It was a hundred times worse than a roller coaster inching its way to a terrifying apex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding his own struggling to be useless, Max realized how fatally close he was to the mouth. There was no way of telling how much time he had, but he knew he had to resist this fate somehow. Rolling around did little, as he was literally in a pinch, but allowing gravity to take control seemed to help. Wherever gravity made him lean, he leaned as much as he could that way. He didn't have a choice of where he'd go, and Max was less than enthusiastic about the height from which he was falling, but anything was better than what looked like certain death in the mouth of Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gravity was on his side, but it threated to carry him off of the palm to an unknown fate below. He had already decided he was willing to risk it. When he felt gravity's tug, he shuffled forward with all of his might and felt the familiar tug of gravity on him. He'd come free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Max felt the awkward sensation of skydiving without a parachute. He'd gone skydiving twice before. He'd felt the rush of the wind against his face and body, but always with the reassuring feeling that he knew where and how hard he was to land. This was nothing like that experience. He was blinded, due to the wind caused by his speedy descent had forced his eyelids closed. He did nothing but swerve around in the air as much as was possible. With his light weight it was somewhat effective, but he couldn't even place a spot to land without being able to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax met the \"ground\" with a thud. It wasn't even loud to his ears, so it must not've been to Julie. Able to focus and see again, Max looked at his new environment, jaw agape. He had fallen in both the best and the worst place he could've imagined. Max had fallen directly onto the top of Julie's cleavage, his back now resting against her bra. It was the best because it gave the most cushioned landing for his plummet, but the worst because if she found him here it would look really bad. Really bad.

He couldn't decide if that was a pro or a con at this point, but he did know how desperate he was to get her to notice him. The chances of him being recognized as a person could either be lower or higher when the scientist woman was drunk... her mind might be a little more open to farfetched things if she was drunk, but she might also be a little more \"clumsy\" with him, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the shifting of those enormous chips had stopped.

The bowl's texture wasn't perfectly smooth, which made for plenty of places for him to hang onto as he descended. It was incredible how many minute details he had never noticed on bowls like these. With Julie still passed out, his transit from the bowl to her lap went undisturbed saved for her steady breathing rocking the bowl just a little at a consistent rate. His mind returned to the loss of his grappling tool, which would probably end up being eaten or something, but he had to let it go. He just knew that he'd probably need it again, judging by the bizarre events of today alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a textbook scenario of \"out of the frying pan and into the fire.\" Max was violently thrown from the peaceful monotony of his downward climb into terror and panic as Julie was jolted awake by a louder-than-usual part of the movie. Even in her tipsy state the woman had the reflexes of a cat. He felt the bowl of chips began to slide forward as a result of her rude awakening, but she instinctively reached out to catch it before it could tumble down to the carpet and take Max with it. He wasn't left unscathed by this motion, however, and it wasn't more than a few seconds before gravity came knocking at his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out of a scream of panic that was probably inaudible as he was torn from the side of the bowl into thin air. Max's eyes darted back and forth as he took in the pandemonium occurring around amidst his free fall. From Julie leaning over him and she pulled the bowl back towards her, to various chips spilling onto her lap and stomach, it was a lot to take in. He was pretty much certain by this point was going to die, and it was all this drunk bitch's fault. With his arms and legs flailing and whipping around him, the awkward fall took him into an ungraceful landing on a surprisingly soft surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he was out cold. The shock of his terrifying fall, not the sudden impact had knocked him unconscious, believe it it or not. When he awoke from the ordeal a few minutes later, though, that was when the true shock came. Through the haze of a newfound migraine and aching limbs, Max looked up to find that his plummet had taken him to possible salvation. He was on Julie's stomach. The pink, squishy terrain of her tummy rose and fell slightly with her breathing, bringing about the sensation of being on a trampoline bouncing from other jumpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy hell, her knockers are fucking mountains,\" Max muttered to himself as he looked up at the enormous woman he'd have to seek help from.</span></div></div>",

If she was just relieving herself it could be just a few minutes, but if she was showering or doing something with her hair, he might have a lot more time on his hands. This is what made emerging from beneath the couch such a gamble. Max had no idea how long it would take to cover even the six foot distance from his current position and the bathroom. On the bright side, he'd left the rug jungle behind him, so it was a straight shot of short carpet all the way to his potential destination. The tiny man wasn't even sure why he was accepting the insanity of following this beautifully behemoth woman in the first place, but there really didn't seem to be any other way for him to survive on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the ground wasn't going to cover itself. Max took a deep breath and charged out from his couch awning, entering the harsher light of the living room's radiant lighting. It was unclear what sort of time window he had, and the idea of being a sitting duck in the event that Julie decided to leave the bathroom before he made it was a thought he wouldn't prefer to dwell on. His gaze caught on the discarded shoes Julie had left behind, and he shuddered. Ending up a runny reddish paste beneath an unsuspecting foot was out of the question as far as he was concerned. Luckily, his mind found a new distraction in the sheer enormity of the bathroom doorway, open just a crack like some Olympian gate left ajar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax had managed to keep a steady pace the whole time, and was surprised to find that the gap between himself and the bathroom had narrowed so rapidly that he was already here. Cautiously approaching the entrance, Max noted that he'd been travelling for at least five minutes, so Julie was probably going to be a while. That took a lot of the pressure off, seeing as now he could have time to strategize a bit more instead of acting on forced impulse. He briskly tiptoed into the room, which he quickly realized was pointless, since at his size he couldn't have been heard over a pin drop, even if he was trying. Now he was officially in, panting lightly as he took a break from his run across the tough carpet fibers. But what Max saw next was far more breathtaking...</span></div></div>",

Grabbing the shower head, she began to rince and wash her hair with a bottle or MoroccanOil, filling the room with a mediterannean scent. She brushed out her shoulder-length brown hair and applied the conditioner, slowly running her fingers through her hair to spread it evenly from root to tip.<br>\r\nRinsing the last of the products from her hair, she stood up and let the water drip down her body. She grabbed a towel from the rail next to the bath and srubbed madly at her hair, drying to dry it as much as possible, then wrapping herself in it as she stepped out of the bath and onto the mat underneath. Moving to the sink, finished drying herself off and let the towel drop to the floor as she moved to the mirror over the sink. Wiping the fog from it, she looked into the mirror, noting the bags under her eyes from lack of sleep and long hours of work. She sighed and stepped back, kicking the sodden towel out of her way as she reached for her undergarments. Pulling them on quiclkly, she picked up the towel and her old clothes, slipped into her shoes as her hands were full, and headed to her room to dry her hair.</span></div></div>",

No sooner had Max strolled into the room when his puny eardrums were assaulted with noises of scrubbing and splashing. The woman whose aid he had come to seek was sopping wet with soapy bathwater, not to mention lying an almost unreachable plateau of sleek porcelain. Hell, she might as well have been in a fortress. Fighting back waves of dejection as his peered at the disheartening sight, the man trudged onward across the fortunately smoother terrain of bathroom tiling. But this wouldn't be an easy roadblock to overcome by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet that was the last thing on Max's mind when he suddenly heard another deafening sound of furious splashing from the tub's direction. Julie, looking like a sopping wet Statue of Liberty that had suddenly dived off Staten Island and gone for a quick dip in the Atlantic, rose dramatically from her frothy fortress moat. He probably couldn't have come at a worse time, he thought. The woman daintily stepped out from the tub, sending impact tremors that were enough to knock Max flat on his back  and seeing stars. Relatively enormous droplets of water came spilling off of her, only serving to add the boisterous horror of the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Max finally rose from his brief incapacitation, Julie was already out and toweling off, looming just a few feet away from him. He couldn't help but notice some of her... features at his current vantage point, but Max was by no means going to let anything distract him with his life at stake. Even so, it took tremendous self-control to fight the growing hardness below his belt. The fall had knocked the wind straight out of him, however, and he found himself unable to move even as the sexy scientist's left foot came crashing down just inches from his prone form. That's when the towel came fluttering down, blotting out the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough stunned, Max found himself to be shockingly unhurt. The towel had landed in such a way that it folded over him, leaving ample breathing room and no chest-caving pressure as he'd expected. But the relative safety was not to last, as the helpless man found himself being thrown violently to the side. For a brief second, he caught a glimpse of the woman's imposing foot as it effortlessly kicked his towel enclosure aside, sending him sprawling along with it as it flopped over. Working to clear his head of the dizziness and nausea from his tumultous ordeal, he looked up just in time to see his unknowing tormentor quickly scoop up the towel, and him along with it...</span></div></div>",

The enormous, tree-like phalanges spread open like a blossoming flower, both terrifying and awesome at the same time. He observed, immobilized, as the fingers clamped down like a venus fly trap on his towel embalment, leaving him helplessly ensnared at the giantess gathered her clothing. She slung the towel over her shoulder in one swift movement, leaving him weightless in the air as he was flung upward at unnervingly high speed. He futilely groped at the air as he realized he had been tossed up into the \"sky\", above even the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax caught a brief glimpse of Julie's monolithic visage, her eyes darting around as she collected all of her personal effects. He wondered what she might've thought if she knew that he, a shrunken man, had basically invaded her bathroom and was now watching her nude. Truth be told, he hadn't come in her for such voyeurisitic purposes, but he wasn't blind. At the completion of this thought he found himself landing a lot more softly than he'd expected. The clothing heap Julie had just assembled broke his fall quite nicely. He felt much more at ease now that the roaring rush of air that had tugged at his small form was now comfortingly absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the back of his mind he knew that would happen, which was why he hadn't felt the blind terror one might expect from being tossed what must've been hundreds of feet in the air to him. Still, there were some cons to his current position as well. Although for now he would porbably blending in with the clothes and not be spotted, this wasn't exactly the way he wanted Julie to notice him. He shivered at the thought of what her reaction might be if she caught him in this... awkward situation. She'd think he was spying on her for sure. No, he'd have to lay low (literally) until he found a more convenient and opportune moment to reveal himself to the woman.

He sighed and rose to stand among the haphazard pile which made for poor footing. High above this expanse of soft material loomed his colossal but unwitting captor. Julie, naked and glistening with bathwater, stood above him like a statue. She was looking right at his direction, but obviously didn't see him. For the first time in Max's life, he truly felt invisible. He was being seen through as if he were made of glax, and it was only fitting that it was a woman who was failing to notice him. The irony was not lost on his miniaturized but still sharp mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then turned to garner her clothing and change. Max felt he owed her the respect and quit gawking. Besides, he had more serious matters to attend to. He'd managed to reach his potential savior, yes, but... how to approach her? He was on the desk now, at least, which was a start. At least now he would be somewhat at level with her instead of where he'd started: at her feet. The realization of how far he'd come in just a short time baffled him. Leaping from the low end of the pile onto the stained, wood surface, Max surveyed his surroundings. Various items such as pencils, paper, food, drinks, cosmetics and more littered the desk's surface, but thing was jumping out at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the tiny man noticed the keyboard. Her computer, that was it it! All Max would have to do is get near to that and he was sure to catch Julie's attention. After a couple of minutes, he reached the mouse and sat down beside it, letting his aching body relax as he planned. He could see the scientist from across the room, now clothed in a hoody and jeans. Good, now he could actually study her without feeling like a perv. She seemed to be coming toward the computer. Good. He moved to the other side of the mouse as to avoid the possibility of her hand coming down on him, and he waited.

At first the little man thought she might've actually spotted him, and that this was a knee-jerk reaction to her perceving him as a pest, but her actions said otherwise. A look of frustration crossed her gigantic face, and she sighed, allowing a muttered curse to escape her lips. Max tried not to stare at her ass (which ended up being incredible, by the way), but he wasn't blind, and it filled his entire field of vision. But the real action was still yet to come, as he heard a shattering sound fill the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, the clumsiness hadn't ended at missing the computer mouse. While she had bent down to retrieve the it, she'd actually ended up knocking over what appeared to be a glass of water. She grabbed the towel and started mopping up the splinters of glass and water that now puddled the carpet. You couldn't have but empathize with her. Although Julie's plight seemed rather insiginifcant compared to your life-and-death shrinkage scenario, you were both humans under trying circumstances. She just wanted some well-deserved R&amp;R after a stressfull work week, and you, you were competing for your life at her feet... actually, never mind. She'd almost crushed you on multiple occasions. Forget Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done furiously cleaning up her mess, Julie stood to her full height in front of the desk, looking as if she had the weight of the world on her shoulders.  Easing into her seat in defeat, the titaness eyed the desk. You could tell her mind was ticking, and you instincitvely crouched. Your senses served you well, apparently, because the next thing she did was reach for the mouse. The fingers were out yet again, except this time... she was pushing the mouse and keyboard away! You dived away from the mouse just in time to see it removed from the scene likes props from behind a stage curtain. With that, Julie plopped her colossal bare feet down on the table, nose in a book.

He'd finally found a link between himself and Julie that would give him access to her attention. He wasn't foolish enough not to realize that there was a sizable element of danger in approaching feet the size of cruise ships, but it was the only feasible plan he had. Stepping out from behind the glass, (translucent cover -- not a good idea in retrospect) the miniature adventurer found himself now face-to-toe with the colossal things, twitching reflexively as Julie enjoyed her relaxing position and book. He couldn't help but wonder how many insects had been in his position before; transfixed by the sheer enormity and beauty of the feet, completely missing the equally large peril they posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Julie's behavior had proven that she wasn't just going to notice Max without him having to make the effort. It was then that he heard a rumbling sound coming from the woman's direction. His first thought was that she was going to adjust her feet, and he took evasive action accordingly. That's when he realized it was just her stomach growling, which just happened to be a terrifyingly loud noise in his ears. Unabated, he continued on, reaching the great sole of his potential savior. He examined the soft flesh, poking it to find that he couldn't put so much as a minute compression in its cushioned yet firm composition. On an act of impulsive curiosity, he reared back his fist and pounded the sole with all of his might, only succeeding in hurting his own fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Max quickly rung his hand from the pain, he realized that the heel had begun to twitch. He put it all together immediately. Her stomach had been growling, so now she's getting up to eat! Having to act fast, the tiny man reached out and managed to affix himself the soft flesh of the foot's arch, fitting snugly inside. This was a bold move, but in theory it should keep him anchored in place if she got up. He could hear the woman yawn, setting her book down on the desk as her feet slid back, going over the edge of the desk while Max began to panic, using all of her energy just to keep himself adhering to the bottom of Julie's colossal foot. Although he nearly lost his grip just before the foot hit the ground, fortune must have been smiling down upon him. He was alive. </span></div></div>",

Sure enough, there seemed to be a few slight trickles of blood and some dark objects stuck to her foot. Sighing, she gingerly got to work on the first of the shards with the tweezers, gripping it firmly and pulling it out, wincing as she did so. The second pice went as easily as the first, and she was glad that the cuts were extremely shallow.<br>\r\nAs she moved onto the last shard, she focused properly on it and let out a small yelp.

His heart suddenly sank at the realization of what this might mean for him, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie sat back on her bed, bringing up the foot Max was on in order to delicately work on it. This made it harder than ever to cling to her colossal sole, given the extreme resistance of gravity, but you he managed to persevere long enough.

Max might as well have been looking up at the white cliffs of Dover, but at least those had crags to serve as handholds. This surface was perfectly smooth! Scratching his head, he walked a little way to the right, finding just what he'd hoped for: a \"rope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax assumed it was some sort of waterproof cable that powered a whirlpool feature in the bath, but it honestly didn't matter. The fact was that he now had a means to get up there, so his ship wasn't sunk yet. Taking hold of the cable with a secure, two-handed grip, he hoisted himself up onto it, finding the surface to be surprisingly malleable. It seemed to make for an easy climb, although it would still be highly rigorous. Just one loss of grip and he'd go the way of Humpty Dumpty on the unforgiving, cold tile below. He sucked in a deep breath as he started the climb, silently mouthing out reassurances to himself. There was no room for error here. It was do or die until he reached the top of this godforsaken bathtub.</span></div></div>",

His mind had been sucked into the monotonous lull of climbing when he suddenly noticed a shadow falling over him. By the time he processed this and looked up, she was already there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA set of fingers the size of redwood tree trunks were suddenly hovering over him, too close for him to avoid yet too far for him to see where they had come from. Had she actually seen him, or was this merely an absentminded move on the scientist's part? The titanic fingers blocked his entire view of the room, so he had no choice but to hope he wasn't mashed to bits by them as they swooped by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gush of air was left in their wake as the snake-like extremities passed Max by. He noticed them come to rest on the edge of the tub, her pointer just centimeters below him. He was so enraptured by the site of them that he hadn't even noticed the force of the movement had stirred the air around him enough to disrupt his balance. The tiny man soon found himself clinging to the cable for dear life, legs kicking wildly beneath him as he struggled to hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he didn't know it, this twist of fate had actually saved his life. Just before he would have been forced to let go due to fatigue, Max felt himself caught up in the powerful grip of a massive thumb and forefinger. Surely this meant he had been discovered! The mission was a success. He felt himself hoisted swiftly into the air by the huge phalanges, and for the first time during this entire ordeal he didn't feel ready to soil himself. </span></div></div>",

It seemed as if he'd finally been discovered, and he imagined that at any moment he might see a flash of recognition in Julie's eyes as she finally understood that what she was holding in her hand was actually a tiny human being. He was banking on her maternal instincts to kick in and cause her to want to help him, but there was really no way to be sure until he saw her reaction. Although he hadn't wanted to be discover at such awful timing, (she was still naked from her bath) there had to be some way he could explain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Max noticed that she was heading toward the window. That initiated a darker thought into his mind. What if the least of his worries was try to explain why he was crawling up next to a nude woman in the privacy of her own home. What if... she just thought he was a mere insect? Well, he guessed he'd better hope she was a PETA member or something. He'd seen women do some pretty awful execution on bugs before, but he hadn't dreamed of a day where he might be in their position. That was when he felt her stop dead in his tracks, sighing heavily, when Max suddenly felt a horrible pain pressing on him from his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was squeezing him! The grip that had once held him safely in place was now about to pop him like a grape! Just when he felt like he was about to burst from the sheer force of Julie's vice grip, the pressure abruptly abated, leaving Max with searing pain and a coughing fit. But this wasn't the worst of it. The tiny victim felt his bile rise into his throat again as he was quickly lowered to the floor. She was apparently having second thoughts about the whole window thing. Oh, God, he couldn't have been more wrong! Max began to kick and writhe, screaming to the heavens that he should've never taken this gig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In all of the dizzying commotion, Max hadn't even thought to wonder why he was being placed on the cold bathroom tile in the first place. Now the answer became painfully clear... the time had come for an execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was absolutely terrifying from the tiny man's vantage point. She towered over him like a skyscraper might in a nightmare; her height and size were practically endless. Now, as her knee began to arch and her foot rose into the air, Max could no longer hold in his vomit. Turning his head to the side and retching, he could still see the bare sole of the scientist rushing down to greet him in his peripherals. The rosy pink foot soon filled the man's myopic view, obscuring quickly him in tender, yet formidable flesh. The foot hit with a force that felt fifty times mightier than a brick wall, but he somehow remained conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of Julie's stomp had actually flipped Max over, and he knew that dozens of his bones had been broken instantly. Pain shot through what felt like every nerve in his tiny, fragile body. Despite this fact, the shrunken man still could move one of his arms, which he tried in vain to struggle with against the onslaught of skin and bone that had almost entirely mashed him to bits. Choking out one last exhale of a scream, all Max could hear as his life's fire went out were the ominously insulting words \"That's so gross...\" as his body finally bled out.

He could practically see his spirits lift as he hoisted himself up onto the smooth, ivory surface of the bathtub's edge. From his new vantage point, he could look down at the vast stretch of soapy sea that lay before him. But from below this bubbly white body of water rose an island that was larger still: the bathing giantess herself. Max could hear Julie's low, somnolent breathing as she sunk deeper into the tub. Looking over, he saw that she had actually drifted off to sleep during his trip up there. The problem was, he couldn't tell if this was a good thing or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, his tentative plan of garnering Julie's attention from his current standpoint was out the window. Sleeping Beauty over there wouldn't do a whole lot of noticing from dreamland, and he sure as hell wasn't going any closer. But at the same time, he could see a few perks to her being asleep. One of which was the obvious lustful desire to watch Julie's... assets, but he'd been managing to shrug that off thus far. A more strategic reason, however, was that he had time to secure the best location to be for when Julie woke up in order to be noticed. Yeah, the more he thought about it, this seemed like a stroke of luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he even had time to yell, Max was already falling. He hadn't taken more than three steps before his legs gave way underneath him, sending him sliding headfirst over the interior edge of the bath. Steam and thermal air rushed in to greet him as the tiny man began to enter freefall, cursing his impatience and lack of good footing. He should've known better, and now he might've just lost his one chance at survival in this horrible place. The descent took a lot longer than he expected it would, but the rising hot air coupled with his insignificant mass had managed to soften his landing considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splash almost imperceptible to the regular-sized human eye, Max plunked into the steamy sea. First thought: it was a miracle he'd even lived through this fall. Although he'd just experienced what was, to put it mildly, the worst belly-flop of his life, the minute man wasn't even the worse for wear. Still, this was no rose garden. Max barely even had to tread water in his light, buoyant state, so he seized the opportunity to take a quick look around. Julie's sleeping form was even more impossibly massive up close, and he couldn't even think of where to start. Could he dare approach this island of a woman?</span></div></div>",

Still, there was no sense in relaxing now, since he was still in quite the danger zone. He was far from alone in this steamy sea, and worst of all, he thought she might actually be waking up. Sure enough, after one last snore, Julie was groggily returning to the land of the living. Max found himself subconsciously ducking in the water for some reason, as if that would even help. He would be lucky if she even noticed him while trying to. Her gaze was currently trained on something else at the moment, though, and he wanted to know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man began slowly making his way through the water, fighting against ripples of water that were as strong as ocean currents to him. He supposed he should consider this fortunate, since Julie wasn't moving all that much in the bath since she was on her back, but it was still a chore to even swim. That was when the real trouble began. In an effort to wash herself off, the gigantic woman was splashing around herself, causing the equivalent of a tidal wave to emerge each time. Luckily, none of them came near enough to Max as to cause any harm, but he knew it was only a matter of time unless he hung back a bit more. Still, he wanted to know what Julie was looking at by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Max continued to make his way toward the other end of the bath, he couldn't help but notice that every time the woman splashed water on herself it caused her mountain-sized boobs to rise out of the water, dipping in and out of the water like subs. He had to avert his eyes, both out of guilt and out of fear of the fact that he'd soon be swimming with a boner, which could get kind of awkward even if no one else could see it. It might already be too late. Max's thoughts were yanked in another direction, though, as he finally was able to make out what Julie has fixed her line of sight on all this time. He immediately regretted getting those close, but bubbles had obscured it until he'd gotten too close: it was an earwig.</span></div></div>",

However, anyone is free to add within prescribed limits. That's what the Wild Card Arc is for. Anyone can add to that, and it'll be just like any other interactive. I only ask that you do not write in the first four choices of the first chapter unless you receive permission, because I will have to remove them. I'd hate to see the work you put into it go to waste. 100 GPs are provided for each addition made to the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, my only real dislikes are scat and other \"bathroom\" aspects of macrophilia, as well as insertion. Anything else is accepted; including feet, vore, breasts, ass, and other such things. Also, you may not introduce any male giants. I don't have any issue with homosexuality, but I am straight so it doesn't appeal to me. If you would like to introduce other girls than Julie, that's also fine, but have a decent explanation for why this occurs. Please use proper grammar, and don't make posts that are far too short unless the story cannot proceed without a brief choice chapter. Well, that's about it.
