I just want a new bike right now\" Misty says enraged about what he did to her bike and wanting him to replace it <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my Pikachu, my pikachu is not too good\" Ash announces all of a sudden  reaching to Misty's heart of cause since she loved Pok\u00e9mon as much as any other Pok\u00e9mon trainer so she says \"huh, is it very serious\" feeling compassion for said Pok\u00e9mon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, there is nothing I can do to help now\" Ash continues getting an \"Oh\" from her. Just as all that was said Nurse Joy came out with her Chansey assistants beside her wheeling in Pikachu on a stretcher<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA conversation between the group confirmed that Pikachu will be okay and it was good that Ash got his buddy to the Pok\u00e9mon center quickly (we all know what happens in that conversation and if you don't remember watch episode 2 of the very first series of Pok\u00e9mon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now your Pikachu needs a good rest in the recovery room, you should go in with it Ash\" Joy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Ash said thankfully to Joy, than says to Misty \"Look, I am sorry about your bike but I am going to need some time to make things right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I fell for that last time\" Misty yelled at Ash getting a \"huh\" from the boy \"Well you should take care of Pikachu now and we will settle this later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay\" as returned nervously confused and worried about what she will do to settle this issue <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Insert team rocket attack and the saving of the Pok\u00e9mon center*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Ash and Pikachu were about to leave Viridian City, Misty runs up to them to catch up and yells \"You haven't forgotten that we still have to settle the issue about my bike\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh fell to the ground in shock having forgotten about that and was hoping to leave Viridian City as soon as possible \"Look I don't have any money to get you a new bike but I promise, I will replace it\" Ash says hoping to placate the angry water Pok\u00e9mon specialist<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are going to replace it, but since you cannot replace it straight away so until you do I will join you on your journey and......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
