            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're a 17 year old guy named Martin who just got out of school for the summer. Looking forward to it, you decide to take it all in. You and your girlfriend Sarah part ways and head to your own houses hoping to see her again much later. While walking home, passing several stores, you take a shortcut in the alley. As you're walking along a big truck passes you by. The logo of the truck ready SCIENCCO which seems to be that new science museum that opened up. Its both a museum, and a research lab with all sorts of weird inventions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, as you walk by, you see the back of the truck semi open. You shrug it off and keep walking until you see the truck pick up speed and make a big right turn. This causes a small crate to fall off the back of the truck and drives away. You run towards the crate and try to yell at the driver that something has fallen off the truck but the truck just drives away. You pick up the crate and decide to take it home with you and figure you'll return it later. You arrive home and run up to your room and shove the crate in your closet. You decide you'll return it in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later while you surf the net, a strange feeling comes over you. You begin to wonder what's in that crate. You pull it out and get a crowbar from under your bed and try to pry it open. You can always nail it shut anyways. The box opens and you fins a small box along with all the Styrofoam you find in deep crates. You pull out a weird remote like device as well as a yellow notepad with pencil notes on it. Reading it over, you realize its a prototype body switch machine with various colored buttons on it, a number pad, two sensors on the top and bottom of it and a three digit counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the notepad and read what each button does:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Red Button: Normal body Swap</b>  <br>\r\nThe default swap option. You and whoever you point it at switches bodies instantly. The device will follow you as the swap is set so you wont need to worry about where it went. Once your in the body of someone else, you can also put the body you're in into an \"autopilot state\" meaning that you can let the body act out the person you've become. They will act like the person you swapped without any clear idea that you switched with them. This autopilot applies to any body you've become and no matter what switch option you chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Blue button: Brainwash Swap </b><br>\r\nThis option switches you and another but your victim will believe he or she has been the person they swapped with, so you can live in their shoes without them knowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Yellow button: Ghost </b><br>\r\nLets you become invisible like a ghost and can possess anyone you want. The swap device disappears along with you and will reappear when you possess someone or decide to get out of this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Purple button: Age Swap </b> <br>\r\nHit this button, then use the number pad and three digit counter on the device allows you to change someone's age to that of what you want. The person will not be aware of any changes to them, they'll still think as themselves as they are at their normal age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Green button: Programming Mode </b><br>\r\nThis is different from other modes. This one is very similar to brainwash Swap except it doesn't involve you. You can choose to affect as many people as you want. You have three green button options here:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Program Sub-Mode-</b><br>\r\nYou can \"Program\" or brainwash another person into believing they are someone else. Plant your thumb on the sensor and think about the person you want them to act like.  They will treat their bodies as if they had them and wont react at all to the new changes. When being face to face with the real person they are acting like, they will see them as the person they originally were. (Ex. Jenna swapped to think she is Martins girlfriend Sarah.  When the two met, Brainwashed Jenna will see treat Sarah as Jenna, even though she IS Jenna. Heh Confusing much?).  Program mode can be used multiple times, and you could have a whole family thinking their Martin or someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Traits Sub-Mode-</b><br>\r\nYou can also program certain traits and behaviors to a person if you wanted. The person won't know that they're affected at all and will behave normally. Hold your thumb to the sensor and push the Green Traits button and think of someones trait or behavior and the person will be programmed that way. Some examples include:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Jenna's bitchiness<br>\r\n- Megan's social anxiety and shyness<br>\r\n- Marco's pervertedness<br>\r\n- Jessica's loud mouth energy<br>\r\n- Gross traits from other students at your school etc<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Object Trait Mode-</b><br>\r\nLets bend the rules and add this stupid feature too. This is just for sick humor and laughs. This mode programs a person to become an inanimate object or animal that you select. You point the Remote at something, a pen, a chair, a sweater, a cat, or a radio and then target a person and they will mentally become that object. The majority of nonliving objects you select will have the person lifeless and stand in one position unless you move them. The person will not react at all, but will become a dummy lifeless object state. If you make them into a radio or television, then they will mentally pick up signals and speak and \"play\" their commercials and shows by talking. Changing them to an animal will make them act like them of course. But being a lifeless object will more or less be the same. This is if you want time by yourself and don't want to bother with the family much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-SOUL SWAPPING-</b><br>\r\nActivated by holding the sensor with your thumb for about 10 seconds, then this triggers. In a Limbo and frozen time state, you can switch Souls around people. The people who are swapped will have reality changed so that people but Martin will identify their body as their rightful owners. The person's body, voice, age, hobbies will be adapted to the other people but they will still retain their identity. Ex Megan in Helen's body will still be Megan but she will always think she was a middle aged woman who likes to cook, clean, and enjoy raising a family, but she will still identify herself as Megan, still go to school as a teenager and still have her personality. People swapped this way will be immune to any other SWAPs except RESET.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Black button: Reset </b><br>\r\nWhat it says, resets any and all people affected with the swap and returns you to normal with the switcher in hand. Everyone will forget ever being switched except you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou naturally don't believe in this kind of thing and thinks its too good to be true, so you just shrug it off and think its some kind of gift store prop at the museum, so you put it back in the crate and put it back in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the sack and call it a night. You sleep until the next morning Saturday when you wake up immediately. Its about 5 in the morning and two of your sisters are still asleep. Your older sister Jenna went off to do her morning jog, and your parents are down in the kitchen drinking coffee. Your Dad is about to get ready to go to work to teach Saturday classes which is a half day for him on the weekends.<br>\r\nYour curiosity gets the better of you and you pull out the Body Swap Device. You decide to test it. Playing along you decide to try the brainwash swap first since you don't want anyone to know anything although that Programming Mode looks very tempting as well. You read the instructions again and then hide the crate and instructions into a hole in your wall and sit on your bed. You then decide on who you want to try it out on. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you decide who do you want to test the brainwash swap out on:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was your father Bill who was a chemistry professor at a local college. The same one your older sister Jenna goes to. Your father is a great guy, very easy going and cool.and loves trying to get your mother to stop acting serious. To him, you and him were like best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom Helen on the other hand was a more or less the opposite. She was the type of mother who was overprotective after watching one too many segments on Oprah about children ignoring their parents and causing trouble on their own, doing drugs, joining gangs, getting arrested etc. She really needed to lighten up and realize that not all children will end up that way. Being Helen would probably be the better option that you can run the family your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walk up to the bathroom and find your father Bill shaving in front of the bathroom mirror. You find a blue button on the remote which stands for the Brainwash swap option. You press it at your unknowing father and suddenly fade out to where you see your father in front of you. You successfully switch with your father Bill!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive!\" You say in your deeper fatherly tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look behind you to find your old body standing outside the bathroom looking confused. Your father Bill is inside of there, but he's programmed to act like you, so its all good and you don't worry about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look on your body and see nothing much. Your old life has the same thing except older. You continue shaving then head to your bedroom. You enter and find your mom Helen in there getting dressed as well. You open the door to catch a quick glimpse of Helen's bare ass putting on some underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah!!\" You jump back at the sudden shock of seeing your mom nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey what's wrong?\" Helen looks at you from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, uh, nothing much honey, you just startled me a bit, I'm sorry\" You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiles then turns to face you completely naked. It's the first time you ever saw your own mother naked. Your father begins to get hard and you try to order it to stop. Helen slowly walks towards you and it didn't help much that her bare breasts (size D) started jiggling as she walked towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand in total awe seeing your mother this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'i'm sorry m.... I mean... Helen.\" You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, 'Mommy' huh? It's okay to call me 'Mommy' when were alone. It makes Momma frisky.\" Helen says while taking your course rugged hand moving it underneath her right breast palming it on your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Daddy, like always. Its been awhile since we had any \"US\" time with each other, and me keeping tabs on the kids and all. It's stressful. \"How about one for the road\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap into your fathers mind, despite your disgust and learned that your Dad tickled your mom's tit and it got her wobbling when you did it.You take a deep breath, smile and begin tickling her. She holds onto your shoulder as her legs give out and moan and is in ecstasy from her own pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to keep tabs on the kids....honey. They're smart enough not to wind down that path. You're kind of strict on them and I kind of see that as unfair.\" You say trying to convince Helen to back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I worry alot Billy. Maybe I should take your word for it. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kisses you passionately, you just give in and repay the favor to her and kiss and tickle her again. You pray in your mind that she will finally get it and get off your back. You get dressed in some dress pants, a striped shirt and tie, and a lab coat. You tap into his mind and located your box full of chemicals (sealed from harm of course) and get ready to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's continue where we left off tonight?\" Helen, fully dressed says, kisses you passionately again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree despite the protest going on in your head. You leave with your briefcase, supplies, and the Remote packed in as well. This is the first time checking out the campus of a college so you can explore around and appoint someone to \"substitute\" as Bill and perhaps do a few swaps for shits and giggles. You get in your car, tap your fathers mind for the address to the college and drive off. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You drive to the college in your father Bill's body getting a chance to see what your cool Dad does for a living. You drive up to the parking lot, show the guard your teacher's pass and she let's you in. You take out your things from your car, put the remote in your pants pocket and walk towards the main Administration Building. Since you're only 17 and a year or two away from actual college, this is the first time you actually BEEN to a campus that it takes awhile for you to take it all in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap your fathers mind again about college and learn about how different it is than high school. Dorms, your own personalized schedule, different restaurants and facilities and as far as you're concerned, the students AND teachers were on par with each other. There was no authority over the other in age and it's more comfortable for adults to be students as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou love college and can't wait to come here, but thats later. For now, you're part of the school culture as one of its instructors. You head towards the main admin office and clock in for the half day. You taught only 1 class lecture to a big crowd of students in advanced chemistry, and then have a lab after that with a few number of students from the lecture class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the Biological sciences building where you work and find your office. You close the door and see Bill's office in its entirety. A chair, microwave, coffee maker, cabinet, computer, desk with paperwork, student reports and a window looking over the track and field. You sit in your big comfy chair and see pictures of your family on the desk: You, Helen, Megan, Jessica, and Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna.....\" You say. Then you remember that Jenna comes to this campus as well, and is an athlete in the track and field. You could switch with her and see her daily schedule, but you could do that any other day. This is your time to be your Dad. You learn you can let Bill do all the work while you release his mind and let him do his thing. You do that until the class starts at 9:00am. You get your notes and get ready to teach your first class as Professor Bill. You actually get scared because you need to speak to about 60 kids about Chemistry with its complex mix of formula's, numbers etc, which would drive you mad. You just pray that Bill can teach the class on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room and find that the room is HUGE and they're are a LOT of people in this room that it scares the heck out of you a bit, but you need to do this, as a learning experience and since its too late to do anything. You also wonder if this is what it's like on the weekend, you shit your pants wondering what the class size for the weekday schedule is like. You let go of your fathers body and lets him take over hopefully to teach the class right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, everyone. Open your books to page ninety-seven and we'll continue on where we left off last week.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're amazed that the body pulled it off acting like Bill would teaching a huge class. You let him do his thing when the class ends an hour and a half later. As the class leaves, several students ask questions and stuff and bill's body answers them with easy. You on the other hand inside your fathers mind is just confused and the formulas drove you crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain control again and leave and head to your office. You sit down, drink some coffee, and mellow out before your next class. You didn't really enjoy that class because of all the chemistry shit going in one ear and out the other. You decide to pull a switch when your LAB class starts. You sure as hell don't want to go through that again, so you take the device and put it in your lab coat pocket. Looking at your  plans for today, the Lab class is going to watch a movie today, so while you kick back with the class, you can plan on who to become later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards your 11:00am lab class and greet everyone. Amazingly, they're are only 11 students in the class which makes choosing alot better. You greet the class and then set up the computer to show the movie. You play it and sit in the back with your notes as the class watches. You tap your fathers mind and select 4 subjects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Tara Lingshen: Tara is a 21 year old animation major and is a lesbian, dating her childhood girlfriend Daisy Simpson. The two are madly in love. Tara has no upper body to speak of breasts-wise, but she has a curvy lower body and nice legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Theodore \"Teddy\" Galvin: Big 22 year old jock with a buff, muscular figure. But unlike the stereotypical buff football guys, he is a very popular, light hearted, humorous guy. His girlfriend Tammy isn't the bubbly, cheerleader type, but just an average girl working on her photography degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Gwen Roberts: A 34 year old woman continuing her college work and degree in biological sciences. She has a husband who's a chef, and an 11 year old daughter named Lydia. She's probably the nicest woman you'll ever meet. She loves to joke around and loves to laugh.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Cassondra Hernandez: A 19 year old freshmen single mother with a 3 year old baby boy named Tommy. Cassie's husband left her after being pregnant with Tommy. Cassie's mother takes care of him while she gets her life back together and gets an education.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you want to do now?</span></div></div>",

You almost began drooling as his shirt rode up a little bit and you caught a glimpse of his abs. It took all of your willpower not to grab the remote and switch bodies with him right then and there. But you had to be smart about this, doing it in front of everyone would raise too many questions. You concocted a plan to get him alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now pay attention class, there will be a quiz on this later.\" You heard the class groan and you rolled your eyes. This same video had been shown at your high school, these student had no right to complain. After you make your way over to Teddy, who sits at his desk struggling not to doze in the darkness of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theodore, could I speak with you for a moment?\" You tap him on the shoulder and he jolts with a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't sleeping Professor Remy, I swear!\" He mutters. You grin. Really? Class had just stared and he was already dozing off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you weren't, I think I read that students focus better when their eyes are closed. Isn't that right?\" You joke, and Teddy forces out a chuckle. \"Meet me in the gymnasium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Teddy to gather his things, you exit the classroom brimming with excitement. You head over to the gymnasium and take a seat on a bench, taking the remote from your pocket and fiddling with it. After making sure that you had the settings adjusted properly, you set it beside you just as Teddy enters. You eye Theodore up and down. He was the definition of a handsome, all American jock, with an emphasis on definition. He obviously spent a lot of time in the gym, something you were looking forward to trying out once you were in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you want to talk to me about?\" He asked. Wasting no time, you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision fades for a moment and when it snaps back, you're staring at your father's body. It had worked! Glancing down you see tanned hands, strong forearms, and... Damn, Teddy had a great chest. Poke one of the mounds of muscle you feel pushing on the fabric of your shirt, almost scared that it's going to deflate like a balloon but instead you're met with firm resistance. It's funny, in fiction you always saw guys switching bodies with girls and immediately grabbing their boobs, and here he was switching with a guy and doing the exact same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I saying?\" Your father's body asks. You can see him staring at you in bewilderment, and realizing what a strange sight you must be groping your pecs you drop your hands from them with some disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were just saying that I should go home for the day because I'm not feeling well.\" You cough, and your acting skills were horrible but your your father's body (Teddy? You're not sure) seems so disoriented by the swap that he accepts this explanation and wanders off towards his classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't feel sick, of course, you felt better than you ever had in your entire life! What would you do next?</span></div></div>",

Your hands roamed his body, and as you traced the ridges of his six pack you wondered how you'd gotten so lucky. Without even flexing his arms were already huge and when you flexed them they just got even more ridiculously big. You were so strong now! Every single part of your body felt hard and tight, as you moved your body around you felt muscles in places you didn't even know muscles could be. Reaching around you groped his ass... nice. You guessed that he must have an intense workout regimen to keep his body in such good shape, which you were looking forward to trying out. And if you didn't feel like it, well, you could always just swap into a different jock body if you ruined this one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity getting the better of you you reached into your new shorts, and when your fingers found your new genitals, your brow furrowed. That couldn't be right. There was far too much there. You unbuttoned your shorts and allowed your new manhood to flop out. Holy shit. Obviously the dude had four years of growth on you, but even then you doubted that you'd ever have a dick anywhere near as big as his. Except thanks to the remote technically now you did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd always liked girls of course, but in the past few years you'd begun noticing some strange feelings towards boys as well. Sometimes you stared at a boy and wondered whether you wanted to be him or fuck him, and you chuckled realizing that you could now do either. You'd joined a hookup app but unfortunately the market for pudgy, barely legal teens wasn't huge. But now, in the body of a slice of prime American beef, you had options. Men, women, you had your pick of the litter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do?</span></div></div>",

What could he be doing that was so scandalous he had to hide it from the rest of his friends? You had trouble searching Teddy's memories (it wasn't an exact science) but you were fairly certain the key to the puzzle lay at Teddy's house, as your digging into his mind turned up the occasional glimpse of a box buried deep in the back of his closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling in his pocket for his car keys, you grinned. You'd gotten your learner's permit last year, but your family only had two cars (one for your mother and one for your father) so you hadn't gotten to practice much. Teddy's car was fancy, a bit of an older model but still a very nice car. Sitting behind the wheel, you caught sight of yourself in the mirror and winked. Time to enjoy your new life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride over to Teddy's house was exhilarating, yet terrifying. You'd driven earlier in your father's body but some of that must have been borrowed knowledge like his chemistry skills, and as it turns out, you hadn't inherited Teddy's driving skills. You'd nearly totaled his car several times, but finally you arrived at your destination. He lived in a house off-campus with four other guys, but you knew you'd be spared the trouble of meeting them just yet because they were all out at class or work. Letting yourself in, you headed immediately towards Teddy's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddy's room was surprisingly neat for a college student. There were some shoes littered about and a chair covered in dirty clothes, but for the most part papers only seemed to clutter the desk and everything else was mostly in its place. The decor was about what you expected. There were sports flags that you didn't recognize (you weren't going to dig through Teddy's memories to pick out which was which), posters for violent video games that you did recognize (Teddy had some taste), and there were some dumbbells stacked in a corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dumbbells were of the size that you would have struggled to lift in your real body, but as you experimentally picked one of them up you were delighted at how easily you were able to lift it. These were nothing to Teddy's well trained muscles. Grinning, you began pumping. You'd never worked out like this a day in your life but Teddy's body seemed to know what to do. Noticing a full length mirror attached to one of the walls, you stood in front of it and began lifting the weights. Rolling up your already short, already tight sleeves you exposed more of Teddy's gorgeous arms, and you marveled as you watched the muscles work to pump the weights up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping your shirt off entirely, you thought about your situation. The allure of a magic body switching remote was ever present, but had taken a backseat to the immediacy of being in a new body, especially one as fit as this one. You took a moment again to let your hands roam over Teddy's body, taking inventory of the spoils of your conquest. Soft skin, big hands, firm pecs, tight abs, massive arms, and to top it all off he was Hollywood handsome and had a porn star dick. You couldn't wait until you could take this body for a test drive. Your hands were already migrating south towards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and let out a breath. <i>Focus Martin,</i> you thought to yourself. <i>There's plenty of time to play later.</i> For now, you had a mystery to solve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis closet was messier than the room as a whole, but as you dug through a particularly large pile of junk you began to wonder if that was the point. When you finally unearthed the mysterious box, you trembled with excitement. What had been so scandalous that Teddy would bury it like this? Lifting the lid you laid your eyes on the contents of the box, and memories came flooding back to you. What was it?</span></div></div>",

Superheroes, crime fighters, all around bad asses, they'd always inspired him and he'd always wanted to be like them. He'd started working out in order to look more like his favorite characters, though he'd never admit that. He relished assembling a look and putting his own spin on a character, and to your shock you realized that Teddy knew how to sew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the world made it hard to be proud of his skills. A masculine guy like him, playing dress up? People didn't understand it. He'd tried confessing his passion to his friends once in high school, but had to laugh it off as a joke when everyone reacted negatively. He'd kept his costumes in his closet since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut college is a place to be who you truly are, and though the constraints of Teddy's image as a cool jock still kept him from being fully open about it, he had managed to find an outlet for his cosplay. The college had a cosplay club, and every Thursday Teddy secretly went over to the home of Ken Wu and got to share ideas and tips with fellow cosplayers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was Thursday! You figured you'd head over to Ken's house and see what was up with this group. You grabbed the box containing your outfit and headed out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, who was Teddy planning on cosplaying as?</span></div></div>",

You better decide now because you have no idea why he's here and this is the perfect chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour decision is either trap him in a body with the remote and call the cops then switch them back. Or find out what he's doing here either confronting him or wait till he comes to you, but know that this is more dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Its important you don't lead him on.\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plant your finger on the black reset button thinking ONLY of fixing the sibling swap, you hit it as the two Marco's blink and wobble for a minute then resume themselves.

Whats up sir?\" - Deb says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was taking Marco out to see Martin over for bowling. I wanted to bring him along.\" - you fake a story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay well have fun then.\" - Debbie says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you go back to the car as you plan your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see it?

I wanna switch badly with people!\" - Marco<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall, okay, here's the thing, this baby I got off of a Scienco truck. A parcel that fell off one of the trucks taking it to one of the museum labs. I read all about the functions of this thing and you can switch two people, or brainwash swap another, program a personality into them, and even age or de-age them.\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freaking Epic! Say dude, can I see it now?!\" - Marco<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" - you say as you hit 42 and hit the purple button on Marco aging him to 42 years old<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah....... hey that's not funny! I'm your age! Still, I'm older than Pops, pretty weird. Hey maybe we can hit up the clubs and flirt with some women like this. I mean, my manlyness has reached an all time high now!\" - Marco says which was somewhat true, he WAS in better looking shape for a 42 year old and he could pick up on some younger women at clubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could hang around town and zap random people, switch some unsuspecting people's ages/minds and watch their reactions or something.

The both of you look for the nearest club and soon find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this place is full.\" You tell Marco as the both of you step out and notice all the cars in the parking lot. You both start heading over to the door until Marco stops you and says. \"Martin I just remember that I didn't bring any money!\" You quickly take out your dad's wallet from his back pocket and find plenty of money to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" You say while handing Marco half the money from the wallet. \"Did you even count how much you just gave me?!\" Marco said while counting, grinning happily at the amount he just got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both finally stepped in, the both of you were amazed by the amount of sexy young woman that were out clubbing today. \"Lets go get some drinks.\" Marco said, pointing over at the nearest bar. The both of you buy some beers and take seats to look over the crowed. Soon a sexy red head in a tight dress walks up to Marco and they both begin to flirt, he offers her a drink and soon she's leading Marco by the hand out to the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and wave as Marco goes with the woman, clearly happy by the invitation. You just sit there for a half hour before realizing that most woman seem to walk pass you. \"Why don't they come over?\" You wonder while you look down at your dad's hand and see his shiny wedding ring. \"Oh shit, I didn't even think about dad's ring.\" You know that there was no way of coming back from this, since most of all the woman in the club have obviously seen the wedding ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" You think to yourself. Suddenly your hand finds the remote that you had in your pocket and you realize the new fun you could have. You click the yellow button and suddenly disappear.

You then start dancing in the woman body, which luckily kept Marco's eyes on your new body and stopped him from asking anymore questions. \"This body is pretty sexy.\" You think as you watch your new boobs moving with your body. \"These have to be CC cups.\" You think to yourself as you begin to fondle them while still dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see Marco watching your body move and you actually love the attention your getting from all the men in the club. But it wasn't only her boobs that were gaining the attention, it was also your tight black dress which cut off around her thighs, allowing everyone to see how fit her legs were, but also her nice ass. You couldn't help but grind it up against Marco's body, only to feel the sudden erection in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and see that he is extremely mortified, but since you were in control of her sexy body you just smile seductively and rub your hand against the boner in his pants. You can tell that he is some what surprised by your reaction, since he was probably expecting that he would at least have to dance with the woman all day to get into her pants, but this was less than an hour. You love the secret of him not knowing its you inside her body and decide to see where this would lead to next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you maybe want to head somewhere less crowded?\" He asks you. \"He would not be getting laid today if it wasn't me in here.\" You think to yourself, but knowing that Marco was really hoping for a fun night out you say. \"Sure babe, I'd go anywhere with you?\" You then lock your arm with his and the both of you start heading out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both are outside the club Marco then guides you over to a quit location at the side of the club where he stops and looks you in the eyes nervously. \"Is this okay?\" He asks. You decide that he might chicken out if you didn't do something fast so you quickly unzipped his pants and said. \"Perfect.\" You then pulled them down along with his underwear, only to come face to face with his erect penis . \"Holy shit, that age button did make him a man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel Marco's nervousness as you look his penis over, but soon you can feel his confidence building back up the longer you inspect it. \"Is everything okay down there?\" He asks you. You smile up at him as you grip the top of your dress and pull it down, exposing your new breast to the cold air. \"Are you a boobs man?\" You ask Marco, already knowing the answer, as you start to slide his erection between them. You can feel the warmth of it between your breast as you start to rub it down with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco lets out a moan and reply's with. \"Yes.\" \"Good cause things are only going to get better from hear.\" You say as you drop your body's hands to her panties and pull them off. You then stand up, kicking them away, only to then guide Marco's hands over your breast. \"Are they amazing?\" You purr in his ear. \"God yes!\" He reply's as he keeps fondling them with his huge masculine hands. You moan from just him touching them and can already feel a growing warmth between your exposed legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick a finger down between our legs and feel that your growing wet. You turn Marco's attention to the growing wetness and say. \"Its time to have some real fun!\" You grab his erection and are ready to put it in, but Marco stops you and says. \"I've actually never done this before.\" You just give him a smile and say. \"Well its your lucky day.\" You then shove his dick into your vagina and feel complete ecstasy. \"Holy shit!\" You think to yourself as you feel your legs tightening. \"I didn't think it would feel this good!\" You moan and soon find Marco's lips kissing you. \"Let me take it from here.\" He says, taking you by surprise in seeing Marco take charge of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, he's flipped your back to the wall and begins pumping you up and down with his dick in rhythm. You'd never seen Marco so confidant until now, and were filled with pleasure as you would feel Marco's dick reach farther and farther up your vagina. You soon are biting your lips to stop from moaning out loud as Marco begins pumping faster and faster, until you both felt the other coming to climax. You felt your legs wobbling as a sudden burst of of pleasure rocketed its way through your body, only to feel even more pleasure as Marco cummed inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was.....great.\" You reply wobbly, but still smiling over at him. Suddenly some lights start flashing and you realize that a cop cars just pulled up and two cops are beginning to step out. You __________ her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you're doing this, your eyes wander across a mirror opposite of you and you catch your reflection; your dad's aged face with sandy blonde hair that was beginning to thin just a bit. You looked at your dad's body, and how it filled out the clothes you picked very nicely. Your dad wasn't fat by any means, but he did have a bit of a gut, which you thought was actually kind of hot. You stand up and walk towards the mirror before flashing a smile at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself getting hard, and you reach down and rub your new package, noting that it feels much bigger than your old one.

It worked. You are your mom, Helen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach down to your crotch area, and feel nothing except a small indentation. You then reach up and feel one of your new breasts.

Your mom's breasts never looked too big when you saw them before, but now that they're hanging off <i>your</i> chest, it seems different. You stand up, feeling them bounce and the weight of them changing your center of gravity. You also feel a rush of air flow up into your skirt, temporarily giving you legs goosebumps. Helen's hair also falls into her eyes, so you brush it away, pausing afterwards to flex and admire the smooth, feminine hands with painted red nails that is now yours. You look back onto the bed and see the swapping remote lying next to where you were sitting. You pick it up and put it into your skirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

Get used to it?\" She gets up with her now limp penis now covered in jizz and says \"well yeah, I was wondering if you could be me for the week while I be your father, that was the main reason you wanted to swap with me in the first place, right?\" You looked at her in shock, she was actually letting, no, inviting you to be her what should you say!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well um I guess uhhhhh\" you say as you try to put your words into the world \"I guess....\"</span></div></div>",

Here, put these on.\" Mom in dad's body worked to pull panties and a pair of tight jeans up the fly-mom's legs only to have the woman kick and jerk to the point where mom found it impossible to button and zip the jeans.

As a inscect the fly was smaller, only capable of thinking on survival and how to live as a fly, fearfull of the wondering giants that had roamed the halls of this household. But now it was no longer a fly, somehow un-beknowst to the fly itself it had become one of the towering giants itself and with its new form came new thoughts and a greater expansion of knowledge.

The  fly now began to stroke away at martins penis much more aggressivly, hurting martin slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fly continued to stare deeply into martins eyes as it edged itself closer towards him. With its free hand it reached out towards martins face and gently brushed its fingers across martins face. \"Martin\" it said aloud as it stroked his face up and down. It knew his name, was it learning even more now? Unknown to martin with a kuch bigger brain came higher functions, and whilst the fly had swapped places it had also somehow began to tap ahold of Helens memorys and use them for itself. The fly retracted its free hand and placed it across helens chest \"Helen\" it spoke. It knew its new identity yet it continued to toy with martin sexually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fly now began to admire its new body taking it in. Its other hand still gripping tightly onto martin as it did so. Martin was lost within the moment, curious as to what the fly was thinking and what its intentions where. For a few moments the fly looked away from martin and groped its new body in admiration before snapping back onto martin as he attempted to look. \"You martin, me Helen. You Helen, me was martin!\" It proclaimed. The sentence confused martin at first, did the fly remember being in his body, what he and it had been up to a while ago, or was the fly trying to trick him into thinking that it was either helen or the original martin?

The Fly stopped as both it and Martin glanced at the wall across the room, the buzzing fell silent as Helens bodys expression returned back to an emotionless state. Though devoud of emotion, Martin could tell that the Fly was irratated or annoyed. Then it hit him, it had noticed the fly on the wall. It had spotted Helen in its own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fly let its new feminie hands down to its side as it seductivly walked towards its old fly body, which remained still on the wall. Martin attempted to reach out and stop her or it or whatever the fly was now. The Fly glanced in close towards its old body \"hehe stupid fly\" Helens body exclaimed . Helens body reached out and pinched the fly, not harming it but trapping it within her fingers. \"You fly now, me... im Helen\" Helens body proclaimed, Helens body glared back towards martin and licked its lips seductivly...</span></div></div>",

Well yes I wasn't lieing, that's what mothers do; don't lie\" she seemed to think you were still Martin but she didn't seem too distressed that you basically three to ruin her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"However, Martin, punishments must be given out to disobedient sons, I think an hour of a little darkness should be good for you\" she said as she presses the ghost button and turned transparent. She walked over to you and cut your bindings as she quickly dove straight down your throat and after a few moments you started to black out but you held on you needed to get to that remote! You stumbled out and you could feel her pulling in your essence, still thinking you're Martin, and just about the time you lose consciousness you reach the remote and press the back bumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in the remote and sigh a metallic sigh as you realize you'll have to wait again to become solid again, until then you'll have to wait for the fly to stop its shenanigans in your sons body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFly-mom's P.O.V. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake as your son, you didn't think he'd be foolhardy enough to actually try and brainwash swap with you. You did in fact put yourself under a process called \"self-immunity\" which was a hard process to do with the remote but, as usual, you managed and made yourself completely immune to the remote so that if people ever tried to betray you you could in fact give them a fright when you just stood there impressive while they went through the effects of the remote. You mainly gave the remote to Martin for the testing anyway, you wanted to see if your immunity was all it was cracked up to be, on one side of was: since you in fact weren't even put through its effects and were immune on the other side you did pass out for a good 30 seconds which was way shorter than your son who was asleep for 10 minutes but still, 30 seconds are all your enemies need to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy are you thinking about that when you have an hour to be your son and have your sons tools, besides an hour is an hour and a mother ALWAYS keeps her promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Your plan had backfired so much that now the imposter was in Martin's body too so might as well have something else had happen too right!!! On a change of fortune however, something did happen and it benefited you for the second time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had knocked on the door to which the imposter stopped her \"play time\" and unlocked the door to see her there pouting. \"What are you doing in mommy's room, dummyhead\" she said in her regularly annoying tone \"what I can't have a little alone time with mom?\" It was sorta creepy how that was phrased but Jessica didn't seem bothered by that but she did happen to catch a glimpse of the remote lying on the ground and a look at total want cake over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I want that thing now!\" She shouted as she pointed at the remote, suddenly a huge grin spread across Martin's face \" sure to get it and have fun with it too hehe\" again pretty creepy thing to say but Jessica obviously didn't care as long as she got what she wanted. When she picked it up you immediately started to try to message her but she didn't catch any of the messages, not a single one! She just like pressing a few buttons which did nothing since they weren't pointed at anybody but she eventually did find the back bumped which she decided to press for no good reason while having the remote directly under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, it was the weirdest way to be transferred but now you had a solid body and had the remote now but what to do with it? Sure she could attempt to use the remote on the imposter again, but you didn't want a repeat of last time, perhaps she should swap with Jenna or Megan since they were older and had a better chance at helping her in her quest of stopping the imposter. However, before she could even try that plan \"Martin\" came back looking oddly satisfied and a little sweaty, \"alright Jessy, time to give it back\" you needed to act like Jessica as not to raise suspicion but it pained you to hear her voice sound like Jessica's \"but I don't wanna!\" \" Well to bad, squirt\" \"Martin\" says as he snatches it from your tiny hands and walks away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it! Now you didn't have it at all what are you gonna do now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFly-mom P.O.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you got the remote away from Jessica, as you hope she had fun with bringing her toys to life, you realized it and been 59 minutes so you quickly depossessed Martin and turned opaque again. When you looked at him he looked distressed and a little frightened, \"this is what happens when you don't follow mommy's rules, Martin, do better next time and I'm really getting interested in the pamphlet good work on that at least sweetie!\" He just looked blank and his lip quivered a bit as he spoke \"cool m-mom\" \"alright now to downstairs and set the table, dinner will be ready soon\" he did and walked away with a little limp, it felt great to be a mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin's P.O.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never wanted to be possessed again, it was like being stuck in tar and having to watch someone else act like you, he couldn't feel anything that fly-mom did it touched but could watch it all to down and honestly it was pretty terrifying how badly she impersonated him but Jessica didn't even seem bothered. You just wanted it all to be over with but you didn't know whom you wanted to win, on one side, the real mom had unknowingly told you she plan by inhabiting your body which wasn't as bad as being possessed since it felt more like being in the passengers seat instead of in a locked crate in the trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real moms plan seemed to be good willed but then again everything would go back to normal and the remote would probably be destroyed after her plan was over. The fly-mom's plan was very bad willed but seems really cool and she would probably let you be second-in-command. All you knew was that you wanted to we which side won, and he was going to play both sides until one side won and that meant dishes were going to have to be placed on the table so he could learn how new world better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose P.O.V. should we follow now?</span></div></div>",

Mom really wanted Jenna to get out of the house, but Dad was too nice to send her away without a career and while she was still in college.   Mom was also very proud of Jessica and Megan, who were doing so well in school.  And your Dad, well they weren't fighting, but deep down in your mother's subconscious, you felt her desperation. Upon further inspection, you realize your Mom and Dad hadn't had sex in over a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No wonder I felt so goddamn horny.</i> You thought.  Deep down, you still felt that, but you pushed that biting feeling aside.  Your Mom had the patience of a saint, apparently.  You knew you didn't have that same kind of patience.  Dad was away at an education conference for the weekend, meaning you had to either get laid or get the hell out of this body, before you do something that you'll regret.</span></div></div>",

I'm off to tennis, think Jenna's going out so you'll be home alone\"<br>\r\n\"Oh okay?\" Megan replies quite chilled about it, being a shy reserved person she preferred to be alone anyway.

You cross your arms under your naked breasts, kind of offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you bought this for like 5 minutes, you wanted to have sex me with, <i>Martin</i>, in case you forgot, and now you're chickening out?  Are you serious?  Your first chance to get into a vagina and you literally pussy out?\"  You shout at him, man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Martin... This is too weird,\" he replies walking towards the door, awkwardly, trying to reduce his reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously are gonna deny this?\"  You grab both of your boobs in both and and jiggle them around.  Marco starts to fiddle with the doorknob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit Marco!\" You say, quickly running up and grabbing him by the collar, using all your strength and dragging him unwillingly to the bed. \"I'm too horny to let you just leave.  So how we gonna do this? Are you going to make sweet love to me, or am I going to have to make you love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't all you, this was a lot of Mom's sexual frustrations that she hides everyday showing through your personality.  She was incredibly strong willed to control these urges, while you weren't so strong willed.  The thought of sexual contact was coursing through your body like a virus, making you very physically wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will you approach this situation?</span></div></div>",

Don't do this.\" Marco pleaded, backing away from the extremely turned on naked milf slowly pinning him against the bed's headboard and long soft breathes across his nervous, sweaty visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may say that...\" You grip the lump in his shorts and it snaps to attention. \"But a friend of your's disagrees.\"  You began to rub it sensually, and he began to cringe in sheer ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-M-... I can't...\"  He whimpered pathetically, writhing in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's my name?\" You say in a sultry tone, nose to nose with your former best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Martin.\"  He tries replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I am Helen Remy, proud mother of three beautiful children,\" You say defiantly, as you start to finger yourself, \"And I am <b>sooo</b> happy you befriended my son.  He would be nothing without his friend Marco.\"  Wave after wave of pleasure pulsed through your body. \"But Marco, I have been... nnngh... neglected.  My needs, not as a mother,\" You move your free hand from fumbling with the lump in Marco's pants to his button.  You unwillingly remove your finger from your soaked lady bits to help remove Marco's trousers.  \"But as a woman. And now that you're here... I can finally fulfill my needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed Marco's shorts to reveal his throbbing member surrounded by a forest of unkempt bush.  He looked ready to burst already.  But then a thought occurred to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit, wait.</i> You think, pausing to stair at his six inch giant. <i>What the fuck am I supposed to do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to Porno's, and your few brief sexual encounters.  You had no idea where any condoms were, or lube.  Your wet ladybits should suffice, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go return your gaze to Marco, waiting in anticipation, his eyes hungry for your limber 40 year old self.  You head straight for his lips, pecking gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about when you first laid eyes on me, Marco, as a women.\"  you ask, quietly, pecking on his neck, feeling his warm member push against your midriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh... When I was thirteen, I saw your bathing suit malfunction, showing one of your...\" Marco moved his hand and squeezed your breast firmly. You let out a small moan of pleasure, pleasure that had been sealed away for almost a year.  You didn't feel ready for it, your mind went numb with animal instinct.  You grabbed him by the back of his neck and stuck your tongue down forcefully his throat, caressing his gently as your body melted together.  A part of you screamed that this was your best friend, that this was completely wrong on so many levels, but it was being overpowered by your mother's pure animal drive.  This body you occupied needed this, and it wasn't going to let go until it was finished, no matter how many friendships it broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke loose and began kissing his neck once more. \"You saw my beautiful body.  What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I jacked off, Mrs. R-R-emmmmy.  For the f-first time in my life.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it feel?\" You say, kissing down his skinny torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... Like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\"  You start to kiss the tip of his members, and then you start licking, then sucking, making it wet.  He gropes your boob more, sending wave after wave of pleasure working toward your brain, but his hand stay clear of your vagina.  He was nervous. How adorable.  You taste precum fly out of the tip of his member.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... t-time.\"  You take a good look at your unkempt female genitals.  You admire their beauty once more before squatting over the writhing best friend and lowering yourself onto him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaa... Aaaaaaaah.\" You moan and writhe, your legs start shaking uncontrollably.  Your mind goes blank. This feeling is nothing you ever experienced before.  It is pure euphoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly pump yourself up and down in a steady rhythm,  making sure not a single part of your luscious inner wall missed this pleasure. \"AAAAaaaaaa.... F-Fuck! Fuuuuck!  God <b>Damn!</b> AaaaaAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake violently, losing your rhythm, but Marco isn't done yet, finally, the feeble best friend unknown to the world of women takes charge.  He pushes you down against the soft comforter of the bed and begin hammering you, harder than even you could muster.  \"YES! MARCO! OH <b>GOD!</b>  I CAME FROM THERE MARCO! HAHA! Auuughh!\"  Marco isn't slowed down by that offsetting remark, and you're too lost in your Mom's pleasure to care.  You reach your peak. You find it hard to breath and your body starts to shake violently.  You watch Marco's expression. Confusion- then immense pleasure as he falls face first into your tits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm trickle enters your vagina, sparking another violent shake before you finally cool down, regaining the lost portions <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\"  Marco says, breathing heavy against your double-D's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' right.\" You reply, still very consciously aware of Marco's flaccid dick still deep inside you.</span></div></div>",

Feeling better than ever, you moaned harder, whilst trying to stifle your moans so that hopefully no one could hear you. \"OOH! DAMN!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco chuckled while also groaning from the intense pleasure. \"Your pussy is tighter than before, Helen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pussy tightened at his mention of your mother's first name.

I can't fuck your Mom, and I don't see why you would be so ready to fuck me either! Not that the idea of fucking your Mom isn't totally making me hard.\"  He pointed to the bulge in his cargo shorts. \"But like, I wouldn't fuck you, and I wouldn't I expect you to fuck me, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your arms on your naked hips defiantly. \"Marco Fernandez Hermida  the Third.  You have boobs and a vagina all ready to play with and you deny them.  Tsk Tsk.

Do you ever hear how that sounds?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, but then smile, hatching a brilliant plan.  You retrieve the remote from the foot of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Marco. Have it your way.\" He puts up his hands to try and somehow stop you, but is greeted with the out of body sensation you are now familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now find yourself on the bed, holding the remote, with the familiar sensation of a boner pushing against the inside of year pants.  You feel it mindlessly.  Marco's actually a bit less endowed then you are, but he's got bigger balls, probably from masturbating so much.  You were pleased to see that the remote was still in your possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco on the other hand, was disoriented and playing with his new boobs.  \"Dude.\"  He said, jiggling them mindlessly.  You noted how weird it felt to see your Mom playing with herself mentally, but not physically, as your boner was snapping to attention even more. \"Boobs are awesome no matter what gender you are.\" He moved his hands down his flat, thin abdomen, until they finally reached his new hardware.  \"Uhhh.\"  He moved his hand down slightly more until it accidentally brushed against his clitoris.  One of his knees gave out weakly. \"Hoh shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regained composure and decided to stop playing with himself, turning to me in his body, sitting on the big, full erection persisting, with the remote in hand. \"Not cool,\" he said, \"I want my balls back. That's just not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, feeling Marco's Latino vocal cords bouncing around my throat. \"Nah, man.  It's perfectly fair.  You didn't want me to fuck you, if I recall.  Now you get to fuck me.\"  You remove your shirt, pants, and underwear to reveal your raging boner underneath.  You cross your legs casually, and looked up at Marco, now your own mother, expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in the world would I do that?\" He said defiantly, though you could see a small twitch in her downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, Marco.\"  You twirled the remote fluidly in your hands. \"It's either me or my Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?\"  He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Dad won't get here until 10 PM.\" You pointed at the digital clock. \"It's 2:30 right now.  That means you'll have seven and a half hours to stay as my Mom.  You can probably tell she's horny as hell.\" Marco frowned, showing your Mom's lines, and nodded. \"She hasn't had sex in almost a year. Can you imagine? Being in that bombshell and having no one to detonate you? I could barely control it as it is.  But with this, I can control you fairly well.\"  You show him the remote's multiple buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm the only one who can use it.\" You bluff, but you're fairly sure he won't check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.\" He said, insulted. \"That's sick. You're making me have sex with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.\" You reply, \"I'm enacting the Scallenni Sister's clause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco gasped, causing his boobs to jiggle dramatically when he was taken aback. \"But... Bro... That's for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember dude.  Two sisters. One was extremely hot, the other was a complete whale. Not funny, not smart, just fat and horny. I took that bullet for you, and you still struck out with her sister. You owe me. And it's time to pay up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit!\" You heard Marco say, ripe with your Mom's feminine voice.  \"Alright, fine.  But only because this body is incredibly horny, and if I don't get out of it soon I'll end up in a blood rage fucking a lawn chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then,\" you say smiling. \"What's your choice?

She was the type of mother who was overprotective after watching one too many segments on Oprah about children ignoring their parents and causing trouble on their own, doing drugs, joining gangs, getting arrested etc. She really needed to lighten up and realize that not all children will end up that way. Being Helen would probably be the better option that you can run the family your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was your three sisters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna, a twenty year old college track athlete. she has a very athletic body, firm B size breasts, a firm ass and thighs to boot. But she acts like a total bitch and is rude to you and your other siblings. Obviously being her would put her in her place since you could get revenge acting and pummeling her to the ground for everything she's done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was your sister Megan, a sixteen year old shy kid who loved to drawn and didn't stand out in the crowd as much. You tried perking up her reputation but the poor girl is too shy from doing anything group related or making new friends, so you kind of felt bad for her. You felt you could be able to trust her with your secret and have her get to know what its like being you and having friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally there was Jessie. Your nine year old baby sister. Jessie is a complete brat and drama-queen who is starved for attention. She must have picked it up from Jenna's attitude why she acts that way. Strangely, the third grader loves to spoil her appetite with cookies and will do anything to have one. Do you really want to take that chance and be this problem child?

Immediately he stopped auto-pilot mode and regained control of his mother's body.  He headed out of his parents' room, and he then saw his sister Jessica.  She seemed distracted as she was just standing there at the door to enter her room examining herself, as if she was uncomfortable and wanted a change of clothes.  It hadn't registered for Martin why she was doing that however as he had already been taking a couple steps toward his sister when he saw <i><b>it</b></i>, the remote was in her hands.  He walked even quicker over to her and took it.  \"I'll be holding onto this, Jessica\" Martin said sternly.  He headed down the stairs past Jessica's friend and into the kitchen where he met up with Jenna.  She had looked extremely scared and confused.  \"What am I doing here in the kitchen? Ugh! Wasn't I just about to lay down for a nap?\"  She had said out loud to herself, while scratching her head.  Martin heard someone else coming into the kitchen and quickly put the remote in his pants pocket.  There he saw who he thought was Albert, completely unbeknownst to him that Albert had managed to brainwash swap with Jessica.  He seemed to had followed him into the kitchen, seeing this, Jenna flung her head up and went to ask 'Albert' something.  Martin watched in shock as Jenna and 'Albert' started to talk to each other, and even more surprised that it lasted more than thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, Martin went out of the kitchen for a moment to see if Jessica was still at the top of the stairs.  \"Jessica! Don't you have a project to do?\" He asked her in his best impression of his mother, tapping his feet and hands on his hips.  The real Albert headed towards and walked down the stairs with an evil grin on Jessica's face while Martin turned around and went back into the kitchen.  He wouldn't have believed it if he didn't see it earlier, but now he saw Jenna and 'Albert' laughing together.  One of them had probably told a joke but he could not understand why Jenna was bothering to talk to one of Jessica's friends for more than she had needed to.  Then it clicked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin figured that Jessica had used the remote on Jenna.  <i>Of course! That's why she was standing there disoriented.  She used the yellow button to possess her and was just getting out of it when he had showed up</i> He thought to himself.  Not in any rush to go and help Jenna out so soon, he decided to grab a glass of iced tea from the fridge.  'Jessica' came into the kitchen to get 'Albert' and continue with the project.  Jenna finished talking to 'Albert' and then looked a bit sad as 'Jessica' took 'Albert' and went outside. Jenna then went out of the kitchen and up towards her room, where Martin thought to follow right away but decided against it, as to give Jenna some time to herself and possibly set up to see something good when he would finally check on her.</span></div></div>",

Inside her room you take stock of your surroundings. Megan's room is filled with fantasy stuff: videogames, books, comics, even some movies. Final Fantasy posters are on the walls right alongside some animes like Bleach and a <i>Thor </i>comic is on the nightstand next to her bead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as how Megan is now conviced she's her mother, you figure you should take the chance to try and help your sister socially. She had a pretty secluded circle of friends, being really shy, and was rather constantly bullied by some mean students in her classes. Maybe you could build her up a bit so that when she returns to her body she would have a less miserable time at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the mirror, you take note of her unruly hair and fairly flat features. It's going to be a daunting task to make her fit in, but you think you can handle it. </span></div></div>",

You always protected her though when you could and along with your girlfriend Sarah, had always served as her pillar of strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking over this, you felt bad for her and didn't want her to go through with this anymore so your plans had suddenly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the yellow pad and do some studying up on the remote and found what you were looking for, however you get interrupted by none other than Megan who enters your room and closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, what's up?\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't specifically tell you this, but uh I'll be going away for about a week.\" - Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where?\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our school has yearly sophomore camping trips, up in the mountains. Clear Lake Camp.\" - Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man that's right!\" - you remember<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but.... I've never gone camping before. And our whole class is going to be going. About seventy people too.\" - Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's practically everyone! You... oh damn!\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to go!!! You know how badly I get treated on an eight hour school day, but spending a week overnight with those same people. I can't live with them and their rude intentions.\" - Megan sulks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please come with me Martin! I couldn't get Sarah to come because she has prom this week and graduating, you're the only other one I can turn to.\" - Megan asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly could Megs, but they won't let me. We're not in the same grade, plus I couldn't watch over you since I'd be in a different bunker. I'm sorry.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess i'm alone then.\" - Meg whimpers then goes back to her room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out the remote and clutch it in your hands:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not ..........\" - you say confidently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpending a while reading up on the yellow pad, you learn more and more about the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking some adjustments to your family members, you vanish into thin air and re-emerge as a yellow floating spirit thanks to the Remotes Ghost mode feature. You fly over and see Megan fully packed and sitting on a chair surfing the net. Taking a breath in your immortality you fly over and touch her body causing you to overwhelm and possess her. A split second later you find yourself AS Megan looking at the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had access to Meg's life now, can now actively tap into her memories like a book and control her however you wanted. Megan though, you could feel her consciousness along with you, but she is in a dormant sleep state. You however, had other plans for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever doing this before, you start relinquishing control over your host but keep your overall possession of her. You start 'WAKING' up her consciousness and allow her to regain control on her own body again. She disorients a bit thinking it was a dizzy spell but now Meg is back in control again however you are still within her mind looking over her as a conscience now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes as you just watch Meg act on her own and let her do her own thing, she gets up and looks outside to see the school bus arriving to pick her up to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I don't want to do this!\" - Meg whines<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear this and just randomly blurt out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay strong Meg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you said starts having an affect on Meg. She couldn't hear what you said unless you directly spoke to her but it manifested itself as intuition and a feeling, and Meg started feeling a little better about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta do this.\" - Meg says confidently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed you had the ability to unknowingly influence Megan. She couldn't know you were possessing her so you could make suggestions and she would interpret them as her own feelings or emotions. You practically could make her feel however you wanted and she would think it was all her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gets one of her bags to load up on the bus until she was stopped by Sarah your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Meg. I see you're leaving. I'm SO SO Sorry I couldn't go with you. I honestly wanted to.\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, uh no it's alright. Thank you.\" - Megan says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to help you load all those bags?\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please!\" - Meg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Sarah through Meg's eyes and noticed the new outfit she had on. It was very appealing to you that you wanted to see her, however you could do that later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Sarah, looking hot.\" -you say in Meg subconscious, which later caused a change to Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan loads up the first of four marked bags before she takes a look at Sarah again. Thanks to your little comment, Megan starts getting a little flustered and starts finding Sarah attractive exactly in the way you have for her yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, are you okay?\" - Sarah says looking at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little fine, b-b-but... I uh.... I got one more bag. And I gotta go!!\" - Meg squeaks and runs into the house<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn it, now I just made Meg sexually attracted to Sarah! Now I got competition\"</i> - you roll your eyes and let Meg board the bus to camp</span></div></div>",

While walking by  Lisa starts to talk to Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Four-eyes, Go join the rest of the dork patrol back there.\" and the popular kids start laughing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis immediately caused Megan to go back to her old shy self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ignore her Meg\" You say, and almost immediately, Meg sighs then stops thinking about Lisa and starts to take out her notepad to draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends then start giving her ideas on what to draw but it was mostly stuff you didn't care about, things like My Little Pony and World of Warcraft stuff. You decide to go and try to get her to draw something you both liked. You figured it would be nice if she drew the Crescendolls from Interstella 5555 since you liked Daft Punk and Meg liked anime stuff.  \"Why not draw the Crescendolls?\" You say to Meg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it\" You see Megan say to her friends as she reaches into her bag and pull out a picture of the fictional band and starts to draw them. You watch Meg for a while seeing as how thats about the only thing you can do besides taking control of Megan or 'sleep'. You are amazed at how fast she is at drawing, however you soon get bored and start to drift off.  Megan eventually stops drawing  after a while and starts to daydream as well.  You can see that she is dreaming about the camp and thinking that it will be horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop thinking about camp.\" You tell her, and Megan stops daydreaming and instead starts listening to music on her iPod and talks to her friends with minimal interruptions from Lisa every so often for the rest of the trip.<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at camp Megan and you get off the bus and the teachers divide the students up and start handing out schedules. Megan and her friends got theirs first and start to get their bags ready when you hear hear Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT! This can't be right. I have to room with these losers?\" Lisa yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but your cabin is being worked on so we have to split you and your friends up into the other cabins.\" The teacher says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not put me in a different cabin?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't\" The teacher responds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Lisa asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough. All the other cabins are full and you will have to make do with what you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, come on geek squad.\" Lisa says reluctantly, as she goes and walks fast with her luggage to avoid being seen, while Megan and her friends trail behind talking while heading up to the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking to the cabin the teacher lets everyone in the cabin to unpack before starting on first activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great just what I needed, to be stuck with a bunch of nerds.\" Lisa sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let her talk about you and your friends that way!\" You tell Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put up or Shut up!\" Megan fiercely replies to Lisa, with her friends following her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen pointdexter, just because i'm stuck here with you and your nerdy friends dosen't mean I have to like it. I may have to talk to you in here but outside I don't want you geeks anywhere near me.\" Lisa told Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The feeling is mutual.\" Megan answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You figured this would be one giant step in your relationship if she went with it. You continue reading the devices notes until you see Sarah's car pull up in your driveway. Sarah comes out and enters your house and is greeted by your mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah finally heads up in your room and enters. Sarah Johnson, your girlfriend, has known you since childhood, she's a very attractive African American girl with a cute smile, and a figure to boot. She has nice D-cup breasts, curvy legs and butt, and a unique laugh. You and her have been the best of friends, making each other laugh, and overall having the best time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Martin, whats up?\" She says as she sits on your chair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much, say guess what I found?\" You say as you pull out the device and show her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Sarah says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a body swap device.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just looks at you and laughs. Something tells you she doesn't believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now, there's no such thing.\" She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you heard those word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll prove it to ya, stand right in front of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plays along and stands before you face to face. You close the door and face Sarah and put the red button for Normal swap. Just then you black out, then reawaken and find yourself feeling your new long black frizzy hair on your shoulders. Looking down you see Sarah's red top and her large breasts which are now a part of you. You look up and staring at you face to face is your own body with a face stricken with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD! No way!!! No WAY!!!!\" Your body says in complete surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nuts! Oh man! Look at me!! I'm you!!\" Sarah as you says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha, yes, told ya it would work babe.\" You say in Sarah's soft voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opens and your younger sister Jessie explodes in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY POOP HEAD! MOM SAYS TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH!!\" Jessie yells in an obnoxious loud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO TO YOUR ROOM YOU LITTLE BRAT! I'LL DO IT RIGHT NOW!!\" You suddenly yell out loud, but then you forget who you really are and actually yell in Sarah's soft voice, which gives a look of shock to Sarah whose in your body. Not once has she ever yelled like that or that loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn.\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What she said. I'll do it right now then.\" Your girlfriend says as you and heads off and takes the trash outside and basically does that chore for you. You just stand there completely embarrassed as Sarah and just laugh it off. Jessie looks at you weird and just ignores it and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah as you, returns and then asks more about being this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say how about we stay this way for a few days? Who knows it'll be interesting and fun for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your own eyes and think about it. Sarah was an only child and had a mom and dad obsessed with sports just like you were. You always wondered what it would be like to not have evil siblings driving you mad all the time, and you sure didn't want to let her live through all that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, my sisters can be a handful and will drive you crazy. I don't know if I can let you deal with that.\" You say as Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on now, we have this little device here to change all that, ha ha.\" Sarah as you points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, you could choose to live Sarah's life for about a week and change some of your family so that Sarah wouldn't have to suffer being annoyed to death. There were other options on this device that you can have fun with so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide:</span></div></div>",

You walk down the stairs to find your old mother sitting down drinking coffee and waves bye to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the remote in your pocket, you head to your new car. You test out more powers of the swap and realize you can have Sarah's body act out on its own. You try it out and release your hold on her body and she begins to move towards her car. You wonder if you could command this body to do things on its own, so you think up, opening the car door, get in, rolling the window down, turn on the radio to a certain station, and get Sarah's sunglasses in her glove compartment and put them on and finally start the car. You issue all those commands into Sarah's temporary subconscious as you stand in place. With surprise Sarah's body automatically, gets her keys, and opens the car door, she gets in, and then begins to roll the window down, and turns on the radio to AM310, a Spanish music channel, then she reaches to her glove compartment and pulls out her favorite sunglasses and puts them on, she starts the car and the drops her hands to her lap and does nothing which means its time for the next orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a minute and manually take over her body again not risking this autopilot mode when you're out on the road. The last thing you need is you bang up your girlfriends body, AND car in an accident, so you tap into Sarah's memory and apply her driving of this car and apply it to you. You change the station and begin to leave the driveway as you smile heading on out. You make a decision whether you want to go to Sarah's home yet or go somewhere else. Since its the first day of summer vacation, why not head to the pool and flaunt your new body off getting some rays. Or head home to your new family and live Sarah's life.</span></div></div>",

For one week, you'll live your life as Sarah Johnson, your hot, attractive girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up the driveway and shut off the engine. You run towards the front door and almost knock but stop since this is now your house and you can't do that. You open the door to find your new parents Jack and Alisha in the living room. Jack has the day off of work as does Alisha. Your new parents see you and wave hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You say with a smile on your face. You got along well with Sarah's parents. Unlike your strict mother who constantly has to keep a watch on you and your sisters at all times, Sarah's mother loved you, heck even more than your own mother Helen cared to show. Jack also likes you because of your huge interest in sports and often times went with the Johnson's to several baseball games. Overall the family considers you as their own son and right for Sarah. For this reason, you're even more excited living with these wonderful people for a week.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up to Sarah's room and lock the door. Sarah's room comprised of a mishmash of a girly room, stuffed animals, books, a desktop computer, printer, laptop, a camera for her photography profession, a large bed, and a few weights on the ground. She has a pretty well rounded room. You jump onto her huge bed and just lie there in happiness. You pull out the body swap remote device and examine it more. After a few minutes you put it aside and get off the bed to try out more of your control over Sarah's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased from the Normal Swap you did with Sarah, you learned that you not only can become another person, but also allow the body itself to act on its own while you release control of the body's temporary brain. You can also order Sarah's subconscious to do whatever you want without willing to do it yourself. And whats great is that her brain wont react at all since you've taken Sarah's place in her life. You assume Sarah knows this as well, sooner or later. You have more control than you ever had in your own body. So you decide to test it out more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release control of Sarah's body and have her move on her own. You observe as Sarah takes out her IPod and sits on her bed listening to music and looking over a magazine. The freewill seems to be working right as this is something Sarah would usually do and she loves music. Next you begin to test out her taking orders. You regain control again and order Sarah's body to stand in front of her mirror in her closet. She immediately gets up and like a zombie walks toward the mirror. She stares at the mirror with a blank look on her/your face and you begin the next test. You wonder if you can also control the persons emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell worth the try as you order her body to start crying. Just then tears begin flowing down your cheeks, as you watch your girlfriend starts to cry her eyes out. Feeling guilty you immediately cancel the order and she stops. You regain control and dry off your tears as Jack Sarah's Dad tells you through the door that he and Alisha are heading to the ballgame right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, have fun you two.\" You yell back. Sarah was not much of a sports fan, but it didn't stop you from trying to convert her in the past. You feel guilty that you weren't able to go with them, but you definitely didn't want to pass up being alone checking out more of what the device can do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go all the way and check out this body more in-depth. Which means checking out Sarah in her full glory. You think back to your morals of doing this to your girlfriend and wondering if its right or not. But then you get a thought, perhaps Sarah knew you would do this and trusted you enough to pull it off. She was smart and had a copy of your brain so she could easily know if you'd do it or not. Then again, you could order Sarah's body to strip by itself. You have no control over it so why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming to the conclusion you go for it, but what to do:</span></div></div>",

Sarah in your body would feel the same way and experiment with her new \"Devices\", since it is a new experience for the both of you. Sarah's folks left to the ballgame so you're all alone at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo see if your control works, you order Sarah's body to remove her red shirt and jeans. You wonder if Sarah's body has any conscience and might refuse your order or something, but strangely, the body unbuttons Sarah's red shirt and then removes it completely revealing her black spaghetti strap bra and her size D breasts. Your girlfriend then unbuttons her pants and pulls them down and throws them on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend Sarah stands in front of the mirror in her bra and red panties with a blank expression on her face, awaiting your next order. You then order her to remove the bra and take off the panties. And as a zombie she complies and removes the bra and panties. A minute later you find your childhood friend now girlfriend's beautiful body staring right at you in the mirror. The sunlight shines through her window onto her/your dark skin as you bask in all her glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at how she's developed into a beautiful woman, ever since you've known her in elementary school as you're breasts begin to get hard. You regain control of her as you lie on her big bed. You begin folding her large breasts and in return you feel a surge of pleasure that you moan in return. After a few minutes of groping you  move onto her lower vaginal area and begin to \"explore\". Wave after wave of intense pleasure overwhelms you as your legs spaz out from the overwhelming enjoyment your inflicting upon yourself. You never felt anything like this before in your life as a guy and enjoy every minute of it now as a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your orgasm subsides, you get up off the bed and dry yourself off after that episode and go take a shower, once again admiring your girlfriends curvaceous body, You make mental notes in your head on how you wish to repay her for being so great to you after all these years, now that you've experiences sex as a female. <br>\r\nYou return to your room in the buff and open up Sarah's drawers to wear something.  You put on yellow panties with a happy face on the butt and wondering why she'd have these in the first place. You tap into her mind and learn she doesn't like these and think they're stupid and lame, but to you, they're pretty cool and retro, so you keep em on. You find a bra and struggle putting it on. Again you tap into her mind and figure it out yourself. You throw on a white T-shirt, a pink jacket, black track pants and some tennis shoes and you're set. You leave her hair straight since you liked her hair that way. You take the device and head on downstairs into your new kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure on how to cook, you look in the fridge and find some leftover meat loaf and throw it in the microwave and chow down. Once you're finished, you find yourself bored again so you whip out Sarah's cell phone. She has a list of friends on there including your number as well as some of her best friends. Since you're Sarah, you  might as well get to know her friends better, so you scroll over to her friends lists and decide to call one or more girlfriends up and hang out.   </span></div></div>",

Your girls's brown tan legs in sandals kicking the back of the chair in front of you bored for the long 8 hour flight to Hawaii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you gathered, your father's niece Krystal was killed in a car accident in Hawaii three days prior, Jack was notified and brought the family along to set up the funeral services. From Sarah's standpoint, she and you didn't know much about Krystal and weren't directly involved with her so there wasn't as much sympathy, but it is family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting alone, you forgot to tag along Sarah's cell phone and you had a fear that if you used any electronic device that the plane would fall from the sky. That's how paranoid you were because you were afraid of flying too and deep down you are screaming in pain that you want to land ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water? Mi'lady?\" - one of the older stewards offers you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-tttt-t-tt-t-t-tthanks.......\" - you gulp as you take the bottle, and struggle to open it because you are shaking nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents are a few seats back and don't seem to notice the nervous wreck that you've become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the bottle and struggle keeping it still trying to drink until you get your fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder how Sarah's doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, this isn't good for her health. I gotta calm down. Maybe I'll take a nap..... but I might be dead...... AAAAAAAH! I hate flying. I hate flying. I hate flying....... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a girl passes by your row and looks down at you. The girl is very tall about six feet and one of her noticeable features is that her blonde hair reaches to the back of her thighs. Pretty long hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I sit here?\" - the girl asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-g-g-gg-g-ggo ahead.....\" - you stutter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits and puts down her cell phone. After a minute, the blond looks over at you still shaking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? Flying jitters?\" - Blond<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-y-yy-y-y-y-yeah. I just wanna go home! I didn't want to fly out here!!!! I just wanna be on the ground safely and go back to my girfrliends house! On level, solid ground!\" - You erupt painfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. Its normal to be freaked flying. Girlfriend huh, you swing that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it hit you that you blurted that out: \"Whatever, I'm gonna die, I don't care anymore what I say. Thanks for trying to console me eh.......\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Melanie.\" - Melanie says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ma.... Sarah. I gotta say your hair is pretty unique. Tall too!\" - You (as Sarah)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like my hair so much I let it grow out. This is how long I'm keeping it though. It doesn't get in the way that much playing basketball.\" - Mel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you play b-ball?\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, center for my college's girls team. \" - Mel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool. Man I just wanna land and get this trip over with!\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vacation?\" - Mel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funeral for two months. My niece. It's gonna be a looooong two months!\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well my condolences. I'm just on break with some friends. My boyfriend broke up with me so I'm just taking this trip with my friends and teammates and taking it easy coping.\" - Mel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry about that.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you're interested in Mel's stories, you cannot shake your anxiety of flying that its starting to make you upset. You really wish you had the remote with you so you could swap with someone or reset the switch. Melanie takes out her cell and calls a friend. You do your best closing your eyes and trying to breathe. Its not until you open your eyes that you notice your fingernails begin to sparkle and glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What is..... this? Am I hallucinating?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a backpack and try to hide your hands from Mel's view. You definitely feel odd as this cannot be from the shitty airline food. You notice your fingers begin glowing yellow. Just then you feel different again this time coming from your hands and you pull away and find yourself holding the switch remote in your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Son of a...................?! How did this get here?! Did I summon this here?! My nails stopped glowing too. This is probably what happened. I can summon the remote at my beck and call.....\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you were the \"Owner\" of this device it must have developed a \"bond\" with you as it materialized in your hand. Well you didn't want to put yourself in a situation where you wanted to switch, but it could be fun all the same to ease your mind off the flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Mel again and check her out. She was incredibly tall, long athletic legs, blue eyes, and long blond her that goes way past her butt. She is an athlete too. That much you know. Do you want to give Mel a spin and see her life or perhaps put this thing away and when you land enjoy your vacation?</span></div></div>",

You sounded convincing when you were going on earlier.\" - Meg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Well. Yeah, I am in here and its very weird obviously. My mind has full control of this body and I can do alot of things with this body. Make it run on autopilot if need be. Watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mentally release my hold on this brain and program it to run normally. While doing this, I can have access to Martin's memories and view them or edit them if need be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....? Meg whats up? Why am I on the floor?\" - Martin's body says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, are you in there?\" - Meg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you calling me Sarah, Meg?\" - Martin's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan remains silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nature calls, I'll be back and you wanna hang with me for a few? Catch a flick or something? The Dark Knight is playing in theaters.\" - Martin's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin's body leaves to the toilet. Megan sits there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree minutes later, Martin's body reenters the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin?\" - Meg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, its Sarah. I kinda took over again and was in another awkward position. Ah......\" - Sarah (as you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha. Your body took control again and startled me a bit. This Martin though was a nice guy.\" - Meg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us head to Martin's room where I showed Meg the device and its features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you want to try it out?\" - Sarah says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest. No. I really want to work on my people skills and confidence. Being another person is just running away. Besides.......\" - Meg<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg looks at you and smiles: \"I always wanted to be your sister. When you're this way Sarah, I feel I can talk with you more better. Martin was the one who tried to get me out of my shell, and I always was thankful for you saving my butt from bullies all the time. I want to be your sister and we could bond more. Two weeks right?

She would be the perfect target to test this out on. Jenna loved to work out and loved to get in shape. She loved to work out and had the body to show for it. She has average sized B-cup breasts, was very tall at about 5'11, long shapely legs, and a good ass to boot. The only thing that needed changing was her attitude problem. She was very mean to you and your sisters and needed to be punished badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aim the device at your jogging sister in the window and put your thumb on the blue Brainwash swap button so that she'll think she's you. The last thing you need right now is your bitchy sister yelling whats going on your body and causing trouble for you like being grounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push the button and suddenly black out. You then wake to find yourself out in the middle of the street standing on the sidewalk. You look up to see your house in the distance from the faint light of the morning sky. You look down to find two breasts on your body in a workout bra, and track pants revealing your two long legs and firm ass. You look up at your right hand to find the device there. It traveled there along with you when you switch, you concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the other hand and honk your left breast, and sure enough you feel slight pleasure after doing that. Yup, you're really her, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jog back towards your house where you enter in the kitchen door and are greeted by your parents Helen and Bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey, how was your jog?\" Your dad asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty damn good.\" You say with a huge smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run upstairs to where you old room is to find your body which is actually your sister Jenna brainwashed into thinking she's you lying on the bed asleep. She must have assumed that you woke up abruptly and decided to go back to sleep. you enter your old room, throw off the covers and spank your old body in the ass, grab and pull her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAHH! What are you?!!!!\" Your sister as you says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like its MY turn to have some fun with you. Stick around you tramp.\" You slap your own face cheeks with a palmed hand and head off to your new room. Your sister, who is you wonders what happened and just went back to sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go up to Jenna's room, which is now your room now and look around. You wouldn't be caught dead coming in here, but since you're now in control, this room is ripe for exploring. You pull out a full length mirror to see your sister Jenna staring right into the mirror. You smile with your sisters perfect white teeth and let her dark brown hair down past her shoulders. You decide to check out your sister more, but what should you do, enjoy this body under a cool shower, you were drenched in sweat after the long jog Jenna did, or say screw it, lock the door and check out Jenna's body up close. You had no conscious or guilt feeling up your actual sister for all the torment she put you through, so who cares....</span></div></div>",

You then reached for the clothes. From Jenna's dark red and black sports top, you removed it and found her white track bra on. You blush as you remove your hair band and let her flowing and drenched hair out. She came from a long jog and workout and hadn't showered but you still didn't care about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached for her track pants and ripped them off in one gesture revealing Jenna's white panties. You gulp and get queasy for a second because this is the first time you'd ever see your evil sister this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sucking it up, you remove the two pieces of clothing and stare seductively in the mirror. You flaunt various poses, blow kisses and say things like 'I AM track-Bitch! Hear me Roar!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop to Jenna's water bed and begin to play with yourself. You commence grabbing and fondling your sisters breasts until her moans were as loud as they could be. You then proceed to stick a finger below your slit and begin fingering yourself which in turn causes you to orgasm like crazy. You cant keep a straight thought as you're enjoying every surge of pleasure emanating from your hands to Jenna's sexual organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last fragments of thought in your head was pity because you were giving pleasure to the \"Evil One\", but then not really since its the person's mind who was at fault, the body is a vessel, so you continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour exhausted, you fall off the bed and lie on the floor. You're drenched in your own liquids that you really need a shower after all this. Staggering up you see Jenna's window midway opened and take notice of the neighboring house. The neighbor boy Cody Clark (14) was there watching you're little adventure. As you looked out in your naked glory he immediately closes the blinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of thinking you're pissed, you look out and can tell he's still staring. You blow a kiss to him and he runs off very surprised and stunned. If that didn't ruin Jenna, theres always room for more punishment. You throw on a loose nightgown and decide to head downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's after 7:30, your father is at work, Helen has taken Jessica to school, and your lazy ass brother of an older sister thinks she's a wiseass boy sound asleep, which means:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey could you keep it down?! You woke me up with all that moaning you did. We get the point, your body is incredible, so quit rubbing it in. You're lucky our folks weren't here through that. \" - Megan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave past her still wobbling it off and head downstairs for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And take a shower why don't cha?! Jeez!\" - Megan concludes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Well perhaps it was my doing, you know first time ever being inside a girl's body.\" You tell her apologetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin it's cool, you're a guy so it's understandable you wanted to try it out. But try to be a little more gently with my body.\" She tells you with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah!\" You shout out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's a good body Martin Rempy. You should be thankful I give you permission for it, most girlfriends wouldn't have allowed it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true Sarah, and uh thanks.\" You say looking interested at Sarah's flip flops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Martin, and you should call me Jenna as long as I'm in here.\" Sarah points at her body looking pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jenna.\" You emphasize the last word. \"But what do you want to do now?\" You ask Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks again in the mirror, bringing her hair together and pulls it up. \"Oh how I love that look.\" She says checking herself out. \"You were saying something Sarah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said Jenna, what do you want to do now?' You ask again not entirely sure of your decision of giving Sarah Jenna's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could each go our lives, you know, as in we pretend to be the persons in whose body we are in. For you to be Sarah and for me to be Jenna. Or we could hangout you know, go shopping or something else like that. Or we could try out the remote some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jenna discuss these plans some more and in the end decide on....</span></div></div>",

Why is your room different now?\"  Megan asks in her male sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when your mom heard all the yelling and headed upstairs to see what was going on.  \"Megan what are you doing in Martin's room?  Leave your sister alone!\"  She yelled at your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there incredibly confused, but powerless to really do anything.  You knew you had to get the remote back, but your new 'brother' was now stronger and faster than your nerdy girl body.  You decided to appeal to your mother instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom get her... him out of my room please?  And he took my remote, make him give it back!\"  You said in Megan's voice, the pouty teenage girl routine somehow coming naturally to you, without even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother looks at you with pity, obviously favoring her 'daughter's side of the story, but when she looks at Megan holding the remote, she simply furrows her brow.  \"What is this?  I don't remember either of you having something like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Megan can respond, your mother grabs the remote from her hand and looks at it closely.  \"Is this some kind of prank remote?  It doesn't even have channel numbers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mooooom!  It's mine and he took it!\" You whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't 'but Mom' me, I'm going to show this to your father and see what he thinks of it.  He's always up on these new techo gizmos.\"  Your mother says.  \"And I'm not going to tell you again, Megan, leave your sister alone!  And get out of her room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan seems to fold under the pressure, and leaves the room, walking into the hallway beside you, as you both eye the remote in your mother's hands.  She is gripping it firmly, and quickly leaves to go downstairs.  The two of you are left standing there in each other's bodies awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Megan and ask, \"So what the hell was that?!  You lost the remote!  And what did you mean my room is different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over her shoulder into your room, and notice it's still similar, but there are changes.  All of your clothes have been replaced by Megan's, as well as most of your games were replaced by anime, manga, and drawing supplies.  The strangest part was, you didn't feel like losing all your things was such a bad thing.  It wasn't like you were that attached to your sports equipment and video game collection. Were you?  You weren't sure anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird...\" you muttered in your female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do?\"  your new 'brother' asks from outside the room.</span></div></div>",

Megan doesn't mind that much when you come into her room either, mostly because you two get along much better than her and Jenna ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was all of that I heard as I was waking up Martin. I think I heard her call you a tramp too?\" She asks you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll tell you. I'll wait here, just go and make sure that Jenna's taking a shower or just somewhere that isn't near us.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan goes and leaves her room for a few minutes and comes back. \"Okay, I looked around and found Jenna. She went to go take a bath after she came home. Now what's going on Martin?\"  Megan asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Megan, I'll tell you. Do you know those RPG and manga stuff you like?  Well this remote I have can do things like in the games and manga.\" You explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has got to be the dumbest thing you have ever said to me, I mean you actually want me to believe that THAT remote can do crazy things--\" Megan keeps talking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Megan is still talking you go and bring up the remote and Normal Swap you and Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Even I know that stuff like that could not possibly happen.... in.... real.....life?\" You hear your body say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin...\" Megan says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Megs?\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I see myself?\" Megan asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All because of the remote, dear brother.\" You reply jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, you are freaking me out Martin.\" Megan demands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Okay, I'll undo it. But first I want you to sign something, and I'll sign it too.\" You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" Megan asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a paper, that says we won't use the remote on each other, unless we both agree of course.\" You explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that sounds fair, considering you didn't have to show me this remote in the first place, sister.\" Megan laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou write up a piece of paper and jot down that You and Megan will not use the remote on each other without consent from each other and you both sign it.  Then immediately afterwards You hit Undo button on the remote and Megan asks if it can do anything else.  You explain to Megan all of the features of the remote and she asks what you going to do now.

You grinned as you looked down at her, before flying off to Jenna's room where you found your older sister lazily texting in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hovered around her body for a while, loathing the sibling who had caused you so much pain in the last few years. As long as you remembered, there was nothing good that ever came to you and Megan from her. You and Megan had learned to live with her bitchy attitude with great discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as she clicked the 'Send' button before phasing right into her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ma-Martin?'', Megan stuttered as you reveal to her your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't you want to use it?'', you said as you put the remote in her hand, smiling widely at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No... I mean, it's too weird... It's other people's right and stuff like that...'', Megan pushed the remote back to your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aww, that's sweet.'', you cooed and leant forward to give her a big hug, in the process feeling two sets of B cup boobs pressing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You aren't going to do weird stuff with that remote right?'', Megan spoke again after you released the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, of course not.'', you said before you turned around. ''Why would I?'', unbeknownst to Megan, a devilish smile formed on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed at the ceiling, feeling the warm water enveloped your shapely body as you relaxed in the bath tub. It was like any person's dream to own something of this 'power'. You thought about what you could do with the remote, you were actually looking forward to school, too bad for the summer holiday. With this remote in your hand, everyday would be an exciting day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of possessing different people at school, maybe body swapping with them, changing their age or brainwashing them or maybe you could pass as your older sister and play with more bodies. You licked your lips and stared at the mounds of flesh, cupping them both appreciately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard sharp knocks on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uhm... Martin?'', came Megan's meek voice from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah? Whatsit?'', you replied while keeping your mind was still exploring your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What are you doing?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why... I'm taking a bath.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''WHAT? In- in Jenna's body?'', Megan half shouted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Shhh... You're gonna make Mom and Dad come up.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They already went out some time ago, just me, you and Jessica now.'', Megan said. ''It's... it's wrong Martin...it's just wrong.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh? Why not? After all, it's MY body, and so far as anyone is concerned, I AM Jenna now.'', you snickered before you reverted your attention back to your body. ''Who knows who I might be next?'', you added silently, feeling amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan decided not to bother trying to convince you anymore and at the same time, you felt regret at telling her about the remote. Megan was just too straight, too pure and too nice, maybe later you would be able to make her more 'adventurous by appealing to her more curious nature, but for the time being it seemed that Megan did not want to take part in any of your play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about calling Sarah, who knows what she had in mind if you showed her the omnipotent remote or Marco, you knew him well and he would really be fun, the two of you would have endless hours of fun with the remote. You sniggered at the thought of how Marco will jump at the prospect of the remote, probably messing about with some hot chicks and took their photos as souvenir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you remembered that they might have unexpected views towards the remote, like Megan did and so, as your fingers crawled down to your crotch, you began to ponder of your next move...</span></div></div>",

Besides Megan's right, I do feel a tiny bit of guilt swapping with you. We'll see what next time brings\" You say to yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit Jenna and think about what to do next.  Sarah was your girlfriend and Megan looked up to her a lot so even if Megan found out you told her about the remote she might not get that mad.  Marco, on the other hand, was a different story.  He would probably abuse the remote if he ever was left alone with it, you thought.  You exit ghost mode and text Sarah that you were coming over to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Arriving at Sarah's You knocked on the door and were greeted by Mrs. Johnson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Martin, Sarah is upstairs in her room.\" She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs. Johnson\" You say entering her house.  You start heading up the stairs as Sarah was coming out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Martin, what's up?\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I talk to you in private for a bit?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I guess, is everything alright? Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea everything's fine. Just need to tell you something.\" You reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out the remote.\"This might sound crazy, but everything I say about this remote is true.  This remote has the power to change anybody around it, such as you and me and swap them or gain the characteristics of anything in your room, as well as change their age. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I were to believe that, which is a big stretch, then you would be able to swap bodies with me, right?\" Sarah asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea that's about right\" You tell her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you waiting for. If you want me to really believe you let's get this show on the road already.\" Sarah says rushing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aim the device at Sarah and press the Normal swap button and swap with Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what was that.\" Sarah says, now in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.... that takes some getting used to.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you weren't lying. I have to admit, I thought you were starting to go crazy.  Man Sarah, you sure are looking great today.\" Sarah says as she does a 360 admiring her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I was born this beautiful\" Martin says confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround this time, Mrs. Johnson was coming up the stairs to check on Sarah. She knocks on the door and comes into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing up here alone?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing Mo--\" Sarah starts to say before you cover her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing Mom, Martin and I were just going and talking about what to do for today and talking about school.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well I'll be downstairs then.\" She says not noticing the remote as she heads downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was close. Sorry Martin.\" Sarah apologized<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Megs got a little bit freaked when I showed it to her too.\" You explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not freaked It's just- Wait, you showed it to Megan?  Does Jenna know about this too?\" Sarah frantically asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Jenna doesn't know about the remote yet. Although she's feeling a little bit weird since she barely remembers anything after her jog home this morning.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you switched with her and she doesn't remember a thing?\" Sarah questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I used different buttons to go and swap with her.\" You explain further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do that with Meg too?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I only did a regular swap like we did now. and then I signed an agreement that we wouldn't use the remote on each other without each other agreeing to swap.\" You tell her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, good. As long as you didn't go and take advantage of her\" Sarah replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never do that, she already has it bad with Jenna and the rest of those jerks at school. Also I almost forgot, I didn't tell her that I was going to talk to you, So she doesn't know that you know about the remote yet. I was going to talk to Marco or you, and well I figured you were a better choice than he was to tell.\" You assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now then?\" Sarah asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's keep this away from Marco for a while and maybe go get something to eat.\" You tell Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we just going to go this way or are you going to change us back?\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want to change back I'll change it.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just asking.

You may hate it, but I love it and as of 15 minutes ago you are Sarah Johnson and you will eat the filet-of-fish sandwich.\" She explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever but if I don't like it don't say I didn't tell you.\" You reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, when you take that first bite you are going to wish you could have a second sandwich.\" Sarah says opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went in the McDonalds and ordered food.  While on line, Sarah spotted \"Endless\" Mike, one of your schoolmates. and hoped that he didn't notice you or her.  It took about 5 minutes to get the food and sit down. That was around the time Endless Mike went and finished his food and was on his way out when he caught sight of you and came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...... Sarah.......... still hanging out with dweebs like this guy?\" Mike starts to say to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd rather go out with someone actual brains then a loser like you whose sense of humor comes from the pain of others.\" Sarah interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, butthead. You are one to talk anyway, not like you have any real brains.\" Mike retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone, besides it doesn't take brains to impress me. I like someone who can make me laugh.\" You say, interrupting Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that butthead, you still have a slim chance if you start cracking some jokes that are actually funny.\" Mike says towards Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike you who has no chance at all.\" Sarah quickly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. See you losers later.\" Mike says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Endless Mike finally left and it was chow time on that fish sandwich Sarah had ordered for you, while she was able to have chicken nuggets &amp; fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow.\" You say in delight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'm guessing by your reaction that I was right?\" Sarah questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. this thing is incredible, and yet I hate stuff like this, man Megan is missing out on all the fun.\" You tell Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is too shy, she'd probably love something like this, maybe I should go talk to her.\" Sarah says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that idea. I kinda didn't tell her I was going to show you the remote.\" You reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Why does that matter, it's not like you promised that you wouldn't tell anyone about it.\" Sarah explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but I promised not to use it on her without her knowing.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen it's not like I'd control her or Jenna.  Just don't give that thing to Marco or he'll go to town with your sister or any other girl for that matter. Come on, You want to help out Megan don't you\" Sarah says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine let's go find Megan then\" You reluctantly say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you finish your fish sandwich and start heading home with Sarah with your sodas in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, correct me if I'm wrong, but back there when Mike was talking about us, It sounded like you were implying I was smarter than you.\" Sarah says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Oh yea that I was just..... well I was trying to get Mike to stop bothering us somehow and well.\" You try to explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax.....Well, thanks anyway for the compliment.

You ask Marco<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what uh, yea sure.\" Marco says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I hotter than Martin's sister Jenna?\"  You ask him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.\" Marco replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. you are so easy to read. You like her more.  You know it. So what is it you like about her more than Sarah?\" Sarah asks, slightly laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I guess because she's just in shape and has a good body.\" Marco says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see so if I go for a jog everyday and start acting all bitchy to everyone. then you'd be after me instead of her.\" You snap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea probably, but that's why your with Martin instead. Besides you'd really want to be with me?\" Marco replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, after all you are a great kisser aren't you?\" You jokingly ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when you snagged your big chance, and you were about Marco as Sarah. Before you were about to kiss, however you burst out laughing before you did and Sarah soon joined in. Sarah soon interrupted your little prank as she heard Debbie getting out of the shower and told you to put her shirt back on.  Sarah then busted your little prank and Marco was surprised to find out that it was really you as Sarah and she was Martin.  He asked to see the remote however you said you had left it at Sarah's house and explained that you were on your way to your house to get Megan.  Marco wasn't that interested seeing as how he was grounded for the day and Megan dosen't really care for him that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well. I'll talk with you first thing tomorrow then. Later.\" Marco said as you started to leave<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya Marco.\" You both said as you head out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah then both start heading towards your house to get Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I didn't do anything that bad.\" You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but if you really did kiss him I would have probably lost it right then and there.\" Sarah told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You took your time to admire Jenna's well toned body as you had never saw it without a single thread covering her body before depossessing her and materializing in Megan's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ahh! You scared me!', Megan yelped as you gripped her shoulders. You saw a pencil line across the paper she was drawing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry sis.'', you grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''How - how, was it?'', Megan asked as she rubbed off the accidental line that she made in her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Different feeling, definitely.'', you grinned ''Do you think I'll be turned on by Jenna? Fat chance!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No.. no that's not what I meant.'', Megan blushed and turned away from you, facing her drawing of a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Looks awesome sis, as usual.'', you complimented her drawings, she spent so much time practicing that you think she can get published already. Her room was filled with various RPG character posters, some anime and some DC/Marvel pictures and little plastic figures of anime character that she bought during the family vacation to Japan. She even had a display case for them, of course it lead to Jenna's jeers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You sure that you don't want to try out the remote?'', you asked for the last time before going out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, Martin, I'm really sure.'', Megan replied you without shifting her attention from the piece she was working on, you knew she was fully absorbed and she usually behaved as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to your bedroom, took out your mobile phone while toying with the remote in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sup man?'', Marco's voice was heard from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sup. Hey, can you meet me, now?'', you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now? Your house? Sorry man, no can do.'', Marco said. ''Grounded for a week and dad's asked Debbie to watch over me do house work.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thought immediately went to picture Debbie, Marco's older sister. In her 20s, she attended the local college and in her last year of undergrad study. Your thought then was broken as you heard Jenna's steps outside your door, going to get her breakfast. She called out to Jessica, who responded to her with an equally high pitched voice and the two of them went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey... You still there man? Hello? Heloooooo.....'', Marco's voice brought your attention back to your mobile phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh? Yeah, stay there man, I'mma going to your place in 30 minutes. Stay put.'', you finished the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What's with him?'', Marco mumbled as the call was abruptly terminated.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marco's house was not that far, a few blocks away from yours. You grinned, with the 'right pair of legs', getting there would be a breeze. So in this case, Jenna was the most obvious choice, and other reason included that Marco had an eye for your sister, well, her shapely toned body. Although obviously Jenna always hold a very low value on your perverted friend, then again, Jenna was not the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Still in your PJs twerp? Not going out with your pervy pal, that Marco?'', Jenna sneered at you as you opened the door. She got a plain pink sweater and pants. Although she had no idea on how she got into the tub earlier on, she seemed to have recomposed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm not, but you are. In fact, you're going to spend the whole day with him.'', you spoke quickly as you pushed the blue button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, in fact, I'm gonna be in Marco's place for some time. See you later twerp! Look after Jessica.'', you glared at your old self who just stood there, looking confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh, yeah, whatever.'', your old self apparently did not have any memory about the remote and not one too keen either of engaging a conversation with Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n''Right, so here we are.'', you grinned as you puffed and panted. You glanced at the watch strapped on your wrist. ''Around 20 minutes. Not bad if I say so myself.'', you grinned, being in your sister's ultra fit body certainly had its perks. You dressed yourself with trackpants and a light colored tracksuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, hi Jenna.'', Marco stared at you in disbelief. His gaze, while fixed on your new body, kept darting around to find your old body perhaps somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just pushed him away and let yourself in, kicking off your training shoes aside and crashed right onto his bunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco was flabbergasted, but he did not express his surprise at the thought of Jenna making herself comfortable in his house. You picked up a can of cola from the floor and gulped it in one go. ''Don't stand around like that.'', you zipped down your tracksuit to reveal a plain pink t-shirt that Jenna usually wore and took off your trackpants to reveal a very short denim. You then showed him the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, you must be fucking kidding me....'', Marco gasped in disbelief after several minutes of explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh? You reckon my sister would do something like this to you? Who's lowlier than scum?'', you snickered as you played Jenna's character expertly, which was not hard at all, considering that you were able to somehow access her memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That....kinda hurt.'', Marco looked dejected. ''Prove it, prove the remote works.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''All right.'', you handed the remote to Marco. ''Press this red button if you want my sister's body or better yet, press this yellow button and possess Debbie so we have the whole house for the two of us.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco looked at the remote in his hand. Is the remote really is omnipotent or perhaps Jenna with some other girls were playing practical jokes on him, to humiliate him. He quickly decided he got nothing to lose and pressed a button<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was like all his dreams had come true at that moment and for the few minutes as Jenna he could make her do whatever he wanted. Marco went and took a jog around his room ending at his mirror, and all that looked back at him was Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, you really need to get out more.

On second thought, don't answer that.\" You say, forgetting who you were talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Marco asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know about you but I better get Jenna home.

The sooner this week is over the better.\" Marco retorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was friends with Marco's sister Debbie so she found it odd that Jenna came over and actually talked to Marco without even talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever weirdo, I'll just talk with her later then.\" Debbie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's see. Mom and Dad will probably be home in about an hour or so. So I could probably talk to Sarah too, that or maybe have a little jog of my own and see what other losers fall for Jenna before I have to split.\" You think to yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought to yourself what might've happened if Marco had known more about the remote before you gave it to him and after he swapped with Jenna.  He'd probably  blackmail her somehow and stuff so that she'd be his girlfriend, because there was no way he was smart enough to try and become her ideal date. But for right now you had other plans, since Marco was out for the week you thought about going to Sarah's house. Her house wasn't that far away from yours and Marco's house, and the park was about 10 minutes away so you had about 40 minutes of time at the park if you decided to go there instead.</span></div></div>",

One reason was to see how many losers would fall for your sister, and other being a chance to hopefully find a 'better' body to swap with. Surprisingly, the jog was uneventful, you saw some potential candidates but decided that you can get them another day. Other than that, mostly there were mothers with their small children in the park, you were sure that you don't want to look after small children or to become one.  The only highlight of the day was when a group of jocks stared at you jogging past, but that was all, and before long you made your way back to Marco's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Back so soon?'', Marco glanced at you as you entered his bedroom again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, not much to see.'', you wiped sweat from your forehead with Marco's shirt that was laying around.''PES man? Move over.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You sure?'', Marco looked at you quizzically, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, yes I sure am!'', you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Gah...

As he watched you completely lost in word, he picked the remote up and aimed it towards his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, I might be grounded for a week, but at least I'll be able to entertain myself now!'', Debbie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you watch Debbie began to feel herself up.

Call if you need anything.\" Marco's dad replied, as you and Marco headed out the door laughing.

Only real thing that happened was getting looks from some of the jocks in our grade who weren't even trying to hide the fact that they were looking at Jen...well me i guess.

Marco seemed to ponder this for a moment before shrugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon entered the house and surveyed who was present. Jenna (brainwashed into thinking she was Martin) gave the two a glare as she skulked off to Martin's room. Martin didn't really care for his old body at the moment and let her pass. Martin's mother was in the kitchen, cleaning up the counter, and gave Debbie (actually Marco) a smile and a greeting, asking her to stay for dinner, which Marco accepted for convenience sake. Jessica was watching TV in the living room and didn't pay them any regard. The two passed by Megan on their way up the stairs and Marco almost greeted her as a friend, but Martin cut him off and said something cold so as to not make Megan suspicious that they used the remote. Megan responded with a retort of her own - unaware of Martin and Marco's schemes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally in Jenna's bedroom, the two sat down and began to brainstorm what to do with the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should call Sarah,\" Martin said. \"It wouldn't be fair to exclude her, and she'd probably be able to think of something fun to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can have some fun ourselves first,\" Marco said. \"We can come up with some idea of what to do without Sarah!

Martin realizes that Debby is a few inches shorter than Jenna, who was pretty tall for a girl. While she was still very athletic, she had broader shoulders and wider hips to the more slender runner's body of Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco went a step further than looking at Jenna, and was immediately grabbing at his chest, already making Martin uncomfortable. \"Do you... have to do that right here?\" he asks. \"Can it not wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!

Martin and Marco were both smiling like two kids in a candy store as their minds filled with possibilities of what to do with the remote, and what to buy at the mall. They first went towards the center of the mall where the video game store was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man we've been sitting here for a few minutes now dude, can we go somewhere else?\" Marco said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience friend, just a few more minutes and opportunity is sure to strike any moment now.\" Martin told him, eyeing up everyone passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 more minutes at most, then I'm going elsewhere.\" Marco responded, clearly getting impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo! See that guy over there.\" Martin pointed at the geek coming out of the store. \"He's about to get one hell of a surprise in a minute.\" Martin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you gonna do to him?\" asked Marco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait. Can't rush these things, THERE!\" Out of the corner of his eye, Martin saw a group of preppy girls about to walk by him and Marco and took out the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin pointed at the geek and pressed the blue button and then pointed at the girl leading the group and pressed the blue button again. <br>\r\nHe saw he girl leading the group suddenly go and trip and blink a few times while getting up, with the other girls trying to help \"her\" up.<br>\r\nThe geek made up an excuse to go to the bathroom to get away from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should check up on him later, let's go explore other parts of the mall.\"  Marco said as you two make a high-five and start laughing along the way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After purchasing a few items from the joke shop to have some fun with later, the two 'girls' found themselves in the food court enjoying a quick snack. \"So, what should we do now?\" Marco asked, between bites of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we picked up everything that we wanted with our sister's credit cards\" Martin said with a childish grin before munching on the salad that he had purchased. Both Jenna and Debbie were on strict diets to keep up their figures and while Marco clearly didn't care about what he ate as Jenna, Martin wanted to at least let Debbie keep herself up. He figured that it was the least he could do after taking her body like this. \"Maybe we should just call it a day and head back to our houses?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?\" Marco asked, frowning as some sauce dripped from the slice of pizza in his hands onto Jenna's tank-top. Not that Marco cared about that, though. \"You mean I'll have to switch back to Debbie's body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin nodded. \"I think that makes the most sense. You don't have to go back to being your normal grounded self, but I think it's easier for both of us if we stay in our own houses and with our own families. That way we know for sure that we won't accidentally slip up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco just kept frowning, putting down the slice of pizza. \"Aww, come on man...I like being Jenna. Oooh, I know! Why don't you do that brainwash swap thing with the the real Jenna? That way you can go back to being yourself, you get to make sure that I don't do anything at your house to give myself away and Debbie and Marco can just go about their normal lives. What do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin sighed and thought about that idea. Having both of them under the same roof would definitely solve at least a few of their logistical problems. But there was a lot that could still go wrong with this. \"I don't know, bro. Megan knows about the remote and she's smart enough to definitely be able to tell that something will be up with Jenna\" he said truthfully. It was no secret that Megan was a lot smarter than Martin was. Martin had no doubt that even with Jenna's memories, MArco would not be able to keep up his charade for long if Megan was in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So brainwash swap with her! Let Megan be Debbie and you can take her body for a little. Or let me be Megan! I wouldn't mind that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Martin said firmly. \"Neither of us are brainwash swapping with Megan. That's final.\" Martin took a deep breath after making that statement. He and Megan may not have the best relationship in the world as far as siblings go, but they were close enough that Martin knew that he wouldn't let anything happen to her that she didn't want. And as long as he had a say in what was done with the remote, that was going to be the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco sighed and rested his head on his hand. \"Fine. Nothing happens with Megan...\" he said, looking down at the bag of pranks on the floor between the two of 'girls'. The remote had been put in there to give each of them easier access to it. It would be so easy for Marco to quickly grad the remote and use the blue button on Martin, effectively giving him 100 percent control over it. Then he could erase Megan's knowledge of the remote and then enlist the current Martin (the brainwashed Jenna) as his helper since he had yet to find out about the remote. But could Marco really do that? Making that choice would not only be betraying his best friend, but also effectively killing him by erasing his current self from existence, at least temporarily. After thinking on this for a few minutes, Marco decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately for Martin, Marco had the head start. Aided by Jenna's reflexes and dexterity, Marco grabbed the remote out of their bag and immediately angled it upwards at Martin. Martin barely had time to gasp as Marco clicked the blue button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm going to finish my pizza Debby,\" 'Jenna' said as she prodded at her food a bit. \"Why did I even get this? It's way too greasy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Debby' shrugged, \"just jog it off later, you'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess. Was just a weird decision. You can keep the stuff from the joke shop, I don't have any use for it. Be sure to get your weirdo brother with it, got it?\" She continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Debby' shook her head and chuckled. \"Oh don't even worry about it Jenna,\" she replied. \"Anyways, let's head out. I just remembered I have a lot to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back inside Debby's body, with Martin brainwashed in Jenna's, Marco considered his plan of action as the two left the mall, leaving behind the nerd they switched earlier. He'd have to get Martin back into his old body for sure, and then make him forget about the remote. While he was at it, he'd have to make Megan forget too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think I left my phone charger at your place. Mind if I run in and get it?\" he asked as he got out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" the fake Jenna said casually as she reached for her keys. \"Hey, what's that thing you're holding?\" she asked as Marco held the remote up and clicked the green button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be quiet and do what I say for now,\" Marco replied, getting a simple nod in return. \"Good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour or so, Marco set up the Remy family to his liking. Everyone was back into place: Martin was Martin, Megan was Megan, and Jenna was Jenna. And none of them knew about the device anymore. All of them, mother and father included, sat blankly at the dinner table, still entranced by the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Marco said, still in Debby's body, \"I want you all to resume life as normal 3 minutes after I leave. You won't think the missing time is weird, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded, to Marco's joy. \"Awesome! Then I'll see you tomorrow Martin. Hopefully I'll be seeing ~you~ to Jenna.\" With that, he exited the house, using his sister's athletic body to jog home in what felt like no time. He felt a bit bad about manipulating the whole family like that, but the power he held in his hands more than made up for it. And tomorrow, he had the feeling he'd be able to meet a much more malleable Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco was mostly surprised the next morning by the sound of an alarm. He rarely set one of those when it was summer. Looking around the room though, everything came back to him - he was in Debby's body! He got up from her bed and stretched her muscles. Her body was a bit sore from the jogging yesterday, but was surprisingly in good condition. She was still dressed in what he was wearing last night - athletic shorts and tight t-shirt. He opted to keep her body after getting home partially since she wasn't punished still, but also as prep for his meeting with the slightly amnesiac Martin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin decided to visit me with Jenna's body, so why not introduce him to the device as Debby?\" He reasoned. Copying Martin's routine felt like a fun joke, even if it was one only Marco would still understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he struck some poses and patted Debby's body down in the mirror, he thought over his plans now that he had the remote all to himself. After cupping his breasts a bit, he pulled her shirt off, leaving nothing but a white bra covering her top. She was a bit sweaty and probably needed a shower. It was a new sensation for sure, but Marco's excitement at the prospect of getting ready was a bit tampered by the fact that it was his sister's body. \"Hmmm. Martin didn't come to me with it <i>immeditely</i>... maybe I can have some fun on my own first.\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, Debbie was an attractive girl by any objective standard, but she was still Marco's sister. While there were plenty of bodies that Marco would 'expiriment' with in a heartbeat, she just wasn't one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do need that shower though\" Marco said with a smile as he took off the rest of Debbie's clothing, easily accessing her muscle memory to figure out how the bra worked. Marco then wrapped himself in a towel and headed for the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\nEventually, Marco was finally ready for his meeting with Martin. He had dressed Debbies body in tight black shorts and a particularly low cut pink tanktop. While Marco wasn't so interested, he knew that it would be hard for Martin to hide his...excitement...once he got a good look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, can't forget you, now can I?\" Marco asked, taking the remote from Debbie's dresser. Debbie's shorts didn't have pockets, so Marco slid it between the shorts as Debbie's leg. Anyone that he passef on his jog would just aaaume it was her cell phone and not think twice. \"Now, I think I'm ready to pay Martin a visit\" Marco says with a grin on his face. He felt absolutely no remorse about the fact that it had orinally been Martin who showed him the remote. And why should he? Thos was so much more fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\nLoving the fact that hos sister's body was so much more in shape than he was, Marco decided to take advantage of his sister's fitness and actually go on her full morning jog, working up the sweat that he had showered away earlier. But as he stood on the porch of the Remy house and looked down at his slightly revealed cleavage, he knew that that wouldn't matter. He'd have Martin right where he wanted him. On that note, Marco knocked on the door, grinning like a child as he imagined all of the ways to indoctrinate Martin into the ways of the remote...his way. </span></div></div>",

He was really hoping that it would have been Martin to open the door. It would have made things so much easier. \"Aww, that's too bad...\" Marco said, sounding disappointed. Of course Megan assumed that Debbie had come to hang out with Jenna. What other reason would she possibly have for being here? \"I think I left something in her room the other day. Any chance that you could let me in so I can check?\" He asked, hoping to avoid this problem and get right back on track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...Jenna really doesn't like it when people go in her room while she isn't home. No matter who it is. Besides, I think she locked her door before leaving\" Megan said as she fixed her glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco sighed. <i>Well that's just great,</i> he thought to himself as he rested his hand on Debbie's hip and pouted a bit. This whole thing left Marco in a sticky situation to say the least. Even if he could convince Megan to let him into the house, she would be around the entire time that he would be trying to explain things to Martin. It would just be one extra unneeded annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Marco with a few options to get things back on track. The first option was to simply give up on this and go back to his house. From there he could just invite Martin over and show him the remote. That would give Marco some time to go about his own business first. He could do more experimenting with the limits of the remote and maybe even find a body that wasn't his sister's to have some fun with. It would be nice for only him to know about the remote for a little and just have his own fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option that Marco had was to just use the remote now in some way. Either he could use the programming but to make Megan let him in and keep her out of his way while he showed Martin the remote, or he could just take Megan's body and let Debbie (probably a brainwashed Megan at that point) just go on with her day. That would leave the house empty besides for Martin and Marco and would provide a perfect environment to tell Martin about the remote. Marco actually wasn't so against that idea. Megan was a bit on the quiet and nerdy side, but she was cute. Way cuter that she gave herself credit for. With a personality like Marco's in the driver's seat, Megan could even be hot. She would certainly be a body that Marco could enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I guess have a good day?\" Megan said as she began to close the door. Marco wrapped his fingers around the remote as he decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was the reason he had to go through the trouble of memory-wiping Martin, after all. If he let her be aware of the swap, she'd probably object or get in the way, and Marco knew that Martin would follow suit. Then he'd have to start all over again. This was actually a boon as he thought about it; he'd be able to have easy access to Martin <i>and</i> the real Megan would be out of the way in Debby's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he clicked the blue button with almost no hesitation, putting himself in Martin's home as the new Megan. 'Debby' merely turned around and jogged off with a wave, Marco having already said her goodbye for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this wasn't what I planned, but it'll be fun in its own way,\" Marco said after closing the door and turning to walk up the stairs. \"I bet Martin will be surprised to find out I'm in his sister's body. I wonder how I should go about it...\" He decided to head into Megan's bedroom for a moment to make some plans. The room was as he expected; with walls plastered over by posters for various tv shows, comics, and games she liked. Her shelf was filled with manga and comicbooks, and a look at her bedstand implied she was making her way through Game of Thrones. He was surprised by how many of her posters seemed to be drawn by her though; he saw the initials \"Meg R\" written in the bottom right of many prints hanging up, which he guessed were probably the original copies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. She ought to market herself more, that's some talent.\" He noted that a large stack of sketchbooks laid about on the top of her bookshelf, each labeled with date ranges that he guessed were how long she used the given book. Flipping through them, he was surprised how... raunchy some of them were. \"Shame I don't know who most of these characters are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her mirror, he took stock of his new body. He could tell Megan was wearing a bra, but her bust was still much smaller than Debby's or Jenna's. She was dressed pretty plainly overall - an orange t-shirt with the logo some anime or videogame Marco had never heard of and a pair of blue-jeans.\"It'll take some work, but I'm sure she can pull off a cute librarian look or something,\" Marco said to himself as he ran his hand through her hair, undoing some tangles. \"These glasses are a bit unflattering too, but I'll get to that later. Can be fun having a body to work on I guess,\" Marco said with a chuckle, as though he was fixing up a car or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was beating around the bush though. He <i>finally</i> had a body that wasn't his sister's AND he was out of sight from Martin. With a smile, he locked the door and sauntered back over to the mirror. \"Was hoping to do this with Jenna honestly, but I guess you'll be a fun first time too, Megan,\" he spoke at this new reflection as he threw off her shirt, revealing a simple white bra, and pulled down her jeans to show a similar pair of panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree to do as he pleased, Marco slid a hand underneath Megan's bra, moaning to himself softly as he felt a pleasurable jolt, playing with her breasts. Stepping back, he collapsed onto her bed, continuing to run his stolen hands down his new body, exploring every sensation he could.His hands eventually made his way down to her thighs, pulling her panties down her legs so he could reach her crotch. Marco stuck a finger inside Megan's slit, and groaned in ecstasy. It ws like a pressure he never knew existed was being lifted from his shoulders. Eventually, he came to a climax, and fell asleep on his new bed due to the exhaustion of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Marco woke up, a strange smell hitting his nose. Looking down, he once again found himself waking to a body that wasn't his own, this time in a bed that he had just made a mess in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that was incredible,\" he mumbled as he pulled himself to his feet, pulling back up Megan's panties and straightening out her bra. \"Not sure if I'll be able to go back after that, hah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he redressed himself though, he was still a bit dissatisfied with the state of Megan's wardrobe and appearance. Staring in the mirror agin, he noted that her clothes were either bland or TOO nerdy. 'The nerd look is cute and all, but there's a limit. I wonder if Jenna or her mom has makeup too...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Martin probably did something like this after finding the remote too. Maybe showing him could wait?

There was definitely going to be a point where the two of them were alone in the house again. Even if there wasn't in the near future, Marco was sure he'd be able to get Martin alone somehow. Of course, there was a risk that came along with waiting to tell him. Marco didn't know the first thing about Megan! His little act would easily be caught without some kind of help. Even if he wanted to put an end to her nerd look, it would still be beneficial to have a working knowledge of Megan's interests. Heck, even knowing who all of these stupid characters are would be a plus. Marco was just drawing blanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like a pretty silly design flaw\" Marco said with a sigh as he glanced at the remote which had been placed on Megan's dresser before any of the fun began. March walked over to it and took the remote in his, or rather Megan's, hands. There was no way that the person who invented this would leave in such a flaw. One of these buttons had to be able to give a non-brainwashed person access to their body's memories. That was logical, wasn't it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco thought briefly about what he knew of the remote. So far, he knew that the red button was a regular body swap and blue was a brainwash swap. Green was a mind control sort of thing and black would reset everything. The Yellow button was a mystery for now. \"I might as well give it a try\" he said with a shrug before pressing the button. He felt a tingling sensation, but nothing seemed to change. Then he looked in the mirror but saw...nothing! He then looked down at himself. His body was still Megan's but it was nearly transparant. Megan's clothing and the remote had taken on a similar appearence. \"Wow, I'm a ghost!\" Marco exclaimed, though he was almost positive that no sound was made. This button was definitely interesting, but was no current help. Marco quickly preased the button again and once again became physical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it must be one of the other buttons\" Marco said, trying to logically think through his options. What would happen if he pressed the blue button only on himself? Would that give Marco access to Megan's memories and personality? Or would it just convince him that he was Megan entirely? Marco couldn't imagine that the creator of the remote would do something so stupid. But was he willing to bet his existance on it? All Marco would really have to do was tell Martin about the remote. Then Martin could help him pretend to be Megan and that would be that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that Marco wanted to be independant. He went through so much trouble to make sure that the remote was his. He had no interest in giving Martin any sort of edge or power over him. He didn't need Martin....he hoped. Marco gulped. He also didn't need to pretend to be Megan, right? He had her body, but he owed Megan nothing. He could just go to the mall now, get her new clothes and be himself. Who did he have to convince? Byt Marco knew that was wishful thinking. If he wanted the remote to renain secret, he would have to do everything in his power to play the part that he was given. He'd still have his fun transforming Megan, but it would hace to be done with people thinking it was her doing it. All of this pointed to the simple fact that Marco needed the access to her personality and memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Marco decided to...</span></div></div>",

She didn't feel any different than before. There was no flooding of her mind with memories, no headache as her identites dueled it out. She just felt like herself. Everything about the body she was in and the room she was in just felt natural. And why wouldn't that be the case? Megan had lived in this room her whole life and this was the body she was born with. Sure, she may be a guy named Marco in the driver's seat but there was no reason for her not to think of this room and body as hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around her room, Megan was easily able to identify and provide a bio of every superhero and manga character featured in her posters. Once she was done with that, Megan sat on her bed, crossed her legs and looked through her drawings. She remembered when she drew all of them and why she drew them all the way that she did. She even made notes for a new drawing to start before closing her book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is definitely an interesting position to be in\" she said as she walked over to her reflection in the mirror and smiled cutely at herself. \"I'm Megan Remy. I'm 16 years old, a total nerd, but totally proud of that\" she said with a giggle. \"I used to be Marco Hermida, but who cares about that? He's just a grounded friend of my brother's as far as I'm concerned\" she said with a wink. Of course, Megan still had all of Marco's memories too, but the remote had pushed those into the background. At this point, her primary indentity was Megan, but with the awareness that she was actually Marco. Thanks to that awareness, Marco's personality was still the one calling the shots. So Megan now had none of her old inhibitions and all of Marco's charisma and confidence. She was basically Megan 2.0 and she couldn't wait to get herself some new clothes. </span></div></div>",

Within half an hour, Megan was walking around the mall with the expression of a kid in a candy shop. Megan was normally very good at saving money, but with Marco calling the shots, she felt like she should reward herself for what she was doing and binge a little. If it really came to it, it would be easy for her to get extra money with the remote anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's shopping started at a clothing store. Megan spent what could have easily been a few hours trying on various outfits, all of which were far more provocative than things that she would usually wear, yet still stylish enough by her standards to not be out of the realm of things Megan would like. After buying new shirts, skirts, leggings, and shoes, Megan toyed with the idea of picking up contact lenses while she was here. That idea left her mind pretty quickly though. She liked her glasses and honestly, Marco did also. They gave Megan a cute look that she was very okay with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her various new outfits, Megan stopped off at the comic shop where she picked up the latest issues that she had been reading. Marco, now having all of Megan's interests was curious enough in where the stories were going and on top of that, there was no point in killing Megan's personality now that he had such complete access to it. Megan was her own girl and her identity was not only unique but incredibly fun as long as it was Marco's personality calling the shots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Megan returned home and brought her new stuff back into her room. She smiled as she put the comics with the rest of her collection and then took time to put away her new clothing. Finally, Megan took the remote out of her pocket and fiddled with it in her hand. Was it time to bring Martin in on the secret? </span></div></div>",

Can you come in here?!?\" she exclaimed, loud enough that she was sure Martin would be able to hear her from his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!! What do you want?!? I'm in the middle of a game!\" Martin yelled back, probably playing one of his many video games. Megan sighed. Both her and Marco's original memories confirmed that there was no way that Martin was going to quit in the middle of a game unless he REALLY wanted to get up and while he certainly liked Megan more than he liked Jenna, there was no chance that he would deem anything that she had to show him important enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't want to come in here, I'll just have to go in there\" Megan said as she pressed the yellow button on the remote. Like last time, Megan felt a tingling sensation all over her body. When she looked down, she saw that her body was once again in the transparent, \"ghostly\" form that it had taken on previously when she had been playing around with the remote. Megan took a deep breath and stepped into the wall in front of her. As expected she phased right through it and came out on the other side, in Martin's room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Martin was sitting on his bed, watching the TV intently with his controller in hand. The door to his room was closed and locked so that no one would be able to come in and disturb him. Or so he thought. Megan grinned as she walked right in between Martin and the TV. \"Time to give you quite a surprise, bro\" Megan said with a giggle as she pressed the yellow button once again and immediately saw a look of shock on Martin's face as she materialized right in front of him. \"So, Martin, are you still in the middle of a game? Or do you finally have time to see what I wanted to show you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight. This remote can make you turn into a ghost and stuff?\" Martin asked, as he felt the remote in his hand and looked over the strange device that Megan had presented him with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded. \"That's right, but it can also do soooo much more\" she said, grabbing the remote back from his hand and pointing her finger at the various buttons. \"The red button will switch the bodies of the one pointing the remote and whoever it's aimed at. The blue button will do the same, but the person you switch with will think they were you all along but not remember the remote. The green button will put the person into a trance and you can tell them to do or think whatever you want. And the black button will reset everything back to the way it originally was\" she said smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how exactly do you know all of this, Megan?\" Martin asked, raising an eyebrow curiously. \"And why are you acting so much more confident than usual?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gulped and felt her heart flutter nervously. Obviously, she had neglected to tell Martin that she wasn't actually his original sister. In fact, the had no intention of ever doing that. The more time that the person that used to be Marco spent in Megan's body, the more it felt like home. Since the original Megan was brainwashed as Debbie and the original Debbie was brainwashed as Marco, the new Megan had no reason to feel bad. It wasn't like any of them would realize things had been any different than they ever were. Besides, if Megan told Martin the truth, he would just get mad at her. Worse, he would hate her. And she loved her brother too much to want that. \"Well, I...uh...found the remote earlier today. And I spent the past few hours testing it out. One of the ways I did that...might have been programming myself to have more confidence\" she said, making up a story to explain things. In reality, her new confidence came from the fact that the current Megan was more like a combination of Megan and Marco than either of the two were originally, but Martin had no reason to know that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But, why?\" Martin asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I've always wanted to be more confident, okay? Now I can be!\" Megan tried to sound as hurt as possible by Martin's questioning. At this point, she just wanted to move on and have fun with her best friend and brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I asked...\" Martin said, looking like he felt guilty. He knew how nervous and shy Megan usually was and he was honestly happy to finally get to see what she was like out of her shell. \"So, how do I know that the remote is real?\" Martin asked, looking up to see the remote was pointed right at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this\" Megan said with a grin as she pressed the red button. Megan, now in Martin's body, watched as Martin, in her body, immediately freaked out ans started feeling himself up. <i>What happened to wanting to respect your sister's body, Martin?</i> Megan thought slyly. This Martin had no memories of the remote, meaning that the lessons he learned from his use of it had never registered in his mind. that meant that this Martin was a lot more malleable than the one from only hours before. Of course, as fun as this was, Megan had to admit that she wanted her body back. Martin's body was just weird. Despite originally being a boy, it felt weird for Megan to now have a penis. And as far as boy's bodies went, there were plenty of better candidates than Martin. With that in mind, Megan pointed the remote back at her original body and pressed the red button again. \"So you believe me now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin nodded, disorientated to suddenly be back in his own body. \"Yeah, I believe you. So what now?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Megan took on a thoughtful look, clearly trying to figure out something fun that the two could do together with the remote. As she did that, Martin's gaze fell to the remote in her hand. There was something...familiar about it and it made Martin feel uncomfortable. As Martin looked at each button on the remote, he had the sudden urge to press the black button and reset everything. As if doing that would fix something that had been broken. But why would he have those thoughts? This was the first time that Martin had seen the remote or even heard of such a devise. But there was still something about it that Martin just knew he had seen before. He wanted to feel the device in his hand and at least use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Megan...can I use the remote?\" Martin asked cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan frowned and looked at him closely. Martin couldn't tell, but it seemed as if she was trying to determine if he would be a threat to her by using the remote. the Megan that he knew was never this defensive. Even if she had used the remote to give herself a more outgoing personality, Martin was not convinced that his sister would be that mistrusting of him. Something was very wrong here for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, for her part, looked down at the remote in her hand and then back at her brother. She recognized something in his voice about the way that he asked that question. Could he possibly be remembering things from before? Megan wasn't sure how that was possible, though it certainly could be that seeing the remote and swapping bodies with her had awoken something in his unconscious mind. Maybe trying to bring Martin into this wasn't the right move after all. Megan's body was nice and she would certainly be able to make plenty of friends to use the remote on or with. Heck, she could even go bring in 'Marco,' who would DEFINITELY be more cooperative than Martin would. All Megan had to do was use the programming button or brainwash swap a few times and Martin would forget again. Then she could just forget about this whole thing and go on with her life without having any need to worry about Martin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was also the chance that she was just over thinking things right now. It was only natural for Martin to want to try out the remote himself right now and it was only natural for her to be suspicious of that. If Martin really only wanted to try it out, he would do so in some way and then give the remote immediately back to her. If he had something else in mind...well, then it would be too late because he would have it. If he wasn't starting to remember, Megan really would love for Martin to be her partner in crime moving forward. But if he did remember and he got his hands on the remote, it would be game over for the former Marco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Megan sighed and decided to...</span></div></div>",

While Marco probably would not have made that choice, Megan's personality was currently the stronger force inside of Megan's body. And she trusted her brother tremendously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin smiled as he took the remote from his sister and twiddled it in his hand. Sure enough, it felt extremely familiar. Martin was tempted to press the black button right now, but he just couldn't bring himself to do that. He had to know what happened to Megan and he knew exactly how to do that. Martin quickly pressed the yellow button and felt his body tingle. Seeing the look on Megan's face made it clear to him that it had worked and he was now a ghost. \"M-martin? what are you doing?\" Megan asked nervously as Martin stood up and walked towards his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Meg. But I need to know what happened\" he said as he phased into Megan's body. Megan shook a bit as Martin forced himself into control. When his vision came to, Martin was sitting down exactly where Megan was with the remote rematerialized on the floor in front of him. Martin put the remote in his, well Megan's, hand and slowly stood up. This time, he didn't feel over his stolen body. That wasn't what he had to do. Instead, Martin just closed his eyes and concentrated on seeing Megan's memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Megan's memories were pretty much what he expected to see, it soon became obvious to Martin that not only her memories were in her head. As Martin dug deeper, he also found the memories of his best friend Marco! In fact, seeing those memories showed Martin the whole story. Martin read through Marco's memories, seeing him show Marco the remote, Marco brainwashing him to be Jenna and then becoming Megan and finally giving himself Megan's personality. It all made Martin sick to the core. He felt betrayed, especially since he himself didn't remember any of this thanks to Marco! Suddenly, the anger was too much to bare and Martin balled Megan's hand into a fist and started pounding on his bed, screaming. What had this remote done other than corrupt the people that used it? Marco's memories showed Martin that he had second feelings about it, but Marco had used the remote for himself before anything could be done. Well now Martin knew exactly what had to be done...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin walked Megan back to her room and sat on her bed. Once again, Martin pressed the ghost button and flew back to his room before becoming solid again. He locked the door so 'Megan' couldn't get in and then looked down once more at the remote. All he had to do was press the black button and everything would be back to normal. Martin would be himself again and everyone that had been swapped would return to their original bodies with no memories of the remote. Then this nightmare would finally be over. Sure, Martin would miss the ability to possess people and swap bodies, but who needed that if it would cause all of this chaos? Why couldn't people just learn to be happy with themselves instead of stealing the lives of others? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock on the door and Megan's voice was heard. \"Martin! Let me in!\" she yelled, pounding on the door louder and louder. Martin sighed. As much as he wanted to let her in and just have fun with the remote, he knew that things had gone too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. This has to end. I'm sorry, Marco\" he said as he pressed the black button and everything went black. </span></div></div>",

He also had the innate feeling that everything was back to normal for everyone else. \"Megan? Are you still out there?\" Martin asked, opening the door to find his sister standing there timidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...yeah, I am. S-sorry to bother you. I just wanted to say I got some new comics if you want to check them out\" she said, remembering what she had done while Marco was in her but not retaining any changed personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know they aren't my thing, Meg...but maybe I will later\" Martin said with a smile. Megan smiled back at him and then returned to her room. Martin smiled as he watched her walking back, glad that she was her normal self and not something artificial. Marco was probably now back in his room, grounded like he always was. Everything was the way it had been before any of the swapping started and Martin was the only one who had any memory of the remote. Of course, there was a chance that showing the remote to Marco would cause him to remember it like what happened with Martin. That risk was too big to take. Martin knew that he would either have to be the only one to know about the remote, or no one could know about it. And at this moment, Martin did not want anyone else to know about it. The remote was too dangerous and could lead to too much corruption. So what if people's lives weren't perfect. They could fix themselves without having to invade the privacy of another human being. This game had gone on for long enough. Martin knew now that he had to get rid of not only the remote, but even the idea of the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin held the remote towards his head and spoke while pressing the green button. \"This remote does not work. Throw it out.\" Suddenly Martin's head hurt. the remote dropped to the floor as he held his head and sighed. \"Ugh what happened?\" he asked before seeing the remote on the floor. \"Why is this still here? The piece of garbage doesn't even work!\" he said before picking up the remote and tossing it out his window. Good riddance to the stupid thing for getting his hopes up. Part of Martin really hoped that the remote had done what the instructions said they did. He would have loved the chance to be someone else, but oh well. His life was better than no life. </span></div></div>",

But I'm afraid you'll get in my way too much for it to be fun.\" Megan said, then held the green button down. \"You don't remember anything about this remote. If you see the remote you will not be interested in it, and will not ask about it. If you see something weird happening from the remote, you will brush it off as just your imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith not even a flash, Megan knew the deed was done. She walked over to her room, looked over the stuff she bought and laid on her bed, staring at the remote. Was doing that the right choice? She really wanted to share the remote with Martin, afterall, Martin was the one that shared the remote with Marco in the first place. But that look he had, the tone he was using; she wasn't dumb, especially not with the combined Megan wariness and intellect as well as the Marco confidence to act. She knew keep inside that Martin would have gotten in the way. Martin wouldn't want anything to change despite having found such an incredible power, only to play around with it a little, then leave things as they were before. Marco wasn't about that, and the Megan now knew very well that in the past Martin acted much as a limiter for Marco. But now, the limits are opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if anything, just knowing that the person keeping Marco back from going all out is now out of the way, scared Megan a bit. Scared of all this new freedom. Feeling a bit frustrated, Megan began doing what Marco would do when he had felt frustrated at the world... masturbate. She slipped out of the clothing she had been wearing, throwing them into he clothes bin, and ran her hands all over her body. Her hands eventually focused on her breasts and her crotch. As the feelings of doing this the second time with Marco in her head filled her mind, any regrets she had of keeping Martin away was washed away with pleasure...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hot water from the shower came down hard on Megan's naked body. Following her little play time, Megan decided to take a shower so she could feel less icky as well as think about her next move. Megan knew that removing Martin from the equation was the best move that she could have made, but she was now in a bit of a dilemma. The whole reason that Marco had come to the Remy house in the first place was so he could have a partner in crime to use the remote with. Now that it was clear that Martin would not be ideal for that, what was going to happen now? Megan had no intention of returning to Marco's house or life. She liked her body and she liked her family here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the obvious choice was for Megan to recruit the current Marco and let him in on the secret o the remote. Since she was still Marco at heart, there was no doubt in Megan's mind that the two of them would get along wonderfully. Marco's mind was just as creative as hers was, though since she had Megan;s intelligence it was clear that she was the smarter of the two. With her brains, it would be very hard for the other Marco to betray her like how the original one betrayed Martin but that was still a risk to consider even if it was not a definite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was to go back to Martin and use the programming button on him in some way. His mind would be like puddy in Megan's hand and she would easily be able to manipulate him into losing those dumb morals and doing what she said. Unfortunately, there were two major issues with that idea. First of all, Martin had demonstrated that he was somehow able to at least partially remember the remote from being around it too long. There was no promise that wouldn't happen again and it was even possible that whatever allowed him to remember the first time could also undo any programming that Megan tried to do to him. Second, Martin was always the one arguing against doing too much lasting change. While Marco and now Megan couldn't care less about that baloney, Martin was still Marco's best friend and Megan's brother. Part of Megan wanted to respect that and leave Martin be. He'd be kept safely away from the remote but otherwise untouched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third option, which is probably a safer bet, was for Megan to use the remote on Jenna in some way. One option was to use the programming button on Jenna and bring her along for some fun. Since Megan was originally Marco, she was still very attracted to Jenna. Besides, having some sibling bonding could be fun. Of course, that would require a lot of programming on her end. To get things really working in her favor, Megan would probably have to effectively make Jenna her slave. Alternatively, perhaps it was time to move on and just swap with Jenna. Jenna could live Megan's life, probably with some personality adjustments to explain the new wardrobe, while Marco became Jenna. Then the new Jenna would be able to have a body that even made Megan jealous and could easily have fun with people at Jenna's college. Although, the thought of having to leave Megan's body was a very sad one since she was so at home in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Megan stepped out of the shower deciding to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marco shook his head at the thought. No matter how intoxicating the power of the remotes were, it'd be too cruel to betray Martin's trust like that. Frankly, Martin didn't have to tell him about this device at all; it was generous enough of him to let Marco use Debbie's body to skip out on his punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Besides, I'm sure I can eventually turn Martin to my side the normal way!'</i> Marco thought to himself with a wry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I think its time we leave,\" Martin said, getting up. \"I think I actually told mom I'd be back for dinner, and we might've killed Jenna's appetite a bit, but I'll have my own stomach back in a bit so that's her problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suuuuuuuure I can't have another body?\" Marco pleaded, giving a pout with Jenna's face. \"Doesn't even have to be Jenna's! I just won't enjoy myself much as Debby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin gave an exasperated sigh. \"As if that'd even work coming from the real Jenna. You know it's a bad idea. Keeping you as Debby simplifies it, okay? You can't be Jenna or Megan, and I'm not about to let you take a stranger's body. It'd just be an extra headache. Now come on, we'll switch back in the car.\" The two made sure to track down the random guy they swapped earlier - still confused and nervous in the body of some random girl - and pressed 'undo'. The girl was a bit dizzy for a moment, unsure of what just happened, and her friends seemed concerned over her behavior, but it wasn't their problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy's going to fantasize about that for <i>at least</i> the next year,\" Marco laughed, as the two went out to the parking lot and into Jenna's car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marco, for the last time, no. We won't alter Megan,\" Martin continued. \"She hasn't done anything and I told her I wouldn't use it on her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we messed up that kid at the mall!\" Marco asserted annoyingly as they pulled into the house's driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we fixed him shortly after!\" Martin retorted. \"That girl will just go to bed early and the guy will be convinced it was a weird dream he had.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how about this then,\" Marco offered. \"What if we're just straightforward with Megan and tell her what happened? Maybe she'd be okay with me staying! It's not like she likes Jenna, right? She'd totally prefer me as an older sister! Then you can go back to your body or whatever and we can all test the remote under one roof.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin took a deep breath. He knew Megan wasn't very fond of Marco. She thought he was too impulsive, and she wasn't totally wrong. She probably wouldn't be happy that Martin shared the device with him without consulting her. Still, he supposed the truth would have to come out EVENTUALLY. Maybe Marco was right and being straightforward would be best? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeease?\" Marco pleaded again, still giving unconvincing puppy dog eyes with Jenna's body while Martin considered the remote in his hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Martin thought for a moment before letting out a sigh. \"Alright, fine. We'll explain everything to Megan. But first I want to just get back to my own body\" he said truthfully. Being in a cute girl's body was definitely fun, but Martin did miss being himself. \"Let's go back to your place first, though. I want to make this as simple as possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco frowned, as the two returned to his own house. While outside, Martin pointed the remote at Marco and used the normal swap button. \"What the hell, man!\" Marco exclaimed from Debbie's body, remote in hand. \"I thought we agreed to tell Megan and then move things forward from there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we did. But we've opened a can of worms with all of these swaps. As it stands, the original Debbie is brainwashed to think she's you abd the original Jenna is brainwashed to think she's me. I don't think there's any reason to make this more confusing. So you're going to go upstairs and swap back into your body and call my body over to hang out for a minute. Just say you need to show him, er...me, something for two seconds in person. I'll stay over here and hang out with Debbie as Jenna until he gets here. Once he does, you swap with him and I'll swap back with you. By the end of that, Debbie is back to herself, I'll be back in my own body and Jenna will be thinking that she's you. That makes it easier for everyone to keep track. Okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay\" Marco said, understanding the rationale now. Honestly, Marco didn't see any issue with just coninuing to brainwash people. It wasn't like they eould know the difference. But whatever. This wasn't worth fighting over. \"But I'm still grounded, remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long\" Martain said with a smirk as he grabbed the remote from Marcos hand and walked into the house just as Marco's mother was finishing dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, girls\" she said with a bright smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI Mrs. Hermida,\" Martain said with a grin as he took aim with the remote and pressed the programming button. A blank expression appeared on her face as Martin continued. \"You're going to let Marco invite my brother over for a few minutes even though he's grounded, won't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco's motger nodded as expression returned to her face. \"Of course I'll let Marco invite Martin over! But why on earth do you girl's care?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason! Come one, Deb. Let's go upstairs\" Martin said with a triumphant grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'd you wanna see me for, bro\" 'Martin' asked as he walked into Marco's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to show you this\" Marco said with a grin as he took out the remote and pressed the brainwash swap button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, I really don't know if I should tell Tom how I feel\" Debbie said, deciding to use the extra time with Jenna to unload some of her feelings. Martin had been playing the part of the supportive best friend for nearly the past hour, but all this was doing was making him miss his own body more. Just as he was about to offer some advice to Debbie there was a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jenna! I'm done here if you want a ride back home!\" 'Martin' said from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Deb. I gotta go\" Martin said, at this point wanting his own body back more than anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting a ride back? After the pizza you had at the mall? What's up with you today, Jen? You've been strange in here too\" Debbie asked with a slightly concerned look on her face. That question gave Martin two important pieces of information. First, once a brainwash swap happened the person would remember everything that was done still, just thinking they'd done it and minus memories involving the remote. Second, if Martin wasn't able to totally fool Debbie, there was no chance Marco would fool anyone. Not without some additional help from the remote anyway...but that was a thought for later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Deb. I just haven't been feeling like myself today. I'll call you later\" Martin said before heading out with Marco. As soon as both were in the car, Martin grabbed the remote and used the normal swap button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank God!\" Martin exclaimed, finally back in his own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking the same thing\" Marco said with a smile as he immediatly cupped Jenna's breasts. Martin was so happy to be himself again, he didn't even comment as he drove back to his house. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Megan would still find out too, since its not like Jenna and I ever hang out.'</i> If he was going to let Marco do this, Megan deserved to know. Having her as backup could help too, just in case Marco made a decision they all regretted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, 'little bro', I'm going to go to my room for a bit,' the new Jenna announced as they got out of the car, as she started to head into the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold the phone Marco,\" Martin replied impatiently. \"Before you go wild, we have some business to take care of. I want to give Megan full disclosure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco sighed, exasperated. \"Was hoping we'd put this off, but alright. Let's go track her down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why Marco's in Jenna's body,\" Martin concluded, the three of them all gathered in Megan's room as Martin explained to Megan the events of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, for her part, seemed calm. If she felt strongly about the matter, she was hiding it well. \"You at least switched everyone else back right? Jenn is in Marco's body and Debby is in the right body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco nodded affirmatively, Jenna's hair flinging about his face as he did. \"Sure did! Martin wouldn't let me use the remote otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan seemed to atleast take some assurance from that. \"If the problem was grounding, why not just make Marco's mom lift the punishment though? You basically did as much anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin shrugged. \"It's easier if we're all together, and having Marco be Jenna gets him in our house with the fewest buttons clicked.\" He was silent for a moment as Megan seemed to stare through him. \"...and I figured it'd be nice to not have to deal with the real Jenna for a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not very responsible, Martin,\" Megan chided. \"Can we really just steal her life away like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only temporary!\" Marco assured Megan. \"So we can test it together! Think of it like... an extended sleepover? I'll be out of her body soon enough. Besides, can you really say I'll be a worse sister than Jenna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was quiet. \"...well, no.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco smiled, \"see, told you it'd be fine Martin! Now, I'm gonna go to my room for a bit and get acclimated. See you all at dinner!\" With that, he bounded out of the room, thrilled at the energy and stamina Jenna's body contained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan turned to Martin, shaking her head. \"I just don't think this is a great idea Martin. I wouldn't mind if it was someone like Sarah, but Marco makes bad decisions, a lot. We can both guess what he's going to do first thing in Jenna's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't like him, but Marco isn't that bad a guy Megan,\" Martin told her. \"He hasn't done anything with the remote that I haven't told him. He won't do anything TOO crazy as Jenna; he likes her body too much to ruin his time in it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But are you SURE he won't try to do more with the remote? Can we really keep control of it when more people know?\" Megan asked again, raising an eyebrow as her tone became more critical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, Megan. I told you all this specifically because of that. We can both keep an eye on it and Marco and nothing will go wrong. The remote seems to solve a lot of its own problems anyways. Debby seemed to think that she chose to do everything Marco and I did as her. You should try using it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan shook her head. \"I don't want to use it on anyone Martin. It just feels bad to do something like that to a person without their permission. Brainwashing in particular seems scary to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin frowned. He really wanted to get Megan to cut loose a bit more. Maybe a trip outside her own body could help her a bit? \"Well, I give you my permission then,\" Martin said as he held the device out towards her. He liked being back in his body, but he wanted to give Megan the chance. \"You can switch with Marco too if you'd like; he can't really object when it's not his real body. Now what do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just stared at the remote, a mixture of curiosity and anxiety on her face.</span></div></div>",

You have my full permission to use the remote on me. Or you can use it on Marco, if you want. It's ultimately your call\" he said with a friendly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just looked at the remote and gulped. It was obvious that she was incredibly unsure about all of this. Martin was about to say something again, but before he could Megan took the remote from him and held it in her hands carefully.  \"I don't want to switch with Marco...I'd really rather not have him in my body\" Megan said firmly and then looked at Martin with uncertain eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin put his hand on top of Megan's and looked at her firmly in the eyes. \"If you don't want to use the remote, I won't force you to. But if you want to give it a try, I'm telling you it's okay. I don't know how many times I can repeat that, Megan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded and closed her eyes, clearly deep in thought. In truth, she did want to try to the remote. She was curious to know what it would be like to be in a different body. But Megan was scared. She was scared that she would mess something up. Or worse. She was scared that she would like it. Power corrupts after all. And this remote which seemed to give the user absolute power, would no doubt corrupt absolutely. Would Megan become addicted to the thrill that the remote gave her? Would it change who she was? Did that matter? All of these were questions that could be avoided if Megan just gave the remote back to Martin right now and said 'thanks but no thanks'. But Megan didn't give the remote back to Martin. Instead she opened her eyes and looked at Martin with just a bit of newfound confidence. \"Thank you, Martin\" she said with a smile as she aimed the remote at her brother and pressed the button that was closest to her finger. </span></div></div>",

Martin found himself exhaling it as he was transferred into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Megan shouted in shock as she suddenly swung to her feet, having to grab the frame of the bed that Martin was sitting on just to keep her balance. \"I - somehow I, I didn't really imagine-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-That it actually works?\" Martin finished in Megan's voice, with a smirk. \"I know right? The weight of it doesn't really hit you until you use it.\" Martin himself was a bit offset by the switch too. Megan was, after all, much shorter and weaker than his, Jenny's, or Debby's body, but pure experience let him rebound faster than Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stared at him like a deer in headlights though, still adapting to the sight of her body acting without her. Martin had to stifle a laugh at the sight of his own body looking so taken aback and nervous. \"What? Want to trade back already, Megs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan shook her head. \"N-no. Not yet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Martin replied, eyes lighting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded. \"I may as well commit if I'm going to use it at all. If I trade back before having any chance to adapt, I think it'll bother me more. We... can stay like this. Just for a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin shrugged. \"Sure thing. How about we keep eachother's bodies until tomorrow, okay? I'll keep the remote in your room. After breakfast, we'll decide if we want to trade back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gave a nervous grin, both excited and scared by the proposition. \"Y-yeah! Tomorrow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence. \"So, uh, what do we do now...\" Megan asked, a hint of uncertainty creeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever we feel like,\" Martin said,falling backwards casually into Megan's desk chair. \"I'm Megan now, and you're Martin. There's no rules saying you have to do anything crazy when you switch. We can just do whatever Megan and Martin would do. Draw, read, watch TV, play video games, hang out with friends - it doesn't really matter.\" A wide smile broke out over Martin's new face as he had an idea. \"If you want to do something interesting though, you can call up Sarah! See how long it takes for her to notice something is off about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about that Martin. What would I do when she notices...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If</i> she notices,\" Martin corrected. \"And if she does, just tell her the truth and bring her to me. I plan on letting her know anyways. Not like I'd tell Marco and leave her in the dark.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll think about it....\" Megan said, noncommittally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all you have to do!\" Martin replied. \"Now, why don't you check out your new room for a bit and acclimate before dinner? Need to get into character less mom or dad get on us, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Megan replied, sounding a bit more sure. The confidence Martin was showing ,even in her body, was surprising. Even if she was faking it, she figured she would have to reciprocate the feeling. With that, she made her way to Martin's room, now hers for the night. </span></div></div>",

Of course, neither of the two were truly who they appeared to be. Martin was still dressed as Megan was when they swapped, with a green t-shirt and black jeans, but Marco had already seemingly showered and changed Jenna's body, wearing a pair of comfortable joggers and a tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does Megan feel?\" Marco asked casually as he clicked at various buttons on the controller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin grimaced a bit, something about the way Marco asked it made him uncomfortable. \"Not especially notable I guess,\" he replied. He thought about it a bit  more however, and continued. \"Small. Not as strong as my old body, and especially not as strong as Jenna. Doesn't feel bad though i guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco shrugged. \"She's not as sexy, but she's got charm. I bet if she tried harder, she could pull off a lot of cute looks. She's already cuter than Jenna, don't you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin gave a quizzical look to Marco, game still running, \"I don't exactly rate my sisters that way dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco shrugged, \"fair, sorry about that. Still, being Megan ain't a bad deal. What's she doing in your body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she might be out with Sarah,\" Martin replied. \"I put her up to it to see how well she could pull of the imitation. Fake it 'til you make it, you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if she messes up and Sarah finds out something's off?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we tell Sarah about the remote. I'm going to do it eventually anyways,\" Martin replied in a more aggressive tone than the real Megan ever spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marco was about to object, the match came to an end. \"Ah what? I lost? Bah! You only won because I lost my reflexes in Jenna's body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg doesn't play Call of Duty either, dude,\" Martin shot back with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but she's always drawing,\" Marco insisted. \"She has to have quick hands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure,\" Martin waved away the complaint. He looked out the window, and he saw it was beginning to get dark. \"So, what now? Might be a bit before Megan gets back.\" He pulled himself up from the floor, dusting off Megan's jeans as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco seemed to think on it a moment before a light went off in his head. \"Oh! We can switch, right? I'd like to give Megan's body a test drive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt Megan would like you in her body without her permission,\" Martin said. \"It was a struggle enough to get her to switch with me at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco shook his head, \"well, it ain't her decision right now, right? You're Megan, not her. So it's your body to trade until she gets it back. Now come on, what do you say? If you're really that worried about her reaction, we'll just change before she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what the answer is Marco. Consider yourself lucky to have Jenna, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco gave a sheepish grin, and gave up the fight, \"yeah I guess you're right. May as well get used to what I got before hopping around. Speaking of, I'm gonna take a moment or two to myself again if you don't mind,\" Marco announced as he got up to his feet as well and sauntered out of the bedroom. He looked back before exiting the door, \"I'd recommend you try it too. Trust me, it's incredible.\" With that, he left an uncomfortable Martin standing in what used to be his bedroom in his own sister's body, considering the possibilities before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dammit Marco,'</i> Martin grumbled mentally. He began to make his way over to Megan's bedroom, now his. <i>'Now I can't get that image out of my head...'<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, Megan shook her head and smiled at her brother. \"No thanks, Martin\" she said firmly with more confidence than Martin would have expected to hear out of her. \"I don't like the idea of a remote that can do all of these things. It's too much power for a human to have access to. If you and Marco are going to keep using it, I guess I can't stop you but please don't use it on me. At all. that's all that I ask\" she said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin nodded. \"I understand, Megan\" he said. Although Martin really did not understand how Megan could avoid the desire to use such a devise, he really did respect his sister's internal strength. In some ways, her willpower was stranger than both Martin and Marco's. \"I promise you that as long as I have a say in how this remote is used, it will never be used on you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope you keep having a say in how it's used\" Megan said, the worry returning to her voice as Martin put the remote in his pocket and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, Megan. Marco is a good guy and he's super happy to have Jenna's body. I think that'll be enough for him and even if it isn't, he's my best friend. I don't think we have anything to worry about from him\" Martin said, not knowing about what was going through Marco's head at the mall earlier. Martin was completely oblivious to the fact that his best friend had seriously contemplated swiping the remote and brainwashing Martin when the opportunity was presented to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Martin. I trust you\" Megan said, holding the door open so Martin could leave her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for understanding, Megan. I love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Martin\" Megan said and hugged her brother tightly. Though Jenna had always given them problems, Martin and Megan were always incredibly close. \"Just be careful with that remote. You and Marco aren't gods.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine, sis. I promise\" Martin said as he turned around to make his way back to his room, smiling mischievously as he felt the weight of the remote against his leg. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Martin returned to his phone and put the remote on his dresser before laying down in bed and closing his eyes. Boy, had this been a tiring day. Martin was ready to fall asleep early when he suddenly felt a vibration against his leg. Martin reached into his pocket to pull out his cell phone, which showed a text from his girlfriend. Sarah Johnson had been Martin's best friend throughout elementary and middle school. The two started dating fairly early in high school and had been happily seeing each other ever since. Sarah was one of the few things in his life that Martin was genuinely thankful for and Martin really did love her. The text on his phone told Martin that Sarah was thanking him for a wonderful time at the movies today. Martin remembered that the two had planned that for awhile, but finding the remote had caused Martin to go off on his own adventures. Clearly that didn't stop his body, which had at the time been under the control of a brainwashed Jenna, from going on their date, but since Martin himself wasn't actually there he couldn't remember a thing about it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin was about to reply that he had a great time too, but stopped typing midway through. He knew that if he was going to continue using the remote, it was only right for Sarah to be told about it. She was the girl that he loved and Martin wanted her to be a part of his life completely. That meant sharing the remote with her and letting her use it. With that decided, Martin dialed Sarah's number and waited for her to pick up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetheart. What's up?\" Sarah asked as she answered the phone. Martin smiled, as he always did when he heard her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe. Can you come over to my place? There's something that I have to show you as soon as possible. It's really important\" Martin said firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why couldn't you have told me this when we were together earlier?\" Sarah asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin sighed. \"I really can't explain it over the phone, babe. Please come over? I promise it'll be worth it\" Martin said, practically begging her at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be over in a bit. Love you\" Sarah said before hanging up. Martin then put his phone back into his pocket and picked the remote up in his hand. He didn't regret that he was about to tell Sarah about the remote. Bringing her into this was the right thing to do on every level. But Martin did worry about how she would react when she found out that Marco was also involved. Sarah and Marco had always hated each other with Sarah seeing Marco as a bad influence and Marco seeing Sarah as always holding Martin back. Not to mention the fact that Martin knew that Marco thought Sarah was hot. While he knew Marco would never jeopardize their friendship by trying anything on her, it did make things awkward when the three of them were together. Sarah would definitely be mad at Martin for sharing the remote with Marco first. The easiest solution to this was to not tell Sarah that Marco knew about the remote and split his time with the two of them. It would be easy to hang out with Marco since he was in Jenna's body. But if Sarah was going to be over a lot and know about the remote, it was only right for Martin to tell Marco that she was going to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Martin walked to Jenna's room and knocked on the door, still holding the remote. \"What's up, bro?\" Marco asked with a smirk on Jenna's as he opened the door. Jenna's body was completely naked, but wrapped in a towel. Clearly Marco was about to leave her room anyway to go take a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to tell you something. Can your fun in the shower wait a few minutes?\" Martin asked, walking into Jenna's room and sitting down on her bed. Martin would never have done something like that with the real Jenna, but he knew that Marco wouldn't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so\" Marco said with a shrug. \"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just invited Sarah over. I'm going to tell her about the remote\" Martin said firmly, holding the remote tightly in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?!?\" Marco asked, clearly ticked off and sounding just a bit too much like Jenna for Martin's comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's my girlfriend. She has to know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, She doesn't. You only think she does because you think you owe her something but you don't!\" Marco was clearly angry about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I owe her everything! She's the only one that really accepts me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept you!!!!!\" Marco practically screamed. \"I'm your best friend, bro! I understand that Megan knew about the remote before you told me about it. And I get that she's your sister so she kinda needs to know anyway. But why on earth would you invite Sarah over to tell her about it when she would have no idea otherwise? I mean, the whole point of the brainwash button is to prevent extra people knowing about the remote! Now Sarah's going to come here and ruin all of our fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Marco! She's going to ruin all of your fun. And that's only because your idea of fun is messed up! Clearly telling you that I'm going to tell Sarah about the remote was a bad idea...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It was\" Marco said as she took a few steps closer to Martin, blocking him from getting up from Jenna's bed. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marco suddenly pushed Martin down onto Jenna's bed and used Jenna's vastly superior strength to keep him down as the remote fell next to Martin. Marco pressed down hard on Martin's arm to prevent him from reaching for it and smiled evilly at his friend. \"I'm sorry about this, bro. I really am\" he said in Jenna's voice as he grabbed the remote. Without hesitation, he pointed the remote right at Martin and pressed the brainwash swap button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WERE YOU EVEN THINKING BARGING INTO MY ROOM WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO SHOWER YOU CREEP?!?!?!\" Jenna yelled as she tossed her annoying younger brother out of her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Jenna. I just wanted to ask you something!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well next time, have some manners you little brat!\" Jenna exclaimed, before pushing Martin against the wall and finally heading into the bathroom for her much needed shower. As the bathroom door closed, 'Martin' just grinned as he spun the remote in his hand and returned to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Martin's body, Marco was quite content with what had happened. Martin, in inviting over Sarah, had been stupid. The remote was clearly intended to be known about only by its user and making more people aware of it was a crime against its design. Martin wanting so many people to be aware of the remote had forfeited his own right to know about it. It was clear to Marco that he was the only one in this house worth of knowing about the remote, which meant that he had quite a mess to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco wasted no time, immediately knocking on Megan's door. \"What is it, Martin?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Marco could have pretended to be Martin for a little, he just wanted to get things over with so he immediately pointed the remote at Megan and pressed the 'programming button'. While the button was held down, Megan's face became completely emotionless. \"Forget everything about the remote.\" He said before releasing the button and seeing the life return to Megan. \"Hey Megan, do you know what this is?\" Marco asked, holding the remote in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it looks weird. What is it?\" Megan asked, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing important. Just something a friend made for  project that he wanted my opinion on\" Marco said before heading back to Martin's room. With that done, he was the only one in the house to currently know about the remote and that was exactly how things were going to stay. Of course, Marco now had a few options ahead of him. On one hand, Marco really enjoyed being Jenna. once she came out of the shower, it would be very easy to switch back into her body, giving Martin back his real body but without memories of the remote. Since Jenna hated her siblings anyway, Marco could pay them no attention and still use the remote as he pleased. With Jenna's body he would also have access to plenty of college kids as well as easy access to his own older sister if he ever wanted to return to his real body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option that Marco had was one that was a bit more evil. Martin had invited Sarah over and it would be a shame if he didn't get atleast a taste of that fine body of hers. Marco could have some fun screwing (maybe even literally?) with Martin by pretending to be his girlfriend and then he could easily either swap back here or keep her as his body. After all, Sarah was smoking hot and Marco would definitely want to spend lots of quality time getting to know her body. Plus, she was an only child which would make experimenting more with the remote in her house way easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Marco decided to...</span></div></div>",

Both were really good choices and well, it was simply too good to pass up. He remembered about the 'programming function' embedded in the remote and thought about how to stretch it further for his benefit. An eye on Megan's room, Marco proceeded with his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>***</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi Martin, what is it?\" Megan said when she opened the door after Marco rapped his knuckles a few times against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Marco grinned, for he was borrowing Martin's body, \"I want to show you something,\" Marco said slowly as he brandished the remote out. There was no harm in showing Megan the remote. If anything, wiping out her memories or even doing brainwash swap with her would be easy as pie, \"Can I come in?,\" Marco gave a glance at the bathroom, \"I don't want Jenna to know\" he spoke in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can,\" Megan moved aside so that the person that she thought was her brother could enter her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Too easy</i>, Marco thought. A brief thrill ran over his body. A hassle free way would be to just zap Megan there and then, but where was the fun in that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you take a seat <i>sis</i>, while I show you this remote\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco didn't say anything, instead he pointed the remote at Megan and pressed the 'programming function' button, \"You'll think that you're a copy of Marco\", Marco paused,\" Just in Megan's body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wicked,\" an evil grin that was on Megan's face reminded Marco of his own, that he had to do a brief double-take when he saw the grin that was usually on his face, plastered on Megan's usually innocent and cute face. Megan ran her hands over her body, stopping only briefly to sneak a quick squeeze of her own breasts. \"Give it a few years mmmm,\" Megan said to herself, \"She'd probably rival Jenna\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not as sexy, <i>yet</i> but she's got charm. I bet if she tried harder, she could pull off a lot of cute looks. She's already cuter than Jenna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure her friends think so too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky them,\" Megan twirled around thriumphantly, \"Because this girl is now under new management. Thanks to this little remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco grinned, it was a lot of hard work and there were minor adjustments that he had to make to Megan's psyche, but ultimately, he was able to program Megan so that she thinks that she really was Marco in Megan's body with access to the real Megan's thoughts, memories and mannerisms. Martin who wante so many people to be aware of the remote had forfeited his own right to know about it. It was obvious that the only person that Marco could trust was himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's not let <i>our sister</i> be kept waiting for longer,\" Martin rose up from his seated position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want twerps?\" Jenna said in exasperation at her siblings who were blocking her way to her room. Her towel clad body left little for the imagination as her generous bosom and toned ass made a remarkable outline, \"Get the fuck out of my way,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut tut\" Martin said, \"You're going to be nicer to us from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck? Have you gone nuts?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco didn't answer, instead he lifted up the remote and zapped Jenna with the 'programming function' button, ready to make the last person currently in the household into a copy of himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few minutes ago, Marco made the same alterations on Jenna that he did with Megan. By the time he was done, Jenna was thoroughly convinced that she was Marco with the only parts of Jenna left being the parts of her thoughts, memories and mannerism's that were being made use of. With that done, the two female Marco's went to Jenna's room to enjoy each others company while the original Marco went downstairs and waited for Martin's girlfriend to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her heard the ring of the doorbell, Marco had everything that he was about to do planned out and he imagined that if 'Jenna' and 'Megan' ever decided to take a break from their fun, they would easily figure out what he had in mind. He took a deep breath as he put the remote that he had been fidgeting with into his pocket and walked to the door. \"Who is it?\" He asked, feigning ignorance, a playful smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else would it be, baby?\" Sarah asked, with an innocent smile on her face that Marco could see through the hole in the door. She clearly thought that her boyfriend was playing a joke on her. Of course, she was half right about that. There was a joke being played on her, but it certainly was not being played by her boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. Maybe it was one of the other girls I have on call\" Marco said, opening the door and pulling Sarah into a kiss as he closed the door behind her and pressed her body against it with his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other girls? And how would you have managed that under my nose, Martin Remy?\" Sarah asked playfully before kissing Marco back and wrapping her arms around his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco just kept grinning as he pulled himself away from her and took a step back. \"Because I'm not Martin Remy\" he said, his face taking on Marco's trademark grin as he grabbed Sarah's hand and pulled her towards him. She gasped from surprise as she found herself pulled towards the person she thought was her boyfriend and then pressed against the wall by his body. He was a lot closer to her now and she could feel a very powerful erection against her thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Then who might you be?\" She asked. Her voice was playful, but there was a slightly nervous twinge in it. Martin had never done something like this before, and while she certainly did not mind him being so direct, there was a look in his eyes that made her just a little bit...scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco caught that hint of nervousness and his grin grew wider. He wrapped on of his arms around Sarah's slender body, effectively holding her in place against the wall while his other hand removed the remote from his pocket and pointed it Sarah, who was too busy looking in his eyes to notice. \"Well, it's a bit of a long story. I started this day as Marco Hermida. But now...I'm going to be Sarah Johnson\" he said as he pressed...</span></div></div>",

I haven't had to deal with someone react to a swap yet. I see why the brainwash function is so popular. But there's so much to clean up now...\" he said in his new voice, loving the luscious sound that escaped from his stolen mouth. He licked his stolen lips and pointed the remote at Sarah (in Martin's body) before pressing the \"programming button\". \"Sarah, you know exactly how you're in Martin's body...but since you memory clearly isn't on par with your looks, allow me to fill in the blanks for you. You've been madly in love with Marco ever since Martin introduced us. You would flirt with me whenever you can and every time that you and Martin banged, you were thinking of me. You were about to finally break up with him so that the two of us could be official when I showed you the remote and told me all about my plan. Now Martin's out of the picture. You have his body with two of me to share the house with you and pleasure you in all sorts of ways while I'm taking good care of your old body. Oh, and you'll do anything that me or my copies tell you to, because you just love making us happy. Has it all come back to you now, babe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah frowned and put a hand on her head. Suddenly her frown turned upside-down and the current-Martin hugged her former body tightly before passionately kissing who she knew was her love, Marco. \"Mmmm, it's all clear as day, baby\" she said in Martin's voice, still clearly disoriented from the swap. \"I didn't believe you about the remote at first, not that that you've proved it...oh man, this is kinky. I hope you don't have too much fun in my body tonight\" she said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco laughed. \"and I hope YOU don't have too much fun with Martin's sisters. I know you can have a dirty mind, but incest is still a little fucked up, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'M not actually Martin and they aren't actually my sisters\" the new Martin said with a playful grin, though one that looked very different than Marco's distinct one. \"I think I'll go up and let them know that we swapped. I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing that they won't be happy for you to join with. See you later, lover!\" Marco exclaimed as he walked outside to Sarah's hot pink convertible.

Martin however went towards the other side of the store looking at the Fun &amp; Games section of the store.  While Martin was browsing around, he spotted Sarah doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah.\" Martin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Jenna.  Didn't think I'd see you in here.\"  Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, Debbie and I are here, and I thought I'd stop in and see what my brother might be planning on me next. You wouldn't happen to know would you?\" questioned Martin .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.  Well I was just about to get a box or two of weird jellybeans to surprise him with next time we meet.\" Sarah told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm well can I talk to you for a second, outside the store for a bit.  I think Debbie might be a while and I don't really see anything I like.\" Martin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin accompanied Sarah as she paid for the boxes of jellybeans and headed outside the store, as Marco was too busy looking at everything to notice.  As they got out of view of the store, Martin and Sarah sat down on a nearby bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it that we had to go out of the store that we couldn't talk about while in there Jenna?\" Sarah asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well it's kindof a long story but to make things shorter I'm not actually Jenna, I'm actually Martin.\" Martin said plainly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again? You aren't 'Jenna'? I suppose that 'Debbie' isn't herself either.\" Sarah replied skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct too.  'Debbie' is actually Marco, since he got grounded for whatever crazy thing he didn't tell me about.  See I found this weird remote that dropped off some truck and it turned out to be a body switching remote and so I swapped with Jenna and headed over to Marco's place where he told me he was grounded.  So in order to go and get him out of it, he used the remote to swap himself with Debbie and we decided to come to the mall.\" Martin fully explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I believe you maybe not because of that mess of a story, but for the fact that a girl doesn't usually keep her legs wide open for the world to see.  Just for fun though, how about you do something really embarrassing for Jenna?\" Sarah jokingly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I got just the thing.\"  Martin does a double take for a second, looking both ways as to make sure there would be as few onlookers as could be. 'Jenna' then took her arms and cupped her breasts and started jiggling them. \"God I just love having boobs, they are the best part of being a girl in my opinion don't you think?\" 'Jenna' then put her hands back to her sides and continued on as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just burst out laughing when Martin was done. \"Yeah that's embarrassing alright. Okay I believe you. Um so, how long are you planning on keeping Jenna's body?\" questioned Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long I suppose. I wanted to at least have a day to get away from Jenna's bitchiness all the time.  Marco, on the other hand, might keep Debbie's body outside of the house while he's grounded.\" Martin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds okay, as long as he's only doing it outside the house and not being Debbie for the whole week. By the way, he sure is taking a long time are we sure he didn't get 'lost'.\" Sarah said, as they both looked back towards the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me, as long as he isn't causing trouble. But yeah, so I was going to tell you about this sooner but I was still amazed that this thing actually works.\"  Martin told her reassuringly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco eventually came out of the store with a bag of clothes and some other practical jokes for later.  Marco was a bit upset that Martin had told Sarah about the remote but as long as he was getting out of being grounded for the week he would get over it.  Sarah eventually suggested to the two that they could have a girls night out tomorrow.  While Marco detested such an idea, Martin was more accepting seeing as how Sarah was his girlfriend and was a little excited of such a thing happening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up one morning. Groggily yawning as you removed your bed cover only to be greeted by the sight of two taut mounds on your chest. After two months of waking up to them, you still felt aroused. It has also been two months since your best friend Marco had stayed in your house as Megan. He was resistant to it at first, but he soon realized that Megan had more 'potential' than Debbie or Jenna and had happily stayed in your younger sister's body, making few alteration to his new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and examined yourself in the mirror, you tried to keep yourself fit as Jenna would have likened it, but with less a bitchy attitude. School was scheduled to be back in another week and after being Jenna and casually Megan or Jessica and some random girls you met, you could not wait to test the remote on the females at school. You were thinking on returning back as yourself, as Martin... or continue as Jenna. Marco had a plan of his own as Megan and that was to hook up with Alyssia, the school's self proclaimed lesbian and perhaps more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good morning sis!'', Megan suddenly entered your room. No one would have recognized her change over the holiday. Long gone her long frizzy dark brown hair, to be replaced by slightly wavy blonde one. Her eyes were blue of the contacts, but Marco kept her glasses' frame and fitted them with normal lenses. ''Your sister's kinda like the sexy secretary, you know?'', Marco grinned two months ago as he examined his newest body, you could only felt a sense of disbelief on the extent of Marco's pervertedness. ''Cute face, boobs, glasses, well, well... I think I'll make a fine Megan.'', again Marco grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stood in behind you, clothed in stylish pink and mini denim jeans. Your parents were surprised at the change, but Marco were able to do it subtly.  Bill and Helen could only watch as their daughter were transformed in front of their eyes, but as Marco was cunning, he knew his boundaries and got away with it. ''Looking good.'', Megan approached you from behind as she groped at your firm bosom, playing with them and giving a light squeeze, before inserting her fingers to your cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aaaah....'', you moaned feeling a bit weak at the knees as a wave of pleasure went and gone through your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, seemingly feeling satisfied with what she had done, crashed to the bed and wiped her stained fingers against the sheet. The new Megan no longer had interest in drawing, RPG and stuff like that, instead, she filled her time watching porn movies, if not having a 'wild' day with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Marco...is that? What I think it is?'', you looked at Marco in Megan's body. The pink top was quite loose that it gave you unrestricted view of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yep, just got these bras yesterday.'', Megan replied with a smug grin as she caressed over her body. ''Can't wait to get back to school!', she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to get dressed properly while Megan took off her glasses, setting them beside a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No one's gonna recognize her anymore'', you eyed Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So? Let them see the new Megan!'', Megan replied, Marco's trademark of a stupid grin was apparent in her face. The real Megan was in fact in Debbie's body, oblivious to the fact that her body has been bizarrely transformed beyond recognition. ''Why're you wearing that? Bill and Helen... I mean, mom and dad had gone to work.'', Megan stated, commenting on your choice of apparel, Jenna's usual cream colored top and some pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whatever, I'm hungry. Gonna go get some pizza, you want some?'', Megan gingerly got up and took out an iPhone from her pocket. Marco had bought a new iPhone using the money that the real Megan had saved up to buy some other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, get me the bacon pineapple one.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''One large pepperoni and one large bacon pineapple please'', Megan spoke to the counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Pizza today?'', your old body quizzically asked as you and Megan laid out the pizza on the dining table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, want some bro?'', Megan asked chirpily as she took a slice of the bacon and pineapple and giving it to Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No cookies?'', Jessica pouted. ''I want cookies.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Cookies are not for brunch. Eat your pizza.'', you nudged Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you then finished the pizzas, with some occasional friendly banters and conversation in between. Two months ago, you would have dismissed a scene like this as an occasional delusion from playing too much Halo 3 until the next morning, but with you as Jenna and Marco as Megan, somehow, the four of you were able to get together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco told you that Martin, your old body was suspicious, but he in the end welcomed the change that befell his sisters although Megan seemed to be getting weird and he missed the frequent eyes to eyes conversation that he used to have with his younger sister, although he welcomed Jenna's change in attitude with arms open wide. Marco however, successfully fooled your old body into thinking that everything was okay and the change was for her own well being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you munched on the last piece of pizza, you decided on what you should do next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were not going to bother doing your usual jog, the old Jenna would not have missed it for the world. It was around 7.30 that you managed to lift yourself up from the comfy bed. However, you decided to let your body run in auto pilot, just like Jenna would do each morning and before you knew it, you were ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.35am. The whole family were eating downstairs, you noticed Megan wore a low cut top with jeans. Your school did not have a uniform, unlike some other schools. You thought about your plan for the day. You were not sure that you would want to go as Jenna. Although you can easily fall back to the auto pilot, but you wanted to experiment with the remote in your own school, you also wanted to see what would Marco do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited, you went back upstairs and began to read the long forgotten manual of the remote as you clutched the remote in your hand. Neither you nor Marco used the remote much as both of you were busy playing the characters. You did swap with him twice and felt the new Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a small inscription 'VICTIMS OF BLUE AND YELLOW BUTTONS WILL NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING RELATED TO THE REMOTE WHEN THE BLACK BUTTON IS PRESSED, HOWEVER THEY WILL THINK THAT THEY DO THE ACTION BY THEMSELVES' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoa cool.'', you exclaimed. With that, you called out your old body and without him noticing pressed the blue button on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why're you changing back?'', Megan asked you before the two of you went to your respective classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Gotta do something.'', you replied her.''Remote's with me, if you want anything, just give me a ring.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sure''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see that the new Megan was attracting a lot of attention from the popular girls and jocks that usually would never pay attention to her. One of the teacher, Ms. Shauna Robertson even gave her a remark on her low cut top, but Megan brushed it aside and strode confidently to class. <i>Hopefully nothing bad'll happen...</i>, you muttered. Your attention was soon distracted though by Marco's body running to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey man!'', Marco came with his stupid grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your old body went to Marco's to hang out with him and you took Jessica to one of her friends' place to play, much to her delight. While the two were out, you and Marco did various things with the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Marco then shared a lot of stories, just like you always did as the two of you made your way to the class...</span></div></div>",

Kelly Black did not know what hit her when you zapped the blue button at her during lunch break. A natural beauty with ample bosom and ass, she was one of the beauties in your school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hi.'', you chirped as you approached Megan. Kelly and Megan shared a class, although Kelly usually would not want to be associated with geeks like your younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hi.'', Megan quipped back, after exchanging winks Megan knew that you were inhabiting Kelly's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the table, strangely there was not a lot of Megan's geekier friends there. Seemed like Marco really changed your younger sister. Instead, much to your shock, Allyssa, the school's self proclaimed lesbian sat beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hi Kelly.'', Allysa looked at you beaming, her brown eyes twinkling as her gaze fixated on your boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Are you two really...'', Allyssa gasped as you and Megan looked at her like a piece of meat in a secluded shower room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah.'', Megan moaned as she leant in closer and closer before engaging Allyssa in a deep kiss. While her body pinned Allyssa's against the wall, you could see Megan's fingers made short work of Allyssa's skirt, before ultimately rubbed against her cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh.. Mmmmmhhh.'', Allyssa's moan muffled by the kiss. She the unexpectedly pushed Megan away, fixed her skirt and ran out. As soon as she was outside, you and Megan burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, that got to 'cure' her for good.'', you giggled in Kelly's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan however, looked dejected afterwards. ''Aww, and I was getting aroused too!.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So you decided to make Megan your main body?'', you asked quizzically when you and Megan got home. You were in your old body again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah man, I'm going to make her run for student council, kinda hot wouldn't it be?'', Megan grinned as she sat spreading her legs. You looked at her in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoa... that's... ''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Awesome right?!'', Megan cut your sentence short. ''You going to help me, man?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave it a good thought...</span></div></div>",

I just kinda feeling guilty you know...

The reason you felt weird last night is because the past few months you have been under the influence of Marco and he made you do the things you were doing for the past few months.\" You told Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MONTHS!? And you didn't bother to stop him during this?\" Megan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to but..... I was having a little bit of fun too and for the most part he had the remote, so even if I wanted to I would have needed the remote. Look, when we go to school, I'll get the remote and you can have your revenge or do whatever you want with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not what bothers me at the moment Martin. The fact is that I cannot even remember when Marco even switched with me is the part that troubles me. I remember Jenna going to his house that day you showed me the remote, and her friend Debbie coming home with her. After that is--wait.......you did not..... \" Megan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg.

I found this note: 'VICTIMS OF BLUE AND YELLOW BUTTONS WILL NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING RELATED TO THE REMOTE WHEN THE BLACK BUTTON IS PRESSED, HOWEVER THEY WILL THINK THAT THEY DO THE ACTION BY THEMSELVES'.

Monday was a drag, You had to go and babysit Jessica and Marco was out having some fun of his own as Megan with her new friends. Tuesday went by slow as well, as you went about Jenna's fitness routine the whole day jogging in the morning having a small but healthy breakfast, and then it was off to the Gym to go on the treadmill and lift some weights. The highlight of the day came during dinner time when your old body had said Sarah was coming over on Thursday.  Then Wednesday had come along and you were finally able to relax.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went and woke up and went about jogging in the morning as usual and came home, ate breakfast and went straight up to your room.  You turned on the T.V. and watched the food channel for a little bit until you were bored and started to pick up a book and read until it was lunch.  Marco then came into the room and asked if you wanted to play Halo 3 with your old body again.  That got you thinking about the other day as you zoned out for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that a yes or a no?\" Marco asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, sure just give me a minute.\" You said as Marco went downstairs to set the match up with your old body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes,you made yourself get up and head downstairs over to the Xbox and started playing a match. You played a couple more games of Halo before calling it quits. Marco stops playing once you do and went back upstairs, to surf the internet presumably to watch more porn, while you made your way up to the bathroom to take a bath before dinner.  The bath was pretty relaxing although you couldn't shake off the fact that ever since you saw and heard Marco tell your old self that her changing was for the best, you had second thoughts about showing Marco the remote in the first place.  You remembered the paper that you and Megan both had signed as each other that you weren't going to use the remote on each other without the other knowing and that is when you secretly made up your mind.  The rest of the bath went smoothly after you got that off your chest.  You got out of the bath feeling refreshed, and changed out of your workout clothes. By that time dinner was ready and you went down to eat. You decided to have a hot dog and fries and go back upstairs to call it a night.  You went back to watching T.V for a couple of hours and fell asleep reading your new book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday finally came along and you spent most of the day playing with Marco on the Xbox and outside after your morning jog passing the time until Sarah came over. Your old body answered the door and before your old body took Sarah upstairs you had asked to talk with her before she left. You lied to Marco about what it was about and just set up the Xbox for more games of Halo 3 with him.  You creamed him so badly he wanted to quit early and go play on the internet again. You jumped at the perfect opportunity to finally set things straight and get back the old Megan and hope that she would forgive you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah, Can you come down here?\" you yelled up to your room hoping Sarah heard you. You heard a door open and saw Sarah at the top of the stairs coming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea Jenna, what's up?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been doing a lot of thinking and well, here you better come outside for this.\" You said opening the front door to the stoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Sarah. I have to come clean.  You haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary in the way we've been acting the past month or two?\" You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not necessarily you or Martin in particular, but Megan sure changed a lot.But I thought she said she wanted to do other things and that other stuff was just a phase.  She's even become less shy not needing my help at all. I don't know what got into her but it sure gave her a confidence booster.\" Sarah told you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yea.\" nervously chuckling \"I think that is the problem though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what do you mean? Explain.\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, All of this is wrong, Megan, Jenna, you, me, Jessica . I got carried away the past two months and it's spiraling out of control. I just want it to stop right now.\" You told her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Jenna what are you talking about?\" said Sarah, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. I know I look like Jenna, but I'm not. It's really me Sarah, Martin.  I found this dumb remote 2 months ago and I showed Megan it and I was planning on showing you or Marco next and I chose Marco over you. He was grounded that day and so I asked him if he wanted to use the remote to get out and he asked if he could possess Megan so I let him and now Marco has me in a huge mess. That's why she's been acting weird as of late. It's all been Marco for the last two months.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then how did you end up as Jenna then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in the midst of all this I was sick and tired of Jenna always being a bitch so I decided I needed a break from all that so I just swapped with her and let her live my life without knowing she swapped.\" You say, elaborating further<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright so why are you telling me this now?\" Sarah asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took out the piece of paper which held yours and Megan's signature and showed Sarah. \"Listen I really miss how Megan and I used to talk and how she used to be. I know I screwed up but I want you to help me make it right.\" You said pleading Sarah for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what do you want me to do?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we get Megan back.  Then I know Megan will have a few choice words for him. Then comes punishment. and I'm hoping that Megan can forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she will if you really mean it.\" Sarah said trying to calm you down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here come with me upstairs and let's fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah followed you upstairs to your room where you took the remote and headed over to Megan's room to get Megan back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jenna you didn't tell Sarah about that thing did you?\" Marco asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I did Marco, Can you hold still for a minute I want to try something real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Marco said, not aware of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco fell hook line and sinker as you aimed the remote at him held down the black button. A flash enveloped the room. and Marco was sucked out of Megan and materialized again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you give the remote to Sarah knowing she wouldn't let anything else happen to Megan and would keep it away from Marco, and run over to Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan!\" You cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. what happened, and why do I have a major headache\" Megan asked still feeling a little woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Megan I'm here, It's Martin.\" You tell Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. The last thing I remember you had that crazy remote and you were going to go over to your weirdo friend's house.  How long have I been out?\" asked Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been at least 2 months Megs.\" You answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! 2 MONTHS!\" Megan said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sure woke you up in a flash.\" You respond<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we signed that paper. What the heck did you do to me?\" Megan screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't Martin, Megan. Marco had kept pestering him till he gave in to get out of trouble and use the remote.\" Sarah said trying to calm Megan down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this true Martin?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Absolutely. I promise I didn't mean for it to be this long, Marco said he would stop after a few days and days became weeks.\" You said begging for forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Alright I believe you. As for you Marco you are going to have to pay for this. I don't know why I look the way I do nor do I care, all that matters is I don't like it. You my friend, are going to pay dearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sarah, whatever you do make sure he does not leave.\" Megan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to your room you asked Megan what you had planned for him. She told you wanted to see the notepad first and then she would make up her mind. You went and got the notepad from your hiding place and gave it to Megan. She skimmed over it for a couple of minutes and then told Martin's old body to call Marco's house and tell his dad that he will stay the night at their house tonight and went back to her room to give Marco his punishment once Martin told Megan that he was able to, he went back to her room to issue her punishment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Marco.  If you want to be a part of this family so badly I will let you.\" Megan said grinning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Marco asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan aims the remote at Marco starts pressing the green button and then plants her thumb on the sensor on the remote. Marco looked on in horror as he could only imagine what would happen next. and in the blink of an eye it was done. Megan opened her eyes and the punishment had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think? Pretty good huh?\" Megan asked you and Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask her.\" Megan replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HER!?\" Sarah and You both said loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that right Jessica?\"Megan replied jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't!?\" Martin asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What didn't she do Martin?\"  'Marco' asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... nothing Jessica. Here... go play with this.\" You told 'Marco' hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good huh?\" Megan asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned Marco into Jessica?\" Sarah asked Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, basically. so now he can go play with Martin and I more and I can go and live my life and best of all I don't lose any of my memories.\" Megan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first of all, that's brilliant, and second, I am going to laugh so hard when Jessica and Marco see each other.\" Sarah says bursting out laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you stay as Jenna if you want to if you won't be as much as a pain as she normally is\" Megan told you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do me one thing, promise me you won't let the remote fall into the wrong hands like I did\" You told Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'm sticking to that piece of paper no matter what. Although you still will get a punishment after his is done. Don't worry it won't be that bad if you promise you'll spend time with me fixing this mess.\" Megan replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Yeah, sure. Anything I can do to help out Megs.

The three of you get ready to go and pay when you hear one of the popular kids from Megan's grade coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Megan, I didn't think you were into bowling.\" Kevin says to you. \"Don't be ridiculous she can't bowl, that's why she needs those glasses.\" added Elizabeth, who Megan recognized as one of the cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea. Why don't we lane side-by-side and we'll see who can really bowl!\" You say as Megan nudges and pulls you off to the side for a second. \"Are you crazy? I told you I can't bowl.\" She reminded you. \"Relax. we're here to have fun. this will just make it a little bit... interesting.\" You say, trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say?\" You say, turning back towards Elizabeth and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The four of us vs you three? Sure why not. I  could use a break from a real game, just don't cry when you lose. See you at the lane then\" Michael replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see who will be crying when we're done with you.\"  You say confidently, while Megan just sighs. \"I guess you want me to bring my A-game then.  I don't want to embarrass you, and more importantly Megan.\" Sarah asks you. \"It'd help.\" you reply. \"It doesn't matter anyway I'll just drag you guys down anyway.\" Megan starts to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You just go on and have fun and we can take care of them, now let's get some shoes.\" You say, already paying the man at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try...\" Megan whispers to herself before realizing she doesn't know her new shoe size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are your shoes guys. Go beat those guys into the dirt.\" The man behind the counter says as he hands Megan her shoes. Megan just stares at the shoes until you grab them for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you and Megan are ready the match begins. The popular kids let us go first and the games begun as you step up towards the lane. You toss the ball down the lane which glides with a perfect spin and lands a strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad for a first timer huh...?\" You say leaving most of the popular kids at a loss of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beginner's luck\" Michael retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Do it again and I'll be impressed\" is Kevin's response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's turn came up and she rolled a gutter ball and then knocked down three pins, much to the amusement of the other kids. While Sarah, on the other hand had no problem keeping up with you as she scored a strike of her own which led to your turn again. Walking up to the lane again you wind up and throw the ball which proceeds to land a split \"Hah, a split.\" Kev smirks. \"No big deal. Watch and learn.\" You tell him while throwing the ball at the pins which bounce into each other picking up a spare, causing Kevin to grumble a little as you walk back triumphantly. A few frames later your team was winning by a few points since Megan started to do a little better.  At around the second to last frame is when the popular kids were a few points away from winning. Megan was up and knocked down six pins while Elizabeth and her friend started to choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it's time to end this little game of ours.\" You say, as you finish off the game with a spare with Megan following, while Sarah finishes with a strike ending the game with roughly a twenty point difference between the two teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, like I said it's just beginner's luck. Come on guys let's get out of here.\" Michael says, heading back towards the front of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We actually won?\" Megan asks in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure did, did you have fun?\" You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the beginning not so much but as the game went on I started to, although I am not as good as you or Sarah.\" She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I'm nowhere near as good as her either. That's why you don't see me going bowling with her often, cause I know she'll leave me in the dust.\" You jokingly say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now? and all this time I was under the impression that you were busy babysitting your little sister.\" Sarah adds as she lets out a laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, now that bowling is over what else do you want to do?\" you ask Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking of going and getting new manga since I have some catching up to do and then maybe go check on your jerk of a best friend. Megan told you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sure, anything you want Megan.\" You say as you head towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You park your car in front of the house and walk towards the house. You knock on the door and are greeted by Alisha, Sarah's mother. Alisha is a very beautiful woman and you must admit you have the hots for her at one time, and probably still do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisha was dressed in a pajama bottoms and a tank top since it was still a bit early in the morning around 10:30 on a saturday in mid June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Martin, you're here early, Sarah should be upstairs.\" - Alisha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good morning, thanks.\" - you greet her as you enter the house. You and the Johnson's were on good terms and they even treat you as another son, so coming over so early hasn't really upset them at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou towards Sarah's room as you have millions of times since you were 10 when you were next door neighbors one time and were often babysat by Alisha. Peaking near Sarah's room, you knock on the door quietly, and pop your head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you find Sarah still asleep in her bed with the fan blowing, window open and a sheet for a blanket since it was a scorching hot day. Her room was very tidy too which was always a little rough for you because you weren't the neatest person in the world. You pull out the device and remember back at the instructions at how the age options work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold down the small bulgy purple button which causes the number pad to light up, the numbers below the buttons glow blue as well which signals you to type in an age number. You input the number 37, aim the device with your thumb on the sensor, and hit the purple button again. This causes a quick black laser to hit Sarah and you notice the changes beginning:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour GF starts growing height-wise about 5 more inches, her waist and hips start expanding some more including her chest. Her hair was straight begins to grow more from her shoulders down to her elbows. Her head grows a tiny bit larger, her face ages as well as her nose and eyes separate a bit more out but not by much, To finish the change her clothes which was also a white tank top and pajama bottoms grew as well fitting this new Sarah. The changes have been completes as you drop the remote on the carpet and are stunned as the new older (hotter) Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really found an older version of your Gf extremely hot and you can't wait to see her reaction. You tiptoe out the door, pocket the remote, and close the door. You knock, this time loudly on the door hoping to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stirs from her bed and finally wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" - Sarah says. Her voice sounds similar to her regular young voice but she's disoriented after waking up that she doesn't notice a change at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe its Martin, are you up? You wanna see a flick to...\" - You say as you're cut off with a thud coming from a pillow hitting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still sleeping you goof, come back in an hour!\" - she says a bit miffed. Sarah is very easygoing and doesn't get that angry at times, but this is as pissed as she can get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring she didn't notice, you try:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's with your voice? you sick.\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gets Sarah up as she hops out of bed and slowly walks towards the door, she passes the mirror, doesn't notice her adult body and opens it to chew you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens as your face to........ face with your girlfriend for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou naturally a 5'11 guy and Sarah a 5'7 girl, it was shocking to see her standing even with you. This was also the first time you actually got to check out Sarah's older self in clear detail and this even shocked you, that your mouth hung out. The whole idea of Sarah being older really made you hot that you blurted out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy............ shit!!\" - you say stunned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to sleep her Mar.... what's with you?\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-s-sarah? L-l-l-look in the mirror...... You're..... Uh..... WOW!\" - you say also trying to act like you had no part in this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Hey, did you shrink....?\" - Sarah runs to the mirror and finally sees herself....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah doesn't react naturally like screaming her lungs out, but takes two steps back and drops to the ground fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch her before she falls to the ground. You relax her on the bed and go out and get some smellingsalts to wake her up. <br>\r\nShe comes to as she wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Martin.... I dreamt that I woke up and was an old woman.......\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty seven actually.\" - you say with a grin <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,what?!\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah knocks you to the ground, gets up and runs to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, its not a dream...... I'm....\" - Sarah says stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did this happen?\" - you say trying to fake innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks at you for awhile then back to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin?\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this, didn't you?\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!!!\" - you say stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one thing, I noticed you're more calm than usual. Secondly, why hasn't my mother or father come in here, I figured you would at least go and get her after seeing me like this, thirdly that snake in your pants is telling me you're really gettin off of this, and lastly, how'd you come up with that number to how old I am here? Hmmm?\" - Sarah says while looking at you face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that's why I love you, you always catch on to things. I can never fool you.\" - you say dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out the remote and tell her all about it. You hand it to her, she looks at it and then:</span></div></div>",

It must come with the age.\"  - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pretty damn weird, but I kind of like how we are. We could pass as a legit family.

You're still just a kid, you should go out and live like a kid. You're time for adulthood isn't now.\" - Alisha says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not let her? It could be a new learning experience, and Sarah really seems to enjoy it, so lets just let her have her fun.

Why?\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could turn into a ghost and fly off to my sisters and get some clothes.

But you almost choke on your toast as the three of you are stunned in shock:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisha emerges into the kitchen as a young beautiful sixteen year old version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh MY GOD!~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" - you yell out loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma?! You're?\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, you're.... wow!\" - Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear Martin, I only got the clothes and then just changed myself, that was all. I flew to my sisters house, got some clothes for Sarah, decided to change myself to 16 years old because I was curious, and I feel like Sarah, I really love being this way. I borrowed this outfit too from my niece and it seems to fit. Here you are Sarah.\" - Alisha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisha hands Sarah the bag as she walks slowly and seductively and sits on Jacks lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, I love myself an older man.\" - Alisha flirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOMMA PLEASE!\" - Sarah says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alisha, wow, I remember you like this since we started dating!

Make me seventeen like when me and Alisha first met. I want to show her the time of her life as if we just started dating again.\" - Jack says proudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile inwardly as you are liking this new closeness that your GF's parents are partaking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marty, when I did the change I also gave myself my old sixteen year old mindset so add that as well.\" - Alisha says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... okay....\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou change Jack as he shrinks a few inches. He was still a tall man even as a teenager. His bald head changed as he grew hair again and when it was done he emerged as a seventeen year old kid about a few inches taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Alisha then get together and head into the living room to plan out where they want to go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that's cute. Good for them.\" - you say proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you finish up and go up to Sarah's room to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah begins changing as you watch from her bed.

I mean, I kinda want you to...\" -  Sarah stop midway through her talk and you cuddle her from behind. You wrap your arms around her waist and begin kissing her arms up to her neck.

I meant to say I think you should change as well. I.... just don't know about this.\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't listen as you keep trying to persuade Sarah to give in as you grope and feel your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Martin, I didn't know you had a thing for older women.\" - Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do now baby, please?

Summer has only just begun which means you would be placing yourself as 'parents' for a few months, a precarious choice to make. They all stare at you, the beautiful maturity of Sarah providing quite the incentive but even the hopeful and overly eager attitudes of the new younger generation leave you pondering saying yes. \"Well... I guess it's summer so we're not exactly missing school or anything. So... s--sure...\" You say, your weakening arm falling to your neck providing a gentle rub. They erupt off of their feet, hugging each other with excitement while Sarah clings closely to you looking rather unsure about the whole thing. \"Are you sure about this, Martin? I mean... we'll be old for awhile.\" She asks as her hands wrap around your larger arm, pressing her even larger breasts against it. \"It's still summer vacation for us anyways.\" You tell her, enough of a fact to lower her worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best, pops!\" Jack exclaims, pressing Alisha's beautiful body right up against him. \"Seriously, you're totally awesome um... Daddy.\" Alisha adds, giggling with excitement. As you they kiss each other passionately you follow suit to kiss Sarah, pleased to finally have her maturity pressed against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe initial excitement fades a bit as you bring about the ideas for this to work. You discuss amongst each other ideas on how to explain all of your absences and as the meeting ends, everyone but Sarah is returned to their normal state to remove themselves from <i>'existence'</i> for the summer. Both Alisha and Jack abuse their built up vacation time while you tell a horribly inconsistent lie about how you're going on vacation with Sarah's family for the entire summer. It all works out alright though, putting you all back in the Johnson household in your altered states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's out of the way, babe. Let's go out and have some fun.\" Alisha says as she climbs a leg into Jack's arms, pressing her lips against his once more. \"No doubt, babe. Let's blow this place. We'll see you old folk later.\" Jack expels, hurrying out with his hand cupped between his former wife's. The whole scene leaves Sarah rubbing her temple and shaking her head with a sigh. \"Seeing them that way is so... bizarre.\" She divulges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it.\" You tell her as you step lightly behind her, bringing a hand up up and over her back. \"Now where were we?\" You whisper with a playful incentive. She turns her head to you with a look of disappointment. \"Is that all you think about?\" She says before turning about to meet you halfway, her hands cupping your butt with blinding speed. \"Of course, I can't say I'm not interested in this new you...\" She admits, the lust in her voice passing it's breath right against your ear. Her actions bring a flirtatious smile to your face as your hands slide underneath her shirt, cupping her breasts without the burden of cloth. \"Let's see how age has changed you, baby.\" You say as you both walk off towards <i>your</i> bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay her bare body down on the bed, glancing it over with excitement before readying yourself for the experience to come. \"God damn, baby. I think you look better than ever...\" You blurt out with amazement as your eyes wander up and down her body; her curves are all longer and more accentuated than before, her breasts are as large as ever and still noticeably youthful but it's the womanly appeal of her face that gives you the most excitement. \"I think I'm actually looking forward to us growing up.\" She whispers in astonishment as her she follows your eyes along with you but her interest fails to lock on herself and instead on the potent man you have become. \"N--nice...\" You hear her whisper even softer than before as she locks onto your fully erect penis, bringing her head back to await it's embrace. You grin as you press it into her, the moan she exhausts is not that of your girlfriend but that of your wife; of a full-fledged woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing...\" You both say between your recovering breaths...</span></div></div>",

Without a job or school to strict your schedule, being a 37 year old man during the summer is no different than being your normal age. The only exception to that is of course the two 'children' who rather enjoy calling you pops. You're not sure what they get up to most of the time as they usually leave the house the moment the sun rises, only returning in a laughter of enjoyment when the sun sets. You're happy to see Sarah's parents enjoying themselves so much and you do enjoy the time they leave Sarah and you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fun and freedom you all partake in only becomes troubled during the last month of summer when Alisha's and Jack's long since accumulated vacation time begins to end. The phone rings each day of the month, reminding you that only a couple weeks remain and that 'Jacks' paid vacation time ended after only the first month and that you have been providing no income for the second month. Ironically, the plague of money only seems to bring stress onto Sarah and yourself; the two children completely upbeat about the whole thing. Saying things such as... \"It's fine pops, you'll figure it out.\" or \"Stop worrying so much Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words only make your nerves excel at their act, quivering for the next couple weeks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon lights the kitchen well as Sarah scrubs away at the remaining dishes of a dinner built for two. You wrap her loosely in your arms, pecking at her heightening cheeks with a soft giggle. \"Stop~\" She whines playfully as a plate comes between her and your next kiss. \"Hey!\" You exclaim. The dish which covers her face jiggling slightly to her soft chuckle. You're about to continue your act in hopes of arousing her for later tonight but the front door flares open. Through it come the two eager children and their laughter, coming into the kitchen to greet you with their tongues in each others' mouths. \"Hey pops.\" Jack says after releasing Alisha from his unshaven face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passion you began to mount for Sarah fade as the reason to end all of this comes falling out of your mouth... \"I think the time to call me pops is over. You have to go back to work in two days. You too, Alisha.\" They're not pleased to hear it though, their gaze falling on each other with concern, perhaps afraid to lose their acquired youth. Their worries seems to dissipate after a short whisper in each others' ears. \"Tomorrow then.\" Jack says coolly. \"Let's go, babe.\" Alisha whines as she tugs on Jack's arm like a 4 year old child. \"Alright I guess...\" You concede as they walk passed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be weird being so young again.\" Sarah admits as she forces herself upon you. \"Yeah...\" You say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you awake with a long stretch, rolling yourself over next to Sarah who groans from her forced awakening. \"Come on, babe.\" You whisper softly, a sense of distortion falling into the room as you hear the words repeated in your head. You lean yourself over her blanket covered body, stealing a kiss from her but as your eyes settle in you jump back from the sight. You are about to scream until she does it for you... \"Daddy!?\" She screams, following up with.. \"What are you doing kissing me on the lips!?\" She asks as she rubs her lips with disgust. You are about to question what it is 'Alisha' means until you notice your own person, dark skin your first sign of change. It doesn't take you long to conclude that you're in Jack's body. \"It's me Martin, is that you Sarah? You look like your mom.\" You tell her, the information bringing a shiver to her body. \"Please tell me you're joking.\" She blurts out as she takes in her appearance, reaching a conclusion as she gazes into the small mirror on the desk across the room. \"What the hell!? W--why am I my own mom? And why the hell are you my damn father?\" Questions Sarah as she rubs her face with a further sullying expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something we need to ask your parents.\" You say as you climb to your feet and towards and out the door. In the hall you find a sleep deprived 'Sarah' scratching her head with a long yawn. \"What did you do to us?\" You ask, your loud base voice bringing her attention to full alert. \"Ah!\" She yells before looking, a guilty grin propelling her cheeks away. \"Oh, well we didn't want to return to normal just yet so we thought you guys wouldn't mind being the real us for awhile.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to ask us about stuff like this.\" Sarah blurts out from behind your broad shoulders. You express a sigh of disappointment before passing by the fake Sarah and into the room where your body lays sleeping. \"Get up.\" You tell him as you rip the blanket from his body. \"Hey-- not cool pops.\" He whines as he lifts himself up from the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit them both down at the dinner table, a sense of great distortion appearing in all the translucent reflections around the room. You can't define how odd it is seeing yourself and Sarah sitting across from you while here the real you and Sarah sit wearing the skin of her parents. \"What's the deal, Daddy? You were so cool before, like don't get all lame on us.\" Alisha says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being myself and older is one thing but I'm not having my mom run around with <i>my</i> body.\" Sarah states as the sound of her hands slamming to the table echoes throughout the house. \"B--besides... I'm not-- I can't exactly enjoy being with my boyfriend if he's my father.\" She further adds, your head continuing to bob along with her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey whisper amongst themselves but with their minds still immature by their previous change, you take a swipe for the remote that sits atop the table top but so does Alisha...</span></div></div>",

You scratch at your head but find only surprise as no hair is there to greet your nails. \"First things first... we need to give you two back your older personalities.\" You proclaim as you point the remote at their direction, a bit of an uprising occurring as they rise from their seats to protest. It doesn't last for long however as the reality of the situation comes flooding back to them. \"Oh my goodness, dear, we're in a bit of trouble aren't we?\" Alisha exclaims as her hands reach to the tips of her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... a month and a half without pay. We should have stopped when my paid vacation was over.\" Jack groans, rolling his head as the results of his actions kick in. \"Still, it was nice being young again.\" Alisha says with a smile, much to his agreement as he smiles back. You watch as they close to a kiss but Jack turns about before pressing lips with his daughter's body. You feel yourself blushing a bit as you notice Alisha's disappointed stare, realizing that perhaps she wanted to kiss you-- or your body at least. After Jack composes himself, he turns back to you with a modest smile. \"Thanks for time as kids, it was the best vacation I've had in a long time.\" He says, an approving nod from Alisha by his side. \"My pleasure, I enjoyed it too.\" You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I sort of want to continue experiencing some of the remotes powers. It was fun.\" Jack admits with a bashful chuckle. It seems to strike a tone in Alisha's head as well however, as she leans in to whisper into his ear. \"Seriously?\" He asks aloud to her whispered words. \"Yeah, it'll be fun and we can still do our jobs. Sort of... haha.\" Persuades Alisha with an arm pressing against her hesitant mate. He eventually agrees, turning back to yours and Sarah's curious stares which have gone on so long the room has become nothing but a blur. He places his hands on the table, cupped and ready to present his proposal... \"Well, we want to continue experiencing something new and we want you too as well so we thought why not switch with each other after returning to normal? In other words, you and I will be the ladies of the relationships-- bizarre as that sounds.\" He suggests, his tone seeming to break off towards dread as he announces the idea. You turn to Sarah, debating with each other without words. \"Come on, sweetie. Don't you think it would be fun to be a man; to be your cute boyfriend, Martin? Let him wear this skirt for awhile.\" Alisha teases as she tugs on the skirt she wears below the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma!\" Sarah calls out, her head shrinking into her shoulders with a coy groan of mumbled shame-- be it from her mother's enthusiasm about swapping sex or the fact she has her body, you can't be sure. \"It'll be a good experience for you two.\" Alisha states, further pressuring you both...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've already concluded in your mind that you wouldn't mind trying to be a girl, Sarah specifically. You sit there with your wrist spinning about the remote in all directions. Leaning against the side of the table, you watch Sarah's bizarre motions as she discusses the idea within her mind. You pass glances with the two across from you who are both equally amused by their daughter's cute inner debate. As you're about to reposition yourself for what appears to be a long wait, the remote is stripped from your grasp. Her eyes are wide from the sudden conclusion and with a shaking finger Sarah presses a button on the remote which lay pointing at her father who is currently in your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit more interested in what you may be going through in a bit, your eyes stay on Alisha's profile which is now wielded by Jack who promptly looks down at himself in utter astonishment. \"Holy... crap!\" He blurts out as he hands tenderly go to work on the ageless breasts hidden behind the silky nightgown he wears. \"How's it feel, sweetie?\" Alisha asks Sarah, a hand gripping her shoulder tightly. \"It's not... <i>as</i> different as I thought it would be but it's still... <i>very</i> very very very very weird.\" Sarah explains with increasing alarm as her voice's pitch raises to almost meet her former threshold, all the while, her hands patting against her flat chest and down the edges of her body. \"What about you, dear?\" Asks Alisha towards her husband who is now trailing down the lower edges of his new body. \"T--this is not what I'm used to...\" He mumbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, this seems so fun!\" Alisha squeals, her arms clenching together near her long eager smile with excitement. She then snags the remote from her daughter and points it in your direction. \"Ah! H--hold on a second. Let me prepare or something!\" You blurt out, trying to recall your brief time as Jenna in hopes to be less surprised. \"No way, this is too exciting. Hehe~\" Alisha states with a sliding grin as she presses the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour short time months ago as your sister Jenna did little to prepare you for the drastic change you feel as you find yourself seated at the opposite end of the table. \"D--damn!\" You exclaim as your eyes fall to the large breasts, cupped and held back by a tight tube top. The new feelings seep into you all at once, mounting your attention: The weight of your new breasts, the frizzy hair clinging to your cheeks and neck, the smell of her commonly used perfume now impossible to avoid and a lingering absence between your legs are all only the blunt of the sensations. You hesitate to grope your new body with her parents so close by but grab at your new breasts anyways, finding the firmness of them completely perfect, a bit of a sensitive tingle emanating throughout your body as you hold them, all while making your whole body feel lighter. Out of the corner of your eye you see the hinting of a grin, turning only to it and Sarah's giggling. \"It may be everything else as well but I feel a lot lighter without those.\" She remarks as she pokes at the side of your breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, now I can play with them whenever I want.\" You retort with a smug stare which struggles to remain as you hesitate over the girlish voice escaping your lips-- leaving you wondering if what you said even sounded like you wanted it. \"This is great, don't you think, sweetie?\" Alisha asks of Sarah as she rubs herself arm to arm, the large and toned muscles of her new body a topic of interest. \"I kinda like this.\" She comments with an appeased smile. Your eyes fall back onto Sarah who hesitates to give any response, fearing scrutiny most likely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long do you want to stay like this?\" Alisha asks, laying her arms onto the table to support her. Jack remains without words and merely tucks his hair behind his ears with a frustrated gaze, seemingly annoyed to have such long hair after being bald for so long. You can sympathize as Sarah's unwashed hair continues to fall into your eyes with even the slightest of movements. \"What are you talking about, momma?\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know with the remote we can stay like this however long we want but I think something like this would be more fun if like... we had to stay this for a certain amount of time. That way we really get the feeling like we're living someone elses life without a way out, get it?\" Alisha explains, the excitement in her voice continuing to deny what you thought was her limit. \"I guess I do.\" You say with a shrug as your hand pushes up your skirt beneath the table, rubbing only inches from your lost cargo. \"That sounds fun to me. How long do you think?\" Sarah asks as her hands copy your own, scrapping along the edges of her boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a month?\" Asks Alisha with a softening smile as her chin falls into her hands. \"I guess...\" Jack says, speaking up after his long pause. With both her parents in agreement you and Sarah merely shrug with nods ensued. \"Great. So we're not allowed to swap back for a month. This will be fun, I think.\" Explains Alisha once more as she rises from the chair, stumbling backwards a few steps. \"Woah!\" She cries out as she settles herself into a stand, her eyes blinking with confusion. Interested, Jack stands up to meet a similar action as he grasps at the table for support. \"That's gravity for ya.\" You comment as you stand to your feet, fumbling only briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should tell my parents that I've come home from my 'vacation.'\" You say suddenly as you walk over to the front door. \"Ah, right. They must be worried about you, huh?\" Jack concludes as he stands by your side, his stance broad and unnatural. \"I'll give you a ride then.\" He adds as he motions you out the door, seeming undeterred by the fact he is only in a nightgown. You only get to feel the warm breeze blow beneath your skirt once before you're pulled quite harshly back into the house. \"Where you going, silly?\" Asks Alisha with a lighthearted chuckle. \"She's you now.\" She informs you with a darting finger towards Sarah who wobbles towards you with a dumb smile. \"Oh, right. I have to go live at his house, don't I?\" She asks with a nod from her mother proceeding. \"Go get dressed then.\" Orders her mother, leaving you a bit gleeful, knowing you won't have to deal with your mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll see you later.\" Sarah says with a shrug as she walks beside Jack, who stands anxiously in the flattering sleeveless dress Alisha made him wear with an angry stare returning to her his feelings. \"Yeah, I guess so.\" You say over the snickering of Alisha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel awkward watching her drive off, leaving you alone with the overjoyed Alisha. \"You should probably take a shower, Sweetie.\" She comments the moment the front door claps shut. \"You're not seriously going to call me Sweetie are you?\" You ask her with a dubious frown as your head sinks into your shoulders from the idea. She chuckles and waggles a hand to her point... \"I called you Daddy when you were older than me and you're going to be my daughter for a month so I might as well. Feel free to call me Mo-- erm... I guess Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it...\" You grumble as you walk towards the bathroom to do as asked before stopping as the idea hits you. \"Shower!? You want me to shower?\" You blurt out as you turn to meet her teasing gaze. \"We're all going to have to do it eventually. You're so cute, honestly...\" She replies with a long laugh leaving a trail behind her as she walks off toward her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what part should be attracting your attention as you stare at the image of your girlfriend, naked and drenched from a long shower. Are you amazed to see your reflection as that of your girlfriend or are you just awed at how beautiful she is? Whatever it may be that attracts your mind, the results are the same as your hands ravage your doused body; not satisfied with only the shower time itself. \"God... being a girl feels weird.\" You say, shaking yourself away from your curiosity. You grab the nearest towel and go to work with your eyes shut up until you waddle your naked body back into Sarah's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're going through her dresser looking for clothing to wear, her mother pops in with a long winded hum. \"How's being a girl?\" She asks as she takes your place at the dresser. You cover yourself up with the blanket on the bed, not pleased to be seen naked by someone's parent, even as their daughter. \"It's... strange.\" You say, remaining vague as to not encourage anymore questions. You sit upon the bed and watch her pull things out of the dresser: a short pleated skirt, a scoopneck shirt and quite the extravagant bra and panties. \"Here you go.\" She says as she hands you the set of clothing. You have no reason to decline and put it all on to her looming stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't say you don't feel more like a woman as you sit at the desk in Sarah's room, gazing into her mirror trying to fix her hair all while one hand tugs on your short skirt. \"I can try and do it for you, Sweetie.\" Suggests Alisha as she brings her hands into yours and starts tossing and weaving your hair. \"I--I'll just have Sarah do it herself. I think I read something about how you can do that on the remote...\" You say, as you take a deep breath and struggle to relinquish control of your body. You're rather stunned as your hands raise without your will, going to work on your hair as if it they had done it a billion times before. Once your left eye loses half of it's vision from Sarah's beautiful part, you regain control of her body, posing yourself in amazement. \"Wow, that worked flawlessly.\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is amazing. That will come in handy when I try to do Jack's job.\" Alisha says...</span></div></div>",

You follow after her, simply unsure of what it is you should be doing. \"That dress looks good on you.\" Teases Alisha with a masked chuckle behind her raised hand. \"Be quiet...\" Sullies Jack as he lets out a long sigh just before wobbling his way passed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou again want to follow after them but they close their bedroom door for some privacy. You hesitate to think about what it is they plan to do in their, a feverish heat coming to your cheeks at the thought of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a long sigh as you walk around the house with an uncertain pace. You know it's too early to go hang out with Sarah again as she is probably stuck explaining things to your parents. So you continue to walk about the house looking for some way to kill time but only find yourself back into the bathroom looking at your new reflection. You're amazed at the curvature of your form, a fact which is even more potent as you turn your body to it's profile; the large breasts making your somewhat slim waist seem slimmer. \"Did I really sign up for a month like this?\" You ask yourself with a groan of disdain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste an hour watching T.V. and coyly teasing at your new sensations, the whole while, Sarah's parents remaining locked in their room without a spoken word traveling to your ears. A bit tired of waiting you ready yourself to leave, grabbing Sarah's purse and shouldering it with a bit of shame. \"I'm going out!\" You call out. \"Alright, sweetie! Just be sure to be back for dinner!\" Alisha shouts back sounding rather distraught and seemingly exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're quite happy to sit yourself in a car that you now technically own, a thin smile of satisfaction reflecting back at you in the rear-view mirror. You apply Sarah's knowledge of driving to your own and head to your home to a distressed Sarah who sprints out of the house the moment she hears the honking of the car horn. \"Ugh...\" She grumbles as her head plants against the seat of her former car. \"I take it my mother was a pain?\" You ask with a sheepish grin. \"Oh my god, it was awful!\" She begins, turning herself towards you... \"She just... ugh... 'Did you have fun?,' 'Where did you go?,' 'What did you do?,' 'Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?,' 'How come you didn't tell me?', 'Why did--- Uuugh, it was never ending. I've been answering her questions since the moment I got there.\" Releases Sarah with a burden relieved sigh expelling afterward. \"I'm glad I didn't have to deal with that. That sucks though.\" You say but it only leaves her glaring at you which strangely leaves you snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do anyways?\" You ask as your hand grips the steering wheel once again. Sarah thinks for a moment before deciding...</span></div></div>",

Let's do something fun.\" She describes, looking rather sluggish in her expressions despite claiming otherwise. \"Tennis?\" You blurt out as the bright sun hints at such an idea. \"Mmm... sure.\" Answers Sarah with a finger to her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out onto the tennis court with an eager smirk and a hand twirling the racket in hand. As the wind wraps around your legs, you realize you probably couldn't have picked out a better outfit for such an activity; you're even wearing Sarah's tennis shoes. \"Alright, let's do this!\" You yell as you toss the ball up for your serve. You're a bit shocked when you see your perfect serve sent bouncing back on your side of the court with no chance for return. \"N--nice!\" You compliment, a bit unnerved by how fast the ball went bouncing by you. \"Thanks!\" Sarah hollers back, sounding pleased as she twists and turns herself in a common stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end up being a bit overwhelmed the whole game and while it's not one-sided, you end up you losing rather convincingly. \"Phew... that was fun! I think that's only my second time beating you!\" Proclaims Sarah as she crosses to your side of the court. \"Yeah...\" You agree softly as your gaze falls a bit south, spotting a basketball court only a few steps away. \"Want to play some basketball then?\" You then ask, readying yourself for some redemption. \"I suck at it... but sure.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bout of redemption you hope for falls out of sight on your first attempt at a shot when Sarah jumps far above your height and steals the ball away. After the game you find yourself panting on your knees, your neck drenched in sweat, only heated by your long hair-- though your legs sting the skirt does leave them cool. You cannot believe how pathetic you feel as the game was by no means close and though you didn't even keep score, you'd say it was something like 80 to 12. \"Wow!\" Sarah exclaims as she rubs your back. \"You ok? Want a break?\" She asks, her face peaking into your vision as she leans over to meet your height. \"I'm fine!\" You spit back at her, your eyes stern with displeasure. \"Oh come on, babe. You're not really sore about this are you? It's basketball, it's a game of genetics; the taller person wins. Which is me at the moment.\" She notes but it does little to soothe the frustrated men inside your head, bickering and whining without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dabble into multiple other activities of a physical nature but fall short on every one as Sarah used to against you. The loud clack of a plastic hockey puck brings you into focus as you ready yourself. \"Alright, air hockey-- no physical prowess to be had. I can't lose this.\" You tell yourself but it falls short yet again as you lose even if only barely. \"W--what the fuck!? You've never even gotten close to beating me before!\" You shout with frustration. \"This makes no fucking sense. I'm better at this, basketball and even tennis then you just because I'm a damn girl doesn't mean I should be losing!\" You declare as the paddle within your hand feels the most of your grip. Meanwhile Sarah is left laughing, gathering pleasure from your misfortune it would seem. \"Sorry, sorry...\" She apologies with a shaking hand struggling to conceal her continual chuckles. \"Jenna's a girl and she's beaten me-- being a girl shouldn't make a damn difference.\" You reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, come on now. It's just a game besides... maybe being in your body is making me a bit better at this stuff anyways.\" She suggests but you shake your head, claiming otherwise... \"It shouldn't! I sure as hell don't know more about being a girl just by being you.\" You tell her, leaving her only shrugging. \"Well, I don't know then. Maybe I'm just on the ball today.\" She blurts out which leaves you dragging her back into your car. \"Alright then, let's swap back and do this again!\" You tell her as you grip her wrist as strongly as you can but it doesn't even seem to make her flinch. She lets out a long sigh as she lays her head onto her arm... \"Fine, whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou storm through the door of Sarah's home shouting \"Where's the remote!?\" which quickly gathers the attention of Alisha and Jack who group up around you. \"Why?\" She asks plainly. You are about to speak up about your frustration but Sarah takes your place as she steps next to you with her hand on her face looking rather annoyed with you. \"Oh, he's just upset because I beat him at a few things that I normally wouldn't of. Namely: Tennis, Basketball, Running, Hockey and <i>Air</i> Hockey.\" She explains, garnering a bit of a smug grin as she lists off the activities. It leaves Jack laughing aloud in his new feminine voice, patting your shoulder with a playful grin. \"I don't know about you but I wouldn't exactly expect to win against my wife now that she has my body-- look at her; she's huge. It's to be expected.\" He tells you but it doesn't make you feel that much better. Sure the size difference between Jack and Alisha is clear as day but you're not<i> that</i> much bigger and stronger than Sarah or at least you thought... until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still... where's the remote?\" You ask once again which prompts Alisha to retrieve it. You're not pleased when she comes back holding a strong box. \"I--Isn't that a bit much, momma?\" Sarah says, eyes a bit wide from the over protection. Alisha shakes her head and taps the box with her finger before replying... \"Now there's no temptation. We said one month didn't we? Besides, it's best to protect something as valuable as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to spend a month like this!\" You inform her, bringing about a cold stare from both Sarah and her mother. \"Is that all you boys think about? So you lost a few games, so what? Now you know how Sarah feels when you force her to play against you which is the whole point of this swap.\" She lectures as her finger circles around the keyhole of her box as if to mock you. You find your head drooping in shame from her words, a bit of truth to them. \"It still doesn't make sense that I'd lose just because I'm in her body.\" You mumble in continued infatuation of the subject. \"Maybe you played just as well but maybe Sarah played better or maybe you were never really better than Sarah at those things and having your strengths reversed merely made that obvious.\" Retorts Alisha with an increasing scold developing in her voice. \"And the air hockey?\" You ask dubiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad luck and frustration.\" She concludes, leaving you at a loss for how to respond while still quite infuriated by the whole ordeal. \"So she's better at sports than you now, big whoop. Once school starts next week you can focus on that.\" She further adds, a fact you just realized you'll have to deal with. \"Oh crap. We're going to school as each other aren't we?\" Sarah realizes, her stance widening to portray her concern. \"Something to think about...\" Alisha mentions before suggesting to drive Sarah home for the day as it is already quite late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nThe next morning....<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour annoyances from yesterday converse with each other in your mind as you awkwardly tug on your plain white T-shirt. You had hoped to dress a bit less feminine to perhaps regain some of your lost manhood but find the jeans in Sarah's closet only to heighten your femininity as there is definitely no bulge to show in the tight cloth. You're thoroughly irritated to see Sarah's reflection as your own-- the incident from yesterday sort of ruining the female experience for you. You know it's childish of you but you can't help but be annoyed by it...</span></div></div>",

You are ready to leave for his house but as you take a step outside into the glaring sun which drowns you in it's 95 degree gaze, you take a step back inside. The burden of the heat only leaves you recalling the sweet breeze wrapping around your legs yesterday as you walked around with a skirt for the first time. \"Screw it. I<i> am</i> a girl right now so whatever.\" You deem as you head back into your room to replace your jeans with a skirt and your T-shirt with a halter top. \"So I'm making Sarah look a bit slutty, whatever...\" You whisper as you tug on the skirt which just barely covers your butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at Marco's house in only a few minutes, the breeze you spoke of before wrapping around your legs as you knock on his door lightly. The door creaks open revealing Debbie; Marco's sister who is rather overweight with little redeeming factors. \"Heya, is Marco here?\" You ask. She nods and steps out of your way, allowing you entrance to her home. You feel as though you are being analyzed as you turn back to Debbie who is appears to be scoffing at your appearance. You merely assume that she is jealous of Sarah and walk on by her and towards Marco's room. Inside you find him with his head upside down as he leans off the side of his bed. \"Uh.. what's up?\" You say as you watch him slide himself off of his bed and onto the floor. \"Oh, hey Sar'. Back from your vacation? You know you guys left me to boredom by both leaving like that.\" He says as he swivels himself into an Indian sit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... sorry about that. It was a bit sudden.\" You scoff as you scratch the back of your head with a small chuckle. \"Where did you go anyway?\" He asks which only leaves you fumbling for an answer. \"Uh... y--you know... places...\" You mumble, a dumbfounded glance gleaming at you-- labeling you as an idiot. \"No... I don't. That's why I asked.\" The remark only leaves you laughing as you struggle to form a competent answer. Through the walls of his room you can hear the knocking of the front door but it only buys you a couple seconds of thought. \"Well?\" He asks again but before you can answer another knock is heard only this time on Marco's door.</span></div></div>",

You both glare at each other, apparently annoyed that you both had the same idea this morning. \"Hey, what's up man? Did you come with Sar' or somethin'?\" He asks a bit startled by the closeness of your visits. \"No, it's just coincidence I guess.\" Sarah concludes as she takes a seat on the floor beside Marco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird. Anyways, maybe you can answer me since your girlfriend refuses to. Where did you guys go on your vacation?\" He asks, this time towards Sarah who seems to have a better grip on the subject as she answered that question and more to your parents yesterday. She tells him of where you went and other similar questions, even making up stories of apparent memorable moments from the fictional vacation. You more or less remain silent unless prompted to add something to one of her fakes stories until the conversation veers away from the subject of vacations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you guys want to do?\" Marco asks as lets out a long yawn and leans back against his bed. You merely give a shrug as an answer while Sarah coaxes some frustration out of you with a testy grin as an aid. \"Maybe we could play <i>basketball</i> or <i>tennis</i>...\" She suggests with her eyes locked on you. \"Yeah, I guess.\" Marco says as he gazes at you as well, perhaps confused by the angry stare which focal point lines with Sarah's position. \"Sar.'\" He begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" You reply, your hatred removing itself in place of curiosity as you turn to Marco who seems to be looking at you-- though his eyes certainly don't seem to meet yours. \"You really should wear more clothes when you're with me. You're distracting me...\" He states with a small chuckle, which leaves you lifting up both your breasts and looking down at the tops of them which peak out of your tube top. \"Oh...\" You mumble before taking notice of Sarah's furious expression; her mouth felled from disgust from your bold cupping of her breasts. A bit allured by her displeasure of it you wonder if you should continue to embarrass her from a third person...</span></div></div>",

Both Marco and Sarah display a great deal of shock, cold in their stance as if they are made of marble; a statue you would definitely enjoy encasing in glass. \"W--what are you doing!?\" Sarah yells as she crawls along the ground to shield you from Marco's gaze. \"Hey! It's her body, let her do what she wants.\" Marco remarks as his head peaks around Sarah's self-designed wall. \"Yeah, Martin. It's my body.\" You restate for Sarah with a cocky grin as a hand of yours reaches to undo the bra strap which clamps to your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D--don't you dare!\" She whispers loudly, her face actually tinting a bit red. You know you shouldn't but your hand unlocks the bra from your body, a loose slumping of your shoulders sliding it off of your body. \"Woah!\" Marco exclaims as sees the bra straps drop from his shielded view. He jumps to his feet, cooing with delight as he sees your ample breasts out on display. Sarah turns to him, her lips quivering with shame to the point where you fear she may cry. \"Y--you're a real jerk!\" She cries out before running out of the room as is she is the one who is naked. \"What's up with him?\" Marco asks as he scurries next to you with his eyes still locked on your breasts. You feel legitimately bad but it is the payback you wanted to obtain which seems to loosen your guilt. \"I don't know what's gotten into you Sar' but... can I?\" He says with hands cupping the air in hopes for a grip at the real thing. \"Yeah, go nuts.\" You tell him, much to his delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't some big tease is it? There's not cameras here or something are there?\" He asks as he looks around the room with a large smile on his face. \"Ah, well, it wouldn't stop me anyways.\" He admits as his hands grab at your breasts, an unexpected moan coming from you as he toys with them. It seems to bring only more delight to him but it makes you a bit embarrassed--  you weren't expecting to get any pleasure out of this from a physical stand point. The sensation is strong enough to cease you from stopping his continual play of them. In-fact, after awhile you merely lay down to get comfortable as he does so. You're a bit confused on why women don't let men play with their breasts more often, it feels really good-- like a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there for awhile with your eyes closed, an increasing sense of guilt increasing with each bit of pleasure you obtain from it. You also find it quite awkward to be this close to Marco...</span></div></div>",

I was just a little out of my mind this morning.\" You tell him as you pick up the bra and top to put back on. \"Uh... sure. That's probably for the best. Nice rack by the way.\" He comments as he stumbles to feet, the bizarre predicament seeming to exhaust some of his energy. \"Thanks.\" You say as you cover yourself up with the appropriate attire. You know you're probably going to have to apologize to Sarah at some point today but foolishly decide to wait on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to go do something?\" You ask as you turn to meet him, no longer bare-chested. \"Uh... sure?\" He says with a shrug. You drag him along to the movies and also to lunch in what you realize may appear as dates-- especially after what you just let him do. You make a point to tell him that they aren't such an activity but you're not sure if he even believes you. It's not until you're back at Sarah's home at about 3 P.M. that you decide to call up Sarah to apologize. No amount of calling or ringing make her pick up however. \"Ugh... she's definitely upset in a big way.\" You realize with a long sigh as you shuffle through some of the mail you picked up on your way in. Inside you find the form for filling out your school schedule for this year, something you should have filled out a month ago. \"I guess I need to have Sarah fill this out. Mine's probably at my house too.\" You conclude just before the front door opens, revealing an exhausted Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" You greet but he only slithers himself into the chair at your side, running a hand through his long hair with a sigh. \"I just went through almost the whole day letting Alisha's body do everything for me because I sure as hell didn't know what I was doing.\" He moans out as he stretches his thin arms high into the air. \"Well, you agreed to it. I'm sure you'll be able to do her work yourself after awhile.\" You tell him as you sit next to him, having a hard time convincing yourself that you're even speaking with Jack and not Alisha. \"Yeah, I suppose. I suppose... this is all part of the choice we made.\" He concludes with another long sigh. You watch him eye himself over for a minute, twisting his arms and looking at his finely polished nails. \"I'm going to be completely honest. I don't like being a woman. I'm a guy an outdoor kinda guy: I fish, I golf, I go for runs, I enjoy hiking and camping and to be quite frank... Alisha's stamina is crap. So I guess what I'm trying to say is I sort of sympathize with what it is you were talking about yesterday.\" He rambles off, leaving you smiling in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we sort of got the short-end of the stick. I feel like I would have been better off being my sister, hell, she's in way better shape than anyone else I know.\" You blurt out, a bit of a disturbing insight for both yourself and Jack. \"Hey, at least Sarah is young and hanging around with you a lot, you put her to work. Alisha is an old-fashioned girl, she doesn't even like walking-- anymore anyways. When she was a kid she was quite energetic.\" He tells you, a fact you can only nod in agreement to as you did in-fact see how peppy she used to be. \"At least we're hot, I guess.\" You say with a quickening laughter to shuttle out the fact you just called his wife hot. \"I guess there's that...\" He agrees as he glides a hand down the edges of his body before rising to his feet. \"Still, being a woman just isn't for me.\" He concludes as he turns to walk himself out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" You say on a whim, pondering on whether or not you like or dislike being a girl. The annoyances from before certainly plague your decision but you can't say it's <i>that</i> bad. At the very least you went through today without even paying it that much mind, though Marco sort of did it for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple days go by where all calls to Sarah are either ignored or a picked up with a brief \"Jerk\" being exclaimed on the other end. Meanwhile the deadline for Sarah's class schedule is reaching it's limit. You know you have to fill it out but with Sarah out of contact you wonder if you should just be a jerk as she calls you and fill out her undetermined class slots with things <i>you</i> like or if you should go to her in person and apologize. </span></div></div>",

She has an average body, average height for a sixteen year old and didn't really have much to stand out with. She has long frizzy from the bottom dark-brown hair that lead down to her average B-cup breasts and wore glasses that made her look cute with them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the person who liked videogames and loved to draw. She has stacks of rubber cabinets full of drawings, books on anatomy and various drawing subjects. She also has posters of various RPG game heroes and movie posters on her wall rather than those crappy boy band posters. Megan was also a very shy kid who kept to herself. She tended to get embarrassed very easily and didn't like group activities, that made you feel bad for her and tried to help her on many occasions hooking up with some new friends, but it hasn't worked out that much before in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter her room and find her still asleep.in her small bed. You stand in front of her bed and aim the remote in her direction. You press the blue brainwash swap button and then black out. You suddenly wake up to find frizzy hair in your face and it seems you're lying on a bed which you are. You get up and take a look at your old body lying on the floor asleep blurry in the dim light. Megan is inside and she's programmed as you. You immediately jump out of bed not knowing you weight less and overcompensate and almost trip. You look around, but for some reason see everything blurry. You try to squint around and then find Megan's glasses next to her bed and you put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision comes back, in fact, alot better than what you normally see if not better. You run to the mirror and see Megan's cute reflection staring back at you smiling cutely wearing an extra large T-shirt and panties. You stop in your admiration and look at your unconscious body still asleep. You need to take your sister back to his room and act as if nothing happened. You sigh and grab Megan by his legs and drag him to your old room. Knowing from your siblings you tend to sleep like an ox and nothing hardly disturbs you, so hopefully Megan is just the same. You struggle trying to drag him to your old room hoping no one will see, but your arms are more weak and frail that it's tough dragging about 200 pounds of the old you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally get Megan in his room and get him to his bed. Unfortunately for you, now comes the hard part. You have to LIFT your brother back on the bed. Suddenly a thought comes up, why not switch with Megan again but this time lie on the bed and switch back. You realize you don't have the switcher with you, its back in your room. You tiptoe back to your sisters room, grab it and then tiptoe back to your old room still trying to be as quiet as possible. You return and open your closet and sit down on the floor. You aim the remote and then black out again. You wake up to find yourself in your old body again lying on the floor in front of your bed. Just as you get back up, your mother suddenly enters the room asking if you're alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin, are you okay?\" Your inquisitive mother asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah, uhh..... I'm Okay!\" You say with fright hoping your attentive mother doesn't find your sleeping sister in YOUR closet which would be one heck of a weird scene if you get busted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay then.\" She looks at you with a curious look and closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is still racing like mad after that little surprise. You climb onto your bed and pass out. You grab the device and hit the button to swap with your sister. You then black out again and wake up back in your closet. You wake up in Megan's petite body again still aching from dragging your heavy body to this room. You get up and quietly open the door and tiptoe back to Megan's room hoping your mother didn't hear you this time.You lock your door clad with drawings your sister did and just drop to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh, talk about a pain in the ass first day,\" you finally say in your new voice. You throw the device in a side drawer and knock out asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, you awake in Megan's bed after that little episode and get up. You look around and realize your new surroundings. Just then your door opens and its Megan whose brainwashed as you asking to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, can I ask you something?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggy, you find your glasses and put them on and say sure. Your old body enters the room as you get up yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why am I, Megan, in my brothers body, and who are you? Are you Martin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there in fear and realized that you must have pushed the wrong button on the swap device and did a normal switch with the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....... yeah I found a body swap device last night sis and wanted to try it out....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the look on his face you can tell he's pretty: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Came from that new museum they opened up. This thing actually freaking works Meg! This thing must be some kind of big discovery for them to create.

Count me in then.\" Megan agrees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we try and live each other's lives for a few days and see how this goes.\" You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I mean, living your life will be a bit too much. I'm not a sports fan, and I'm shy around people so I don't know much about your friends. Plus if you live life as me, you're only going to be asking for trouble. I still have a bad reputation at school and get picked on. It's terrible.\" Megan says in a low voice. Even though your vacation began, Megan still has a few days of school left until summer vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tap into my mind and immediately learn all this stuff about me. I'm off now so you can just relax here at home. You don't deserve that kind of shit at school, so why not let me take your place and see what its like for you.\" You offer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I could use an early break then. Thanks for doing this.\" Megan says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem sis.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the device and aim it towards each other and hit the red normal swap button and you change:</span></div></div>",

Getting up, you open your eyes to see your sister's room. This was the second time you had awakened here, so you were starting to get used to it. You flip on the light and see Megan's face in the mirror. Her frizzy hair was in a tangled mess, making the body look absurd. Her dull blue eyes look back at you from within her average looking, pale face. Her average B-cup breasts poke out underneath the long tee-shirt you are wearing. You look down to see her somewhat shapless legs.<br>\r\n  Sighing a bit from your grogginess, you make you way over to the bathroom to take a shower. Walking in, you take off your long T-shirt to see your sister's body topless. It's not really too much of a sight to behold. Her breasts look a little bland, and her panties are covered in the Final Fantasy logo. You take off the panties to see your sister's tangled brown pubic hair, and a pancake butt. You take the shower, then hop out, put a towel on, and make your way back to your room. With a bit of trouble, you get Megan's bra on, and then proceed to put on panties. Once your done with that, you put on a Nirvana T-shirt (Onme that's actually your's), and you place on Megan's jeans.<br>\r\n   Your younger sister never wore much make-up, and you didn't know how to put it on, so you leave it on that and continue out the door. You grab your bookbag and go downstairs to see your own body standing in the kitchen, \"Well Martin, are you sure your redy to do this?\"<br>\r\n  \"Yeah, Megan, I'm ready\", you reply in your sister's voice. The two of you walk outside, Megan hoping into the driver's seat of your car. Megan had never gotten her liscence, so you were forced to take the passenger's seat. After a dangerous ride to school, and almost dying from Megan's horrendous driving, you make it to the parking lot.<br>\r\n  \"I'll be back to pick you up, 'Meg' .\", Megan says to you as you get out.<br>\r\n  \"Just don't screw up the car\", you reply, getting out and moving towards the school. Once you get in, you go to Megan's locker, and et her stuff. You recognize many of the people in the hallways as underclassmen who you know quite a bit about. Megan had told you quite a bit about her problems, so you knew what needed to be adjusted. <br>\r\n  Suddenly, as you close Megan's locked, you look to see.....</span></div></div>",

You knew a lot more about Amanda than she thought. Especially some of her most guarded secrets, \"Hey MANdy, never thought I'd see a skank like you roaming around here. Especially one that's done Ed Dinkleberry\". All of her friends stop laughing in a complete silence, and Amanda's face just goes cold. Ed Dinkleberry was one of the nerdiest kids in Megan's grade, and Amanda had allowed him to screw her in a moment of absolute horniness.<br>\r\n  \"Yeah, I especially liked the part about the two of you roleplaying as a knight and princess in bed\", you continue, enjoying every minute of this, \"If you would please excuse me, I believe I'm late for class\", with that, you stride off, leaving Amanda's friends to laugh at their slutty friend.

I don't know what you were thinking trying to borrow my life, but I'll let you off the hook and take a risk. I do have a game tomorrow night in another school a few miles off though so I need to be back in my own body by 11:00am for the bus ride. \" - Aisha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

I'll have to tell you everything about myself so you'll know whats up about me.\" - Aisha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need.

Soon her pants came off for a pair of gym shorts as well, making him ready for practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Just let Aisha's mind take over,'</i> he told himself as he and the other girls walked out on court.

Aisha was impressively athletic - her body was almost like a machine! Martin was almost a bit jealous, he'd have to consider asking Aisha to switch again some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good practice girls,\" the coach announced, \"I think I'll let you all off early today, since the game's tomorrow. Rest up early for now, and be ready to play even harder during the game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Martin took back control of Aisha, glad to be able to have some fun for himself. Going back into the locker room, he was excited at the prospect of 'hitting the showers' as he envisioned earlier. He was disappointed, however, to find the girls just grabbing their gym bags and leaving. \"See you around, Aisha!\" said the same girl from before. Martin had seen her around every once and a while, she was a blonde, white girl around 5'11, decently in shape but a bit more spindly than Aisha. He couldn't really remember her name though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, you too!\" Martin waved back as the last girl cleared from the locker room. It seemed they all just planned to shower at home, which Martin supposed was logical. He pulled up Aisha's arm and took a brief sniff, confirming that he ought to do the same. \"Well that was disappointing,\" he said to no one in particular, \"but I suppose I still have this body to myself as a consolation prize.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he went to Aisha's home to have fun with her body, though, Martin realized he forgot to close her locker when he was changing earlier. \"Probably nothing,\" he said as he walked over to it with her gym-bag in hand to collect her clothes and the remote. He buried the device underneath the outfit Aisha was wearing before practice started to keep it hidden. He lifted her shirt and shorts to find...</span></div></div>",

Gaming, anime, manga, and RP'er's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit different from what you (Martin) usually like sports, playing pool, and being a little wild and reckless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor is 16, Mexican, a bit skinny and tall, and is an artist just like Meg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet is 16 too, Asian, a little on the chubby side, and obsessed with RP'ing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them are on equal footing with you (The real you).even if you don't share the same hobbies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you meet and begin chatting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Meg, you so looking forward to the long summer break?\" Janet asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already enjoying it. Hahaha. \" You say, which is actually true. Meg is kicking back at your house in your body. Probably sleeping at this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really like these days since we've done our last tests, we just need to show up for attendance and can leave if we want.\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really? We don't need to suffer in class after all?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thats a freaking relief. I thought I was going to bored out of my skull listening to this 10th grade crap I already know about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends just stare at you weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, yeah I know what you mean. Just two more years to go.\"  Janet says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you walk nonchalantly towards the gym when some of the \"popular\" kids walkby you and Amanda (one of them) trips you. If this situation was different and this was Megan, she'd fall on her face and get a laugh, but since you're in control, she trips your legs, you regain your composure and pull off a flip just like a gymnist would and safely land on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time honey.\" You smugly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got lucky nerd. We swat nerds like you like flies. Better watch yourself.\" Amanda says, her lackeys following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose 'we'? Oh you mean this group of so called \"Popular\" people? Thinking that you're all superior to everyone else and picking on those people just for laughs is rather primitive and shallow don't you think? Oh my mistake, I guess you and your friends haven't evolved yet or else you'd see through your bitchiness and hurting other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your popularity going to be when you're working a 9 hour job just trying to survive once you graduate or drop out, maybe the latter? You may be on Cloud Nine now and pick on us \"nerds\", but realize that the big picture for you isn't going to be pretty when you're 29, living in a shitty apartment and your   figure begins to sag and we'll be raking in the money with fun jobs cause we took the time to take our schooling seriously.\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got nothing to say to lowlifes with no futures, come on guys lets jet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you walk off while the bullies are just stunned at your hard hitting speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing Meg. Plus it was true too. Hahaha. Wish I had your courage.\" Trevor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I had it in me for so long, I just had to release it to those losers.\" You say proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't really seem like you though, but bravo.\" Janet says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you should say that. Hehehehehe.\" You begin......</span></div></div>",

Jenna ruffled her frizzy hair in discontentment and took off her glasses. However, immediately her eyesight blurs and she put the glasses back on. Jenna then smiled to the mirror,  her reflection however was of an evil looking Megan. \"No matter, I have this baby\" and she twirled the remote in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna then spent some minutes to memorize the notepad, and tried on several buttons until she got accustomed to the remote. She clicked the yellow button and phased herself inside her room to see her former body doing some workout. \"Gotta be honest, I look pretty,\" she smirked as she saw her old body lifting some weights. She then materializes on top of her bed, effectively surprised the new Jenna and gave her a fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing in my room?!\" the new Jenna yelled bewildered. The real Jenna however, just gave a wicked grin as she positioned her glasses. \"I'm you, girlfriend.\" Megan stated calmly. The new Jenna just gaped in shock. Real Jenna then told the Martin in her body all her secrets, and the remote thing, although altered the story on how she found it. \"Sweet, let's tease our little Megan eh Megan? I mean, the me in Megan.\" the new Jenna grinned after she 'knew' the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan in Martin's body sat anxiously anxiously in her new bed, when suddenly Jenna's body rushed inside. \"Megan, I- I remembered!\" Jenna stammered.

Jenna closed the door behind her. \"Here, dear brother, I mean, me!\" suddenly the body of Megan materializes near Jenna.

Should we tell her that I'm really Megan and you are really Martin?\"  Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I trust her, besides it'd be weird knowing that Jenna did something with her while she is me.\" Martin said with a slight chuckle, as they both head towards the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" Martin asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I want to go and get some more anime/manga/clothes &amp; stuff with Jenna's cash.  What about you?\" Megan replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I guess I'm following you with this for now.  Then we can get back to torturing Jenna somehow.  Although if I am going to be you, I should probably look into drawing and getting some of those games you like.\" Martin said<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well I can certainly teach you how to draw when we get home, but first let's go and find some cool clothes and stuff.\" Megan replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember we are not in the car anymore, so I am Megan and you are Jenna again.\" Martin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so where to first sis?\" 'Megan' asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's go to Hot Topic and see what they have, Megs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jenna\" replied 'Megan'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 'Jenna' and 'Megan'venture into the store, they start heading towards the clothing section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. They have some Dragonball Z stuff.\" 'Jenna' said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea but too bad they aren't in your size.\" 'Megan' told 'Jenna'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure they are, I'm getting them for you.  From one sister to another.\" 'Jenna' replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I get it, you are pretty clever.  Now I know I don't want to get on your bad side.\" 'Megan' said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So We got some clothes, Now what?\" 'Megan' asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we go and get some manga.\" 'Jenna' replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. At least I won't have to read anything too girly now will I?\" Martin asked, teasing Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, i'm not into anything that bad.  Here, Final Fantasy Manga and look more Dragonball Z stuff.\" Megan told Matin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going and picking up more manga, Megan and Martin head to the cash register to pay for their things. After paying for their new stuff, Megan spots one of Martin's friends outside passing by. On their way out they find out that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have to hitch a ride in your car though, My mom dropped me off here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we walked out to Jenna's car and I talked to Sarah about the stuff 'Jenna' and I bought,<br>\r\nand where we would go for lunch. We eventually decided to go and settle on McDonalds to celebrate<br>\r\nthe summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving away from the lot, Sarah and I sat in the back, while 'Jenna' drove the car again.<br>\r\nI began to take out the remote to explain to Sarah what was going on. The strange remote,all its functions, and the fight with Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, you are telling me that you are really Martin and 'Jenna' over there, is Megan driving.\" Sarah questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, hard to believe isn't it. Remember those weird trucks, well after you went towards your house, I saw another one of those trucks and found this device in it from a crate they dropped.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I am truly to believe that you are Martin let's give it another test run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine this will really blow your mind though, so just stay calm.\" I said, pointing the remote towards me and pressing the red button.\"Here, I will just put these on your lap here.\" You said, taking off Megan's glasses.<br>\r\n\"Now just take the remote,aim it towards yourself and whenever you are ready press the red button.\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I saw Sarah pushed the button the change was definately noticeable.  I was able to see clearly again and definately felt better<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was definately an odd feeling. Why is everything so blurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here these will help you out.\" I said, picking up Megan's glasses again and handing it to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks......Whoa, there is something you don't see everyday. Me talking to myself. Wait, that voice... then that means I really am Megan now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.... about that, Red button is normal body swap. I think I can even act like you if I wanted to fool someone. Come on though let's switch back, besides I want you to help me with something.\" I told Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright this is getting pretty creepy for me too seeing my own body telling me to do things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, it has been a long day for me too.\" I said, reversing the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So listen Sarah, I wanted you to know that Megs &amp; I came to the mall because Jenna suprised us at home and she was going to go mad with power, so we made her believe she is me.\" You told her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i'll be dating your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, I was hoping you wouldn't do anything serious while we punish Jenna for a while. Maybe you'd want to help us punish her since she had me thinking I was her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah suddenly burst out laughing.  \"You mean to tell me she had you thinking like you were her and you were a fitness obsessed girl who only cares about her figure?\" Sarah started laughing again.<br>\r\nSarah did enjoy a good practical joke every once in a while, and I liked her for that. This remote was supposed to be my practical joke device though and Jenna wasn't going to ruin my fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright it isn't that funny, besides you have it worse knowing its really Jenna that is me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I appreciate you telling me that, but now i kinda want to play with that remote some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to yourself you sound like Marco, if I told him about this first he would have already screwed up the whole world by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you are right, but I want to know what all these other buttons do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll show you one more button. But I haven't really got a chance to test it so you might want to relax and talk to Megs for a while.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well I'm glad you are okay Meg.  Jenna's probrably jealous of you. You are great at video games, drawing, and tons of other things i'm sure she wished she could do. You get along well with Martin too, which is more than what can be said for Martin and Jenna.\" I said trying to cheer up Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I felt a chill down my spine for a brief moment, and then asked Megan if we can go inside McDonalds and eat. I couldn't wait to have a Filet-o-Fish and a drink to celebrate the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Martin?\" Megan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get him something for when he comes back. Here I'll take care of lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting on line was the hard part, but a couple minutes of waiting and we finally placed our order. Another couple minutes and the food was ready.  Taking the food out and back to the car, Megan went into the back seat with me and we started to get out the fish. First I really wanted to eat some of the chicken nuggets I had gotten Martin so I took those out of the bag and started to eat some of them as well. No sooner than a couple of bites did I regret that as i spat some back out into a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Now I remember why I hated these.\" I said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hated these why did you take some in the first place?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I felt like I had an uncontrollable urge to eat them so I did.\"I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the filet-o-fish's, I had needed a napkin so i reached inside the bag again and got one. Then I changed my mind, and I put the napkin back in the bag and started to use my finger and pick my nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Megan asked surprised at Sarah's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Can't a girl pick her nose in peace anymore?\"  I snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I felt that weird chill again and outside the car, I saw Martin holding the remote again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah, picking a winner?\" Martin said laughing, Megan and I immediately looked towards Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did that didn't you. You were that weird chill i felt... You made me eat those nuggets didn't you? and just now you made me do this!\" I said, trying to open the car door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I admit that was me, and not one of my brightest ideas either, I felt the same way you did when I made you eat that.  I was surprised that happened cause I really love them. And the nose thing was just a gag.\" Martin said starting to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok funny guy but tell me this, if you were in control of me when we got out of the car, why not just forget the fish for me and buy three hamburgers or do something more humiliating.\" Angered, I responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like I said I didnt test this button yet, and if you think I really wanted to humiliate one of my friends you are mistaken. Only me, megs and you know what just happened.\" Martin told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let's go to my house and you can fill me in on the rest of these buttons.\" I suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright first we have to go get my notepad back from the house.

You're body is alright, but certainly not one that I can see myself living in long term. It's too average and has too much of a nerdy look. Jessica's new look is very nice, but she's still a nine year old at heart so it's weird. I want a nice, sexy new body to take over and live in since my old life has been getting boring. So here's the plan. I want you to use Martin's body and get his girlfriend over here. You're going to put on a little performance as Martin and break things off with her. Make her cry and feel terrible about herself. Do whatever you have to. Then, when she's ready to give up on it all, I'm going to use this baby to swap the two of you. I'll program her into thinking she's Martin and then I'll switch with you, giving back your body. After that, I'll make Jess here normal again and leave the house in Sarah's sexy black skin. Everything will be all cleaned up. Well, Megan, what do you say? Do we have a deal?\" Jenna asked, the evil smile on Megan's face now echoed on the faces of the older Jessica and Jenna's old body.

She would always be little more than a scared, nerdy girl even in Martin's body. She wanted to just go back into her rightful body, lock herself in her room, crawl into a ball and cry for hours on end, but she knew that saying yes to this proposal was the wrong thing to do. Sarah was innocent and had nothing to do with all of this. Bringing her into this was wrong and would only cause Jenna to get more power hungry. Not only that, but Sarah was Martin's girlfriend and Megan knew how much her brother cared for her. It was true that Martin now believed himself to be Jenna, and would likely stay that way unless Megan could get her-well, Martin's- hands back on that remote, but she knew that Martin would never want something like this to happen to Sarah. While she was in control of Martin's body, she would certainly do what she would want and keep Sarah safe. That way, maybe she could keep her brother alive in some way. Balling Martin's hands into fists, Megan finally showed confidence inside of her hopefully temporary body. She looked right into her former eyes and spit on her old glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that I'm going to bring Sarah into all this chaos, you have another thing coming Jenna! You want to take over this family, fine, do it, but don't you dare bring Sarah into this! There's no way in hell I'm going to let a bitch like you take over her life!\" he yelled. Jenna had taken off Megan's glasses and was carefully wiping the spit off of them before she placed them back over her eyes and looked back at the new Martin. She had a strange looking smile on her face. She pointed the remote at Jessica's grown up body and used it to change Jess back to her normal age, though Megan could tell by the look of disappointment on her face that the little girl was still programmed as Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" The evil Megan said, crossing her arms over her chest. \"I'm impressed. I didn't think you had that in you, Meg\" she says, having a thoughtful look on her face. She turns to the other two Jenna's, the brainwashed Martin in her true body and the programmed Jessica. \"You two can leave the room. Go do whatever it is that you'd be doing now. I'll finish this up in here and let you know what happens\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Martin and current Jenna sneers at the current Martin as she practically drags Jessica out of the room. As the door closes behind them, Megan looks at Jenna in utter confusion. \"Wh...what are you going to do now, Jenna?\" she asks, truly not knowing what her evil sister could have in mind for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as much as I respect your newly acquired guts, there's no way that I'm going to let you get in the way of me taking over a sexy new body like Sarah's. Believe me, I feel like I can finally call you a sister after seeing you fight back like that, but now that I have this power under my control, I sure as hell won't let that get in my way. I want to see the world and have thing always go my way. I want to have influence over as many people as I can, so I can't keep myself restrained here. The only real question now is what to do with you before I start that plan...\" she says, pointing the remote at Martin's body. \"I'll ask you one more time. Are you sure you won't cooperate with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan uses Martin's body to nod. \"Yes, I am\" she says, gulping with a little fright, but nothing close to how she felt before. She finally possessed some kind of confidence in herself and knew that if she ceased to exist, it would be while she refused to help Janna get her way. Megan hears her former body sigh as Jenna presses a button on the remote. </span></div></div>",

Megan looked disoriented again before glaring at her apparent brother, who now had Jenna's cold look in his eyes. He looked down and briefly felt his crotch area, grimacing. \"Ewww, being a boy sure is gross. I really hope I don't have to use this body any more than I have to...\" he said to himself before looking at his younger sister. \"How, exactly, did you deal with this so well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, once her disorientation ended, just glared at Jenna/Martin, still having her new confidence. \"Shut up, Jenna. You know I still won't let you do this\" she said, quite bravely, all things considered. The new Martin just grinned at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know you don't WANT me to do this, sis. But let's be honest here, what can you really do to stop me? All I need to do...\" As he speaks, he takes out the cell phone from his pocket, \"is give 'my dear girlfriend' a call to ask to see me. Once that happens, well, there wont exactly be anyone to stop me from taking over sexy Sarah's life, is there?\" strangely enough, Janna could feel her new male part hardening up at the thought of Sarah within his body. She made a creeped out face before looking at Megan for her response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan kept the anger up. \"I can stop you, Jenna! I said it before, and I'll say it again...there's no way that I'll just let you get away with this!\" she yells. Jenna just sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe you need a lesson in authority, sis\" Jenna says in Martin's voice, pointing the remote at Megan and pressing the programming button. A brief second passes before anything else is said. Megan seems to still be standing with confidence, looking at Jenna. \"Well, Megan? Do you still think that I shouldn't be doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan shakes her head. \"Of course not, Jenna! As your loving sister, it's my job to make sure you're happy! If taking over that tramp who's dating Martin will do that, then it's my obligation to help you. How can I be of assistance?\" she asks, smiling at Jenna, greatly in awe of her older sister's superior vision. How could Megan ever have been against Jenna? How could she be selfish enough to want to ruin her sister's happiness for that annoying Martin? Megan had no idea what had come over her to ever wanting to side with him over Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current Martin just smiles at Megan. \"Well, you can go to the other two mes and let them know what the plan is. Help them with whatever they need and I'll go get you all when I've finish my work with Sarah, okay?\" Martin/Jenna had used the remote to remove any and all hatred that Megan had ever had for her. Instead she replaced it with a sense of idolization. Jenna had always been Megan's hero and Megan would do anything to help Jenna be happy. After all, Martin and her had never been as close as she was with Jenna and never would be. Especially while that slut Sarah was ruling his life. Jenna taking over her life would be the best thing to ever happen for both Martin and that bitch who he was always out seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Jenna! I'll go right to them! I can't believe there are three of you now, it's so awesome!\" she says, practically skipping out of the room happily. Once she leaves, Martin reaches into his pocket and dials Sarah's phone number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, it's Martin. Can you come over? I have the coolest thing ever to show you!\" </span></div></div>",

Sarah had been very curious what Martin wanted to show her, but Jenna insisted on her coming over before he gave her any clues. With Sarah now on her way, that would give Jenna about ten minutes to clean things up here. Having so many of her around was definitely fun, but it would only cause confusion in the future. \"Hey! Everyone get down here!\" she yelled in Martin's voice, loud enough to be heard by the entire house. Within seconds, her two 'clones' and a very eager-to-serve Megan were standing in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I help you with now sis?\" Megan asked happily, unable to help herself from wanting to aid her genius older sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna smiled and continued in Martin's voice, \"I'm going to be leaving here and moving on to a new life to ease my boredom. So it's best if all of you just go back to your normal lives\" she said before quickly hitting each girl with the programming button. Once hit, they immediately stood at attention, as if they were robots or statues. Jenna then pointed the remote at the aged Jessica. Her body and clothing began shifting around, until she became her regular nine year old self again. Jenna then programmed her back into her real personality. Jenna then shot her own body with the programming button and watched as she too passed out. When Jenna's body wakes up, the original Martin will still believe himself to be Jenna, but will have no memories at all of the remote and it's powers. Jenna then zapped Megan with the programming button, reverting her personality to normal, but wiping all memories of the remotes. Megan then passed out along with the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Jenna smiled as she used Martin's body to bring all of the girl's into their respective rooms. When they wake up, they'll each just assume that they dozed off for a bit. None would suspect what really happened. Once everything was set up, Jenna sat on the living room couch and smiled as she flipped through the television stations. Everything was now cleaned up. Sarah would arrive in just a few moments and Jenna would brainwash swap into that sexy body of hers. Jenna's family would continue their lives absolutely normally while Jenna took over Sarah's life and had her fun. And once she gets bored with Sarah, Jenna would just keep moving on. If Jenna played things right, she could probably life forever! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jenna began fantasizing about her immortal life, the doorbell rang. 'Martin' grinned and licked his lips. He turned off the TV and opened the door to reveal. </span></div></div>",

This had all started out so nice, just a little game between her and Martin!  Sure, this entire experience sailed right past her comfort zone and into pure insanity, but before the offer had just been too outlandish to refuse.  But now?  Now she had one shot; her sister seemed to be out of control and Martin was, what?  Dead?  Worse?  And all that was left of him was his body and a few memories.  No, this was too much to handle, she needed more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she attempted to finger the device and look it over while she subtly put her finger on the Soul Swap button and held it.  Of course, Megan wasn't really accustomed to subterfuge and she didn't hide her little trick well.  Jenna (or... thing inhabiting Jenna's body) was the first to speak up.  \"Megan... what are you doing?  Which button is that...\"  Then Megan's body quickly piped up, exclaiming \"It's the Soul Swap button, stop her before it goes off!\"  In something straight from a sci-fi novel, Megan's own body was now lunging at her with a fury in its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinched for the inevitable collision, but it never came.  Timidly opening one eye, she saw her own furious face still directly in front of her.  Megan tensed up again, but then realized that she was having an awfully long time to anticipate this supposed attack.  She slowly opened her eyes fully and noticed a patently impossible sight: her body floating, mid lunge.  Megan emerged from her defensive posture and simply marveled at the power of this device that had entered her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device... what <i>was</i> it, really?  A device that could seamlessly transfer consciousnesses between bodies, make duplicates of minds, override free will, and now... stop <i>time</i>?  This device could underhandedly win <b>wars</b> by controlling leaders, there was no limit to its power.  But such a thing... why would it simply be transported on a truck?  This thing was most likely valuable enough to warrant an entire army escort, so why was it carelessly let slip away?  Megan mused that there was more to this story than what Martin had ignorantly guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before she could get lost in any conspiracy theories there was the ever so small matter that she had stopped time.  The Soul Swap button... the notepad had said hold it for ten seconds, then time would stop and you could switch people's souls.  Megan didn't doubt that the device had that power after all she had seen it do, but curiosity was beginning to get the better of her.  Perhaps just a small bit of testing was in order...</span></div></div>",

I'm frightened of Jenna and want this mess to STOP!!\" - Meg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, sorry. We should have done this together then.\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, she told us everything about Jenna and so I'll explain everything about the device. The remote is powered by a dulithnode crystal. This crystal is what causes the changes. It allows the person to alter another's mind, body and soul to anyway they see fit. And as such the remote was created around it for testing out all the features. It was on its way to one of our labs in Europe where it was to be destroyed, but you gotten your hands on it first and the rest is history.\" - Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destroyed?\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, after our tests were done, we concluded that its far too dangerous to exist. I mean that kind of power is too dangerous for anyone to have. to bend and shape another willpower and brainwash them. Since your sister has the Dulithnode, you'll have to get it back and there IS a way.\" - Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is?\" - Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll explain. For your first switch, the dulithnode implanted a small ion within your body which changed your body composition to that of the dulithnode crystal, but only 1% so you're still human. But because you have this ion you can now attract the crystal and summon it to your hands easily, but that still won't fix things.\" - Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrate and a split second later, the remote manifests itself into your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive.\" - Aida says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, this nightmare is over!\" - you say as you hit the RESET button. nothing happens<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it we're only that easy. Listen, since Jenna read the notepad, she knows all about the Ion conversion am I right?\" - Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ion what now?\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" - Aida in disgust<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Ion Conversion allows the owner to convert their whole body to become a dulithnode crystal itself without the use of the remote device. Your sister now has the powers and features of the device without it, so she can still move about and is unaffected by this ones RESET option. The only way to fix this is to possess Jenna and cause her to RESET her whole body, this will remove the ion within her and she'll no longer have power, nor the memory of the events that took place, but finding her and confronting her will be difficult.\" - Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we go and find her. We have the device here now so we should be okay.\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be a better idea if the two of you find her while both of you have the dulithnode powers and for that, you both must convert your bodies the same way Jenna has.\"- Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin. I can't do it....... I'm..... terrified of her..... you saw how psycho she was. What she did to Sarah. I'm afraid of going outside and finding her waiting for us!\" - Megan begins to sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about we sleep it off and think this over tomorrow. It is getting late. We'll need to lay low though.\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin, if you'd like I'll show you how to convert your body for Ion conversion.\" - Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I want to have full control of these powers without a device. Meg, if you don't want to do this, then I'll take her down instead.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin, this way, I'll lead you to my office and take out the spare notes I have on the dulithnode.\" - Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two leave leaving Megan alone in the room looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's out there, doing who knows. Waiting for us. I'm so...... I want this to end already</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Aida returns with Martin who is stumbling walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin?!\" - Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm..... alright.... god, that took a while out of me. \" - Martin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His body is now 27% dulithnode. He has all of the devices functions among him, but he'll need to rest.\" - Aida<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but where ARE we going to stay and hide at?\" - Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah about that, uh Meg, there's only one safe way we can hide out.\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, a car emerges out into the front lawn of a house. Out steps Aida and Aaron who is also her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home Sweet Home\" - Aida says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say, why did you go and give me THIS guys body for Martin!!! You must really like this deep down don't you!!!\" - Aaron's body says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no, Dr. Franklyn felt that it was necessary that I..... bah I got nothing. Let's just go inside already.\" - Aida's body says</span></div></div>",

Uh it worked...... Ha ha ha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan as you puts on hand on your shoulder:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so wicked cool bro! where did you find this thing?\" Megan asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not mad? I mean I practically took your life and gave you mine in return, come on, get pissed or something!\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead Megan just rolls up your shirt and checks out her or your old biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I actually like the weird and unusual. I read alot of books like this, well not LIKE this but you get the idea. I find this whole thing pretty interesting.\" Megan says with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing, Megan wasn't mad at all at you. You pretty much made the right choice on who to trust with this secret. You and her were on good terms so this secret would be a good one to share between siblings/friends, plus its fun to have an accomplice getting away with being other people. Megan never talked with anybody or had any good friends except you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would rather be someone else other than you bro, no offense, but can I be someone else?\" Megan says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, who do you want to be?\" You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I always wanted to run the house my way, and mom is a complete nightmare, so I could spice up this family a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, someone needs to give that woman a reality check.\" You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's Jenna, she pisses me off so much. It would be fun ruining her life. She has everything, tall figure, great health, a good body, no asthma.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aim the device and switch back with Megan with the normal swap option so she remembers all this. Megan looks down to find herself back in her body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, what else is on there?\" Megan says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it has a brainwash swap, the blue button, a regular swap option, the red button, the reset that resets everyone back to normal, theres a yellow ghost mode button that turns you as a ghost and you can possess anyone you want and become them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Thats cool! I know who I want to possess.\" She suddenly blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs the remote out of your hands and laughs. You suddenly back away getting a little worried. She was a quiet bookworm, so who knows what she would act like if she was given power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, relax bro, I'm not going to snap or anything. I'll see you later. I promise i'll give this back to you in a few minutes.\" She says with a calm voice as how she normally talks. Somehow you can trust her, so let her have her 5 minutes of fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan pushes the yellow button with a smile on her face and vanishes. Judging from the way the air in the room is, she flies away to possess someone but who?

Haha.\" Your mother says shockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just drop your spoon and just stare back in utter shock at what your mother just said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry hun, just thinking out loud again. You were always my favorite, that's why I favor you and Megan over her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it hits you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan?!!!!!!\" You blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty sweetie, thank you, thank you.\" Megan in your mom's body says in a softhearted tone exactly how Megan talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the ghost mode swap option, you can take your mind and your body and possess someone and the person possessed won't know anything. This is pretty fun. You need to try this out Martin, its so cool.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, you got me there. Holy shit Meg, that was nuts. Oh, where's the device? \" You say relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan opens a side drawer and takes out the remote swapper and hands it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to hang out or something as someone else?\" Megan as your 42 year old mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, but There's no one to switch with.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's Jessie, our sister, although I don't think you want to hang out with me as mother and son/daughter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, there is one thing!\" you suddenly remember another function of the remote that lists an Age swap option. It says that you can input the age of the target and then age that person to the age on the counter. You haven't tried that option out. since it was obvious Megan wasn't going to leave her mothers body for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie honey, can you come on down?\" Your sister Megan says in your mom's commanding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue sitting on the chair and continue examining the device. Just then your 9 year old sister Jessie walks down and runs up to her new mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it momma?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then input the number \"20\" in the remote reader and hit the purple Age swap button at Jessie. You hit it again cause hitting it again will make it a brainwash swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie then stands in place and looks lifeless. She then begins growing a few feet taller, her hair started from short head length brown hair to long shoulder length hair. Her figure starts taking shape into a normal teenager with larger breasts, bigger than Megan's even and finally the change is complete as Jessie's clothes even begin to morph and fit her older body. Jessie's morph is complete as she stands in front of her disguised older sister in her mom's body and begins to close her eyes then reawaken them as her now 20 year old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to see me mom?\" Jessie asks unknowingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to go to the mall later on with me and Martin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a second to think it over and then agrees with your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get dressed then.\" Jessie then runs up the stairs and gets ready to go. It does confuse you as to how thats going to be possible since Jessie's clothes are too small for her new body, but you just shrug that thought off at how amazing the remote was able to age someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing is impressive man, well lets get ready then. What are you going to do, age her to around Mom's age or something?\" Megan says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of aging mom's body to 20 instead, but then that would mean, you wouldn't be the mom anymore.

Megan has really taken the role of being Mom and the two of you are getting a kick out of acting like them.  Megan knows how boring and old Mom\u2019s wardrobe is and decides to buy her some tighter clothes and switches out her boring Mom pants with a tiny skirt.  She knows Mom would never buy something like that for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you are in the food court looking for other bodies to possess.  Megan whispers to you, \u201cWho do you want to become?  Are you enjoying the whole \u2018girl\u2019 experience?  Or do you want to be a guy again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay I guess.

Let\u2019s find you an older woman to posses!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both survey the mall looking for bodies to posses.  Megan notices a curvy blonde woman and points, \u201cHow about her?  She looks fun to posses!\u201d  As you check her out, Megan groans, \u201cOh..Never mind.  She has a baby with her.\u201d  Suddenly, you notice that the hot blonde turned her head and wasn\u2019t paying attention to her baby.  The baby started crawling towards the top of the stairs and was about to fall off.  You and Megan were too far away to help.  Megan looks at you and says, \u201cWe need to do something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou activate the necklace and start floating like a ghost through the air.  You aim towards the baby and get there just in time.  You possess the tiny infant just before crawling off the ledge.  About the same time, you look up at the hot blonde woman who is the baby\u2019s Mom.  She reaches down to grab you and winks, \u201cNice job Martin!  That was quick thinking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realize that your sister Megan has now possessed the mother.  You try to talk to her but nothing comes out except babbling.  Megan laughs and takes advantage of your situation.  She sets you down in the stroller and talks to you in baby talk, \u201cMy cutie putie wittle baby.  You are such a cutie putie girl!  Yes you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter possessing the baby, you hadn\u2019t taken the time to really check out your body.  You look down to see that you are wearing a tiny pink dress and have a diaper on.  It\u2019s no problem though.  You are glad you saved the baby girl\u2019s life and just need the necklace to get out of her body.  Right then, Megan waves the necklace in your face and giggles again, \u201cI bet you want to play with this don\u2019t you cutie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to maneuver your tiny hands to grab the necklace but Megan pulls it away smiling, \u201cI think we both need a break from this necklace!\u201d  Megan stuffs it in the blonde woman\u2019s purse and whispers, \u201cThis purse costs like 5000 dollars!  I bet this woman is rich!  Let\u2019s check out her house before we possess new people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at Megan for leaving you stuck in a baby girl\u2019s body for the time being.  Megan searches the purse and reads the woman\u2019s ID to see where she lives.  Next she finds a valet parking ticket and says, \u201cWe are in luck!  Let\u2019s go pick our new car up from the valet!\u201d  Megan pushes you in the stroller as you go to get the car.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s one expensive ride!\u201d  As she buckles you into the carseat, Megan dangles the magic remote in front of you.  Megan giggles as you try to grab it.  Megan puts the remote into her pocket and explains, \u201cSorry bro.  But you gotta stay like this until we check out where these people live.  Judging by how expensive her purse and shoes are, their house has to be huge!\u201d  Megan looks in the mirror and applies a layer of lipstick to her new body and mumbles, \u201cI\u2019ll bet this woman has a hot husband too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to talk to her but only baby babble comes out.  Megan smirks and makes fun of your situation again, \u201cYou are such a cutie putie wittle girl!  Yes you are!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare back at her and she drives away.  During the car ride, you try your best to stay awake but you must have fell asleep.  When you wake up, you feel refreshed.  You must have slept through the night.  But you are in an unfamiliar bedroom.  You manage to sit up and discover you were sleeping in a crib.  The room is decorated with pink walls.  It\u2019s obviously designed for the baby girl\u2019s body you have.  You hear voices coming from down the hall and listen.  It doesn\u2019t take you long to figure out it is the sounds of sex.  You roll your eyes knowing that Megan was testing out her new body while you are stuck as a baby.  For the next few minutes, you keep listening to them having sex and get mad that Megan is having all the fun.  You then realize your diaper is full and start to feel uncomfortable.  You decide to start crying to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, you recognize the woman Megan has possessed coming to your rescue.  <br>\r\nMegan glares at you, \u201cYou just had to wake up right now!  I was in the middle of something you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick your tongue out at her and she picks you up.  Megan immediately smells your diaper and makes a face, \u201cYuck!  I\u2019m not changing your diaper!\u201d  The husband was just walking by the hallway as Megan gets an idea.  She pulls out the magic remote and points it at the husband.   The woman the Megan was possessing is suddenly back to normal and begins to change your diaper.  You look over at the husband who is giving you a smile and a wave.  You know Megan is now the husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman changes your diaper and then grabs a clean pink onsie.  She puts a bow in your hair and then grabs a bottle.  She puts it in your face and you have to start drinking.  You look over her shoulder to see Megan watching with the remote.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you have a new point of view.  You are now looking down at the baby girl that you were  possessing.  You see cleavage in-between your chest and figure out you are now possessing the woman.  You set the baby back into the crib and turn to Megan with a glare, \u201cWhy did you keep me like that for so long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan let out a giggle, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake a sleeping baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d  You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan grins, \u201cThis family is rich.  Have you seen this house?  We should enjoy being rich for a little while.  Doesn\u2019t that sound like fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders and agree, \u201cOkay.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amazingly, Jessie's new clothes that she has on are tight jeans with a flower print sewn on the bottoms, and a yellow T-shirt that says \"spoiled\" on it are her old clothes magically grown to fit your average bodied sister. You could tell she wasn't wearing a bra either. This you conclude is what Jessica would more likely wear on a normal day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a minute.\" You say surprised. You run upstairs to Jessie's room to see your sisters room is changed. Her old clothes are still intact, all the little dresses, underwear, shoes, tops, etc have all magically grown along with your sister. The mess of pink walls, teddy bears and other stuffed animals are still there as well. Quite odd of a room for a 20 year old, but you're still amazed that the remote can morph your sister's belongings as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, awesome.\" You say in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go back to the plan and input 40 on the counter. You pause wondering what it's like to see Jessica aged to 40 years old and wonder if the room will change again. You run down the stairs and find Jessica just standing around. Megan seems to not be in the kitchen as well. Must have went to the bathroom you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on one of the chairs and stare at Jessica still unaware of her change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma went to her room to get ready for us to go, butthead.\" Your mature sister says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, Jess, how you feeling? How old are you by the way? Just wondering?\" You wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you stupid or something? I'm nine years old, just how I always been since yesterday loser.\" Jessie says angrily and goes up to you and punches you on the shoulder. What the little Jessica would do to you in the past, only this time it actually hurt a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan in pain and smile a bit that despite how she looks she still thinks she's nine years old in the Age morph. You get the device and point it to her again hitting the age morph to 40 years old. You hit the purple button and Jessica stops in place and begins to change. Her hair grows longer, her but and hips grow wider, as her breasts begin to grow and become more firmer. Hints of grey hair appear in some parts of her head as her clothes begin to morph as well, this time growing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in your kitchen is Jessie or Jessica in the same tight flower print pants, same yellow \"Spoiled\" shirt, with her breasts forming out the shape of the t-shirt since she wasn't wearing a bra in the first place, long flowing brown hair with faint signs of grey showing, and black flip flops. Your sister was now a 40 year old woman unaware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is just stand there is pure amazement. This device is incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister Megan comes down the stairs ready to go flaunting a rather loose blouse, tight fit jeans which curve out her mom's full figure, and dark brown sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Martin ready to go? Woah!! Who is that?!!\" Megan shocked as she stares at the fully grown woman who was once your nine year old sister and still thinks she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong mommy?\" Jessie says in a very unusual tone of motherly and childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, nothings wrong honey, you look pretty hun.\" Megan says while trying not to go crazy her own sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, all right!!\" Jessie runs up awkwardly to your sister and gives her a big hug, which is a very weird scene to behold. You cant help but watch, blush, and be wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Martin are you going to 'get ready' or come with us dressed like that?\" Megan asks you which was code for \"Are you going to possess her or leave her that way and see what happens?\"</span></div></div>",

Megan possessed Jenna and wanted to ruin her life, so ruining Jenna's consecutive healthy diet days is a start. Your Dad left for work and your Mom Helen went out with one of her neighbors for an hour or two so its just you and Megan whose inside of an unaware Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna sits on the table in her sports bra and track pants with her dark brown hair and few blond streaks pigging out on bacon and eggs. Next to that is a plate of sausages, two bowls of cereal, and one stack of pancakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand by the stairs complete stunned with your mouth hanging open at the gross site Megan is displaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE GONNA EAT ALL THAT?! ARE YOU CRAZY?!\" You yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your own damn business, you damn stupid twit. Don't you have someone else to annoy you pain in the ass?\" Jenna blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaah!!!! Jenna?!!!\" You say surprised and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna stops and gets up and looks down on you. She was alot taller than you, and even intimidated you cause she was in better shape than you, that she could kick your ass easily in front of people, and probably would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha, I'm sorry Martin, but um.. I was just being 'in character'. Pretty accurate you think? Man, I swear this is so cool. I can totally ruin her life and stuff.\" Jenna says in a calm loving shy tone that sounds exactly like Megan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... uh, pretty good sis.\" You say back after your heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna's different now, she wouldn't be mean to you. After all, you are Megan's best friend, and I think thats sweet.\"  She says in a teasing Jenna-ish tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna leans over to you and gives you a big hug and a kiss on the forehead, in turn makes you feel very uncomfortable cause this girl was the one who gave you many problems before in the past and sought after you're own demise, well not literally but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan sits back down and continues eating. You sit next to her and just watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you eat all that?!\" You say amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Jenna has a high metabolism so she can eat more than us, I guess. I read about it in a health book for those people who are very healthy.\" Megan says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a damn health nutcase if you ask me. A little to obsessive, makes me look bad compared to my.... eh girth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna stops and looks at you and begins to break down in tears and begins to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Martin!! For hurting you guys these last few years!! It's just that I had over 40 boyfriends, and they all turned me down because they kept saying I was so self absorbed for popularity and treated them like crap, oh and that my nose was too big, and I snore like a basset hound, and say everything is all about me me ME!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explode in laughter as Megan belittles Jenna's love life. you lose control and fall out of your chair in laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're loving this aren't you?\" You get up off the floor drying off the tears in your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every minute of it my friend, every minute of it.\" Jenna/Megan says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the two of you finish breakfast so you two decide on what to do next.<br>\r\nJust then the phone rings and it's your girlfriend Sarah whose going to come over to your place and hang out with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan then bloats up and runs to the toilet cause of all the food she ate. You laugh and a second later Megan reappears next to you with the swap remote. You just applaud her on her amazing performance. She does a bow and high fives you. <br>\r\nUpstairs you hear running which is the real Jenna running to the toilet after the feast your sister gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be in there for quite a while. Ha ha ha.\" Megan says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are a mastermind sis behind those glasses, braces, and booksmarts. Oh yeah, Sarah is coming on over so looks like I'll leave you to having fun with Jenna once she chugs down some Pepto and gets out of the toilet.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, actually I had another idea, now that you bring it up. Why not include Sarah into the fun?\" Megan suggests<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we all hang out together? I wouldn't mind checking out what's it's like to be that hot as your girlfriend since I'm just average. Sarah wouldn't have to know about this, you could brainwash swap her into me. Or would you like to swap with me and be the definition of average and fool Sarah when she arrives? Ha ha.\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm just trying to keep up with you.\" - Meg says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sis. \" You say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head into the mall. As you pass the shops, people take notice of Megan and makes her uncomfortable. She wasn't used to looking this good so it seems out of place. You notice and you grab her hand and drag her off to the restaurant in the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you get a seat and look at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Martin, its just no one gives a crap about me when I pass by, but now I'm getting stares because I'm flinching a bit.\" - Megan says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confidence is the name of the game here. Just act like you usually do, but around people. Don't be afraid to speak up and just talk. you'll make better friends that way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant waitress appears and overhears your conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you ashamed of? With those great curves and looks you got, the men should be lining up for you Cleopatra like. Ready to order?\" - She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute.\" you reply. She leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this is just a lie. I can't really see results unless I'm actually myself you know?\" - Megan says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take my advice, go out, join some clubs too as long as you are with people with similar interests as you and stuff. That'll score some friends for you.\" - you conclude<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright. I'll keep it in mind. I don't want this to be a pity party for me. Lets just hang out some more.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress arrives as you order up some lunch. The two of you chow down and have fun exploring the mall, window shopping. You get some sports items, hats for the both of you (or your girlfriend back home thinking she's a shy nerdy girl drawing fanart characters), and a few books for Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty fun, where we off too now?\"  - Megan says more openly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking back to the remote here. The company that made this thing is called SCIENCCO. also has a museum. Maybe we should check that place out and see if the scientists are missing this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I mean, its too risky getting caught, isn't it?\" - Megan wonders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out your car and vanish out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin?!!!\" - Megan says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister looks around for you but can't find you. A minute later, the driver door opens and you sit down again in the car, but now you're in control of the waitress (GHOST MODE) from the restaurant named Miranda in her waitress outfit with a short short dress. She has brunette hair in a ponytail, and brown eyes. Average everything else though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What risk now?\" You say.in a new female voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just sits there looking at you annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't wait could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.................... \"  you say</span></div></div>",

Why would it be? You have a device that is theirs which is basically stolen and you plan to waltz into their home with the device in use and in hand? I can't help but think that that is stupid, no offense.\" She deciphers your decision for you but you can't help but feel curious to what a company could have inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right sis but I can't help but wonder what is inside that building.\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder later, if you're going in there I am not following.\" She states, arms folded in a stern lock under her newly acquired bust, which you notice she is nervous to touch.

Besides, I haven't gotten to be a girl yet.\" You say as you mount your breasts with your hands, exploring your different exterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really... that is funny because I believe you were in <i>my</i> body earlier.\" You attention changes to Megan as you begin to form up a defense to her fact.

It's just that I'm not pretty enough for you to find me attractive.\" You wave no with your whole body. \"Th-that's not--You're my sister, I am not allowed to find you attractive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you find Jenna attractive just like most boys do.\" She sulks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! She is a bitch and I am not into incest!\" You claim, hoping the conversation will come to an end soon. She lifts her head and stares at you briefly before speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Why can't she speak this clearly towards anyone but me? She is also way more intimidating when she is angry with Sarah's body...</i>' You ponder while Megan stares at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not asking if you would sleep with her. You don't have to be in love with someone to find them attractive.\" She says as you just look at her with a stupefied expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Perhaps being only close to Sarah and me has twisted Megan's view point on family members.</i>' you joke to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan seems to be frustrated with your lack of response but smiles for reasons beyond you. \"Well, this remote is a good way to show you. Do you find my attractive right now?\" She questions. You immediately respond with \"That's not fair you have my girlfriend's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Is Sarah unattractive because I am in her body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine Megan up and down, eying Sarah's smooth, glossed lips, her dark powerful eyes, perky breasts, protruding hips and overall fantastic figure. You feel your face blushing as a strange sensation you have never experienced overtakes you, you're becoming wet. \"Uhn.. that's not fair. Course I find Sarah's body attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you can find family member's attractive, you pervert.\" She laughs in triumph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, it's was a rigged question anyway.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get out of that body.\" She demands. Unwilling to go through another disgusting conversation you get out of the car and relinquish control over Miranda's body.

You question yourself for a moment on where Sarah would go but remember that she frequents the bowling alley more than anywhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go.\" You say. In only five minutes you are at the destination and it is easy to see that Megan is put off by your decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bowling alley? I don't even know how to bowl and I doubt Sarah does either.\" She grumbles with eyes gazing out the window. You smirk and lay a hand on Megan's shoulder. \"Shows what you know about Sarah. She loves bowling and is damn good at it. She comes to this alley more than any others and if you don't believe me just go inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do just that.\" She says as she tosses herself out of the car. You follow behind her and only moments after entering the alley you see two recognizable faces pounding across the place's hard wood floors; Jake, a 16 year old kid, short with dyed blonde hair and Kevin; Jake's best friend, same age, about 5'8 and Sarah has told you is pretty cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah! I'd say it's been a long time but you're here almost everyday.\" Kevin starts up a conversation with a Sarah who is diluted of all her people skills. You notice Megan already at a loss for words as her face drops a small degree. \"H-hey.\" Is all she manages to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to beat us all into the ground at bowling again?\" Jake jokes. You put an arm on Megan's shoulder and answer for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure has.\" You declare with a grin. Both boys respond with false hopes of being able to win and recede back to their lane. Megan just sighs and looks at you. \"L-let's leave. I guess Sarah does bowl, I don't want to embarrass her and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You can just make Sarah take over every time it's your turn. Now let's get some shoes.\" You say, already paying the man at the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess that's true...\" Megan whispers to herself before jerking herself into a focus as she realizes she doesn't know her own shoe size. \"Uhm.. I don--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are you shoes, Sarah. Go beat those two children into the dirt again.\" The man behind the counter says as he hands Megan her shoes. Megan just stares at the shoes until you grab them for her. \"Told you she comes here a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you and Megan are ready the two boys come over and you begin the match. The boys opt for Megan to go first despite Megan's nervous refusal, she eventually agrees and walks slowly towards the lane. You can see her shaking, her posture is low and without confidence but after a moment, you see Megan's posture straighten as she let's Sarah take control. She reels back and throws the ball which glides with a perfect spin and lands a strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I got a strike...?\" Megan says in utter shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did, way to go Sarah! Wooo!\" You yell out to her while the other boys groan in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaargh, a strike on the first go? I guess it's going to be another loss for us, no point in challenging Sarah, she is way too good.\" Kevin pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" is Jake's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Megan turn around with a smile and with an actual kick in her walk, returns to her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\nAfter the game<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan laughs, places both hands on her hips and with her head held high begins to gloat \"You boys need a lot more practice before you can beat me!\" With Sarah's image it wasn't much of a sight but you eagerly await the day when Megan can speak in such a way in her own body. Jake throws his hands up and walks out the door and Kevin after sighing for a moment follows after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you have fun?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! That was amazing.\" Megan replies in a tone of delight, her posture high and looking more like Sarah's. You smile and pat her on the back which she is quick to find an obnoxious gesture. \"Glad you enjoyed yourself. So what now?\" You ask once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me somewhere else that Sarah would go.\" She requests again. A brief thought passes and you know where you are heading. You exit the alley with Megan, start up the car and drive to the ice rink. Megan is again put off at the lack of know-how on how to even skate but you reassure her that if she has trouble she can use Sarah's know-how in place of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being driven by Sarah, you find at the end of the session that Megan fully enjoys herself. It is clear throughout Megan's current form of acting that she is feeling happy and overall excited about the day. \"This has been so fun.\" She comments. You agree and opt that it's about time to be getting back home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Umm.. bye baby.\" is all she says before she leaves with a disoriented face. In the same instance Megan comes out of the kitchen and hands you the remote. \"I don't want to be hiding this while I eat, this body is really hungry.\" She says and scurries back to the kitchen. You pocket the remote and go wait in your room as you're not very hungry yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile of waiting, you find that even after all the ruckus of dinner and cleaning up is done that Megan still hasn't come to your room. You climb to your feet and walk to Megan's room where you find her staring blankly in front of her desk. You close the door and ask \"What's up?\" Furthering yourself in the room, your perspective shows a pocket mirror on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so ugly...\" Megan whispers, her voice too soft to even relay sadness. You stand behind her and let out a deep breath as you look into the mirror with her. \"You are not, stop being so down on yourself.\" you assure her but with little impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today was really fun... I really enjoyed it but.. already the feeling of confidence is gone. I could only be confident because I was Sarah.

You feel sorry for her but can't really think of something productive to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I feel terrible that today, I was even thinking <i>\"What if I just stay as Sarah?\"</i> It's horrible of me to think that way, that I would steal one of my only friend's life. I'm glad I didn't but I... I'm so jealous of Sarah, being her made me realize just how much I admire her.\" Megan continues as she nearly breaks the barrier of tears. You place a hand on her shoulder and try your best to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can learn to skate and bowl, you just need to try. I can help you and so can Sarah. You're not bad looking, you just need to work at it a little bit. Wear something with more personality and maybe get your hair styled. We can do all that tomorrow if you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan runs her hand through her tangled hair, her reflection doing the same. She sighs and decides...</span></div></div>",

You could grab the remote from Megan's room, and take over her body to MAKE her have the make-over. It'd be for her own good right? Once she sees how great she can look she'll be sure to forgive you.

Why did this happen to her? Her beautiful body was all gone now, speaking of her body . Jenna undid the buttons of her pajama's as she pulled off the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see Jenna?\" Sarah asked as she saw Jenna inspecting herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, well, it doesn't come near to my figure, but I have to say you don't look that bad Megan.\" Jenna said as she looked at her body. Megan and Sarah were both confused, was Jenna feeling okay or did she hit her head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was surprised by Megan's physique, even though she didn't work out that much, she was surprisingly skinny. Her waist line was perfect. Another surprise was her breast size. Even though Jenna always thought Megan was flat judging from the clothes she was wearing, she was actually a B-cup just as herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls.\" Megan said as she turned around to Megan and Sarah. \"We need to do this fast.

She was normally not allowed inside the room and neither were her siblings. The room was painted in a dark shade of pink. On the walls she could see posters of different boy bands, photos taken of various championships in which Jenna competed and a series of medals she won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan sat down on Jenna's waterbed as Jenna walked over to the walk-in closet she owned.  Megan could see how Jenna picked some clothes out of the racks puts them against Megan and then puts it back as she didn't like it. Jenna finally decided on a black bra, crop top, shorts and sandals with heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't walk on these.\" Megan complained as she held the sandals in her hand. When she and her mom had shopped once, she tried to walk on heels. It didn't work out in the end as her feet ached. Her mother pointed out that it was normal, but she didn't want her feet to ache like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can, you're in my body Meg. It's not the first time I've walked on things these high.\" Jenna said as she walked back to the walk in closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan pulled off the sports bra over her head, then she removed the Yoga pants. As she looked in the mirror she felt herself turning red. She was now looking at her sister's body, or should she say \"<i>her</i>\" body now. Megan could feel the long blond dyed hair she had in a ponytail, she now had a light brown tan skin, from her front head to her little toe. Her breasts seemed to be the same size as her own, which surprised Megan a little. Jenna was always wearing such revealing outfits which showed off her cleavage. She always thought only women with much bigger breasts would show off. <br>\r\nMegan's waist size was perfect, she couldn't see any fat and her curves were amazing. Her butt was a bit larger and felt softer. Her legs were strong from all the running on the track as she admired them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was still looking at herself in the mirror when Jenna came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" Jenna asked as she looked at her former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yes, I mean no, no I meant....\" Megan stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg, quit it. If you're supposed to be me, act like me. I'm proud of my body, and so should you.\" Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna what are you holding there?\" Megan asked as she looked at what her sister had grabbed from the walk-in closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing special, just two of my bra's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Megan asked getting scared. She put the bra on she got handed from Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To wear them of course. These are enhancers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that.\" Megan said as she walked over to Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can, I can do with <i>my </i> body what I want.\" Jenna said smiling wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you can't, you both said we have to act like each other.

I won't have you talk like that. That's my body you have there, my body is no quitter. Now you can cry all you want, but you're going to wear those sandals if you like it or not. Now just listen to what I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your feet out.\" Megan did it hesitant. \"Don't worry I'm here to catch you.\" Jenna said holding Megan's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just take small steps, not too big. Got it?\" Megan began to take a few small steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, you just have to walk from heel to toe. First let your heel touch the ground and then your toes. That's it, you're doing great.\" Jenna said proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes Megan was walking around in heels like she had always wore them. There was nothing to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna took Megan inside her room as she closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I told you, you could do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed, thanks Jenna.\" It was the first time Megan had said thanks to Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Jenna said in a soft voice. \"Let's see what you have to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna looked around in Megan's wardrobe, she was a little disappointed. Megan had nothing fashionable. Only long jeans, and t-shirts. It was when she digged deeper in the wardrobe when she found something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, where have you been?\" Jenna pulled a long blue dress decorated with roses out of the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. That old thing. Please you can't put that on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It's your size even.\" Jenna checked out the tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, mom bought that for me, a while ago. I hate wearing dresses like that, and I thought you hated those too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but since you have nothing else to wear except long jeans and weird t-shirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not that bad, I mean you would look way more better in those than I would.\" Megan said complementing Jenna.</span></div></div>",

Jenna first showed how to apply the make-up on herself. Looking at herself she thought Megan looked already so much better than before. And then it was Megan's turn. Jenna had to grind her teeth as Megan made so many mistakes in the beginning. If it wasn't her own body she would have thrown her out of her room already. But Jenna also knew that Megan had a lack of confidence, that needed to be pushed. So Jenna began to support Megan, giving pointers to areas she should improve on, and compliment the things she did right. The washcloth she used to put off the make-up was soaked in all kind of colors. But in the end Megan finally could do it on herself, not as well as Jenna could do, but still it was a way better improvement as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can't believe I did this.\" Megan said to her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, you could do it.

It felt nice to be bonded like this once in a while. \"But enough of it for now, we still need to fool that brother of ours.\" Jenna said as she let go of Megan's arms.

When Jenna came in and disrupted their swap, Martin took the opportunity to swoop in and snatch the remote control. Using the yellow button, he disappeared from sight before any of them had the chance to see him. He was watching the three of them panic and argue from above, not feeling inclined to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe that Megan wanted to be his girlfriend! The fact that Sarah was just going to roll with it was shocking to him as well. He was definitely going to need to have a long talk with the both of them when he finally got around to revealing that he had the remote. For now though, he just wanted to get away from the drama. He had no clue that something like this was brewing, but he felt he would need a little break from being Martin before he got around to addressing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating downstairs, he passed his mother and younger sister Jessica in the kitchen. He <i>could</i> possess one of them, but they were just too close to the ground zero of it all. He wanted someone outside of the house. As he flew out of the door and went up above the neighborhood in spirit form, two candidates came to his mind for possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was Debbie, the older sister of his best friend Marco. She was athletic and attractive, just like his sister. While she was Jenna's best friend, Martin had the feeling that neither Jenna-as-Megan nor Megan-as-Jenna would come to visit her anytime soon. He, however, would have excuse to go visit them freely. He could keep any eye on them while still away from home, and he could easily tell his mother and father that he was just staying at Marco's place for the weekend. After all, it'd be true so long as he was inside Debbie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was someone less familiar; the rich girl who lived a block down. Her name was Charlotte, and he was the same age as Martin but they had never interacted much. She had red hair and was a bit on the short side, but she was well endowed with an hourglass frame. In her body, he'd definitely get space from his old life. Her wealthy lifestyle definitely held appeal (they had a pool for one thing), and no one would think to come looking for him in her body either. He wasn't sure how he'd justify his absence from home, but that'd come later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Martin pick?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flying a few blocks down the road, Martin came across Charlotte\u2019s home. He phased through the door of her home, ending up in an expansive living room. There was a piano off to the far left side of the room, some paintings on the wall, and a grandiose looking spiral staircase. He was willing to bet that Charlotte\u2019 bedroom was on the second floor, so he followed the staircase upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first room he found was a bathroom. <i>\u2018Nope.\u2019</i> The second room seemed to be a large master bedroom \u2013 likely belonging to Charlotte\u2019s parents. <i>\u2018Not it.\u2019</i> The third room was also a bedroom, but there was a younger girl in it, who looked to be about 14. She had red hair like Charlotte but was paler and on the skinnier side. Martin didn\u2019t really care for her and moved on to the last room in the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Just right!\u2019</i> Martin exclaimed as he finally found Charlotte\u2019s room. It was bigger than the other girl\u2019s: It had pink walls, a rather cushy looking white bed, some posters of musicians lining the walls, and a makeup desk as well as a work desk. There was also a bathroom adjoining it, and Martin heard the shower turn off just as he entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh,\u201d Charlotte sighed as she walked out of the bathroom, towel tied around her body, \u201cthat was nice.\u201d Martin couldn\u2019t recall when he last heard her voice, but it was definitely more sing-songy than he remembered. He floated above her, watching as she took a moment to brush and dry off her short hair. Once that was done, she replaced the towel with a bathrobe, and threw herself down on her mattress to relax. As she pulled her phone off the nightstand, Martin decided to make his move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte twitched for a second, but it was overall a pretty easy process. In an instant, Martin had phased into her body. Charlotte's conciousness silently faded to the background of her own mind, leaving Martin with total control. He could feel the curves of her body under the bathrobe and he could see the remote in her manicured hand, with her phone in the other. He could see she had just gotten a text a second ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hey Lottie, you doing anything tonight? Nikki and I are bored af right now.\u2019 \u2013 Taylor <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte\u2019s eyes lit up at the sight of the message. If Charlotte\u2019s friends were as attractive as she was, Martin could definitely have some fun with them. He just got here though, maybe he should have some fun getting used to being Charlotte herself first? Charlotte was already more or less undressed, after all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You cut corners and head down an alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll be Valedictorian once its all said and done.Pfft, who am I kidding, I barely survived my gym courses and being the dodgeball magnet for three straight years in junior high. Wait, is P.E. considered part of the Valedictorian process?\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking by some closed off mini-warehouses you finally get to the end of the shortcut to the highschool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was easy, I guess I.......\" - You begin to say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop when you immediately back out. Unable to move you get a glimpse of a scene which feels like it lasts forever. You see a vision of the same area if not less desolate. The last thing you see is a big truck turning right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision changes and you regain yourself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh..... What the hell was that? Okay Jessie, calm down. That vision? That's here, but the pavement isn't so damaged..... I think I'm going crazy!\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of walking you immediately run to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're greeted by the chatter of the high school clamor as students everywhere decend into the hallways of your new high-school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay first class is gym. And in the morning?! What the crap!\" - You groan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the bleachers and listening in on the announcement of the new PE teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay ladies, all of you! We'll be scrapping off that rust off your lazy summerbound asses by playing some basketball! All of you will be in teams! Girls line up over there and fellas over there. \" - The gym teacher Mr. Swain says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou line up and are grouped into a team with 4 other girls and pitted against another team of boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm so dead.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game starts and again you phase out but only for a second again. You barely notice it at all as you play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys gets the ball and begins to dribble it to their basket. You play defense and successfully steal the ball. You run the other way, defenders of boys begin to get in your way. Amazingly you swerve out of their grasp and take your chances and you lay the ball up and in scoring 2 points for your girls team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" - several of the girls say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.... how the hell did I do that?!\" - You say as you're not even tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue playing hitting a three pointer, stealing the ball again twice and making a long distance fade away shot from 24 feet. The class ends as you stand there shocked. Your teammates meet up with you and high fiving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica the Jet! You are ballin' girl!\" - One of your teammates says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. It wasn't a big deal.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should join the team.\" - She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh it off and head off to get a locker assigned and head to your next class which is mathematics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn math your teacher Mr. Berensen drones on and on about numbers you already know but you're only focused on your recent vision and sudden explosion at the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That was very weird I had NO idea I could do that, but it could be luck. If not the game, that vision was surreal too. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Remy, are you awake there?\" - Mr. Berensen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaah! Uh yes I'm paying attention!!\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then care to solve this problem on the board?\" - Mr. Berensen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over it and remember these old middle school fractions. It was the only thing you were good at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that's easy, its three fourths.\" - You say confidently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That incorrect, pay careful attention again.\" - he say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \"That's odd. I've seen that problem before, but I got it........ wrong?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou phase out again and you get another vision:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Thats incorrect again. Pay more attention again next time mister!&gt; - Male voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I-i-i-i-i'm sorry!!!!&gt; - Boy voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Hey amigo, quit day dreaming about her again. You two finally hooked up but your head in check.........&gt; - another boys voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \"Those voices? Whats going on? Where are they coming from? I can't see anything!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Sorry bud, but I think this is going to be one amazing four years of our lives!&gt; - first boy voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Another high school noob? Are they doing this to me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap back to reality, blink and see you're still in class. You shake your head and wait for the bell to ring for nutrition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out of the class and head to the ladies room. You head to the mirror and check yourself. Your eyes were clear, you didn't have a fever, nor where you having any physical side effects from the vision. It was just you Jessie dressed in a light red top, camo pants and tennis shoes and a headband over your long straight hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm hallucinating. Or I took some meds or something. Gaaah! I need a head doctor! - You yell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for a psychologist girl! \" - someone from the stalls yells<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack, sorry!\" - you say and escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visions didn't occur again all day. After school you begin to walk home again when you're greeted by your old friend Casey from middle school. She was an average redhead short hair, decent figure, and was your best friend, unfortunately she goes to a different high school as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl! Don't cha recognize me?\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Casey?! Oh hey!\" - You say a bit apathetic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disappoint me, haven't seen your best friend in a long time and you look all gloomy!\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but its been rough for me lately.\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue down an alley and explain everything to your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your just losing your mind is all.\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats NOT funny!!\" - You yell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe sorry. It could be a past life experience. Like someone from a past life is living out their lives in your head or something. Take that alley vision of yours. You say the area looks more cleaner compared to now. It coulda been years back.\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I dunno. This is freaking me out.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, cheer up! Be the old hyper Jessica again from years back. You were always a sparkplug but you're been really sarcastic and cynical.\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always been this way.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, you can't fool me, you must have fogotten.\"  -Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's odd, what's she going on about? I don't remember being hyper at all. Wait. I can barely make out what I've done in the past. I can't remember anything!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can't remember anything!\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For reals? Thats freaky!\" -  Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its weird. Now that I think about it, my memories are fuzzy and hard to picture. I can remember things from what happened last month, but years, its..... not there, you know.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd.\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you pass by a parking lot to a science museum that opened up years back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can remember better if we hang out there for awhile.\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A science museum? What the hell? I'm going crazy, maybe I could donate my brain for them to look over or whatever.\" - You say sarcastically</span></div></div>",

We can clear our heads when we see the ancient dino exhibits.\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know, but this is starting to bug me, and then I think about possible past liv.....\" - You say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your train of thought is interrupted as you bump into a woman and you fall on the ground:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie!!\" - Casey runs over and help you up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to the woman to see an African american woman in her twenties stumbling over and giving you a thorough look over then to shock as she eyes your face and helps you up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't see where I was going.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry......\" - the woman quickly apologizes and then runs off in the other direction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was weird. Are you okay?\" - Casey begins<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She.... she was frightened.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The look on her face said it all. Like she was totally scared of me.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh really? How can you be sure?\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this new feeling. When she knocked me down, and when I saw her face. I suddenly felt..... euphoric. I can't describe it, but then her face, that look of being scared, the feeling went into sadness and pain. And to a complete stranger. There is something definitely wrong with me. I'm not making this up. To have these mood swings and feel them that fast to someone I don't know is extremely unusual.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".................\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you continue walking to the entrance of the building. Along the way you look down to notice small water droplets on the ground from the woman's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Those were... her tears....... she was so sad.......</i> - you think to yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the museum, the two of you pay the inexpensive fee and look at the exhibits for awhile. Casey tries to brighten up your mood with the dino exhibits, it seems to work until you start having relapses again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!!!\" - you groan as you kneel down to the ground and clench your stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie, are you okay?!\" - Casey<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relapses cease as you help yourself up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Casey, thanks for being a good friend, but can we head back home? I wanna lie down in my bed.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" - Casey smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you leave the museum as Casey walks you home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive home and say goodbye to Casey who promises to call you again, as you collapse onto your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DINNER!\" - Helen yells<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lag behind and take your dinner upstairs to eat in your room. Afterwards, Megan arrives home and walks by the hallway to her room. Reaching forward you get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, I'm feeling like crap, do you want to hang a bit? Please?\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... Uh....are you alright? S-sure.\" - Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's new?\" - Megan says cheerfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megs.... where's Martin?!\" - you unconsciously say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" - Megan looks at you shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clasp your head in pain and look up at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your mouth dropped open as soon as you had heard what Megan said. How could that be? How could you possibly be a boy named Martin? It was just impossible. Your name was Jessica Remy. You were 15 years old and just starting high school. You couldn't possibly be anyone else, especially not a boy who you didn't even know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, I understand what you're feeling right now. You probably don't believe me, but it's true.\" Megan said, her eyes starting to tear up as she looked down, averting your gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Megs, you're not making any sense, how could I be Martin? I've never heard that name before in my life. I don't know who he is.\" You said, confused, trying to figure out what Megan was trying to say. \"Just start from the beginning. Please tell me exactly what happened. I need to know.\" You said, placing your hand on her shoulder. Megan looked into your eyes for a minute, letting the tears run down her face, before rubbing them out and nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. It all started a few years ago with the discovery of this remote.\" She said, gesturing to the device in her head. The more you looked at it, the more it felt familiar.  \"Martin, my brother, had gotten his hands on it, I have no idea how. He started using it and having fun with it's power. Eventually he did something to me that I couldn't forgive. I was really mad at him. Sarah and I were their too. We took the remote and were about to do something to him, when he grabbed it from us and ran. We had chased him home where he was hiding from us with the remote and were about to get it from him again. In order to hide, he used the GHOST function on the remote to possess your body. While he was in you, we got the remote back and decided that he had become corrupt from the remote. We were so mad we couldn't think straight. Sarah and I decided the world may be a better place if Martin were to disappear, and we used the PROGRAMMING mode to alter his mind. We made him become you not only in body, but in mind as well. And we used it to make everyone forget he even existed too. It was horrible. Eventually Sarah and I realized we were wrong and tried to reset everything, but it wouldn't work. Martin was gone forever.\" Megan said, as she began crying again. You realized that she truly felt horrible about what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely shocked. This was too much...You COULDN'T be Martin. Before now, you didn't even know who Martin was, and now you found out that he was you. No, it was too impossible. You'd have remembered something if you were Martin... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember all of the flashes and mood swings you'd been having. Maybe that was Martin's was of coming out to let you know he was alive inside you. It made sense but it was still hard to believe. You weren't mad at Megan for what she had done. You realized that she didn't mean it in the long run and that she truly regretted it. And somehow you knew that Martin would forgive her too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, it's alright. I can't believe all of this, but I can believe that you feel horrible about what happened. If Martin saw you like this, I know he would forgive you.\" You said reassuringly, putting your hand on Megan's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked up at you and smiled, tears glimmering in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, I'm so sorry. I don't know what you're going through. I can only imagine that you're starting to get glimpses of Martin's life. I should never have done this. I should have just forgiven Martin for this. I know that I can't bring back the dead, but please, take this remote and use it. It's the least I can do for robbing you of your real life.\" Megan said, handing you the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took it from her hand, and as soon as it touched your hand, you felt an incredible sensation flow through you, as if your entire body were being filled with energy. Having the remote in your hand felt familiar. It felt right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Megan. And really, it's okay. I forgive you.\" You said, but you didn't know if you really believed it. You had a whole other life. A life you were only just starting to remember. You had friends, who now wouldn't even remember the original you. And you had a feeling that these memories slowly coming into your head was a sign that somewhere inside you, your original mind was still alive. You couldn't truly forgive Megan for taking that life away from you, but you could atleast let her feel better about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you really knew for sure was that you had a lot to think over. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You had no idea how to react to what Megan had told you. It was just...so weird. You just couldn't find it possible to accept that you ever could have been anyone different than Jessica Remy. You remembered playing dolls and dress up with Megan and Jenna as a little kid, and you remembered talking to your friends about guys that you liked. Even trying to think of yourself as a guy just felt so...wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on your bed and looked around your room. It was the stereotype of a teenage girls bedroom, filled with old stuffed animals, Twilight novels, and posters of boy bands you had liked since you were a kid. You got up and looked at yourself in front of your mirror. You weren't the best looking girl in school by a long shot, but everyone had always told you you were very pretty. You had long golden blonde hair, sparkling blue eyes, a white smile and a figure that all of your friends envied. Everyone had been telling you to try out for cheer leading but you had never gone for it because you didn't want to be looked at as some stuck up slut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how you thought about your life you had come to the same conclusion. There was no way you could have been a guy. Even if the remote could erase your memories of having a brother, there was no way it was possible to change someone that drastically. Or could there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze drifted to the remote sitting on your dresser. You picked it up and looked at it in your hands. It just looked like a remote with a lot of buttons. It didn't look like something that was responsible for changing the lives of so many people so easily. You still weren't even sure if you believed what Megan had said about it. You thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that there was only one way to see if it worked or not. You would have to test it...</span></div></div>",

Either Sarah pressed a wrong button, or the collision with Megan made the remote go awry for that moment, which means that something must have happened as well to Megan or as the original finder of the remote, you get some sort of immunity, although obviously not a complete one, but adequate enough to retain your sense of original self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to strip and sleep, intending well to explore Sarah's body to the fullest tonight as a payback for what happened.

She had returned to her original body, but she felt weird. Like something or someone was living in her head, but she tried to brush it away and went into deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly in the morning, you woke up with a start and yesterday's experience flooded into your mind, making you unsurprised by the fact that you're not in your own room and your body was not your own. You tossed the pink bedsheet away and quickly dressed, donning up tank top and denim short and took a pair of Sarah's sunglasses which was on her table, grabbed a cap and put on a grey jacket which was hung on the wall. You decided that morning attack was a better plan to reclaim your lost remote. Sarah and Megan wouldn't expect that you retained your memory and probably still snoozing away, dreaming a mischievous plan of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely dawn, as the first ray of sun could be seen in the horizon, you set off. <i>5am, good</i> you thought and with that you carefully pocketed her wallet and put on a pair of trainers. You couldn't use the car, Sarah's parents would probably wake up and your plan would be foiled, not to mention that you could get questioned so you decided to go by bus. You tiptoed downstairs and made it out without even making a noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey was uneventful as you were more concerned about what to do when you get there. Various plans and schemes fleeted your mind, but you know they are useless if you can't get your hands on the remote. Pretty soon, you arrived, faster than you expected. In fact you're lucky that an old lady dropped off at the stop near your house, otherwise, you could've missed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself staring at your house as dawn just began to break and colored the sky bluish orange. You hid yourself well near some shrubs, as you caught a glimpse of Jenna running off to her usual morning jog. You waited and waited with bated breath until you couldn't see her anymore, the morning wind made you chatter as it brushed against your new legs. You gathered up courage and walked into the front door, turning the handle slowly and pushed, only to see Megan standing and looking at you with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Sarah,' Megan sneered as she turned and walked back to the stair leading up,' Come on follow me.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a weird feeling to her voice but you couldn't turn away and run from your house, so you followed her to her room as she lead you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan sat on her bed and you just stood in her room, uncertain about your fate. Could it be that Megan and Sarah had known that you didn't completely succumbed to become Sarah? You saw the remote on her hand and pondered whether to just snatch it from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not so fast,' Megan smirked again, as if she read your mind. 'I'll give it to you, in due time.' With that said, she stood up and hand you the remote, much to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next 10 minutes was spent as Megan told you that she was actually you. Another you which resided inside Megan's mind. Just like you inside Sarah's mind. You even tested her to see if this was a trap set up by Megan and Sarah, but Megan dismissed all your suspicion as she told you things that only you would know. 'I dunno how it was done, but I don't think it could happen again. A glitch, or something made this happen. Which is a good thing huh?' <i>Megan</i> concluded her explanation as you stared at her in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So where's Sarah?' you asked after all your wits had come back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, she's trying out Jenna's body, she pressed the blue brainwash button and now Jenna's conciousness is in our old body and thinks that she is us. For me, I've been busy dressing our little sister with Jenna's clothes.', <i>Megan </i>was wearing Jenna's old tank top which was still a bit loose for her small frame and her own denim shorts which you've never seen her wore before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, you really are me.', you voiced breathlessly, marvelling about the same clothing choice both of you had chosen for your bodies as you unzipped your jacket, letting the you in Megan to see that you had the same attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was gonna dress her up in lingerie, Jenna's, but she's too underdeveloped, basically I tried to make her like Jenna. Which would be hot.', <i>Megan </i>twirled her frizzy brown hair and sat down. 'So, what're we gonna do dude?', <i>Megan </i> asked you as she moved closer to your body. You flipped the remote several times, getting used to the feel again and breathed out a sigh of contentment as you ponder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who knows I might disappear completely and gets overrided by Megan's self again.' She finished with a worried tone in her voice. Some minutes has past and your clone in Megan had changed herself back into Megan's pyjamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still had no clue of what to do, .twirling the omnipotent remote. You wanted Sarah and Megan to feel embarrased, to feel the despair that you felt while in Sarah's and Megan's body. You were certainly not evil, but the need for revenge clouded your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tell you what, let's use Megan, and turned her against Sarah.', the clone in Megan spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You mean like, programming mode and made her into anoher me?' you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nope, just normal swap with her so she can taste how betrayal is like, I'm fading soon, so do whatever you think is good,' Megan spoke before she fainted to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to take your clone's advice, but you took 2 sleeping pills as well. As you began to feel drowsy, Megan stirred. What a stroke of luck you had these days! You positioned yourself inside Megan's closet, which was her place to store her comic books and hit the blue button with the last of your conciousness. Quick moment later, you felt your face rub against the carpet, while you hear a thud from the closet, as Sarah's body knocked against the wall, dozing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked yourself up, and closed the closet door with Sarah inside. You breathed a sigh of relief and waited. Pretty soon, you heard Sarah came back from her jog as Jenna and your dad and mom greeted her in the dining room as usual. According to Megan's memory, which you literally tore apart, Sarah had not done anything to them, she had better morality, just wanting to experience other's life and giving you punishment for your prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pocketed the remote and went downstairs to have breakfast with the rest of the family. As the morning progressed, you stayed close to your parents so that Sarah couldn't ask you about the remote. When they were about to leave for work, you hurried to the bathroom and locked yourself there until you were certain that they had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah greeted you as you came out,' Hey Megan, did you take the remote?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the cue for you to drop the bomb on her,' I, I feel that I should be the only one to hold the remote.', you acted, feigning Megan mustering her courage,'I want it for myself, it's not meant to be shared.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was puzzled by the sudden change of attitude,'Megan, are you okay? Give me the remote please.' Sarah demanded as she took a step forward, which you reacted by taking two steps backward. As Sarah was in Jenna's body, she got Jenna's strength and agility, she could cover the distance and grabbed the remote off you very quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry Sarah, you have to live as me from now on, Martin was better than you, at least he didn't try to wrench the remote from me.' and with that you pressed the red swap button intentionally, much to Sarah's horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swap happen quickly and you hid your grin. Jenna's body was much much better than Megan's. More athletic and agile, the result of her training and discipline for years and you get to have it without breaking a sweat. You flexed your body as Megan stared at her hand in disbelief. The Sarah inside Megan tried to reason with you, and plead to give her the remote. 'Now Megan, we have to act in character.' you spoke to her,' Out of the way, twerp!' and you pushed her aside, went up and got ready to take a bath in Jenna's body. Meanwhile, you could hear Megan broke into tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pleasured yourself in the bath, you looked at the remote you put beside you. And you thought of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

You supposed, that because he was \"you\", you couldn't help but worry about him and whether or not he was still around, now inside of Sarah's body. You didn't want him to disappear, because as odd as it was, you enjoyed having a different version of yourself to have around and talk to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the bath and rapped yourself in a towel, thinking about how to check whether he was okay, when an idea came into your head. You had no idea where the idea came from, but it was certainly possible. Maybe the clone of you somehow went into Sarah's body, and the remote can be used to bring him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the remote in your hand and walked into Jenna's, now your room. It was much bigger and nicer than your old room, and you definitely liked Jenna's body. You briefly felt guilty that the real Jenna was basically wiped from existence, but remembering how much of a bitch she was made you think the world could go without her for a few days. You put on some new clothes and briefly admired yourself in the mirror before putting the remote in your pocket and heading into Megan's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood outside of Megan's door, hoping the Sarah in Megan's body didn't stumble onto the real Megan's sleeping body in the closet. You banged on the door as loud as you could and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, open the door, twerp!\" in a very Jenna-like way. After she didn't respond you put your ear to the door to try to listen if she was even in their. You couldn't hear her anywhere. She probably went downstairs for something, but that wasn't important. You opened the door, and walked inside. You then opened her closet and found Sarah's body, with Megan, and hopefully your clone as well, inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jenna's strength, you were easily able to lift up the sleeping girl and bring her to Jenna's room ans lay her on the bed. After a few minutes of waiting you started to lift Jenna's weights. You found it odd how your old body couldn't lift more than ten pounds, but Jenna could easily lift fifty. As you were lifting, you heard Megan (Sarah's mind) close her door. It sounded like she had went outside to try to clear her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so, you heard Sarah's body begin to stir. You stood up and looked down at her waiting for her to open your eyes. You had the remote in you hand just in case you needed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sat up in the bed, rubbing her head. She looked a bit dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me it worked Jenna.\" She said looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what worked Sarah?\" You asked. You had an idea what she was referring to, but had no way of knowing for sure. Sarah smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're in character. I can't believe the luck we've had today.\" she said with a huge smile. \" I thought I was done for when I fainted like that, but when you switched me with Sarah's body, I think it was only me that moved. As far as I know, Megan's mind is still unconscious in her body with Sarah. and something tells me she isn't the type to try to take control. I'd doubt she even knows how to talk to Sarah.\" She said. You returned the smile. You knew what had happened and were relieved. Your clone was alive and well. And then an idea struck. You could tell from her smile that your clone had gotten the same idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still another you waiting to have fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, you knew full well, you wouldn't like Jenna barging into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You in there baby?\" Sarah asked, knocking lightly on the door. She sounded just like the real Sarah. You heard footsteps coming from the room and a minute later you saw the door opening and your old body stepped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah. It's nice to see you. I thought you were dumping me for my sister for a while.\" He said smiling. Since he couldn't remember the remote, you guessed that he thought it was odd for Sarah to spend so much time with Megan. His smile disappeared when he noticed you standing next to Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say I like your company though. What do you want?\" He asked you, looking pissed off and ready to close his door again when Sarah took hold of his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. We have something to tell you that you probably won't believe. It's easier if we just show you first.\" Sarah said, putting her other hand out. You knew what she was implying and gave her the remote. She pointed it at Martin and hit the normal swap button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck did you do, Sarah?\" Sarah's body asked. You could tell she was trying as hard as he could not to feel her breasts. You laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, baby. It's the remote. It can swap bodies and has all kinds of features. Like I said, it's easier if we just showed it to you first.\" Martin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sarah, I just remembered, don't we have a loose end to tie up?\" You asked. Martin's body looked at you and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be right back, baby. Don't have too much fun in my body.\" he said, kissing Sarah's body on the cheek. The two of you walked out of the room and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it feels weird. even though I'm you, I've never actually been in my body before.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why don't we just tell him who we actually are?\" You asked, ignoring his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can tell him later. It would be easier on him thinking another version of himself took over his bitchy sisters life, but if he finds out we did it too his girlfriend it could become a problem.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So what do we do about the real Sarah, in Megan's body?\" You asked. He looked like he was thinking for a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just program her too think she's Megan. She won;t remember the remote.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's a good idea. But then what about Sarah's body? We can't just leave 'him' in it.\" You said, referring to the Martin in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll keep her body. I do really like it.\" He said. With that the two of you walked over to Megan's room. He gave you the remote and you walked into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, who used to be Sarah, was crying a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this Megan?\" She asked, thinking you were Megan. You pointed the remote at her and pressed the programming button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, why was I crying?\" She asked, dazed. Then she looked at you and practically jumped back terrified. \"I...I didn't do anything to your room, J..Jenna.\" she said. She thought she was Megan now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Twerp!\" You said, leaving her room and slamming the door. You and your clone smiled at each other and went back into Martin's room. Sarah's body had a sly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, babe. I didn't look too much\"  She said. Your clone took the remote from you and pressed the swap button putting her back into her body. Martin looked disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have fun soon, Martin.\" she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I guess I should ask. Why's Jenna here?\" He asked. You could tell by the way he said her name, that he hated Jenna just as much as you did. You smiled at him and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Jenna. I'm you. Well, I'm another version of you. When you use the remote, your mind splits so there are two of us. One in you, and one in me.\" You said, trying to make it as easy for him to understand as possible, and lying so he thought the clone was Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I understand now.\" Martin said, scratching his head a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. So where too now, guys?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a low voice, almost a whisper, but kept getting louder and louder. Eventually, the voice got so strong, she help her hands to her ears to fight it, pain filling her head. The voice still kept getting louder and louder, until finally, it stopped, and Megan laid on her bed, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, she remembered everything. She didn't know how, or why, but she remembered the remote. She remembered being taken over by that...thing. and she remembered being trapped in her own body when Sarah was left here by Martin. Sarah had thought it was her who betrayed her. Everything was messed up, but for some reason, Megan felt different. When she thought of Sarah, she saw Sarah's memories. And then the voice came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Megan, I'm so sorry for this.I saw in you memories, it wasn't you who switched with me, it was Martin. I don't know how this could have happened.&gt; Even though the voice was from Megan's head, it belonged to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" Megan whispered almost under her breath. \"What happened to you? How are you in my head?\" Megan asked, scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I think, when Martin Switched bodies with you, your mind stayed in your body, and then somehow mine was added. I could see and hear everything, and I gave you back your memories. Megan, you have to help me get my body back.&gt; Sarah pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know how to.\" Megan said, and she felt a tingling in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Yes you do, Megan.&gt; Sarah said, sending an idea to Megan's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I get the remote back, and use ghost mode, your spirit might leave instead of mine.\" Megan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Exactly. Can you get back the remote for me?&gt; Sarah asked, getting a little louder in Megan's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" Megan said, as her head began to explode in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;If you have any doubts, say it...&gt; Sarah said, stopping the pain a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can. I'm scared to do it. I don't want to lose my memories again.\" Megan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Fine then. Megan, I need to ask you something important. Can you forgive me for this?&gt; Sarah asked, sounding like she felt guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For wha...\" Megan began, but couldn't finish her sentence before collapsing to the ground, unconscious. When she woke up again, she walked to her mirror, more confidence than Megan every had in her step. She looked at her reflection and ran her hand through her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for this Megan. I really am, but if you won't get back the remote, I have to.\" Sarah said to the reflection. Now that she had a body again, she'd get back the remote and leave Megan as soon as possible. She didn't want to steal Megan's life any more than she had to. She needed to get the remote back. And she needed it soon, because she felt Megan's mind inside her body. And compared to Megan's, Sarah's mind was getting weaker and weaker with every minute, she stole from Megan's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Sarah, and Martin stood in your, Jenna's, room trying to decide what to do. There were now three of you, and the conversation got confusing very quickly. The you inside of Sarah tried to stay quiet as long as possible so Martin thought she actually was Sarah. It was your old body that suggested getting out of the house to go somewhere, but that was cut short when Megan walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H..hey everyone....W...what's going on?\" She asked, but for some reason you couldn't place, you thought she was faking the studding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you in my room, brat?\" You ask, sounding annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..no reason, Jenna. I just wanted to see if you saw any of my manga's lying around.\" She said walking forward, but then tripping on Jenna's weights on the ground. You went to pick er up, and she took hold of your pockets to get a grip and balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have your stupid, manga's twerp. No get out of my room.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sis.\" Megan said, uncharacteristically, and walked out of the room. You turned back to finish the conversation with the others, not realizing the remote was missing from you pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything started to spin, and when she came back, she saw Megan lying on the floor, and Martin, in Jenna, take the remote from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think happened?\" Martin's body asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" The thing in Sarah's body answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked over to Martin's body and felt herself go inside of him.

It's all thanks to that stupid remote.\" you said, trying to make peace. Sarah's body just looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right this is thanks to that remote. It's time we stopped playing god. Look at what this remote has done to us. I want things back to normal.\" Sarah said, she ran at Martin, in Jenna and snatched the remote from her hands. \"I'm going to set this right.\" She said, getting ready to press reset, when her body took the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you press that button I won't exist. And I love life to much for that to happen.\" She said. She put her hand on the remote and pressed brainwash swap. </span></div></div>",

Before anyone stirred, you took the remote for precaution and pocketed it away while you waited for signs of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old body stirred first and realized that he didn't hold the remote. Although he looked relieved that he saw your pocket bulged.'We got the remote back huh?', he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to start a conversation when Sarah groaned. Martin quickly helped her to her feet and after some nice exchanges (in which you played part as a bitchy sister), finally both of you managed to send her back to her house. She seemed to not remember anything about the remote, although she might knew the things you did in her body, although she must've thought that she did it herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stirred moments after Sarah was on her way back. As soon as she woke up, the colors drained from her face as she saw both of you looming above her. Martin smirked as he pressed the blue brainwash button and darkness enveloped Megan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou in Jenna's body and another you in Megan's body soon met up in Jenna's room after dragging your old body back to his room. 'I guess the world and the remote is big enough for two Martins.', the other you smirked as she accustomed to be Megan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're not playing god, WE ARE GODS!', she suddenly broke into a manianical laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dude, stop that, you're creeping me out and I don't have god complex.', you cut her laughter short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, sorry dude.' she mumbled her apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you're right, we're gods! And this remote is our sceptre!', you suddenly broke into manianical laughter which Megan followed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, we gotta act in character dude.', you finally composed yourself. Megan just winked,' I, I guess I'll just g-go and hid myself in my room with my comic.' Your clone in Megan feigned her shyness and occasional stutter perfectly. 'It's not hard to do man, with a bit practice and I can pry into her mind as well or guide her action as though she was the one doing them.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled,' Seems like we're going to get 2 new sisters after all, I'll be sure to turn Jenna into what we had in mind, before I get bored with her.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not a lot of interesting happening that night, mostly you and your clone spent time behind locked doors together, trying out different outfits in your new form and completely inspecting every inch of your new bodies as well as playing a game to uncover the darkest secret and humiliation that your two sisters have had in their life. You conveniently cancelled all of Jenna's schedule to the gym today, while Megan excused herself from going to library for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did you know that Jenna is afraid of spiders?' you chuckled as you told Megan, who was busy trying out Jenna's old stuff and you could hear her stifled giggle. Both of you were skimpily dressed with Megan just putting on a bra to cover her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan then sat in front of you and closed her eyes for a moment, as though trying to remember something far away, then she opened her eyes,' Megan used to have a crush on Bryan the overweight guy next door!' she said Megan's secret so casually as though it was a mundane thing to say. Hearing Megan's secrets coming from her own mouth and her voice also the casual-almost-playful tone she used to said it made it somewhat hilarious. Needless to say, you and your clone spent the rest of the evening playing this game, only stopping once for dinner. Your parents must have surprised to see their daughters being together so nicely. Even Jessica and Martin was feeling left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evening progressed, sleep was getting near and nearer and both of you decided to stop. You got up and Megan followed suit, then she gave you a hug which was really a diversion to squeeze your new shapely ass.'Hmm, I wish I have these babies.', she moaned much to your surprise. With her average height, she only reached to Jenna's chin and made her easier to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I wish I have your boobs dear sister,' you retorted as you placed your hands on yours,' Looks like these can't expand any bigger due to my intense training regime.' you mocked your new body. It was a hilarity and Megan made one last joke as she went out,'Maybe I should try sleeping naked like you did.' Martin who heard the conversation was embarrased and locked himself in his room again. As you lied in bed, clutching the remote, you wondered what tomorrow would bring. To prove that she's a clone of you, Megan willingly let you hold the remote as a sign of good will. However, just to be sure, you still locked your bedroom before drifting peacefully to sleep, while the remote perched comfortably on a desk next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Claire!', you blurted out to your own amazement. It must've taken you quite a while as the voice on the other side was clearly showing impatience when you picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, what take you so long to pick up the phone?', Claire snapped out of impatience. You were too stunned to do anything else and just hum and occasionally saying 'yes' to whatever Claire said to you on the phone. She was mumbling a lot of things about cheerleading practice, track field meeting and stuffs that you had never heard of. She must had spoken for a good 30 minutes. When she finally cut the call, you let off a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then thought carefully about what Claire had said.<i>Track meeting today cancelled</i> you've never known this, but suddenly you just knew that Jenna was supposed to go there in 2 hours time and you could have been going there as Jenna, oblivious to the fact that you weren't her. You concentrated at what Claire said and suddenly out of nowhere, you just knew Jenna's plans and schedules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you made sure that Jenna had no plan for today, your attention turned back to her body. As her, you'd taken bath, undressed and see her in her naked glory, but as you thought you were her, it seemed like normal to you. Now however, everything changes. You looked at your shapely body in the mirror and smirked. Jenna was pretty, it's just her bitchy attitude that made you loathe her so much and now that you knew yourself again she looked very alluring, so delicious that you just can't help but to strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately decided to go to the pool. With your new body, you could take all the time you need to explore your new body and peek at other girls unnoticed and unsuspected. Like a wolf in sheep's disguise. Although you wouldn't be able to swap to a new body if you find something you fancy, you decided that this was a too good opportunity to be missed out as tomorrow Jenna would need to attend cheerleading practices and other duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you packed a two piece bathing suit, towel, and everything else Jenna would need to swim. Strangely as you packed, you seemed to know all the location of the things you wanted to find and didn't spend too much time rummaging around her room. Doing so well, you even thought if you could perfectly imitate her bitchy attitude and be the dominating figure in your house, although you need to do something about the remote first. You decided to brush that thought away from your mind, the important thing was to enjoy the moment. You even found her diary, but having no time to read it, you just left it and zoomed off after you had changed into a t-shirt and denim shorts, clutching a bag which contained all you need. You made sure to choose the bathing suit that would accentuate your new body as Jenna's boobs are average, but her ass and shapely curve made up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to the swimming pool and as you drove, you fantasize on how you'd look like with the two piece. Other than almost crashing three times, nothing else happened and you skipped your way to the dressing room, hoping to see some sights...</span></div></div>",

Part of you is frightened to realize that you are also finding him interesting, if not a tiny bit attractive.

Could we maybe do a movie or something sometime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the Megan part of you stunned and almost swooning because he called you cute again.

How pink can you make this place! I don\u2019t know if I will need the toilet more to pee or to throw up!\u2019 You are glad all the stalls are empty and the lady is leaving with her daughter. You find a reasonably clean stall and lock yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly realizing that standing up to pee is not an option, you get your first experience of needing to hitch up your skirt, pull down your panties and then sitting down. You let loose and feel the urine stream from somewhere between your legs, but right now you don\u2019t want to look. Not having your penis is bad enough without seeing a pussy. However, the worst was yet to come. Using your sister\u2019s memories about hygiene, you realize that you need to wipe \u2018down there\u2019. You finish that humiliating job when you hear a group of chatty girls walk into the bathroom. You don\u2019t really want to face any girls you might know, so you decide to stay where you are at the moment and hope they leave soon or hit the stalls themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don\u2019t leave, but talk about other people a lot.

I will bet neither of them have ever been kissed! Who would want to?\u201d They continue tearing down both Norman and Megan. You are mortified at first, and are on the verge of tears at their cruelty. Then you realize that this is just how Megan would react, but part of what she needs to change. You try to focus and control yourself. They need to be told off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up your panties and stand up, smoothing your skirt in the same way Megan would ,without thinking. Then you flush the toilet and brace yourself to open the door. As you step out of the stall, the girls who have just been trashing you (as Megan) are in plain view.

But he-- she has barely been punished at all.\" She spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm a little and feel a bit sick but speak up anyways. \"I thi-- it's been a few days and I've already gotten you a boyfriend plu--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs whole-heartily \"As if you can call that geek Norman a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a nice person!\" you yell in return. Megan begins to start up again but Sarah interrupts before she does. \"It's been a few days, he's apologized and he's gotten a boyfriend which he had to kiss wish makes the kissing me thing already taken care of and the few days time being you and having your personality is more than enough to make up for the insults he made. I think he's experienced being you long enough. Just get the remote Megan so we can move on.\" Sarah gives her side of the story which rings completely true to your ears, it's how you thought of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan doesn't seem thrilled but she crouches down under the bed and looks to be rummaging under it for quite awhile before pulling the remote out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do...? Hide it?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cut a small hole in your bed and hid it on the top of the bottom fabric of your bed.\" She responds as she seems to distance herself from both you and Sarah. You can't help but feel that something bad will happen but you feel that if Megan truly has the personality you have now that she might be too afraid to do anything stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now give Martin his body back or at the very least give him his personality back, he's suffered through having yours for long enough.\" Sarah says. </span></div></div>",

M--my vi--\" Sarah stutters as she begins to crawl around for her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, yeah, glasses can be a pain sometimes. I can barely see a thing without them, of course... I can see everything clear as day now that I have <i>your</i> eyes, among other things...\" Megan says as she begins to smother Sarah's body with her new hands but quickly stops as she notices she isn't alone. \"A-anyway, I'll be Sarah Johnson from now on. I'll give you your body back when you've done something interesting with my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou help Sarah with her glasses and help her off the floor. You both watch helplessly and filled with remorse as you watch Sarah's body leave the room. \"I'll see you later, Megan.\" Megan says as she leaves with a snicker. You look at Sarah now in Megan's body and apologize as best you can for getting her involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies won't do me any good you-- you idiot! J-just leave me alone!\" Sarah screams at you which makes you uneasy and nearly run away but you know she is under Megan's influence and acting as she would. \"Heh... you're acting like Megan, Sarah.\" You say softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah--well...not much I can do to--to help with that now.\" She says in her defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now...?\" You ask.</span></div></div>",

H--He-- He dumped me!\" Your mother rubs your shoulders gently in a vain attempt to comfort you but in your fully embraced Megan persona, you shrug her hands off and scream \"Just leave me alone!\" as you dash off to your room. You dive into the pillow and sob continuously, the lingering pain becoming more unbearable with each breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn several minutes the door to your small shelter in this household opens and in walks Sarah and Martin (Megan) who still wears your skin with the utmost of pride. \"So Norman dumped you sis?

Sarah situates herself near the trim of your bed and consoles you slightly. \"Sorry to hear about Norman, Megan.\" She says. You take hold of her name for you and it becomes your focus once again. \"I--I'm not Megan so none of this matters anyway...\" You retort. Sarah's eyes widen a bit and she wears a bizarre smirk and expression as if you had said something totally out there. \"You're not?\" She asks, almost laughing.

You're certainly not Martin anymore.\" Sarah states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no better than Megan, whether it's you in her body or her in her own-- I can't tell the difference, nothing's changed.\" She says in a blunt retort to your sobbing. Your whole body is shaking and in as much of a Megan like fashion as you can muster, you respond in as weak and feeble a way as possible. \"It's hard not to be w--when you two used that remote to make me just like her!\" You whine. Sarah merely shakes her head and Martin sits down next to you. \"That's how I feel, it's only fair. It would be easy for you to change my life if you had your own personality but I need you to do it as me or I'll never be able to do it.\" He explains. Part of you agrees but the other just wishes for this all to return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis but I'm sticking with my word, we're not switching back until you get my life into the direction you think it should be going.\" Martin says, Sarah continues off of his statement. \"Sorry, Martin but if you can't man up while under this burden then... well, I'm sorry but you'll just be Megan for good.\" You tremble more as the circumstance comes full circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Sarah.\" Martin says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Bye Megan, I hope I can call you Martin again someday but if not... well, I'll still be your girlfriend-- just.. a different sort of <i>girl</i>friend.\" Sarah says as they both leave the room, abandoning hope on your pathetic display. You crawl over to the limp mirror laying the bed and hover atop it. You begin to cry more as you look at your reflection-- the reflection of your little sister Megan, the girl you could very well be stuck being the rest of your life. \"I... I don't want to be Megan for good but it's so hard not to be.\" </span></div></div>",

At last the moment of truth comes as Norman positions himself over you, and you spread your legs. You can\u2019t believe the feeling of being penetrated for the first time. You thought you would be disgusted, but instead, it feels wonderful! Except for the brief pain when your hymen broke, it is the most wonderful thing you have felt in your life! You are feeling great pleasure when you suddenly feel Norman pumping his load deep inside of you. You moan in pleasure, but it was too soon for you to actually have an orgasm. All the same, it is done. You have fulfilled Megan\u2019s requirements and lost your/her virginity. But where to go from here?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later in the day, you return home maintaining a somewhat superior disposition the whole way. Hating to admit but already wearing it on your mood, you enjoy the fact that you got to have sex with Norman and complete your task from Megan. The \"deal\" if it could be called that wasn't very official, she nearly said to make the changes that you believe she needed. Majority of these conditions have been met. You've gone out of your own life to get her friends, a boyfriend and in a loose sense fixe up her visage-- even discard her virginity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on the bed of your sister's room which your senses deem 'home' at this point. Thumbs fiddling with themselves and stomach twisting, you find yourself feeling nervous as you begin to figure out how you plan to discuss this \"achievement\" with your body's current owner. The past three months haven't been very social with your family and former friends, your girlfriend: Sarah and your sister (now brother): Megan have been all but close. Taking exception to dinner and other routinely things, you have subconsciously avoided your former sister. However, it is easy to tell that she wanted little to do with you other than tease you in a weekly bases about being <i>her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour primary concern is how Megan adjusted to your body. In the past few months you have found yourself becoming comfortable with Megan's body and life, so much so you even have a small bit of trouble remembering old feelings. Undeniably, you fear Megan will refuse to change back as you know she didn't entirely enjoy her former life and how she is enjoying yours is out of your knowledge. With the remote long since gone from your grasp, you have no way of forcing it on her. On days where you have been angry, you remember searching for it but Megan has clearly hidden it where your hands can't reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale deeply and release as you stand off your bed. \"I guess I better get this over with.\" You say to yourself. You walk to the hallway and towards your brother's room, pausing briefly before knocking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Is the response from the clacks of wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Megan.\" You answer, taking another deep breath as he tells you to come in. You open and close the door behind you, locking yourself into this long awaited circumstance. You see that Megan has a Manga in her hand, old hobbies still pursuing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around the room as if you could find the right words to say in the ambiance. No matter how many sentences you create in your head, nothing seems to work and eventually you just blurt out everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I had sex with Norman...\" Megan seems a bit shocked already but you continue. \"I improved your image, I've gotten a lot more friends, boy friends too and I got you a lot more clothing -- a--and umm... I completed your deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown carpet seems out of place as you notice you couldn't maintain eye contact. You shift your head upwards at Megan who seems a bit... you're not sure how to describe it. \"S-so.. c-can I have my body back?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

The whole world seems to come to stop as the words you have wanted to hear for a long time are said. \"Rea--Really!?\" You shout, bypassing your soft-spoken limitations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. Come here.\" She says as she wraps an arm around you, seemingly to guide you. She brings you back down the hall to your own room. '<i>She hid it in my ow-- her own room?

Megan shrugs and points behind you. \"What do we need the remote for? Your body is right there.\" She says with assurance. Disliking where this is heading, you turn your head to your reflection from the mirror on the wall. \"That's just a mirror...\" You reply. Her reflection gets behind yours and plants both hands on your shoulder. \"Course, just showing you your body, <i>Megan</i>. You're Megan, you are, were and will be--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is not m--\" She continues speaking with a more sinister tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"as far as I am concerned and I... I am Martin. I like this body and this life. I felt a bit bad but clearly you have adjusted to being a girl and Megan quite well. So let's make this change permanent, O.K. Sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake her hands off you and turn around with eyes as dark as a midnight raven. \"I am <b>not</b> your sister, I'm your brother. You've been acting strange since you first did this and you know, you're still the same. Your life has changed but you haven't at all. You're running away from your life just like you were running from society before, hiding in your room.\" Your sharp tongue seemed to piercing Megan as she began to turn angry instead of nonchalant about the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I don't need anyone telling me how to live my lif--\" She begins but you cut her off as your mind is focused for once on what you wish to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that all you want but it's not true. You want someone to tell you how to live it, that's why you put me in your body. I proved you wrong, I have friends-- I as Megan have friends, a boyfriend and am no longer a virgin. You, both as Martin and Megan have none of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B--be quiet! I have friends, I have Sarah an--\" Megan seems to be unraveled in her guilty pleasure of being someone else as her own self-conscious becomes usable once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah isn't always going to be here for you and you know you're not satisfied being this way at al-- You know what? It's been 3 months, summer is almost over and in a couple more weeks we'll have to go back to school. Do you really think you'll be any better off as me at school? You don't know how to be a guy or me, you'll fall apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see tears in her eyes but before you can witness anymore, a loud snap rings your ears, your cheek begins to burn and before you know it you are lying on the ground; she slapped you, hard. \"Shut up...just..\" She whispers. You hear footsteps but your vision is blurred with your glasses removed. You rummage around on the floor, almost in tears from the pain on your cheek and shock. You put your glasses back on and begin fixing your hair before turning around to see Megan who is opening a... Anime DvD?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you see the remote inside the casing, the sides are dug out so it could fit. \"Y-you hid it in here?\" You question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan in tears, points the remote at you.

Megan jumps and almost drops the remote as she looks in dismay at her mother's entrance. Helen however, is wearing a scowl and already trying to interpret the situation by the expressions on our faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing up here!? I hear a lot of yelling com--\" She pauses for a moment as she examines Megan. \"--Martin are you crying? Megan, your face is red. What are you two doing? Answer me.\" She demands as she assesses the situation, lacking any correct information on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-umm..\" You and Megan stutter as to come up with a response. Wearing the same personality as Megan is still nothing but trouble as you know you could come up with a great excuse for this if you were normal. She walks into the room more and confronts Megan or who she assumes is Martin. \"Are you two fighting over this?\" Helen asks as she tries to obtain the remote but Megan turns her body away and shelters the remote. \"NO!\" She screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it here young man unless you want to be grounded for a few months.\" Helen says in a voice you have heard many times before. Along with the request, she also begins to grab the remote, this time gaining a grip on it. In only a moment you see your mother and sister fighting over the remote which only leads you to assume something unorthodox is about to occur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote is doing anything but pointing in one direction and with four hands grappling it you are sure some sort of mishap is going to happen. You can only pray that it won't be directed at you but alas your thoughts are interrupted as you feel something being ripped from your hands. You stumble forward from the force and nearly fall into your own body whom you see only for a moment but she quickly runs out of the room. Your eyes stop following your original body as they lay on your sister's body, that you have been trapped in until now. She is looking at you in utter shock and you can't blame her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and bring a hand to your head and straighten your dull blonde hair which now lays at about your neck in length. It is at this moment that you realize that you must be in mom's body. You take a moment to examine yourself, finding your chest slightly bigger than you are accustomed and your height being restored within an inch of what it used to be. Within that height, you're wearing a green pin-tucked blouse and a knee-length layered skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to your previous body who just looks up at you in dismantled shock. \"I-I guess I have some explaining to do.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on? Why are yo-- am I over there?\" She questions. You scratch your head on where to begin and decide that a mirror would be the easiest way to start. You grab the mirror from the desk and hand it to your mother who now occupies her daughter's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what happened.\" You say as she looks into the mirror but instantly drops it to the floor as her vastly different image overtakes her. \"This is... no way.\" Is all she says before she is on her knees, gazing into the mirror again. Grasping her less gentle dull blonde hair which is now in similar length to her own as Lisa helped you with your hair, cutting off most of it to relieve the mess that Megan's hair obtains after becoming a certain length. Grasping her face and massaging it with a gentle palm she asks \"I'm in Megan's body? Then that means you're Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fold your skirt under your legs as you sit down with a dampened smile. \"Not quite. Feel like listening to a long story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it can explain this then by all means.\" She answers while pushing her new frames back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and try your best to explain everything that has happened to the best of your ability. You tell her how after your prank with your sister that you were pushed into Megan's body, her personality and whole life; That you have been Megan for the passed 3 months, how Megan treated you while you were in her body and the things you went through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how it's been.\" You say. She seems over stimulated by the long response but finds herself understanding enough to reply. \"That certainly is hard to believe. A remote that can change bodies, personalities and more. So you're Martin then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Yes, though it is difficult to tell nowadays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking back on it, Martin-- Megan I suppose was acting strange for awhile. I didn't think something like <i>this</i> was the cause though. I can't believe Megan put you through all that but besides that, Martin, how long have you had this thing and what kind of things have you done to us?\" She raves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up off your sore legs and give a response \"I told you, I didn't get a chance to really mess with anyone or anything before I was thrown into Megan's life and forced to stay this way. Today is the day I decided to ask for my body back and this is the result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up along with you and stretches a bit from the strain of sitting so awkwardly for so long. \"Megan really dislikes herself but anyways, why did we switch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the edge of the bed, your hands succumbing to unwanted stress as they flinch about. \"While you were struggling you must of hit the red button, now I'm in your body and you're in Megan's and the real Megan ran off with my body and the remote. It's not a very delightful situation.\" you answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I think we should tell your fath--\" She begins but you cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think that is a bad idea. Megan isn't in a very good mood right now and if she gets a bunch of people chasing her, she might well... umm... good chance she'll use the remote in some way. I think it's best if we keep this to ourselves and not warrant even more displacement in our family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well...\"</span></div></div>",

Still, you can live her life, I could use a break from the stress of improving someone else's life but once I get Megan to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, if you get Megan to return you to normal, that's fine. I have no intention of making my son live my life.

I am thinking that confronting Sarah would be best but I am certain that Megan is already going to Sarah's to hide. It's late, I may just put this off until tomorrow. Letting her cool off might not be a bad idea either. In-fact, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm tired as well. I guess we're in my temporary room now so goodnight <i>mom</i>.\" She laughs as she closes the mirror and jumps to her feet. You notice how much more perky your mother is at the moment and feel that she could very well be enjoying this. Currently, you could careless if she is or isn't as she is in a body you don't want to return to anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the room without a comment on her rude emphasize and head towards your parents' room. The light is off and your father is already fast asleep. Despite being uneasy about sleeping next to your father, you quickly change into a nightgown and head to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up the next day and find being in your mother's room a rude awakening. The events from before are real is your first thought as you climb out of bed. Rubbing the sharp pain in your back, you head over to your mother's dresser where you pick out some clothes that will suit you; a white tank top with a denim blazer along with a pair of tight jeans. You carry them to the bathroom and strip of your nightgown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been awhile since I've seen mom naked. Ha..ha..\" You say, disliking how disturbing it sounds. Still, you can't help but notice how much different your mother's body is from Megan's. \"I--It may just be Megan's personality but mom looks... really pretty.\" Her body is toned and though she has a few wrinkles on her face, her overall figure is superior to Megan's in most ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shower done, you head downstairs for the first time as your mother. You run your hands through your hair, finding it much softer than Megan's, it was smooth and felt good on your fingers and on your cheeks. You enter the kitchen to find your mother cooking breakfast in Megan's body. As soon as your heeled boots hit the tiled floor, she turns around. \"Oh, hi mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being completely aware of what is going on, seeing Megan's body call you mom gives you a eerie shiver. \"M-Morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also notice Jessica sitting at the table, batting her legs against the chair in impatience. \"Mommy, why is Megan making me breakfast? I want you to.\" She whines. Again you feel bizarre being called mom but reply without much hesitation. \"Umm, Mommy overslept and it's nice to have your sister make breakfast sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want you to make it!\" She cries out, filling out her personality flawlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll taste just like Mommy makes, I promise.\" You say which seems to be enough to quiet her down. You feel awkward already but at the very least you no longer have to deal with Megan's life-- just your mother's. You gaze at Helen, finding it weird to see Megan from the 3rd person. After all, for 3 months that has been your appearance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get breakfast out of the way and Helen agrees to watch the house today so you can go out as her to confront Megan who still didn't return home.

Your only clear notion is that Megan has been acting different but from her reaction to last night's quarrel, you can tell she is still herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the mall is swift and easy as you find having a car and driver's license of your own a handy part of being your mother. You wander through the mall for quite awhile, keeping your pace on the main hallways and merely glancing into each store or restaurant but find little sign of Megan or Sarah. With little more to check you sit down at one of the benches in the middle of the mall and sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only thing I have seen today are a few men checking me out.\" You whisper but find the aspect of men enjoying your presentation awkward and begin to blush. You look yourself over and wonder if maybe you shouldn't have worn such tight clothing. As you pick up your purse and are about to leave you catch a glimpse of Sarah and Megan out of the corner of your eye. The pressure in your stomach builds as you walk over to them. Mindlessly lost in chat, they don't notice you until you are right in their faces. Megan seems startled but replies \"Oh umm, H-hey umm... mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch a bit as she calls you mom but realize that Megan isn't aware what swap function was used on you. Having not prepared any dialogue, you hesitate and go along with being your own mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. I'm not sure why but your sister has been in hysterics and told me to come get you. I'm not sure what's wrong with her so could you come home and figure out what is bothering her? She won't tell me a thing as always but she sure was acting strange, did something happen?\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stare at you for a moment until they pass glances at each other and laugh. \"Y-yeah, I'll be home in a bit mom, Sarah and I are almost done here.\" Is all they say before walking passed you and into the nearest store, giggling away. Once out of sight you pursue them a bit and try to eavesdrop on them. In the store you find no trace of them but hear a few whispers as you head towards one of the changing rooms. You quietly go into the room next to theirs and listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--n't believe that. Mom must of hit the blue button and now Martin thinks he is mom, how perfect, serves him right.\" Megan says with a detestable spunk in her voice. You hear Sarah laugh in response. \"Yeah, he deserves it after what he did to you last night. I can't believe he said such terrible things about your life and personality and even slapped you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I even offered to switch him back but he shouted that he didn't trust me but I still tried but mom came in before I could.\" Megan says. You are in shock and with Megan's personality leading your emotion's you almost begin to cry. '<i>Megan twisted the events that happened last night and told it to Sarah. I can't believe her!</i>' you yell in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued by the awful lies thus far you continue listening with inflated ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he deserves another 3 months in your body if he is going to be like that.\" Sarah lays her opinion on the matter using only her twisted lies as facts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 3 months as Mom now, body, personality and memory.\" Megan says. You begin to hear some rustling as they appear to be leaving. You curl up your body so it isn't shown above or below the small door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of that, how are you going to handle your mother? She is in your body now, right?\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm not <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">sure how I'</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">ll handle that...</font>\" is the last bit you can hear before their voices are too far away to make out.

All three of them glare at you as you enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems you're not really brainwashed into being mom.\" Megan states. Sarah walks towards you and glares at you for a moment before turning a brief head towards Helen. \"Sorry about this Mrs. Remy.\" She says before turning her head back around and slapping you in the face. You recovery fairly quickly but are still stunned-- an expression that wears itself quite visibly on your face. \"I can't believe how you treated Megan! Calling her life and body disgusting and even slapping her even after she offered to swap back with you, how could you?\" Sarah raves at you but nothing but utter disgust writes itself on your face. \"What!? That's not true, Megan has been telling you lies. She slapped <i>me</i> first of all and I am the one who asked her to switch me back but she refused. Mom can attest to this, I told her everything!\" You explain. </span></div></div>",

Both Sarah and mom look uncertain and eye each other carefully in thought. Megan however seems quite disliking of their second thoughts and continues to warp their sense of justice more. \"Come on, it's been a few months. I've kind of adjusted to being Martin and Martin has adjusted to being me despite not wanting to be me. You didn't even know we were like this until just now mom.\" She clarifies, for once providing actual details despite your loathing of being adjusted to being Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's true...\" Your mom confirms bluntly as she shuffles her hair and glasses. Megan now turns her head to Sarah who still seems uncertain. \"And Sarah, you can't tell me you still want to go out with Martin after all this can you?\" She asks. You only continue to cry as Sarah confirms that she indeed has no intentions of going out with you ever again. You can only hate yourself for despite how hard for these past three months you tried to suppress Megan's emotions that they are now so easily fully out of your control and once again taking manipulation over your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can still be friends with Martin, he'll just be you know... Megan.\" Megan says and Sarah merely nods lightly along with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I want both my kids to be happy.\" Mom affirms. You wish to speak up about how you'll never be happy about being this way but refrain from it as you know it would only irritate the situation even more and further prove Megan's point that her life isn't very alluring. Megan gently presses both her hands together with a smile of assurance as she speaks. \"Don't worry mom. Martin-- rather Megan and I will be just fine this way. She'll learn how to respect others' difficulties as well. This experience will be good for her development for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I only noticed slight changes before I realized about the remote. I guess it's alright then.\" Your mother agrees finally which only causes you to cry out once more in a breaking voice. \"B--but mom!\" She only glances at you briefly, looking a bit ill-- though you believe it's more because she is seeing her own body crying shamefully on the floor rather than the fact her son is upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pulls out the remote from her purse and hands it to your mother who grabs it quite enthusiastically. No sooner is it in her grasp is it pointed at you. You can barely see through the blur inducing tears that pile upon your eyes but your vision clears from a pair of glasses as you find yourself now risen from the ground, standing with your arms raised outward as if just a moment ago you were holding something. The sudden relief from the emotions you gathered into your mother's body is enough to allow you to formulate some sort of objection to this before the emotions settle themselves into your new body. \"You can't do this! I-- I'm not the real Megan!\" You shout, an eye twitching from the squeaky voice you only recently got the luxury of not hearing from first-person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother climbs to her feet, scraping away the tears from her eyes. \"Sorry sweetie but I think this is a good change for both of you.\" She states. Megan and Sarah soon join her on the other side of the room near the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll leave you alone for a little bit.\" Mom says as they all begin to leave until Sarah brings up an overlooked section of the punishment. \"Hey. Since he can't return to normal now, shouldn't you give him his personality back?\" She brings to the attention of your mother and Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this personality suits her better.\" Megan states quickly while your mother looks absentmindedly at you and Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot you made such a change to him. I suppose it was kind of silly of me to not notice what with how he has been acting. I agree with Sarah, forcing a change in how he thinks isn't a good thing considering he needs to learn for himself now, not from your thoughts Megan.\" She explains to the audience before winding the remote upwards once more. The tears in your eyes still continue to exhale from your eyes but the scared and frightened emotions that have been enveloping you for so long fade to a dim light, a more vivid burn arising in your anger and frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything she is saying is a fucking lie! She just wants to get out of her own life! All this started with some stupid joke and she continues to place me off as some terrible person.\" You shout out in a passionate voice that you could never make with Megan's mindset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough young ma-- No. The punishment is decided so that would be young <i>lady</i>!\" Your mother demands for your silence but you do not comply by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is twisting all the events so much. I worked my butt off to make her life better. I did a lot of things I never would of done and it was hard as hell with Megan's emotions being so... hard to deal with. I want some credit-- not punishment! Especially sentencing me to being my own sister for life!\" You scream out as you position yourself closer to them. They all remain under Megan's persuasion which only infuriates you and causes you to leap for a grab at the remote. Megan positions herself in front of mom quickly and without much time to retaliate at all you are slammed to the floor with your arm clasped behind your back. \"Ow!\" You yelp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" Your mother and Sarah both shout. You struggle to get free from Megan's clutches but can't even cause her to budge off of you even a bit. \"Did you forget you're a small unfit little girl?\" Megan whispers into your ear leaving a infuriating sense of superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what?\" Megan says as if restraining you was no big deal at all. \"She's just a filthy liar...\" You struggle to say under the weight of your own body sitting on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is definitely a good thing for you.\" Your mother responds with folded arms. The weight finally leaves as Megan steps off of you. You cradle your arm in your hand and weakly get to your feet, a clear-cut scowl of detest on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's leave him alone.\" Sarah suggests. They all agree and leave the room, closing the door quietly behind them. </span></div></div>",

You cannot believe your gir--former girlfriend is in your mother's body, it's easily a creepy yet disgusting thing to adjust to. \"Why-- why are you in my mom's body?\" You ask, a question she seemed to have been waiting for as the long grin begins to explain itself. \"I knew you'd do something like this so I swapped with your mother last night before <i>'I left.'</i> I'm a light sleeper so I woke up the moment you opened the dresser drawer. I was going to stop you then but I found it fun to watch you.\" She elaborates, the correct foresight granting her endless pleasure. \"If you know me so well then why don't you believe me?\" You ask with a furious glare, dead on her eyes and unshifting. Her eyes roll and her shoulders slump, accompanying a brief sigh. \"You're already Megan permanently, if you go back to your room right now I promise I won't tell your mother or Martin. So if you want to keep your personality, I suggest you go back to your room.\" She suggests but it does little to persuade you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, unamused by her attempt to avoid the question. \"Listen, you've seen how she's made fun of me since this change.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing well that Megan wouldn't let the remote out of her grasp now that you've been returned to your own mentality, you opt to enter into your old room. You open the door cautiously, peering in to see Megan sprawled on the bed with little to no covers over her body. She has always been a rather heavy sleeper, a fact you pray holds true as you creep into the room. Your eyes pass over everything of interesting, taking note that she really hasn't changed much of your room during these months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start with the dresser, bare of much clothing as Megan merely leaves her clothes in a pile in the closet. The vacancy of the dresser proves it to be a poor hiding spot so you instead bury yourself in the aforementioned clothing but find nothing hidden beneath. Already on your knees, you dip your head underneath the bed but find the lack of lighting too much of a nuisance. You scratch your head with uncertainty, wondering just how many other places you can search without awakening the person you would most love to punch. You know it has to be in here and after taking a moment to stare with great disgust at the sleeping boy, you can't help but notice something sticking out from beneath her pillow. It's too dark to make a call but you have to assume it's the remote. \"Megan must have been too busy to come up with a good hiding spot.\" You whisper softly as you inch your head around the pillow but grasp no idea on how you could possibly get it out from under her without waking her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two of contemplating you decide to just grab at it and hope for the best. You take a deep breath, with it riding your hopes and your last chance to fix things as you know screwing up now will mean returning to Megan's horrid personality; which means losing your nerves to do such things again. As the air expels from your chest, you lunge your hand beneath her pillow. Instantly Megan's eyes flare open and after only a brief second of confusion, settle into rage. \"Hey!\" She calls out as you pull out the remote but while you try and press a button-- any button, Megan grabs your other hand before you can. Her strength is far too overwhelming and in a last ounce of effort before she pulls the remote from your other hand you press a button with your thumb. Immediately the ground beneath you seems to fall but as you look down to access, you realize that your foot is going straight through the floor and not only that, your body is loosely transparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I hit the ghost button.\" You conclude as you look over yourself, a bit impressed by the ability that you never got to even test before Megan stole the remote from you. You then begin to notice that you're becoming increasingly transparent-- in-fact, your vision is becoming increasingly blurry! You look about but are unable to decipher much of anything but dive in one direction and upon doing so are reimbursed with the ability to see and your former transparency. You take notice of Megan who is now looking out the doorway to the room, eying the halls of the house with confusion. \"Where is she?\" She asks in a confused whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing your advantage, you try to press into her in order to possess her but instead touch her as though she is solid. Her response is not that of a twitch or flinch, as it would appear she cannot feel your touch and for reasons you find more understanding as you try desperately to move even the slightest bit of her body but find not even the ability to move a fold of her cloth as though it were made of steel. It's then you notice her hand which still holds the remote, something you're positive you should still be possession of if you are using ghost mode. You float there confused but as Megan walks away from you, the same feelings occur once again. \"What is going on? When she walks away I... I feel like I'm disappearing.\" You cry out but even as you think deeply about becoming solid again you find no release from this current state. Moreover, you find yourself becoming rather frightened that perhaps you've uncovered a glitch with this remote that's going to leave you stuck this way for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head of this though, reasoning that it's too soon to conclude such a thing. Still, the sensation you feel whenever you leave Megan's side or seemingly the remote's side is unreal and very ominous. You're sure the device said you could possess people like this and yet you cannot even phase through Megan at all. \"Maybe there is a method to it or something but I don't see any way to do it.\" You ponder with an increasingly alarmed tone, one unheard by Megan who still continues to look quietly for you through the loosely lit house. \"Maybe the remote protects Megan from being possessed or something.\" You reason, fueling a conclusion that you should try and possess someone else even if it means temporarily leaving the safety of the remote's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megan heads back upstairs, her pace increasing with her concern, the moment she passes by ______'s room you phase through their door to possess them...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment Megan passes by Jenna's door you phase through it as though you were going to ram it through. Your vision begins to fade rapidly as the remote leaves your side but through the blur you see Jenna's sleeping frame and in hopes of getting out of this state and praying that possessing really doesn't require any sort of technique, you fly towards and thankfully into her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes sometime later and after a few moments of relaxing in what was seemingly a nice rest, the recollection of your actions from last night spring into focus. You raise from the bed and do indeed find yourself in Jenna's room and no doubt on her bed. Before even looking down at yourself you can attest to the differences that you feel, quite drastically different. An eager smile crosses your face as you proceed to look down at yourself. A brown nightgown wraps around your torso, the strings on it beginning at a point of interest as you take note of the larger breasts at your chest. They are by no means big but certainly better than Megan's premature ones. It seems so strange to look down and see Jenna's body, her tan arms pressing against the bed to support your position while her long brown hair both frames your face and presses against your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a moment briefing yourself with the improved features before climbing off of the bed to an impressive height. Immediately you feel sensational in comparison to how being Megan felt. You're even taller than you are as a man and as you clench your fist and arm, you can tell your strength is returned to a close point to what it used to be. Though you only barely match Jenna's upper body strength as a boy, her legs and stamina are far superior to your own; a trait very noticeable as you have never felt so light on your feet before. \"I should work out more, this feels great.\" You say, surprised at the tone of it as it escapes your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to continue to dabble into the simplicity of analyzing Jenna's body but instead decide that you need to figure out just what the hell happened. You walk out of her room, the early morning sun rising through the windows of your home. You have no destination in mind but as you hear whispering or perhaps better described as soft talking downstairs you take yourself to it. \"What do we do, Mom?\" You hear Megan say as you near the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep looking for him. He can't have just van--\" Your mother ceases to finish her response as you walk into her sight. \"Ah, m--morning Jenna.\" She says in-place of her previous words. Megan follows her example as well. \"Morning.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's clear that they are talking about you as it would seem they still have no evidence on where it is you have gone. It's also quite clear that they think you're the real Jenna, an advantage you're not quite ready to give up yet. \"You two are up early.\" You comment as you walk passed them towards the fridge, feigning your disinterest quite well. As you pull out the orange juice and begin pouring a glass, you watch the two stumble over each other, perhaps confused on how to get rid of you. \"I had trouble sleeping is all.\" Says Megan with an awkward chuckle. As you quietly stand there and drink your orange juice with a look of common place, your mother and Megan continue to pass glances at each other. They soon leave without a word, the footsteps leading most assuredly upstairs towards your old room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish up and head upstairs, pondering how to proceed in a way that will benefit you. You could try to tell them that you're really Martin-- hell, the only way for you to get out of Jenna's body right now is to use the remote. In a way they would be forced to give it to you. On the other hand, you're quite enjoying the feeling of being Jenna and while you feel a bit bad about more or less removing the real Jenna from existence for the time being, it couldn't hurt to stay as her for a few days. </span></div></div>",

They cease their conversation immediately, your mother greeting you with a cold stare. \"Jenna, we're in the middle of something. If you need to talk, we can later.\" She says but you walk into the room anyway, sealing off the room as you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for the real Martin still?\" You ask with a raising brow and a jesting smile. \"I told you he hit the ghost button!\" Megan exclaims after piecing things together in her head. Your mother's shock wears thin and soon she turns to you with the same stare. \"Megan, get out of Jenna right this instant.\" She demands but you shake your head with a shrug. \"First off, that's not my name; I'm Martin. Second, I can't leave her body without the remote, afterall, it's supposed to come with me when ghost mode is used but it didn't.\" You explain to them, broadening a very defensive stance by Megan who protests your hinting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way you're getting the remote!\" She shouts, her hands cupping around her back pocket, surely that's where the remote is. \"You can't be trusted with it.\" Your mother adds, securing herself as your enemy once again. You let out a long sigh before shrugging your shoulders yet again. \"Well, that's up to you. I guess I'm O.K. with being Jenna from now on but it's on your head that the real Jenna is gone for good.\" You pressure your mother, dousing her with guilt which seems to build up as a uneasy expression illuminates on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be some way to get him out of there without giving him the remote, right?\" Your mother pleads for an answer from Megan but she comes to a similar conclusion. \"I can't. He has to press the button. I can use the reset button though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use that then.\" Your mother suggests but fearing what could come of such a thing, you deny such an action even if it would 'temporarily' put you back to normal. \"Problem with that is everyone but the holder of the remote loses their memories of being switched. That means Megan can do whatever she wants to us afterward and we won't be the wiser.

You always insulted Megan's life over and over and--\" As she starts to respond, you force a rebuttal before she even begins... \"<i>I</i> made fun of <i>her</i>!? Were you not there?

She even insulted Norman, saying stuff like 'You're going on a date with that geek, is that the best you can do?' and other crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, Norman is a geek.\" Sarah admits, showing a cold part of herself you were not aware of.

If Megan herself managed to go out with Norman I would have applauded her-- still, despite all of her negative comments, I still improved her life in so many ways while she has done nothing herself.\" You continue to explain the situation, leaving Sarah only in a blank stare; lacking in comments or any form of argument.

You raise the remote once more, an action that actually breaks her white stare.

I'll let you be Megan for awhile.\" You explain to her, a great deal of fright passing by her face. \"I-- Please, Martin-- Sw--sweetie, I promise I'll believe you so please just change me back.\" She pleads in the same pathetic way that you did when you got endowed with Megan's horrid personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back away, running you fingers through your bedhead before placing a hand at your generous hip. \"Now then, Megan. Run on home and tell your mother and brother that they can expect some changes in the near future.\" You tell her and while she appears to want to object, her fuel fails to burn the fire within her and so she backs out of your temporary room.

You open the door and say with a smile... \"Afternoon, Mrs.Remy.\" She looks you up and down before blurting out a message you can very easily answer. \"You're Martin, right?\" She asks, perhaps unsure if you may have switched out of Sarah's body by now. \"Oh? You're willing to call me Martin now but I thought I was <i>Megan</i> to you now?\" You say with a smug bit of sarcasm and a bit of superiority. She ignores it entirely however, blowing it aside with a soft exhale as if your words were built of feathers. \"Where is the remote?\" She asks rather suddenly. In a way you're surprised because in someway it seems as though she is confident in that you'll give it to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far out of your reach.\" You respond, calmly shifting your weight to another leg with a hand wrapping loosely around your stomach. \"Listen, I am your mother and you will give it to me this instant!\" Commands the mother with a stern stare, one which prior to obtaining such a remote would make your cringe. \"Again, it's far out of your reach.\" You restate but it doesn't deter her, rather it seems to motivate her as she pushes you aside and enters your current home without your permission. \"Hey!\" You holler but she ignores you completely and instead begins to search for the remote. \"I can call the cops on you for this you know...\" You state but the threat falls on deaf ears as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to find it and more over, why the hell do you care so much? Megan is still happily in my body and you're still yourself. The only person who is in a body they don't like is Sarah and I doubt you're doing this for her.\" You ask, something which finally gathers her attention. \"I don't like living knowing someone can change me in anyway!\" She states, a sensible response at the very least. It doesn't change the fact that you're not pleased by her intrusion so you decide to...</span></div></div>",

In order to frighten her you pick up the phone and pretend to dial 911, an action which already catches her attention. \"Yeah, hi. Listen, I got this woman in my house who refuses to leave. She's not hostile or anything but-- oh, there we go. Just calling you is frightening her off. Thanks anyways.\" You say into the unconnected phone as you monitor your mother's actions until she closes the front door with her on the other side. You walk over to the window and watch her sully back over to her car with a rain cloud over her head. \"You're going to regret this!\" She yells before slamming the door of her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a small way you feel bad but your true emotions are as clear as the grin on your face. You could have never managed that your mother would sweat nearly this much by having such a power over her. It's a sweet revenge that doesn't even require the actual usage of the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with the results of your waiting so far, you retrieve the remote from your playful hiding place inside one of Sarah's stuffed animals. You look upon it for a few minutes, at first with pleasure but soon dissatisfaction sets in. \"It really irritates me that both my mother and Sarah are against me.\" You say as you think about just how Megan could have distorted what's been going on to convince Sarah so fully. You begin to wonder if knowing the truth without any doubt would change Sarah's opinion and though you know you can never put that sort of proof inside Sarah's head, you can use the remote to make your way of thinking just like hers. Problem is, doing so could leave you unwanting to return to your normal personality or doing things you wouldn't have before.

Not to mention that after having Megan's personality for over three months you have come to notice quite a few changes in yourself. Which while not an awful thing, is definitely something to consider in the long run. \"She would probably believe me at this point anyways...\" You say as you place the remote back inside your fluffy friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the hassle of your mother gone and your desire to keep Sarah in Megan's shoes for awhile longer, you continue to burn your days away as Sarah. It's enjoyable being a woman of a desirable status, no longer walking around with darting eyes that question everyone's thoughts as you pass by them. Among that it's nice to regroup with your former set of friends before you became forced to generate new ones as Megan-- though, you are quite sure a few of your friends actually have a thing for you or Sarah specifically. Of course, you could just be citing words for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the two weeks time you decide to call up the real Sarah to see how she has been doing. \"Hello?\" You hear her ask, a drowsy lisp in her voice. \"Hi Megan, it's Sarah.\" You respond as if all is in the norm, utilizing the same cruel behavior they toyed with on you. Her tone instantly lowers, her interest aroused by her hatred... \"What do <i>you</i> want?\" She queries, the exhaustion in her voice evaporated by your stress-inducing call. \"Nothing much, I was just wondering if you wanted to go out to breakfast with me?\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to go out with you?\" She spits back, an expected arrangement of words at the very least. \"Because if you don't-- well, let's just say you may want to get used to wearing those glasses.\" You threaten, leaving nothing but a clean minute of silence until she finally speaks up, sounding as though she just stopped crying... \"W--When?\" She asks after a loud sniff. \"I'll come pick you up right now.\" You declare, garnering a farewell which pushes it's disdain into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at your former home, finding Sarah standing diligently on the front lawn, dressed in a uninspired set of jeans and a white T-shirt. \"Come on now, I got so many better looking clothes for you to wear, Megan. Why dress like your oldself?\" You tease as she climbs inside the car, her gaze shifting between anger and embarrassment. The discomfort you place into her makes you grin a bit and pass a hand through your dark hair with satisfaction. \"Come on now Megan, this is supposed to be a friendly visit.\" You assure her, a bit hypocritical as you do plan on teasing her quite a bit more. \"Yeah right...\" She mumbles softly, looking out of the window at the beautiful rising sun which glimmers off the window's edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the window you can see your mother and Megan staring at you, their expressions masked by distance and thick purple curtains. Rest assured you know they're angry but in an act which may only anger them more you wave to them wearing a gentle smile before driving off. Sarah remains silent but you notice her diligent eyes which search the car as well as the pockets of your clothing. \"It's in my left pocket but unless you want to risk crashing the car, I suggest you don't try for it.\" You state. She veers away from you as if she was guilty of no such thing but it only leaves you with a sly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seating yourselves at a well distance from anyone else and ordering some food you decide to crack open the shy capsule which surrounds your former girlfriend. \"Now then, how's being Megan been for you? I'm really curious.\" You ask as you weigh your head down on your standing arms. Her eyes thin to an angry glare of frustration-- though her line of sight still remains away from your own. \"Be honest too.\" You add with a small chuckle. You can see the thoughts forming in her head, desperately trying to come out in a provocative way but unable as Megan's shyness prevents it. \"Fine...\" She submits softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate it. I hate-- I hate caring so much about everything. E--even now I...\" The words carry out of her mouth as a disorderly mess, soft and weak to the ear. \"It's annoying, eh? You want to look good so when everyone around you looks at you they enjoy it, yet you know you can never look that good and it makes you feel awful. You want to shout at the tops of your lungs but you don't want to draw attention to yourself; fearing embarrassment. Yeah, that's being Megan alright.\" You say, your words leaving Sarah only nodding in agreement yet still infuriated by you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what Megan wants to hear, I think.\" She says, a strange statement you're not quite positive that you make sense of. \"What do you mean?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is, you were saying things to Megan like... 'Oh, your life isn't so bad and I did this and I did that' but... e--even if you enjoyed her life a tiny bit, you hate it just like she did. I think she wanted to see you fail and say that you hate being her and that her life sucks. And... yeah...\" She deduces, perhaps a way of thinking brought on by Megan's personality or perhaps by the real Sarah. Regardless, it does leave you thinking if Megan really is upset with you for that reason. Sure you got her a boyfriend and felt happy sometimes but for the most part you really were miserable even after getting her life a bit more in order. However, you know it's awful and near unforgivably cruel of Megan to wish for your failure and to force you into her life for good. Still...</span></div></div>",

You follow Sarah into the home with a thumb planted gently over the ghost mode button in-case of any attempts at the device. Your mother and sister cease their descent down the stairs as you walk within their view. \u201cHeya.\u201d You say plainly.

You take them into the living room where you tell them to sit or stand far apart from each other; a safety precaution as you will most definitely be swapping from body to body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you going to do?\u201d Megan asks, her lip quivering from the unknown. \u201cI\u2019m not sure but first things first.\u201d You answer with a shrug as you lift up the remote to swap with Megan to return yourself to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel immensely strange as you look down at yourself, the contortions of your body so different from what you have become accustomed.

You even find yourself blushing as you feel the shifting in your pants, actually embarrassed to own such a thing. Being Megan for so long has made such an attachment quite the foreign idea. You\u2019re not sure how you feel about this, are you relieved to be a man and yourself again or are you uncomfortable? Maybe you would prefer to stay as a girl\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stand from your chair, darting a finger towards Megan who looks up within the gap of her tears. \u201cI was willing to help Megan from the get-go but then she rudely tossed me into her life and later deemed it permanent without my consent yet somehow turning her back to normal is a cruel act? The amount of lies she has divulged into both of you must be enormous.

None of them speak up, not even Megan and as what you said continues to settle into them you turn to Megan with the remote at point and say\u2026 \u201cSorry but no matter how much you want to run away from it, you\u2019re Megan; a shy, bland looking girl whose only amount of superiority to others will come from her mind.\u201d You end your statement with the press of a button. Your eyes are blurred by tears and you can feel the initial burn in your stomach but both symptoms fade away as you take control of Sarah\u2019s body once again. Meanwhile, Megan imbues her old body with the emotions that you so swiftly removed. She cups her hands to her face with a might that almost smashes her glasses, an apparel she may no longer be used to wearing. \u201cN--none of you will ever understand!\u201d She declares before running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you feel good about yourself.\u201d Your mother airs, shaking her head at you with disappointment. You can\u2019t say you feel as bad as you could have, prior to this whole incident you would have been dashing upstairs to help console her. Now however, after seeing how easily she would put her troubles onto someone else, your feet make no motions towards her room. \u201cSorry but I don\u2019t. I feel bad\u2026\u201d You begin, shaking your head with a long sigh. \u201cBut not nearly as much as I used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bold statement leaves the room empty of conversation until your mother asks an obvious concern. \u201cSo, I agreed with Megan. I assume you plan on being an idiot and doing something to me as well?\u201d The shrug that proceeds her concern leaves her scowling at you, demanding an answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know, probably not.\u201d You say, a brief bout of relief coming over her. \u201cGood, you better not. Now then, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to go make sure my little girl doesn\u2019t flood her room with tears.\u201d She announces moments before leaving the room, the tone of her voice an attempt to make you feel guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a long sigh yet again and fold your legs one above the other. \u201cW--what about me?\u201d Sarah asks as she seats herself a little bit closer to you, her gaze a bit less strenuous than before. Perhaps she is relieved to be in a \u2018<i>better</i>\u2019 body or maybe she really enjoys it or maybe she agrees with you swapping Megan back now. Regardless, you answer her question with your unwavering intention. \u201cI\u2019m keeping you that way, I don\u2019t really want to be a guy anymore, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026?

I\u2019m going to swap with Jenna in a bit.\u201d You specify, the idea sprouting quite the rise in her. \u201cJenna!? Wait so you\u2019re going to stay as Jenna for good but that means Jenna will be in my body, right? Why not just give me my body and--\u201d She rambles off, each portion true but as she leans towards obtaining her previous body you speak up. \u201cSorry but I want to punish you a bit, that and I don\u2019t want Jenna to be me, it\u2019d be awkward. Besides, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re not enjoying being me anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first sentence leaves her commenting on how selfish you are but as you speak about her enjoyment, she bashfully looks down at herself. \u201cW--well\u2026 I already said that I hated being Megan. Frankly, being anyone else is better but\u2026 me being a boy for good? I-- I don\u2019t know if I\u2026 could or want to\u2026\u201d She blathers, seemingly questioning her desires. \u201cWhat about my personality?\u201d She then asks, a stern glance indicating that she wants it back. \u201cSorry but I\u2019m keeping you with Megan\u2019s for now.\u201d You state, much to her dislike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come!?\u201d She whines, sounding a bit playful in her accusation-- the utter relief of not being Megan seemingly putting her in a much better mood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with anyone right now and I know you would if I put you back to normal. Maybe in a week or two.\u201d You respond, leaving her with pout lips which do nothing to suit your former body. Considering how much Megan wanted to stay as you, you know keeping Sarah with her personality for awhile will make this transition easier. Whether or not Sarah would actually like to be you or not is something you can\u2019t be sure of. Still, the current body is enough to appease her as she even leaves your side with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later you\u2019re standing at the door to Jenna\u2019s room, your hand only an inch from knocking on the door. There are multiple ways you could do this, you could easily just use the blue button but then you\u2019d pretty much be creating a second Sarah; granted, it\u2019s better than Jenna. You also have to wonder whether or not you want to even reveal the remote to her as it may lead her to pine for it at a later time\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You formulate a corny little scene in your head, one which leaves you pondering whether or not you can do it without laughing. You\u2019re by no means an actor but decide to give this a shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crack open the door enough to not even gather Jenna\u2019s attention who is sitting on her laptop listening to music. You peak the remote through the crack and press the green button, endowing Jenna with an uncanny amount of envy for Sarah. \u201cNow when I enter this room and mention how I would love to swap bodies with her, she should be ecstatic about it.\u201d You reason, preparing yourself with one last deep breath. Exhaled and ready for this bizarre idea of yours you enter the room with a perky attitude. \u201cHi Jenna!\u201d You exclaim as you shut the door behind you. She turns to you with what looks like initial annoyance but it fades the moment she sees you. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d She says quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to her, peaking over her shoulder wearing a playful smile. \u201cWhacha doin\u2019?\u201d You ask. She hesitates for a moment before turning back to her computer screen. \u201cOh, um\u2026 just listening to some--\u201d The moment she begins to answer you stroke her ponytail to add another question. \u201cHow come you always have your hair up? I think it looks better down.\u201d You inquire with a tilting head, a bright smile still pressing up against your cheeks. She reaches her hand up stroke the hair in question before replying, a bit more Jenna spunk engrossed in the words\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s easier to run with it up you idiot. Seems pretty obvious to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA shame, I wish I had hair like yours.\u201d You comment, the first step towards this bizarre situation you have played out in your head. \u201cReally\u2026? I think your hair is much nicer than mine.\u201d She states, quietly and politely. You have never seen Jenna be so docile before, hell, she is actually really cute right now. \u201cThis frizzy mess? You know it takes forever just to get it straight in the morning.\u201d You reply as you pick up one of the scrunchies and tie your hair into a very short ponytail. \u201cDoesn\u2019t really work with my hair.\u201d You state but as is expected, Jenna denies it with her envy. \u201cReally? I think it looks really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenna gets off of her chair to further envelop herself, you look her up and down with an envious gaze. \u201cGod Jenna, you\u2019re so beautiful, it\u2019s unfair.\u201d You compliment but the awkwardness of the situation gets to you in the end, causing a short burst of laughter. \u201cI think you\u2019re retarded because you\u2019re easily ten times better looking than me.\u201d Responds Jenna with a fascinating smile and a gentle shaking of her head. You walk passed her and stretch your hands high into the air. \u201cAh\u2026ah\u2026 it\u2019s a shame we can\u2019t just switch places or something. Don\u2019t you wish we could?\u201d You hint as you sit yourself down on her bed. No hesitation is found at all as she responds within a fraction of a second. \u201cYes! That would amazing!\u201d She nearly yells out with enthusiasm. You expel a phony sigh and desperately try to cover up the irking smile which brims inside your head. \u201cAh, if only there was a way.\u201d You say, much to Jenna\u2019s approval\u2026 \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, maybe if we really think about it can happen!\u201d You exclaim as you pat on the space beside you, motioning for her to join you. After a few minutes of shuffling, you are both seated on the bed with your backs pressed against each other. \u201cThis seems really fucking stupid\u2026\u201d Comments Jenna, a sentiment you definitely have to agree with as this scene of yours is rather silly. \u201cNo wonder my brother dates you, you\u2019re both retarded.\u201d She states, a comment you\u2019re used to hearing; granted you\u2019re usually not referred to in third person. \u201cCome on just go along with it, it\u2019ll be fun. Hypnosis works sometimes and it\u2019s kinda like this. Now close your eyes.\u201d Your desire to continue eventually rubs off on Jenna as she finally closes her eyes. \u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s see\u2026 let\u2019s start with something simple. Try um\u2026 speaking like me-- like with my voice.\u201d You suggest but it quickly comes into question. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to do that?\u201d She criticizes, the anger in her voice bouncing off all of the walls of the room. \u201cJust think about my voice for a minute and then try to speak with it and I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d You reply as you gently pull the remote out of your pocket and aim it behind you. \u201cFine.\u201d She says, submitting to your playful little scene. After several seconds of pause you press the red button and swap places with Jenna. \u201cWoah!\u201d You hear Jenna exclaim, though now in tones that match Sarah\u2019s voice. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d You ask as you hide the remote between your legs as Jenna has no pockets on her. \u201cYeah, everything felt really weird for a second. Still does\u2026\u201d Her answer leads you to further this little charade even if you could end it right here. \u201cHey, you sound different.\u201d You inform her and after a brief analysis she says the same thing to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, maybe it\u2019s working. Let\u2019s keep going.\u201d You say with a chuckle. You can feel her head nod as it shifts upon your back, the height difference very clear-- though it would seem Jenna hasn\u2019t noticed. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 try thinking of my frizzy hair tickling your cheeks. Remember to keep your eyes closed.\u201d You tell her, the same nod rubbing against your back. After yet another moment of pause you pull the scrunchie out of her hair, letting Sarah\u2019s hair fall into place at her cheeks and over her eye. The dispersing of motion on the bed leave you wondering what she is doing but as she softly says\u2026 \u201cIt really does feel different, it\u2019s even shorter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine is a lot longer and smoother, it\u2019s nice.\u201d You comment. \u201cIs this really working?\u201d She asks, her breathing becoming very rapid. You wonder if she\u2019s scared or excited but either way this whole scenario is actually kind of turning you on a little bit. \u201cWell, if it is maybe you have my chest too.\u201d You jest, a set of words that leaves her fumbling with the location in question. \u201cThese definitely feel bigger!\u201d She exclaims and it\u2019s here that you decide to end your little scene as you jump off of the bed. \u201cAh, well that was fun!\u201d You say as you walk yourself over to Jenna\u2019s dresser, opening the top drawer to temporarily stash the remote. \u201cShame it can\u2019t happen for real.\u201d You say, feigning a great deal of disappointment...</span></div></div>",

Jenna\u2019s eyes fall onto herself, put into a permanent gasp as she ravages her body and sprints towards the mirror on her desk. You end up following her, feigning surprise once more as you gaze into the mirror. \u201cIt really worked!\u201d She gleams with a satisfied grin as she lifts up her improved breasts. She then slaps you hard in the back, seemingly returning to normal now that she has the product of her envy. \u201cWell, hope you like being that way because there is no way in hell you\u2019re ever getting this body back. Looks like you\u2019re now related to your boyfriend too, I guess that makes you more than just a slut huh?\u201d She rattles off with a smug smirk which couldn\u2019t be removed even with the strongest eraser. You merely look at her a bit dumbfounded, wondering if maybe you should have made her like Sarah as well as envy her so she wouldn\u2019t be such a bitch to you. The deed is done however, so you straighten your back, clamp your hands to your hips and declare your status\u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. You\u2019re Sarah Johnson now, do whatever you want. Likewise, I\u2019m Jenna Remy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you\u2019re dumb enough to want to be me instead of yourself but whatever, that\u2019s fine with me. Now then, I assume that car outside is mine now so I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d She says as she turns to leave, parting ways with a modest wave. \u201cSee ya, Sarah.\u201d You say as the door to your new room closes. You can\u2019t resist chuckling, a bit amazed by how well you went through that whole ordeal. \u201cI could have made that so much simpler but I was kind of getting into it. Ah\u2026 I\u2019m so stupid sometimes\u2026\u201d You conclude as you take a seat at Jenna\u2019s desk, placing the mirror in front of her computer to gather a preview of your new image. You can\u2019t deny as you used to that Jenna isn\u2019t beautiful and after seeing how she can appear when she\u2019s even remotely pleasant, you feel quite content knowing you will be wielding her face from now on. Still, you can\u2019t quite believe that you actually just opted to be your bitch of a sister for good; a radical decision that you feel you would have never made prior to this whole ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your hair out of it\u2019s ponytail and into the state that you will most likely keep it, if not to differentiate yourself from the real Jenna then because you prefer how it looks. \u201cThough I guess a ponytail kind of suits this outfit.\u201d You say as you get yourself up and into her dresser. You\u2019re a bit put off by the lack of any skirts as you kind of want to show off Jenna\u2019s legs but since you know that Jenna typically only wears: tight T-shirts, tank tops, Jeans and the occasional shorts, you didn\u2019t expect anything less. It\u2019s only when a friend or current boyfriend of hers requests something that she may wear something with more style to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a simple pair of jeans and T-shirt and place yourself in the shower to wash off Jenna\u2019s prior workout. You\u2019re only impressed more when you see her bare naked, the fit and well figured body is easily of a perfect form and while her chest could be bigger, her ass is so firm you could probably hold onto it all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the bathroom with a gratified smile but as you gaze down the hallway at the closed doors to all of your current siblings\u2019 rooms, you sort of feel put off at being enemies to most of them. You could try cheering up Megan or maybe go talk with Sarah who at the very least is in a better mood. </span></div></div>",

Hmph\u2026\u201d You grumble as you press the ghost mode button on the remote. You phase through the door finding Megan laying on her bed with her arms wrapped around a pillow and a Manga sprawled out in front of her. You reappear but with her back turned she doesn\u2019t even seem to notice you. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d You say, the echoing of your voice enough to alert her as she turns to you rather startled. \u201cH--how did you get in?

Going to punish me for something stupid?\u201d She questions, the glasses she wears only increasing the intensity of her glare. \u201cWell I\u2019d like to mend this relationship a little bit.\u201d You say but it would seem your intentions become misplaced as she sparks to life with happiness. \u201cY--you\u2019re giving me Jenna\u2019s body!?\u201d She assumes with a glimmering smile you thought lost from her arsenal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh, no, this is my body now.\u201d You state as you glance down at yourself, a sentence which only sets into motion confusion and anger. \u201cWhat do you mean that\u2019s your body? You spent all that time complaining about wanting to return to normal-- y--you yelled at me for taking your body and now you\u2019re--\u201d She ravages your decision in a vigorous bout but though you motion her to calm down with your hands, she only continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down Megan. All that time under your personality and as a girl, well, I just feel more comfortable as one now.\u201d You explain to her but it does nothing to tilt the scale of hate she has for you. \u201cThen how come I can\u2019t have your body!?\u201d She demands to know. You scratch your head, glancing about her room looking for a good answer but come upon nothing. \u201cMy body is Sarah\u2019s now and I sort of gave Jenna Sarah\u2019s body.\u201d You tell her straight but once more she lashes out in her rage, her former shyness lost behind her anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah wants to be you!? And why not make Jenna get stuck as me? I\u2019ll be Sarah, I don\u2019t care!\u201d She says but the answers you give to each question only lead her plagiarizing your decisions. \u201cOh, it\u2019s not alright for me to take your body but it\u2019s fine for you to lock Sarah in your body and give her body away?\u201d She slyly asks, the folds of her nose pressing closer and closer together as her frustration increases. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything though. You two wanted to keep me as you because I insulted you once-- big deal. It\u2019s not right but this is just how things are going to be.

She blinks multiple times before asking the question yet again. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d She asks, no hint of anger in her voice, rather she sounds quite pleasant. You pick up the mirror on her desk and flash it before her, quizzing her on her appearance. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you look pretty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I do look pretty.\u201d She says as she picks up the mirror from your hand and begins softly stroking her cheeks.

Yet I\u2026 feel like I am.\u201d She states, the battle of her new personality beginning, a struggle you know well. \u201cIt\u2019s called self-confidence. I made you think you\u2019re actually quite pretty and I also\u2026\u201d You cut yourself off as you sit down next to her and hand her the remote. She looks at you as if you were going to stab her but gently rubs the remote. \u201cDon\u2019t press any of the buttons please.\u201d You ask of her, to which she nods appealingly. \u201cI also made you exceptionally nice since you seem to have an issue with getting upset very easily. If you had your old personality you would be bashing those buttons like crazy.\u201d You finish, the whole while her eyes remain locked on the remote. \u201cI want to press the buttons but oh, it would be so rude of me since you said I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry for even thinking it.\u201d She admits but her new conscience weighs down on her desires for revenge and so she hands the remote back to you freely. You take it back with a smile and lift yourself from her bed and prepare to leave. \u201cW--wait, this isn\u2019t right. This isn\u2019t me.\u201d She labels her concerns, a hand reaching out for your aid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were ready to let me live under a false personality and body. You\u2019ll get used to it. Now you won\u2019t be as miserable even if it\u2019s not how you were born.\u201d You explain before leaving the room and the distorted Megan. You only make a couple steps down the hallway before bumping into your old body. \u201cSorry.\u201d You blurt out on instinct. She looks up at you and then down the hall, piecing together who you are and where you came from quite easily. \u201cD--did you just apologize to Megan?\u201d She asks, her voice cracking from her shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to twist and twirl your bangs, gazing away from her as the misfortune of her assumption falls into the recesses of your mind. \u201cYeah, well\u2026 I tried to smooth things over but it didn\u2019t go so well so I sort of\u2026 changed her personality a bit.\u201d You admit with an awkward chuckle, one which prays she won\u2019t get upset with you. Her brow falls into such a state though and so the questions begin\u2026 \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just gave her some self-confidence.\u201d You answer, be it only half of what you did. Sarah\u2019s anger falls along with her shoulders, the tense bit of frustration losing itself behind her agreement. \u201cOh, well, t--that\u2019s probably better for her anyways.\u201d She admits, an agreement you have no plans on losing by telling her about the other half of the personality change. You watch her bashfully look back and forth, a hand ravaging her short hair leaving it as a mess with no direction. \u201cSpeaking of personalities\u2026 can I please have mine back?\u201d She pleads yet again. You follow her previous action to the letter before replying with\u2026 \u201cBut if I do that you\u2019ll get angry at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m already angry at you.\u201d She swiftly points out in a way that leaves you snickering. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll be more vocal about it.\u201d You reason, something she doesn\u2019t seem to be able to deny. \u201cI\u2019d like to say I won\u2019t b-but\u2026 I probably will yell at you; a lot\u2026\u201d An admittance that leaves you wondering whether or not you want to deal with such a thing at the moment. </span></div></div>",

An assurance made more potent by the safe place you crafted underneath Jenna\u2019s desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the day going over any notes or clues about Jenna\u2019s school schedule.

The sun just vaguely dips into your room, illuminating for you the outfit Jenna frequents during her morning routine. Moments later you find yourself in it, stretching your limbs to a remarkable degree. Curiously you split your legs down the middle, amazed to find the intense position not even giving the slightest burn to your thighs. \u201cOh, I am loving this! Jenna is so flexible.\u201d You comment with a bright smile as you continue to stretch your body to the limit. As your hair continues to flap over and around your head, you begin to realize Jenna\u2019s point.

And so your life continues, skewed off it\u2019s course to adjust to Jenna\u2019s path but while hanging around with Jenna\u2019s shallow friends is tough, you find yourself readjusting her life to suit you quite easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan frequents her insecurities but with you and Sarah (or Martin as you begin to refer to her as.) always there when she returns home, you feel you\u2019re not too far off from calling her a happier person. Though all of the changes you made to her life confuse her for quite awhile-- Norman in specific. However, under the same shy influence as you she goes on several dates with him, eventually growing attached to his nerdy presence as you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months later\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon entering your room you find Sarah there with the remote in hand and a puzzled expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Martin?\u201d You ask as you take a seat beside her on the bed. She looks up at you with a solemn gaze, one which accompanies her response quite well\u2026 \u201cHey. It\u2019s been three months and I was just deciding if I wanted to go back to normal or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019d be weird not having you as a little brother.\u201d You say, folding your legs Indian style with a hand slowly running through your long hair. She nods and puts the remote back on the nightstand where it\u2019s been since that day; wide open for use. \u201cReally? I\u2019ve gotten used to this but I still don\u2019t feel like I should be this way. I like being your little brother and everything but-- you don\u2019t mind if I go back to normal do you?\u201d She asks, her face pressing itself only inches from your own. \u201cI--I think it\u2019s more of an issue of Megan than me. I like you this way but you know I liked you before too.\u201d You tell her, a fact which brings her face falling onto the bed sheets. \u201cUgh\u2026 she\u2019s going to hate me\u2026\u201d You hear through the thick layers of cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drag her off of the bed however and into Megan\u2019s room, who is laying on her bed as usual. \u201cHey guys.\u201d She greets with a pleasing smile. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d Sarah replies softly, her steps slowing to a dull pace. \u201cLook, Megan\u2026\u201d She begins, her hands cupped at her waist with unease. \u201cDon\u2019t get too upset but I\u2019m going to return to my normal body now.\u201d She finishes, her eyes finally meeting Megan\u2019s which course with surprise. \u201cW--what? Why!?\u201d She exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable this way. I\u2019ll still be here a lot, I just won\u2019t be your brother, I\u2019ll be your friend like before.\u201d Explains Sarah but it doesn\u2019t settle well into Megan who has come to love her new family. \u201cBut I like you being my brother.\u201d She whines out but it leaves Sarah shaking her head. \u201cI know you do, I like it too but it\u2019s just not me. I had a good time these three months and being a boy is\u2026 unique\u2026 but I just want to be myself. I stayed this way for your sake but it\u2019s time I did what I want, understand?\u201d She says, hands cupping at her chest and her eyes solemn with sincerity. You can sense Megan\u2019s desire to object once more but as she looks at you and the gentle shaking of your head, she settles herself down and gives Sarah the agreeing nod she was looking for. \u201cFine\u2026\u201d She whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. Thank you Megan. You\u2019ll always be my little sister no matter what I look like.\u201d Sarah says before dispersing from the room along with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive yourselves to Sarah\u2019s home and knock on the door but only get her mother, Alisha. \u201cIs Sarah here?\u201d You ask but she completely ignores you, her attention falling onto Sarah and only her. \u201cOh, Martin. It\u2019s been quite a long time since you have been here. I\u2019m sorry about Sarah breaking up with you, she just suddenly seemed so different, I\u2019m not sure what happened.\u201d She says, continuing to gossip with Sarah for a few minutes before finally answering your question. \u201cShe went out for a run, she should be back soon. You can wait inside if you want.\u201d She offers but you decline and instead wait at the edge of the sidewalk for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to think of it, I haven\u2019t seen her since I swapped with her.\u201d You realize, a bit of an astounding feat considering it is your former sister. Sarah sighs with a shaking head\u2026 \u201cI see her at school. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to undo what she\u2019s done to me.\u201d She mumbles with a hand burying her head. The words feed your curiosity to it\u2019s breaking point and so you begin scanning the paths to Sarah\u2019s home for any signs of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes you finally see her fade into sight and as she gets closer and closer you can feel your heart pounding to the vibrations of her steps. She\u2019s dressed in an identical outfit to your own running outfit and you can tell from here that her hair is significantly longer. In-fact as she gets closer you notice her hair is styled identically to your own, albeit still frizzier but Jenna has done a great job of straightening Sarah\u2019s hair. It\u2019s not until she takes notice of you two that you can really see the rest of her body clearly and it\u2019s then that you begin to feel rather-- well, turned on. Sarah has always been attractive but you never would have imagined she would have looked so much better if she worked out a little. In a way you\u2019re a bit jealous and while your legs and butt are still way better, you can\u2019t help but wish you had a chest like hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a surprise, what are you two losers doing here?\u201d She asks as she settles herself down to a stop, her gaze mostly falling on you. She scans you from top to bottom several times before popping a cocky grin without a word, most likely smug about looking \u2018so much better than you.' An odd thing to think considering she has really turned Sarah into another 'Jenna.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing much\u2026\u201d You say as you ready the remote\u2026</span></div></div>",

Jenna however would make much too big of a fuss if you just popped her into your old body-- you can only imagine the carnage that would ensue. You relay the decision to Sarah in the form of a soft whisper and after handing the remote over to her, you proceed to distract Jenna with various small talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a second of conversation you see Jenna\u2019s eyes light up, a quick glance over her current body giving signs of confusion as her infatuation with Sarah's body fades, replacing itself with pure envy of your old body. She obtains no time to dally into why she suddenly dislikes Sarah\u2019s beautiful body as she is hastily thrust into her new home inside \u2018Martin.\u2019 While Sarah takes herself into a bout of self discovery, you turn to Jenna who is wearing a distorted expression, grasping her new body in various ways. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2026? It happened again?\u201d She asks herself as she rubs a hand along her arms with fascination. \u201cI\u2019m the twerp\u2026?\u201d She concludes, her head rising to meet with Sarah\u2019s eyes who is by no means playing along with Jenna\u2019s confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, I must be really lucky. I was getting bored of being in that slut\u2019s body anyway. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying it Twerp but your body is pretty awesome.\u201d She declares with a cocky grin, hands stout at her hips and her head cocking back with superiority. The long and emotionless silence you return to her leaves her questioning the situation and so she makes for a quick escape from the awkward position. \u201cI guess you get to be your slut of an ex-girlfriend then. Have fun with that, I\u2019ll see you losers later.\u201d She says before running off with an eager smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe absence of Jenna leaves you returning to Sarah who is once again looking herself over quizzically. \u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t believe how weird it feels being a girl again.\u201d She mumbles out, appearing rather frightened by the foreign sensations. \u201cYeah but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get used to it soon enough.\u201d You inform as you join her in looking over her body. As she presses a hand against her revealed abs, she lets out a delighted gasp. \u201cWow, I sort of remember what being myself was like but I don\u2019t remember having such a nice body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body has always been nice but yeah, Jenna is a workout nut; she gave you some nice muscle definition.\u201d You confirm as you gaze upon her luscious body, seducing you into a trance of desire. \u201cAh!\u201d Sarah cries out as she cups her butt, her expression altering to embarrassment. \u201cI--I think I need some time alone if you don\u2019t mind. I need to get used to all of this again.\u201d Affirms Sarah as she shifts her attention back towards you. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I got class in an hour anyway.\u201d You say but as you ready to leave you bring a small idea to Sarah\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, since Jenna whipped you into shape and whatnot, want to join me on my morning run tomorrow morning? We can meet up at the park or something-- that\u2019s about even distance from both our houses.\u201d You ask of her, an offer put off from sheer laziness as her shoulders slump with slim desire. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a morning person, even getting up for school in the morning is too early, let alone your silly 5:30 run.\u201d Is the excuse she uses, one which leaves you with rolling eyes. \u201cCome on. Besides, Jenna\u2019s been in your body, it\u2019ll probably naturally wake up that early anyways.\u201d You plead. \u201cFine. On the off-chance I do wake up that early, I\u2019ll run there.\u201d She concludes with a sigh before turning about to enter her long since used home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning as you\u2019re stepping out of your room with a ponytail in creation by your swift hands, you bump directly into Jenna. As she glares at you, you take notice of the gym shorts and simple tank top she wears. \u201cAt least you\u2019re keeping my old body in shape.\u201d She blurts out just before passing by you and down the stairs. You follow after her, releasing yourselves outside at the same time and along the same path no less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop following me, slut.\u201d She says as you jog alongside one another. It doesn\u2019t take long for that distance to increase however, for as the distance traveled increases so does Jenna\u2019s exhaustion from her out-of-shape body, a fact even more true considering Sarah\u2019s been in it for three months. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you back at the house.\u201d You jab, running backwards with only a slight desperation for breath. \u201cS--shut up\u2026!\u201d She replies between her panting breaths but it only leaves you laughing at her misfortune and sprinting far ahead of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty minutes later you find yourself seated at a park bench under the shadow of a tree waiting for Sarah, the branches intertwining in all the wrong ways, allowing the sun to press hard against the back of your neck. Your lips are left shimmering in the sun as remains of your sip of water drip from your them to the edge of your chin. \u201cAh\u2026 that felt good.\u201d You say as you wipe some sweat away from beneath your bangs. You lay your back against the bench and continue to look for Sarah\u2019s march towards you. After about ten minutes she finally plants herself next to you, panting heavily and stealing away your bottle of water without a word. \u201cAh! S--so\u2026 tired. You do this everyday!?\u201d She whines before she goes back to panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desire to answer simply drifts out your priorities as you watch her profile, her beautiful body making your clothing wet from more than just sweat. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d You reply softly, shaking your head loose from the allure. You\u2019re a bit relieved to be so attracted to her as you have been quite tempted to accept one of the many date requests some of the guys at your college have offered. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I still prefer women\u2026\u201d You whisper with a playful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asks, turning to you finally after regaining her composure. \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d You say with a shaking hand an awkward laugh. You toss to her an curious stare as she looks you up and down before pulling out the remote from the small fanny pack at her waist. \u201cWhat are you bringing the remote for?\u201d You ask, a bit anxious to see it being pulled out so suddenly. \u201cFor this.\u201d She says as she presses one of the buttons\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself looking at Jenna\u2019s face, your hand held out with a gap where the remote would be. Your legs are burning far more than they normally would and your chest seems to be quite tight as if your bra is not the right size. \u201cW--what the hell!?\u201d You exclaim, a bit surprised to hear Sarah\u2019s voice coming from your lips after so long. Her hands roll over her new body with a delightful smile forming with each curve she covers. \u201cAh, this feels so much better.\u201d She says as she jumps up from the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You ask you stand to your feet, wobbling slightly from the differences. She turns to you with a playful grin and says\u2026</span></div></div>",

Sarah looked up, half expecting some kind of fireworks show or gay parade to walk by celebrating her new bisexuality, but nothing happened.  She still felt like her normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you did it already?\"  She shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then when her eyes glanced at you, it was obvious something was different.

I'm sorry I just... I didn't even realize i was doing it, but I just couldn't help but look.  I knew you were attractive but, damn Jenna now I think I know why the guys are into you so much.\"  Sarah admitted, looking extremely embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held back laughter and touched her arm to reassure her, \"It's fine, that was the whole point of this remember?  And besides, I don't think I could be as sexy as you, no matter how much I work out.  Your body is something else hun.\"  You said, trying to compliment her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?  My-\" Sarah started, but then looked down at her own body, this time looking even more embarrassed than ever.  \"Jenna I...  I think I'm attracted to myself.  Oh god this is so weird!  HOW DO YOU NOT STARE AT YOUR CHEST ALL DAY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you were nearly on the ground rolling in laughter, holding your sides.  When you finally recovered, you said, \"Oh man... I don't know... I just got used to it I guess?  At least you grew up with a girl's body so it should be easier for you if anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but I was never attracted to it, what the hell!  I honestly have a new found respect for you managing to adapt so well.  Are you SURE you're still attracted to girls?\" Sarah joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the opportunity to lean in and surprise her with a deep kiss using Jenna's feminine lips, your lips.  Sarah's eyes went wide, but she didn't stop you.  Before long she was kissing back, and it was obvious she was getting into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'm definitely still into girls.\"  You said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\"  Sarah said, breathless.  This whole thing was a brand new experience for her.</span></div></div>",

Martin has always been known to tease Megan from time to time, but this was becoming almost constant.  I was hoping they were just having a spat.  You see even though Martin liked to tease Megan, he was also her best friend.  I was worried that Megan had lost her best friend just when she was starting to bloom.  For the last  three months, Martin has been anything but a friend to Megan.  Now that I know you two have been in each other's bodies I understand.  So to answer your question, I believe Martin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Megan in your body begins to protest.  \"What do you mean you believe...\" But your mom interupts, \"THAT WILL BE ENOUGH!\"  And with that you see a very Megan like look upon your normal male face.  She is now sulking on a chair behind Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Sarah is now looking back and forth between the two of you, not quite sure what to think.  Turning to your mom she asks,\"Are you sure, Mrs. Remy?\"  As your mom nods, Sarah turns to Megan in your body.  \"Is that the truth, Megan?  Did you refuse to swap back after Martin did everything you asked?  Did you really slap him?\"  Megan looks as though she has been backed into a corner.  She trys to explain, but begins babbling uncontrolably.  Your mom gives her a stern look, and she quiets down.  Finally she simply mutters \"yes, its true.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Megan explodes, \"YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ITS LIKE!!  You've never had to go through what I have, you've never had to be me and see what its like!  Always the outcast, always the odd one, never fitting in, always so unsure, always afraid.  And YES its true!  I NEVER want to go back in that body EVER again.!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suprised to see your male body leap to attack your mother.  As you and Sarah try to pull Megan off of your mom, you see that what Megan is really after is the remote.  You also try grabbing it, if nothing else than to keep Megan from having it.  As the struggle ends.....</span></div></div>",

Despite how nervous you are about your fake mother's disposition, they agree to come with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving home isn't your intention, you merely want to put some distance between Megan and society so you can talk with her. At a small road with nothing but trees on either side you stop the car on the side of the road and turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you stopping here for, mom?\" Megan asks but after looking at you for a moment corrects herself. \"Or should I say Martin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" You answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't get brainwashed, just posing as mom. Enjoying being her?\" Megan mocks you with a smirk lining her face. You begin to reply until you see Sarah get out of the car, Megan follows and with little enjoyment of the small car, you do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly Martin, I can't believe what you did to your sister last nig--\" Sarah begins but you cut her off immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true! I overheard you two talking in the dressing room, everything Megan said was a lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not--\" Megan snaps back but you cut her off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to ask Megan for my body back last night because I did the final thing she said I had to do and that's to have... s-sex. She said she would switch us back but in-place of that just shows me a mirror and tries to proclaim that I'm the new Megan. I told her that she is running away from her life-- and Sarah, you can't tell me that that isn't true, right?\" You explain with nothing but constant interrupts from Megan who spouts for Sarah not to believe you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah takes turns looking at the two of you until replying. \"I don't know who to believe but what Martin says is true. You are running away from your life, Megan. Martin, you've certainly learned to speak more clearly with Megan's personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile a bit from Sarah's words and nod in agreement. \"I have, because I've learned to cope a bit with her over exaggerated feelings.\" Megan has her head held down, a picture still plausible while in your body. \"I-- Sarah... he still...\" she mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan... I think it may be time to end this charade.\" Sarah says with a consoling hand on Megan's shoulder. The gentle rubbing seems to do little consoling as the pavement becomes damp with drops of tears. Sarah sighs and walks to the car and grabs something from her purse from the lowered window; the remote. You and Megan both watch Sarah as she fumbles with the remote a bit before saying \"Come on Megan...</span></div></div>",

Martin is the one who should be--\" She begins but a denial from Sarah interrupts her voice. \"Martin has had enough and you clearly don't want to be yourself just yet so I thought I'd take a run as Megan to see how Martin faired at <i>improving</i> it.\" With a smile and a nod Megan is already jumping aboard the Sarah train which does nothing short of angering you. Megan has been anything but understandable lately and to have her in your girlfriend's body is one of the last things you want right now. Still, regardless of your angst against the proposition, you agree just so you can be normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah aims the remote at Megan and after a button's press, is in your body. They both admire their different bodies for a moment, finding the surreal feeling of being someone else still an ecstasy. On normal circumstances you would agree but you haven't done a swap of free will in a long time. Once Sarah is done admiring the feelings of being a man she points the remote at you and after a long times wait you feel a sensation you haven't felt in a long time; you have a penis again. You are unsure if it's Megan's emotions or just due to a loss of recollection but you begin to blush at the strange sensations of being a male. You are finding being male alien and distant from what you remember and with fear in your head you ask Sarah to return your personality as well. She agrees and does the procedure to remedy your former attitude. In no way do you not remember how you used to act, you have tried your best to act like yourself but with Megan's way of thinking being your primary it has been nothing but a battle to maintain yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\" You hear from Sarah and with your hands cupped over your face to cover a smile you begin to laugh slightly. The over dosed feelings of fear, desire and stress begin to dim. Your thoughts feel more clear and how everyone feels about you seems to feel like a less prominent issue. You drop your hands from your unshaven face and sigh, nearly forming tears in your eyes from the relief of pressure. \"Ah.. it's been a long time since I could think like myself.\" You say in the utmost delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to have you back, baby.\" Sarah says but it brings only shivers as your mother's voice and body make up Sarah. \"Gross, hearing my mom say that is just sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry. It's not like I want to be like this, being your mother is interesting and all but-- get in the car.\" Sarah declares and with nothing but glee in your step you take the backseat of the car with Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home you notice Megan staring at her reflection in the rear view mirror. Whenever, you pass a glance at her she turns to the window as if she was doing nothing. You dislike that Megan is in Sarah's body, let alone admiring herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are we going to handle mom?\" Megan asks as we near our house.</span></div></div>",

Your mother folds her arms and shakes her head in a objection. \"No thanks, I want to see the reason as to why my daughter is so against being herself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's hair covers half of her face as she tilts her head and sighs in response. \"Well I was sort of going to do that. I wanted to see how her life was now.\" Your mother shakes a finger and raises herself up so in her small body she is above the sitting crowd. \"As her mother, I want to see this myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sigh escapes Sarah's lips as she agrees to your mother's option. \"Fine, whatever but I am not too fond of this and school starts in less than 2 weeks so you're not staying that way for very long.\" she answers with little excitement for the newly found motherhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan flicks her black hair and with a stuck up smile, makes it clear that she is enjoying herself. \"That's fine with me but if you're going to be me mom...\" Megan takes the remote from Sarah's hands and points it at mom. You have a good idea what is coming and the next few vocals from Megan confirm it. \"you'll need my personality to truly experience it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother has little time to object to it before she is pummeled by a false sense of person. Coy and quiet, she asks to be changed back to her original mind. \"U-umm... this isn't what I had in mind. C-can I please have my personality back? This is... weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan giggles towards her reaction and with a dim-hearted reply, denies her of her original personality. \"Sorry but if you're going to do this, you need to do it fully.\" She coaxes mom on to once again enjoy someone else living her life; you find it filthy at how she enjoys teasing herself, her false privado is only present when she is going against her own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fine, whatever...\" Mom retorts quietly and stumbles passed us to leave the room. Deciding you keep clear of stress you lay back on your floor, hands cupping your head. \"So... now what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am not too thrilled about being your mother...</span></div></div>",

Hmm, she is a bitch but I guess that has little effect on <i>me</i>. Not bad looking and at the very least younger than your mom, I'm not too into being 50 yet.\" She says.

I'd prefer to just relax.\" You comment. Megan turns her head in a vibrant attempt to ignore you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I want to see...\" Megan whispers, sounding as if she never spoke at all, an ability she excelled at. She scurried out of the room, her white frilled skirt pressing against her legs from the momentum. You merely shrug it off and ask Sarah if she'd like to go for a walk, she agrees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few feet from the house and distance between you and Megan, you ask Sarah something that you have observed and experienced first hand. \"Isn't it kind of weird, Sarah?\" You garner Sarah's attention as she looks at you wearing curious green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Megan is so-- how to put it... interested in teasing <i>herself</i>?\" You ask but are only returned with a common response and a few blinks of the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, when I was her, she would tease me a lot of the time.

She did tease you a lot when we did see you but we mainly left you alone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't particularly enjoy that you abandoned me for 3 months.\" You reply, encumbering yourself with some previous memories of being Megan. She fidgets a bit, locking her gaze on several points in a nervous reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... I've come to think of Megan as a little sister almost and I sort of just wanted her to enjoy herself. I actually-- I'm sorry. I should have been more considerate of your situation but I was truthfully really angry with what you said to Megan before.\" She says, sounding faithful as ever and even using Jenna's voice in a tone you've never heard before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Still, recalling my experiences as Megan, I think that we should return Megan to her original self after this week no matter what. I just feel like she is trying to distance herself from being-- well... herself.\" You state, sure with your thesis on what Megan is doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. School is starting soon, I don't want her going to school as me or you. By the way-- and this off-topic but that topic is done anyways but umm... you said you had sex while you were Megan, is that true?\" She questions. You feel a bit perplexed on how to respond to the question but try your best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, yes, I did. Megan said I had to-- you're not angry about it are you?\" You ask. She laughs and shakes her head. \"No, no, I'm not mad, more... jealous.\" She says quietly with a hidden smile on her lips as her face falls in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jealous!?\" You stammer out from the shaken mind that can't comprehend her response. She lifts her body and shakes her hands wildly in rejection to what you are thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No No! I don't have a thing for Norman! It's just... you've gotten to have sex as a boy <i>and</i> a girl. I'm kind of... interested in it. I'd like to try it sometime, honestly.\" She explains but it does little good of relieving your appropriately placed reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it.. you say?\" You question her words. Sarah has never exactly been shy when it comes to speaking her mind so talk about sex wasn't exactly rare but you still find this kind of erotic, even for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, like-- umm, we switch and then.. do it. Ack, I'm sorry, is this gross? I'm a sicko.\" She cries as she smothers her face, wind carrying her ponytail over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your head with a twisted smile, trying to find a way to reassure her that she is not crazy. \"Well, maybe we can try that... sometime. Not to fond of having sex with myself though. Anyway, let's get off this subject for now.\" You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing and continuing on, you eventually succeed at just spending a nice day as yourself for once. Despite your girlfriend being your sister at the moment, you at least feel happy to spend time with her after so long. The sunlight eventually leaves the sky and Sarah drives Megan to her temporary home, returning shortly after as your pseudo sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay in your own bed after so long and think about the current situation before drifting to sleep. \"Mother as my sister, sister brainwashed as my mother, sister in the body of my girlfriend and a girlfriend in the body of my sister.

You spend most of your time with Sarah, who despite her already beautiful image, is quite enjoying being your sister. She always wears Jenna's pretty long hair in different ways, discarding Jenna's usual ponytail-only approach. She also went out of her way to buy some cute outfits, abusing Jenna's money. The difference in appearances at the very least made you feel less like you were with your sister and more with your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also tried to hang out with Megan a few times during the week but find that she is most often too busy stalking herself. You didn't bring up how weird it was that she enjoys stalking herself but you felt like your subtle inputs were enough to give her a hint. Still, even when you did get her out of the house, she was still as quiet as ever but that didn't stop her from admiring your appearance at every given reflection. With Sarah also enjoying her temporary image, she didn't bother criticizing Megan for enjoying looking like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the issue with your mother turned daughter. Rarely did you ever get to talk to her as you wanted little to do with Megan's life and with the real Megan constantly harassing her you felt little need but still, you found her quite stressed out and nervous a lot of the time which is no surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week dawns, you get up and after your normal routine, you go ask Sarah if she is ready to switch back. Since she is currently living as your sister, she is in no way a hefty walk away. She seems skeptical at first but eventually agrees to switch back which you are thankful for, last thing you want is for Sarah to stay as Jenna. Sarah switches with your mother's body and along with you, enters Megan's room where you find your mother.

With a bright smile she replies in a eager daunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Being young is nice but... this isn't what I had in mind.\" She answers. You find it a bit funny that an older woman prefers being old over being young but Megan. Sarah quickly restores your mother to her former self in both mind and body. She is in delight at being herself again but soon returns to her motherly stern appearances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I understand my little girl a lot more now than I did before.\" She says. You nod and agree as you also learned a lot from being Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's not bad when you are sure you are going to get your body back. I didn't have that luxury. By the way, you're not going to get all motherly and broadcast this remote to everyone now are you?\" You ask so her answer can decide if you let her remain as she is or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motherly? I am a mother so that can't be helped but no, I don't plan to. That is assuming you don't plan to abuse it, young man.\" She answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't plan to abuse it. I'm happy being myself right now, thank you very much. Anyways, let's go Sarah.\" You respond with a rushed exit. You and Sarah decide to walk to Sarah's home so you can talk a bit. Before you commence any conversation you notice Sarah looking herself over a bit, unused to Megan's exterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't seem <i>that</i> bad.\" She comments as she returns her attention towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not, though it's worse if you have her personality. Megan can overcome it if she tries, I already proved that.\" A stern packet of information being your response. You are nothing but angry with Megan as it is, you've proven that she can do all the things she says she can't do and yet she still hides from being herself. You are a bit nervous of how Megan will react to becoming herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope Megan doesn't get all emotional over turning back.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually get to Sarah's home. Her home or not, Sarah knocks at the door and is shortly after greeted by her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Martin.\" Alisha says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, is Me--Sarah here?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You and Sarah both pass smiles and head into the home and quietly up the stairs. You open the door to Sarah's room and find her body sleeping with little care of the intruders. You grin and slam your hand down on her leg with a scream. \"Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan snaps awake and jumps for safety at the furthest point of the bed. \"W-wh-what was that? Why did you do that!? I hate it... when you do that.\" She yells in a panic as she tries to calm herself down with deep breaths. You have often woken Megan up in a similar way as it's nothing but a treat to see her reaction. On further inspection you realize you have never seen Sarah's body in such a mess before. Her hair is wild, she has imprints on her face from sleeping pressed against her hand and has half opened eyes only moments after being scared awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I enjoy doing that.\" You say, hearing a soft chuckle from beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so what are you doing here, Martin?\" She asks. You are well aware that Megan isn't as stupid as she claims to be and knows why you are here. You place a hand on the framed girl beside you and remind Megan why you are here. \"It's been a week, time to switch back. Sarah is in your body right now as you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's face plummets, whether it be out of her knowledge, to you it looks like she is staring at her cleavage. The thin yellow night gown does little to cover up Sarah's large chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I don't...\" She mummers under her breath. Sarah takes a step forward and points at herself in a dimwitted fashion in order to a convey a message. \"Your body isn't that bad Megan. I'm in it right now and so has your mom and your brother was you for three months. I think that's enough time don't you think? You must have learned something from seeing Martin be you, now it's time to put it to use.\" She proclaims, despite lacking knowledge on being Megan herself. You agree with Sarah and display it with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did learn something... I learned that I... don't want to be myse-- no, Megan ever again.\" She whispers, the silent tone echoing in your ears, infuriating you. You place your knee on the bed and stare Megan in the face, forcing her head up. \"I'm sick of this Megan--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not Megan!\" She yells but the voice barely leaves the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are. I've done everything you said you couldn't so why is it so hard for you? Why do you want to be someone else if you are no different? You still stay inside and only talk to me and Sarah.\" You pummel her with questions but she seems to only stutter and try to break away from your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-- because... I feel better and I feel like I <i>could</i> talk to others if I wanted to this way.\" She says but it only makes you adamant about putting her back in her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk to anyone in your own body, you don't need to be me or Sarah or anyone. Sarah, switch back with her.\" You say as you distance yourself from Megan who is creating tears with eyes that don't belong to her. Sarah seems a bit hesitant but you see her press the button on the remote and before you check with the Sarah on the bed you see Megan's body look herself over. She covers her face and runs out the door. \"I-I hate you both!\" She screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and glance over at Sarah who is wiping the tears she never shed from her eyes. \"I feel really bad, should we follow her?\" She asks. You shake your head and take position next to Sarah. \"No, she just needs awhile to cool off.\" You answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's mother comes up to question what happened with Megan but you and Sarah both opt that it was nothing but a misunderstanding which she seems to buy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gives you the remote and says that she is going to go take a shower. You lay back in her bed to think about what you should be doing right about now. You recall some of your memories of being Megan and wonder what you would do if you were in her shoes right now.</span></div></div>",

Sounds of rushing water swirling through the pipes of the walls and a slight hint of a woman singing make for a distracting setting, doing little to help you think about what you should be doing. You sit up off the pillow and grasp your heels in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even I feel bad, how annoying.\" You announce to yourself as if you couldn't believe it. After all she put you through you still feel sorry for her once she is back in her own body. Exhaling a disconcerting groan you lay back down on the pillow and wait for Sarah to finish up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally dispersed from the shower after what feels like 30 minutes, your girlfriend returns wearing nothing but a towel wrapped tightly around her wet busty figure. Finding the stimulate exactly what you needed to remove your mind from the Megan thing you get up off the bed to further examine her body. Sarah is siphoning through her dresser drawers as you position yourself at her rear, grasping her tight waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! Stop that.\" She retorts. You do no such thing and continue to expand your grasps' horizons. It's been a long time since you've been yourself and after so long you are reunited with the uncontrollable male attachment. You find the enlarging piece of flesh very uncomfortable as you twitch your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin, my mother is home, we can't.\" She says. You are disappointed but oblige with a release of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's been so long.\" You whimper out, sounding painfully pathetic. She turns with a hands placed at hip and chin, to your surprise perhaps thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your sister?\" She asks. You reply that Megan isn't the type of girl you should pursue right away as she thinks very unclear when she is upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we could use the remote to get rid of my mother for a bit but...\" She begins to grin a bit as her sentence furthers towards the end. \"I'll only do it if we switch places first.\" She says, leaving her offer up for you to decide. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Limp shoulders and a sour lip help to convey your stance on the offer as you pout out \"Fine.\" You take the remote from the nightstand and with silent steps bring yourself downstairs. Finding Alisha watching T.V, you point the remote at her and decide to induce a trait into her that makes her <i>very</i> easily persuaded. The remote tucked behind your back you walk up behind the coach in the living room and say \"Hey Mrs.Johnson, If you go out for an hour or so I'll give you a cookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel humiliated saying something so bizarre to your girlfriend's mother but that emotion has little time to set in before you see her eagerly agree. \"Really!? O.K. I'll be back in a little while then.\" She answers in a spree of joy as she retrieves her car keys and heads out the door. You merely shake your head at the skeptical and walk back upstairs to find Sarah still dripping wet in her towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you do to my mom?\" She asks. You tell her what you did and she merely laughs at it. You lightly scratch your head as you lift the remote to switch with Sarah. You are not too happy about switching but at least you know being your girlfriend might be fun instead of a chore. You press the red button and the first sensation you are greeted with is the feeling of having a bucket of cool water dropped on you. From head to toe you are wet and you can feel long hair clinging to your cheeks and down your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Sarah exclaims as she eyes her pants. \"O-oh boy, this is what it feels like to be-- aroused as a man?\" She asks. You refrain from answering as you notice the thin towel around your body barely able to contain the large breasts on your chest. Megan's being at best BB and mom's B or so, you can't believe the difference from going up two cups. You feel like someone strapped a 5 pound dumbbell to your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh? Yeah, that's a penis for ya.\" You reply, relishing little interest as you eye your own eye candy. Sarah looks along with you and begins to twitch her legs in discomfort. \"So do we... do it?\" She asks. You merely shrug and say \"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back and remove the towel to completely exposing Sarah's exquisite body. Laying yourself down on the bed you feel a bit uneasy about doing this. You place the remote on the nightstand next to the bed and return your attention. Sarah hesitant but forward, bridges herself over you. You feel weird seeing your own body above you in such a position. You feel a gentle wave of exotic pleasure as Sarah rubs your breasts a bit. The feeling is still as amazing as ever but you actually feel that Sarah's breasts --though abnormally sensitive on their own, aren't as pleasurable as Megan's petite pair. You wonder if maturity or use could alter the sensation but regardless, you enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye Sarah as she slowly begins to bring herself closer to your face. You feel your own lips against your new glossy pair and begin to kiss but the feeling is quickly dispersed as Sarah pulls away in a shout. \"I--I can't do this! Playing with my own body is... weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" You say in consent to her position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to... do this. If only it wasn't with my own body because I feel really turned on right now, I just can't bring myself to enjoy kissing myself. I mean-- Oh! I know!\" She exclaims as she leans over you to grab the remote off the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, use this remote and give me your sexual desire for me-- hell, just give me your personality completely.\" She asks of you. You feel a bit nervous about it but willingly replace her personality. She looks at you for a bit before removing her shirt with a smile. \"Well, this must work because you just got a whole lot more attractive. I know it's my body still but that seems a bit distant now.\" She says as her belt comes undone and the pants come off. Once again she bridges herself over you but before you can do much she penetrates you. The feeling is nothing short of amazing and without the painful first-time sensation-- is even more enjoyable. \"Damn, this feels good!\" She screams out as she continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind begins to focus away from the pleasure and more at the image of your own body on top of you and in a hinge of disgust you protest to this. \"S-Stop! I don't want to have sex with myself!\" Sarah smiles and grabs the remote from your opened palm. The thrusts continue but you find them more enjoyable as time progresses. \"Baby, what did you do to me?\" You ask. You begin to feel something inside you as Martin finishes up far earlier than you expected. Your eyes widen for a moment as you whisper out.. \"Martin? Did I call Sarah, Martin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah lays down beside you in a pant, moaning at how good it felt. You lift yourself off of the bed with a sour look on your face. \"Maybe for you, baby. You were done before I started.\" You blurt out in dissatisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry for not being very good with this equipment yet.\" He grumbles in protest. You shake your head for a moment, splashing a bit of water in several places. \"Wait wait wait, <i>he</i>, <i>Martin</i>? Why do I keep thinking that? What did you do to me?\" You question. She sits up with a laugh eventually passing a glance at you. \"I gave you my personality.\" She answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back on it a moment and recall instinctively calling and even thinking that Megan was Martin. It seems that when your personality is changed, if you don't realize it-- even if you do, you naturally use their personality instead of your own. So a thought process of 'Sarah being my girlfriend' instinctively translates to <i>me</i> being Martin's girlfriend. \"How perplexing...\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>As Megan I was trying my hardest not to be like her so I didn't screw up basic things like who I was but while being ignorant of what happened, it was almost like being brainwashed into being Sarah.</i>' You ponder. Little more thought is allowed as you see Sarah pick up the remote and point it at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now change me back.\" She says. You can only assume that your personality is back to normal, you find it kind of scary that the change is most often very unnoticeable. You change her mind back to normal and she is already heading to the bathroom to clean up. You look as best you can to examine the wet pussy between your legs but despite being unable to see it well, you decide that you should clean up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah makes you put on a denim skirt, a cowl neck shirt which exposes nearly all of your back as well a pair of banded sandals. You can say you have never felt this womanly before even while you were Megan. Sarah is a girl who usually does partake in fashion but you find the outfits something different entirely when you wear them yourself. The only reason you are still her is because Sarah is very adept at getting you to do something, this time that something is being you. You don't think it's entirely a bad idea as you sparked Megan's anger quite a lot and with someone more calm in your body she could make you come off more docile next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what?\" You ask.</span></div></div>",

Her answer is nothing but expected and with little gull to deny her of what she wants, you comply with a mumble of agreement. You, yourself would much rather give Megan more time alone but as you have seen from Sarah she is far too concerned to take any of your opinions to heart. You both begin to leave the house but the door screams at you in a slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my cookie!?\" Alisha screams with her hands held high-- you don't seem to recall making her more childish. \"I guess she is excited over a cookie... being childish just comes with something as stupid as that.\" You whisper to yourself which only garners a passing glance from her until she returns to glare at Sarah whom she assumes is you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah says until relieving a small chuckle and a glare in your direction. \"Sorry, I lied, I don't have one.\" The surprising amount of turmoil from the cookie that never was is surprisingly entertaining as you begin to laugh at Alisha's temper tantrum. Sarah seems amused but more so shocked to see her mother in such a state-- though she was always energetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, if you go watch T.V. for an hour, I'll give you a uhh... n-nothing?\" You say with a curving sense of stupidity. To your delight, the offer of nothing comes off as a surprisingly intriguing prize from the mother who currently shares the same blood as you. No sooner does she agree is she sitting at the T.V. leaving nothing but empty stares from behind. You feel a shift on your right as Sarah begins to dig into her purse to take the remote to fix her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This change is uhh... ultimately not something I want her to have all the time.\" Sarah says as she readjusts her mother to be herself but her focus still remains on the T.V. regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where were we?\" You ask, knowing full well the answer. Without much of a response you both exit the house and into Sarah's car; Sarah taking the wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think she went home?\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd assume she has little where else to go but she is in a bit of a \"state\" right now.\" You answer. Sarah merely shrugs and starts the car up and begins towards your home. Minutes go by and eventually you are standing on the mat in front of your door. You walk into the kitchen to find your mother sitting at the table doing little to nothing at all. \"Hey mom, is -- err...\" She gives you a strange look for a moment but you continue. \"I'm Mar-- yeah, anyways, um... did Megan come home?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother sighs and plants her face upon her hand which rests upon the table. \"Yes, she is really upset.\" She answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you talk to her about--\" Sarah begins but is given an early answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried but she says she wants to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug with a dim smile. \"She <i>always</i> says that. I'll go talk to her even though I <i>really</i> don't want to right now.\" You say. Your mother hopes for the best while the two of you head upstairs to Megan's room. You open the door with a bit of stealth but a manga comes flying at the door which actually makes you jump. \"W-ah. What are you doing!?\" You rage as you fling the door open with a quick close as Sarah enters along with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan is on her bed laying on her stomach, her brows arching downward and a firm lip, it is clear she is upset. \"What do you want? Haven't you two done enough to ruin my life?\" Megan pouts, barely suppressing the tears which are already forming in her eyes. You take a step forward and reach a hand to chest and air. \"Putting you back into your life is different than ruining and Martin and your mother have already been you, it's time you experienced being yourself.\" You state in a stubborn bout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gazes at you for a moment, a bit lost on why you are pretending to be her. Megan however, seems a bit thrown off that even <i>Sarah</i> is saying such things. \"Y-you too, Sarah?\" She squirms out as she bats at her eyes from beneath her glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been awhile since you have been yourself, you have a lot to learn about your current status. In less than a week school is starting so if you need help Sarah and I will help you however we can.\" Sarah reassures Megan that she is still as caring as ever towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan remains silent for so long that eventually you and Sarah both leave without saying much else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bad.\" Sarah says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too and I have been thinking of a way we can help but I am skeptical on doing it, tell me what you think.

I-I'm a woman and even I get turned on by women easily in this body.\" Your face turns red as you wish you didn't say something so embarrassing.

I like Meg and all but she is so shy and kind of geeky, I'm prettier than her too, I think. I don't know if I want to be that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you with your boyfriend's face and sighs. \"Well, there can't be two of me. Sorry but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stop her but everything goes black before you manage to reach your arm out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and you're lying in bed, you look up to see your sister Jessica standing there with a fan in her hands wondering what is going on. You look down at yourself and find that you are yourself again. '<i>How did I get back in this body? I was going to switch with Sarah wasn't I?</i>' you ponder to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looks at you for a moment then runs out of the room, scared that she had no recollection of what she was programmed to do most likely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the covers off you and put your legs off the side of the bed only to hear the door close. You look up and see Sarah. \"Sorry about that Megan, I accidentally pressed the blue button and you uhh... thought you were me.\" Sarah's apologetic tone present throughout the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your head which lead to running your fingers through your tangled hair. \"Ah, that makes sense, I guess. I don't remember any of it though.\"</span></div></div>",

You insulted your old body and life which made me realize I must think that way too. So.. I want to help you a bit Meg. Let's switch lives. I'll try my best to make yours better and see why it is you're teased so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her in awe, she really was trying to help you. \"But I can't do it. I can't take your life, even if it's only a few days.\" You say, actually upset that you couldn't experience it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked up and got right next to your face, almost hitting your forehead. \"I may not like being you but I want to help. Let's do it, I am willing. If anything ever happens where we are unsure how each other would react we can just use auto-pilot mode and let each other's bodies do what we would of done normally.\" She said, completely sincere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I want to but.. I feel so bad. My life isn't very good and I'm sure yours is wonderful. Not to mention, I'd probably end up making your friends hate you or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and put a hand on her hip. \"Don't worry about it, like I said if anything happens where we are unsure how to live each others life we can just do auto-pilot. My body will respond the way I would. I want to help you, clean you up and give your whole life a make-over. You're a good person Meg, you deserve to be better off but sometimes you need a little boost. So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel guilty but you agreed. \"I can't believe you're doing this but O.K. Let's do it, how long do we stay as each other though?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah thought about it a moment but finally opened her mouth with the answer. \"A 2 month minimum. So, no matter how much we hate each others lives we are not allowed to switch back for at least 2 months. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and nod in agreement. You are very excited to escape your non-exciting life to experience Sarah's for 2 whole months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do it.\" Sarah pointed the remote at you and hovered of the button. You were sure she was having second thoughts as she looked you up and down, almost in disgust that she would be that way for 2 months. Sarah never uses her beauty as an advantage over others most of the time but you are sure she enjoys the fact she's good looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she presses the button and you black out for a moment.</span></div></div>",

I hope she's going to be okay living with my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've been given an interesting life lesson here and that's spending two months in the body of my boyfriend Martin's cute sister Megan. The summer's started and I'm out of school so I can do whatever I want now regardless of whose body I'm in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm pretty amazed at Martin's discovery, finding a very weird remote that switches people's bodies with a button press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not one to believe these kind of things, you'd usually expect to find these kind of things in science fiction magazines or on movies, but it is what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Megan decided to spend two months as each other hopefully trying to improve and learn from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've known Martin and his family since we were in diapers. I've known Megan that long too and I known her a great deal. She's a nice girl, very shy, also pretty cute, but she doesn't have much in the self confidence department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had about 6 classes together. The first one being in 1st grade. Meg came in and was very teary when people wanted to play alongside her. I remember there were these bullies, two of them who would make fun of her glasses and teeth on occasion and Meg would cry in the corner. Martin wasn't there, so I stepped in and would confront her bullies. Megan would cry to Martin and he would hang with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegs grown very attached to Martin and only him. Even though were a year apart in age in both me, Martin to Meg, she really looks up to him as an older brother figure more seriously. Meg wasn't a bad child, she just preferred to play all by herself and was timid and scared to meet new people or meet friends. She felt the same way about me too when we first met. I'd throw off the bullies and she wouldn't trust me at first, just quietly say 'Thanks'. She wasn't trusting of anyone even when I asked to play alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did get better though as she opened up to me in later years and when I started hanging out more with Martin. Even though were not related by blood, I consider her a good friend and sister. Her real sister Jenna wasn't much of a help either adding to the bulling, but Jenna's bullying made Martin toughen up and stand up against her and Meg's bullies so it turned out well, but the poor dears perception of people was fractured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel this is the best thing in the world I can do for her and shape up her image and maybe a spin in my body will make her feel confident about herself again.</span></div></div>",

The carpet on my feet, the window next to me and even the framed picture of the family when its tipped a little on its side that they didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts weird, but I feel alot more at home now that I'm in Martin's sisters body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling is hard to describe but It feels exactly like I'm over at my own house even. I've had this feeling before because I've been to this house hundreds of times, but this time it feels.... different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enter Martin's room and see that he's in his room on his bed dead tired. Our little 'date' with me and Meg in his body must have worn him out. I look over past his drooling head and see the remote on the little table along with the instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kiss Martin on the cheek and head off to my \"own\" room with the remote and instructions. Opening the door, I'm greeted by posters everywhere on the wall. Mainly videogames I've never even heard of and comic books called manga, I believe its called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts like I'm in another country or something because this is all foreign to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n::laughs::<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pull out the tall wall mirror by the closet and take a look at my new \"vacancy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there was Meg with my posture. Usually Meg always is in a slumpy depressed kind of way, but her reflection is standing tall. I'm worried people are going to notice that or my folks at least. Well, its too late now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg is a decent looking person. Her hair is uncombed, long and splits into two long ponytails of uncombed hair on both shoulder sides. I'm also wearing a big baggy grey and black sweatshirt with blue stripes on the cuffs of the sleeves. The large size hides the small loose white shorts Meg's body is wearing. And I'm barefoot if not for a bandaid on the back of my lower right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is Meg. This is me. For two months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see what we can do here.\" - You say as you walk over to Megan's closet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, I open Meg's drawers and find that the girl has nothing but white in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan lacks a bit in finding different colors to wear. Most if not all of her bras, panties, shirts are only one color. She also has like 2 two pairs of pants in all and nothing but the same looking school skirt and button polo school shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't have much in sex appeal choices here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, first thing to do here is give her a new wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove \"my\" glasses, undo my hair and yank off the sweatshirt. Megan in a white bra and white shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More white?!! \" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg's body was pretty average. She didn't have any muscle compared to Jenna and had decent curves. She doesn't have my butt and especially my breasts so she should be glad about that not carrying the extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get dressed in possibly the only pair of pants in that entire closet and one of Meg's polo uniform shirts. I pull her long hair back and get ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking my watch, it's only 3:11pm on a Friday afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I could go out and give Meg a makeover now or shop for some color in her wardrobe. Then again I'm tired after our 'date' with Meg. I could hang here and lay low. Meg did tell me that there was more about being someone else based on what Martin went through. I could learn more about Meg as well as being on this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions decisions.</span></div></div>",

You slowly get up, letting out a yawn and stretching out your arms. You jump off the bed and drowsily make your way to the dresser, picking out some clothes. You grab some white panties and a bra, cut off jeans, a brown tube top and a small leather vest. You bring them with you into the bathroom and place them on the sink. You turn the shower on and hop in, the cool water wakes you up fairly quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water pours onto your smooth, tanned skin which makes you feel a strange satisfaction. You can feel your long black hair clinging to your back and to your butt as well. You get the soap and begin rubbing it into your skin, being sure to get in between and under your large breasts. You get the shampoo and conditioner and begin to lather it into your long hair. \"Mmm. It grew so fast at first, I'd say I'll have to wait another month or so until it's finally at knee length.\" You finish up in the shower and dry yourself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your clothes and begin to apply your make-up. You finish up with some lip gloss, you rub your lips together and smile at your reflection. \"Sarah! Breakfast!\" your mother, Clara yells up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'll be down in a minute Mom.\" You shout, returning to your final touch ups. You walk back into your room and put on some socks and some heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran downstairs and eat breakfast with your mother. \"That was good, mom.

What do you need?\" You ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Sarah now, it's been 2 months. It's time to switch back.\" she says bluntly. Your eyes widen and you dash to the calender flipping back through the couple months. \"A-already?\" You say, trying to buy time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's been 2 months. I'm happy to say I think your life is a little better now.\" she says, excited to know what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, th-that's great to know.\" you say, stuttering as you find the page on the calender.

I don't want to go back but.. it's her body.\" You start to cry from the frustration of agreeing and disagreeing about swapping back. You wipe tears from your eyes and walk over to the full mirror in your room. You gaze at yourself, almost saying good bye to your body with only your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't everyone just be born the way they want to look, so some people don't feel so torn inside like I do!?\" You shout, which is so unlike yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk downstairs and lean against the wall near the front door and wait for the real Sarah. You nearly jump in fright as you hear a knock at the door. You take a deep breath and open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere stands your old body, though it looks a lot different then you remember. Her hair is short, not even at her shoulders. Her bangs part in the middle with short strands of hair falling on her forehead slowly getting longer the closer they get to the edge of her face until it reaches her chin in length. Her skin has a slight tan and the complexion looks better. The rest of the body had the same color skin and the only noticeable difference otherwise would be that it looks like it's a little slimmer. Your old body actually looks like it has nice curves from the stomach down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white hair band lay nestled on her head and the rest of the clothes are nostalgic. You see that she is wearing a white tube top, a dark green skirt, white socks and tennis shoes. She is wearing the same outfit she was wearing when you first switched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examines you up and down and finally picks up her hand and waves. \"Yo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move out of the way so she can come in and reply \"Hey. Long time no see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both move your way up towards your room. Glancing around the house in nostalgia you can easily tell Sarah is feeling a little home sick. \"Wow, it's been awhile since I've been home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both get into your room and sit down on the bed. \"Y-Yeah, so.. how's life been as me?\" You ask with curious intent. She smiles and answers your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it sure was annoying at first. Those mean girls and boys at your school were annoying, along with your bratty sisters. I toughed it out though and I did the best I could to help out your life. I worked out a lot and got you a bit stronger, along with a tan. I guess I did a full make over of your image, I even got contacts. I've made a lot of friends for you and you always have Martin, who was very helpful too by the way. So, what about you?\" You are touched that she was really working to improve your life this whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I umm, as far as appearance the only thing I've changed is my -- your hair.\" You say, pulling your beautiful long hair over your shoulder. She laughs a little and strokes your hair a bit. \"Heh, Why is it so long? I guess it's pretty though. I can't imagine doing anything too physical with hair that long though.\" She remarks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted it to reach the back of my knees. Your hair was so pretty I wanted it to be really long and I think it looks great this way.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and looks at you, most likely waiting for something that isn't about hair. \"Umm. I've really enjoyed your life, Sarah. All your friends are really fun to be with even though I had to auto-pilot with them for awhile until I got some self-confidence.

You drape your hands over her body, taking in how beautiful the female exterior really is. Sarah's dolce skin felt as pleasant as a perfect melody, each section of her body singing a perfect note. You push her skirt until it falls down Sarah's magnificent tanned legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release your kiss to see a blushing Sarah who eagerly begins undressing herself. You follow her example and undress your current male exterior.

Jessica's favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it smells great!\" Sarah chimes in with a growling belly.

You find your old body on the floor reading your manga for some reason. The moment she spots you, she gets up and runs towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that her hair looks shorter and more tamed and it looked like she was wearing make-up. The clothes she was dressed in, you don't recall ever owning. A blue pretty blouse and a long denim skirt with white heeled sandals. She twirled around a little and asked \"What do you think? I thought I'd do something nice for you to make up for what I did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuuute!\" Sarah squealed. You blushed at the fact Sarah called your original body cute but couldn't help but get frustrated by Martin's hasty change of your appearance. \"Hmph! I didn't ask for your help. Now gimme the remote.\" You command in a ill temper, worthy of no one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin stammers from the response but replies by giving you the remote without question. \"Sorry Megan, I thought you'd lik--\" You quickly cut him off by pressing the program mode with yourself in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm.. w-what are we doing?\" The young girl asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" you respond, quickly leaving the room and out of the presence of your former body.

You take your hand out of the purse and look at your pretty hands with really well polished nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes drift up your well tanned arm to your chest where you see your two big breasts peaking through the top of the white tube top you are wearing.

You are simply stunned about how you can literally feel the curves. At your hips is a small dark green skirt then further is your nice legs, socks and white tennis shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held down your skirt and ran your fingers through your hair as a gust of wind sent them both flying about.

You <i>try</i> to stand up only to find it very difficult to stand let alone walk and come hurling back down onto the bed. \"Woah.\" You scream, softly enough that only you can hear it. As a result of the fall; brown hair with blonde streaks begin to cloud your vision, without hesitation you push it out of your face but it slowly begins to sink in that you don't even have brown hair. You stop your hand and grab a large batch of hair to bring around to your face. The smooth brown hair doesn't remind you of your own, appearance or texture wise but your first thought still is that one of your sisters did something to it in your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou angrily stand back but try to be more cautious of your balance.

'<i>Did I hit a huge growth-spurt or something!?</i>' you scream in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the door quietly and begin scratching your head in thought, which leads to you straining your smooth hair. '<i> Since when has my hair been this.. manageable, it's so nice and smooth, I love it.</i> you ponder, continuing to enjoy it.

'<i>The hair, the voice, the height, the breasts, and the tan too. Did I.. become Jenna?</i>' You realize that all these things points towards it you know it's impossible and can't help but make an awkward smile and chuckle at the thought. Still, you find yourself become overly curious and glance at the mirror on the make-up table. You walk over to it and sit down at the chair, unconsciously closing your eyes for some dramatic effect. You open your eyes to expect something logical only to find the illogical and see your sister's face staring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to scream but you hate bringing attention to yourself.

Can you speak up a bit.\" I ask, fully realizing why everyone tells me to speak up. She shuffles herself around and clears her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry. I asked if you really do like this kind of stuff.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure do. I like reading...\" I begin to trail off all the things I enjoy reading, sure enough everyone I own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of time passes and I find myself overjoyed with having a sister who is into everything I am. Martin is the only one who really tried to understand me in this family but I always wanted Jenna for some reason to like me. I suppose it's because she is the older sister.</span></div></div>",

She is probably struggling to think of something we could do that is both something I, Jenna, wouldn't mind doing but also something she wouldn't hate doing. With each twitch of her hand as she nervously thinks of what to say, my smile grows and in the end I sit down next to her on the bed, the compressing of the mattress enough to break her thoughts as she turns her head towards me. \"How about you and I go out for a bit?\" I suggest but her spiteful turn and self investigation show me just how much she doesn't want that. \"I--I'd rather not...\" She replies hesitantly. I bend my smile as softly as I can and lean in towards her framed eyes, a small jerk from the closeness her response. \"Come on, we'll go out and maybe see a movie or something.\" I ease the request into her with a light vocal that from this perspective sounds unimaginably comforting, far from what the Jenna you know is capable of. It seems to indent the same way I was positive it would so she finally agrees to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you into a cuter outfit.\" I say as I leap directly from the bed to my former dresser, knowing full well there is only one thing in it that reeks of anything feminine and that's a simple brown party dress. Jenna cringes as I bring it into sight and shakes her head, crying \"No, I'm not wearing that!\" I lay it down on the bed and bring both my hands firmly onto my hips with a smile. \"Just wear it. You're just saying you don't want to wear it because you're self conscious, even though you want nothing more than to wear it and even more things like it.\" I tell her. She stares back at me with eyes wide and mouth agape, completely astonished that I can read her mind so perfectly, not knowing that it's my mind she is using. Unable to argue with such a direct wording of her thoughts, she pushes me out the door to redress herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy lips can't help but open for the giggles that escape from my enthusiasm and the amusement I gained from being pushed out of seeing my own body dress. As I wait out the event behind the door, I twirl my ponytail lovingly around my hands, fingers and arms in complete submission to the soft embrace of the strands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the creaking of the door from behind and turn around to greet the opening. The nervous girl stands there completely flushed with a dim scowl on her face from resentment to my decision. I honestly don't think that she looks particularly good-- rather since it's my former body, I still feel like my body is unable to wear such things and look decent. Still, I am becoming to think of her as a younger sister and as such, I give nothing but compliments. \"You look great!\" I exclaim with a soft touching of hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like a drowned rat...\" She grumbles, remaining in a glare a direction away from you. \"Nonsense.\" I assure her as I close the distance to look her over from all angles, much to her dislike. I find myself filling with resent towards my old body and can't conjure up anymore feigned compliments. I instead push her weakly from behind to get her started towards leaving the house. I grab my purse from Jenna's room before meeting Jenna at the door. I look over the contents of the bag, finding all sorts of stuff that obviously isn't mine as I've only recently been gifted with Jenna's life. I look with interest as I pull out Jenna's driver's license, realizing that I now own a car as well as the legality to drive it. Though that is only legally as I know I have no idea how to drive and I've been nothing but nervous about trying to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the doorway and look over Jenna one more time, still finding dislike with her appearance in the dress. An idea then dawns on me and I can't help but smile as I jump next to her and lift up her hair. \"Hey...\" She snaps, soft and nonthreatening as it is. I grab a scrunchy from my purse and tie Jenna's messy hair in a ponytail. \"There.\" I say and pass a smile at her but she only blushes and opens the door, unable to even look at me. It's then that I spot Jenna's or rather my car in the driveway and it's now that I realize that I could have a chance to drive but the knots in my stomach tell me that I shouldn't...</span></div></div>",

It seems like this body is just giving more and more perks. Now my cry baby of a sister looks up to me instead of just being a nuisance. I smile and rub Jessica's head a bit. \"Morning, Jess.\" I say as I continue passed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Jessica calls out as I continue. \"Shower.\" I reply abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to my new room, I look around for some revealing clothes that would show off my sister's hot body. Being more of a fitness nut than anything else, I only manage to find some really short shorts and a tank top which looks to be small enough to show a little skin above the belt. It isn't much but at the very least it's something I wouldn't normally wear outside of the house before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk into the bathroom and set the clothes down near the sink. I begin to take off Jenna's track wear and find myself staring at a naked Jenna in the mirror. It is very odd to admire myself and my sister at the same time but I couldn't help it. This new body is so toned and good looking. The few times I have seen Jenna naked or close to it before made me jealous, now I love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the tie out of my hair and turn on the shower, the water really feels great for getting the sweat and dirt off my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finish up everything I needed in the bathroom and open the door to find Jessica staring at me, again. \"Umm, what's up?\" I ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go play! Play! Play!\" she screams as she grabs my hand and forcefully begins to pull me off somewhere, most likely her room.</span></div></div>",

It was the red lock with \"Jen\" scribbled on the lock because Jenna loves herself too much. You find it, unlock it and find several mirrors, clothes, a picture of her (your) boyfriend Freddy and pictures of yourself Megan, and Martin, but markered out with a black marker. Under it was an untouched picture of Jessica which kinda pissed you off a bit but you ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother person opens their locker near you as your anime encyclopedia catches wind of a keychain of an anime character. you can help but squee in delight at how cute it it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuuuuuuttee!!!!

Mary and two other girls arrive and see you. Coleen yanks away the keychain from you as you're surrounded on all sides by girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna, whats going on? You sure are acting weirder than usual, come on, if were going to avenge that loss the other night, we gotta practice hard and tough. Were going by YOUR example Captain!\"  - Coleen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back away in front of your sisters locker stunned, afraid and having trouble trying to explain to them you're not who you appear to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you gals, lets go, time for warm ups!\" - Coach Smith yells from the hallway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jenna, lets go!\" - the four girls yank you away out to the track and field<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wanna go hooooooooooooooooooooooome! - you keep crying to yourself</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team is assembled outside in a group of ten girls and the gym instructor.

Why are you in the back, come up front!\" - Coach Smith orders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no choice, you slowly walk up towards the front of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats the matter? You sure aren't looking right, I mean your posture is off.\" - Coach Smith<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel well. Can I sit this one out Coach sir, ma'am?\"  - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the one who said we weren't at out best, that we should run like the clutches of Cerberus were on our tails, no we're going by your instruction so now you must lead by example, so get into position!\" - Coach Smith<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts a relay race as several of you are positioned on the track passing a baton from one runner to the next, you are at the final line that leads to the finish line because your old host was the faster runner. The signal gun blows as the two teams begin their run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at these girls running and putting everything they got into the practice, but you yourself kept blaming yourself for how pathetic you are saying that you'll never let up, if this change was permanent, then you got to stop blaming yourself for something that you haven't tried yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no more feeling insignificant, I gotta do this. I have no choice.\" - you say as Mary runs around the field and finally reaches you and passes the baton to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO!\" - Mary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you shoot off running..... unfortunately it's the wrong way from where Mary came as you have a brain fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WRONG WAY GENIUS! GET WITH IT!\" - Mary scolds you as you pivot and head towards the right way this time running with everything you got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was right about Jenna as she IS the fastest on the team which surprises even you. Your asthma isn't even acting up at all which excites you more. You're enjoying this newfound bliss as you tear at the field. You reach the finish line as you collapse on the ground with the feeling like you just won a huge anime contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!!!\" - you cheer and yell out at no one in particular, you loved the thrill of sprinting as well as the realization that you were in a stronger body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gathers at the finish line as well to see you jumping for joy in ecstasy for no real reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES I LOVE THIS BODY!\" - you say as you hug yourself to death not noticing the limp as you dance around in happiness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Coleen, can you take her to the nurse?\" - Coach Smith says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you.\" - Coleen says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColeen escorts you to the nurse, you reluctantly tag along as well as you didn't care much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad for her, that must have been fun.\" - Martin says sitting atop the bleachers of the track and field.

The little girl is a huge brat and crybaby and loves being the center of attention all the time. You find the room and just stand out in the hallway. You figure to body swap into her and brainwash her into thinking she's you. You then figure that since she's sleeping and you switch with her you might trade places and have your sister be asleep in your body. So you tiptoe into her room full of teddy bears, plush toys, dolls, and pretty much anything that is pink and girly. You find her next to two pink teddybears, sleeping in a Dora the Explorer blanket and yank on her shoulder stirring her up from her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then run outside into the hallway and push the blue brainwash swap button and suddenly black out. You immediately spring up and look up to find a huge pink pillow with flowers on it and you turn around to find your old body stir and shake his head. Jessie in your body looks in on her own room seeing you and signals you to go back to sleep. Your old body then walks back to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works.\" You say as you lie on your smaller new bed and look up to the ceiling. Minutes later your old body leaves the bathroom and walks towards your old room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha, the son of a bitch actually works.\" You cuss in your sisters juvinelle voice. You laugh some more as you blurt out all the cuss words in the dictionary laughing at your own sisters voice getting away with saying those. You lift up your blanket to find the device nestled in your bed along with you so you're releaved that its here with you. You hide the remote in your sisters pink school backpack and plop on your new bed and fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly wakened by your older sister Jenna as she begs you to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what the hell do YOU want.\" You suddenly blurt out and realize who you now are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna looks confused and then shrugs it off and reminds you that you need to wake up and get ready for Casey Romero's 10th birthday party. Casey was a classmate of Jessica's, and one of the few people who actually can stand Jessica's outrageous behavior. The two of you are good friends and love to screw with peoples heads in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Martin?! I need to see her...err him.\" You demand at your older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That loser left with his girlfriend to go cuddle or something at the mall, I don't know, he said I'm going to see Sarah and ran off. Come on, we need to pretty you up for the party. It's a costume party too, so we'll need to get you ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize that you're stuck in a weird position being your sister Jessica. You constantly think about where the heck Jessica could be with your girlfriend. You'd rather be with her than be going to this party with someone you don't even know. What puts you in good spirits is that Jessica is brainwashed as you, so you know Sarah will be with you, even though you aren't yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, put on the dress and I'll help you with your hair and princess you up.\" Jenna beams with exceitment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.... what the... dress. princess!?!\" you blurt out in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Casey's folks decided on a fun costume party and made that the theme. It's going to be really fun, so since you've been a princess last Halloween, why not put the dress back on and be Cinderella or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you're still baffled at what you have to wear that your sister grabs you and begins putting on your pink princess dress. You just stand there and accept it unfortunately. Minutes later, you find yourself standing in front of the mirror looking at yourself in a big pink dress, leather gloves, pink sparkly shoes, glitter all over your body, hair dulled up, and makeup applied to your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at how ridiculous you think you are and just blurt out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone shoot me....\" You say under your breath as your sister comes from your closet and puts on the finishing touches to this humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the Tiaraaaaa!\" Jenna says in a rather unusual playful voice. That puts the nail in the coffin that Jenna and Jessica are buddy buddy with each other and making you and your sisters lives chaotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was dead.\" you blurt out at your own embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah, dead, you're gonna knock em dead at the ball, sport. Hahahaha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats the last straw, as you can't take any more, you need to get out of this fairy tale and fast, you remember the remote being in Jessica's backpack. You could make a run for it and swap bodies again or better yet hit the reset button and return to your own body again wherever it's at and Jessica will return to this nightmare ready to go to her stupid little party. Or..... you could submit to this and go to the party and bring the remote and perhaps actually have some fun over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do: </span></div></div>",

Is your sister ready?'', your mom yelled from downstairs, breaking your daydream, then you realized that this was the perfect chance to finally be acquinted with your new found toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes mom! In a minute!'', you yelled back, Jenna's high pitched voice boomed against Jessica's bedroom. You pressed the yellow button and floated from Jenna. Moments later, Jessica's petite 9 year old body had materialized, without wasting any time, you pressed the blue button against Jenna's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Have fun now!'', you smirked at your mom and slightly disoriented Jessica as they made their way to the car, before setting off. Your mother had told you that she decided to take Jessica to the party and do some grocery shopping, which meant that she won't be back for another four hours at least, spending time chatting with other parents, then going to the grocery shop. She usually met someone she knew and started chatting for a long time, much to your dismay everytime you accompanied her shopping. Your dad had left the house when Jenna was getting Jessica ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your mom's car vanished around the corner, you slammed the door shut and threw your fists to the air. ''Wohoo!'', you mouthed excitably. It was still 6.37am and you had a feeling that it was going to be an awesome day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let's see what she got to offer.'', you muttered excitably, like a kid who was given a Christmas toy earlier than he was supposed to be. You opened Jenna's wardrobe, to see all kind of various clothes in there and also a full body mirror. Something that you needed to appreciate the beauty of your new body. Jenna's reflection smiled, she was still in her tracksuit. You admired your sister's face, and ran your hands through your brown hair. Jenna's reflection mimicked you all the way. Although you hated her from your guts, Jenna's beauty was still charming, especially now that you had her body and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Phew, I stink of sweat!'', you smirked mockingly as you began to undress. You blushed at the sight of Jenna's near naked body, only covered with workout bra and lingerie. You fondled Jenna's boobs and felt a jolt of pleasure running through your body. ''Hmmm.'', you gummawed. ''Well, it's my body now.'', after you had gathered enough courage, the last piece of clothing fell from Jenna's body, exposing her bare skin against the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to take a long bath, just a reason to know your new body better. After half an hour and lots of moans later, you emerged from the bathroom, shivering, wrapped in towel as in your excitement, you had forgotten to bring a clean change for Jenna. ''Oh...'', you exclaimed silently as you saw Megan, recently awakened maybe due to the uncontrollable moans you were emitting from the bathroom. She quickly evaded you whom she thought was Jenna as you were in Jenna's body and darted back to her room. ''I wonder if I should tell her about this.'', you smirked and Jenna's hands went to squeeze her ample ass again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's body emerged from her bedroom. You decided to dress yourself in a rather undersized tank top and hot pants, which made her ass stuck out even more. After 30 minutes in the bathroom groping your new body, you were able to restrain yourself and went downstairs to grab some cereal for breakfast. All the time thinking how incredibly suggestive the body that you were having. As you munched the cold cereal and milk, Megan decided to went down and had some breakfast herself, careful not to look at you in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey twerp!'', you decided to play a prank on Megan,''Have you finished your pose drawings?''. Yesterday, Megan told you that she began to practice drawing human poses. ''Is it still in the secret place behind your wardrobe?''. She always hid her important stuffs in there. Only you and her knew the place and what was hidden in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan could not believe her ears. She slowly looked up at you, thinking that you had spilled the secret to Jenna. You just smiled ,''Well?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's none of your business!'', she tried to be defiant, but tears had started to form on the edge of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Of course it's mine! I agreed to do some poses as well, remember?'', you broke off into a grin. You did not want to make her cry and decided to stop the prank. ''But with my current state, let's just do female poses.'', you then rose up and did some silly poses which you had seen in some cartoons, which made Jenna looked like a complete fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's eyes grew wide in shock. She covered her mouth with her hands. ''Yep, it's Martin here. Martin to Megan. Hello? Hello?'', you grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, this remote allows you to do these things?'', Megan asked. Both of your bowls of cereal had gone soft and smudgy. None of you had the intention to finish off breakfast. Megan was carefully holding the remote, as if it was a thing made from glass. It was hard to convince her. She thought that it was one of Jenna's scheme to humiliate her. But after a few more secrets spilled and some more humiliating poses from you, Megan finally accepted that you were indeed wearing Jenna's body. After she believed, the explaining the remote was a bit easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yup. I can even read her memories and mind. Also reverting to autopilot to let it look like that it's really Jenna inside.'', you paused. ''But I don't think you'll like it.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan handed the remote back to you, careful not to accidentally pressed any buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Martin...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You look like some bitch...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, doesn't this fits her?'', you smirked as you twirled around and stuck out her ass to Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, I guess so.'', and the two of you broke into a laugh....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whatever. I've arrived in front of your doorstep.'', came the voice from across. Jenna had put the speaker mode that you were able to hear the conversation. However, before she hung up, she gave a small moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's... strange.'', you thought. However, you did not have time to ponder as suddenly a sharp knock was heard and upon opening the door, you saw Laurie, in her casual top and jeans grinning widely before letting herself in.</span></div></div>",

You obviously had the power to be anyone you want, and then begin to think that it would get a bit boring once you had your thrills being other people. So you decide to get out of that funk and decide to go in a different direction using this remote. You have a bunch of options. One would be letting your best friend Marco in on the secret and the two of you could create your own fun. Marco was your best friend and considered himself the third wheel to the triangle of you, Sarah, and him, so keeping the device would be a secret between best buds having the time of their lives. He was a trusting guy, but over exaggerated things, loved to joke alot, and one noteworthy thing was that he has a huge collection of porn mags hidden away, so he was a bit of a perv, but then again 'who isn't', you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option would be having you head to your body's boyfriends house. Freddy is an-above average basketball player and was pretty cool to you, despite how bad Jenna treated you and the family. You could let him in on the secret or break up their relationship just to get even with Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye the opposing traffic light turning yellow, and then make your choice:</span></div></div>",

I actually did that..........\" - you say trying to regain your breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie over to Marco as the both of you lie on each other. Marco falls asleep with a smile on his face. Exhausted you roll over and try to find the remote. You reach inside your track pants and pull it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll his body on top of you and aim the remote to you and thumb on the black button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see you get out of this one Jenna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plan to return to your old body and have Jenna's mind come back to life next to Marco totally ruining her.

You can see the tension in Jenna's eyes starting to get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying,\" - you say with a bit of a swagger in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read an interesting story today. The tell tale heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe started reading it, but our teacher told us the bare bones version of it. This guy does something <b>TERRIBLE</b> to this other person........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....he kills him. So he tries to keep it from being known that he killed this guy so he keeps it a secret. He buries the guys body under his house. When the police arrive to question him, he pleads ignorant, but in the back of his mind he hears it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the beating heart of the man he killed. The guilt that he did something that was so wrong took the form of a heartbeat getting louder... and louder......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....and louder. Ba dump ba dump ba dump..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you say this story you divert your eyes to Jenna who is beginning to fidget more and more focused on looking down at her food instead of everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........ the heartbeat gets <b>SO</b> loud that it drives the killer MAD that he looses it because the agrivatingly loud ba dump ba dump BA DUMP <b>BA DUMP</b>....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwesome book I loved it! The suspense, the drama.\" - you take a bite of a bread roll with a grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family nods in a agreement, Megan looks at you a bit weirdly thinking something is up but doesn't know what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, great book, I read it before in college. I agree.\" - Bill<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh did you guys see those new Superbowl commercials, I think the new ones this year are pretty hysterical.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love the one with Mr and Mrs. Potato head driving, and her mouth gets lost down the cliff, and Mr. Potato Head likes it. Ha ha\" - Bill says, while Helen looks a bit peeved, but shrugs it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the one where that Koala gets punched, and those people are going nuts.\" - Helen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, going NUTS!\" - you say as Jenna fidgets again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My favorite is that one where Chester the CHEETAH told that woman to put those Cheetos under that womans seat and got attacked by those birds. Is it me or that CHEETAH getting more and more dark.  Hehehe CHEETAH! That's a funny word CHEETAH!\" - You say starting to get full of yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna across from you squirms and finally locks eyes with you, you can see small beads of sweat in her hair like she's being interrogated with the bright lights focused on her, and in your case, she WAS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheetah! Cheetah! CHEETAH! CHEETAH!\" - your sister Jessica joins in, in a playful manner only making it all the more sweet for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAN I BE EXCUSED! I GOTTA GO!?\" - Jenna yelps with a creak in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, of course honey.\" - your mother says surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna runs out of the dining hall and to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can I have more gravy? \" - you say with a small grin of satisfaction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna runs to her room and slams the door in a break of nervousness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to get out of here!\" - Jenna says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the phone rings:</span></div></div>",

You put on your clothes which seem to be painting the room as they seem to be scattered everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure seems like something I'd do...\" you say as you begin to put them on. Fully dressed you walk out of Sarah's room to a still house. You walk around a bit, checking for any signs of life. You ear twitches as you pick up a small amount of ruckus coming from Ashley's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer in and see her playing some music on her computer while doing her homework. Ashley is Sarah's sister but unfortunately for her, she didn't seem to inherit the beauty that Sarah was so lucky to grasp at birth. She is 15: has dark hair like Sarah, scruffy and untamed. She is also pretty fat, if you had to make a rough estimate of her weight you'd say around 215lb. You've only really talked to her a few times, you essentially know nothing about her but you did take notice that she seems to be very embarrassed around you. You recall Sarah scoffing at the fact her sister had feelings for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her in a dim witted trance until you finally decided on what to do. You opened her door fully and said \"Hey Ashley!\" She jumped and nearly fell out of her chair. \"Ma-Martin! W-what is it?\" She stammered, trying to take in your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to experience something fun?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Umm.. w-what is it?\" She asks, blushing as you may of accidentally come off sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up the remote like you would a trophy. \"Well, first, have you ever been jealous of Sarah before?\" you ask, noticing her expression changing very sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why would I be jealous of that bitch!?\" She yells, clearly not enjoying the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but chuckle at the reaction and wave her over to you. \"Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe complies and follows you to the entrance of Sarah's room, who is still asleep and in her pure naked state. \"How would you like to be Sarah for a bit?\" You whisper into Ashley's ear. She quickly whispers back with \"How? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain the remote and it's functions. She seems in awe and surprisingly open-minded about the concept. You hand her the remote and tell her to lay down next to Sarah so her body doesn't collapse when Sarah get's stuck inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Ashley lay down next to her nude sister cautiously. She presses the button and you notice her eyes close as she falls asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Sarah gets up, rubbing her head. \"Uhhn..\"<br>\r\nShe looks herself over in awe slowly, eventually looking up at you. \"I'm, I'm thin and pretty!\" She screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou motion her to remain quiet as the real Sarah rolls over with a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gets up and scurries to the mirror and looks over her new body, admiring her lovely features. \"I can't believe being my sister feels this good.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel turned on as your girlfriend's body stands naked, posing in the mirror. You look at her perfect ass until it's image is replaced by her Vagina as she turns around. The image grows larger until you look up at a very seductive looking Sarah (Ashley). \"I turn you on now.\" she states as she begins kissing you. Still kissing, she begins to motion you back towards her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both lay down on her bed and she essentially has her way with you. You didn't choose or plan on resisting as your girlfriend's body was too tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was.. amazing.\" Ashley says in a response to her new experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opens and a sour looking Ashley (Sarah) stands with the remote in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit..\" you whisper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you honestly think I was asleep!? I heard it all.\" She says, as she points the remote at you. In a instant you find yourself across the room staring at your naked body and Sarah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sarah I'm sorry, change me back!\" You scream in Ashley's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah admires her new male body for a moment until pointing the remote at her old body and pressing a button. \"Now go be a good girl and go to sleep.\" Sarah (Martin) says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, master.\" Ashley says, as she gets out of bed and walks passed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then.. what to do with you.\" Sarah says, a unpleasant grin present on your old face.</span></div></div>",

Lightly placed hair along it and a more muscular disposition; larger hands which I pulsate in retractions, easily being able to feel the better grip and strength within them. I press them gently against my chest and cascade them downward, the absence of breasts-- though bizarre was somewhat of a relief. I move them lower and begin to fondle the flimsy attachment to my current body. I push on it a bit, a gasp and moan escaping my lips slightly. I feel it tensing and within a moment, it is stiffening and as stern as it has always been since I previously grasped it with my dainty hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't help but push and play with it as thoughts of how it feels meander through my mind in thousands. I bite down on my thumb as I continue my playful demonstration. \"Oh! this feels better than I expected...\" I say in astonishment. I often wondered how men gathered pleasure from something so weird but I am beginning to understand-- the urge to thrust feels almost instinctive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a thought of being with a woman purely to experience what this feels like at climax goes through my mind I realize my current shame. I shake my head and cover my face for a moment-- the bolder shape of it a bit odd but exhilarating. \"Gosh! Have I no shame? Three seconds as a boy and I am fondling myself relentlessly. Dignity Sarah-- dignity, have a little of it!\" I lecture to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around for a moment, finding nothing in particular. I raise myself off the steps which I have been laying on and walk into the kitchen. I curiously look into the small magnetic mirror on the fridge. Seeing Martin's face is amazing but the reflection almost reacts to my thoughts as I remember what Martin said to me. \"I can't believe he slept with my sister while she was in my body and to top it off, the gross bastard slept with his best friend.\" I spout in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI begin to feel that sex as payback wouldn't be a bad idea. \"Knowing Martin he would careless if I slept with some random woman, it would need to be someone that would really disgust him-- like his sister. He did sleep with mine so making him commit incest does sound like an accurate payback and it's something he'll never get his dignity back from.\" I collaborate to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still... maybe I should just humiliate him to no end at school or something.\"</span></div></div>",

Yet I am about to unveil her brother's naked body to her, I am doing the opposite of helping her become social. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enter Megan's room and she eagerly says \"Hello Martin.\" Still possessing one of the bodies of the only two people Megan talks to, I don't find the eager reply all too surprising but the name given does send yet another thrill down my spine. \"Hey sis.\" I reply, happy that it sounds exactly like Martin-- not that I expected much else. I crouch down in front of her as she lays on her bed, her attention now drifted away from her Manga. I can already feel the pulsating growth in my pants as I even think about doing something so... dirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI place my face lower, close to Megan's while she lay flat on her stomach, a position I could hardly find comfortable with my typically large breasts. She flinches and moves away slightly as a smile brims my face. \"W-what is it?\" She questions, her face becoming red. I assume she has never been this close to a man before, even her brother-- especially her brother. I close the distance between her and answer her instinctive question. \"I just think you look really good today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha--\" She begins but I close the distance completely, pressing my lips against hers. To my amazement, she does not flee, even after the kiss ceases. She looks up at me for a moment, blood rushing to her cheeks. She merely repeats the same hesitant expressions, to which I begin to grow weary of as my heightened state of male being proceeds my current actions. I grab her shoulders and lift her upwards so she lays on her behind. I lift the over-sized T-shirt over her head, she outstretches her arms in aid with what seems like a disregard for any resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I glance at her small breasts covered by a very plain white bra, I think about Megan's situation. She is so willing, I can't help but wonder if she has feelings for Martin despite being related to him. He is the only boy she has ever been with so perhaps she is seeing this more as a dream come true more than anything else? I find myself enjoying this irregardless of the emotions at work, Martin's body is riddled with lust and I cannot find the strength to deny it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI disperse of the small bra from Megan's figure and begin to remove her loose pair of jeans. In a moment she is naked before me and I begin to undo my own clothing which are only impeding the progression of this situation. Both naked, I lay over top Megan who is tense and still blushing feverishly. I position my newly acquired gender and place it next to Megan who lets out a small gasp. I place a finger on her lips gently and she merely nods in agreement. I finally push forward with all I can muster and am nothing but shocked at the feeling of having my penis being surrounded. Megan has her shaking hands clenched by her face, eyes closed and lips moving with her heavy breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue until I cannot bare anymore and I find myself releasing all my joy onto Megan's body. Her position still situated almost identical to the start, she still gasps for air but a small bit of pleasure is visible through her now gleaming closed eyes. I grab for the shorts that lay on the side of the bed and grab the remote from them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On a whim I decide to switch with Megan, for reasons I don't comprehend but I do know that I wish to see her reaction. I press the button and immediately feel a more familiar yet vastly changed body; the body of a female. I open my now closed eyes to see Martin hanging over me, a frightened look wearing his face. With the more natural feelings of being woman present, it dawns on my that I have gotten myself into an awkward situation. It seems I was too possessed with the new feelings of being a man that I let common sense drift away from me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan-- now Martin looks at me in great detail and then at herself, eyes widening as she finds herself wielding her brother's own pride, now diminishing in size. \"W-what is going on?\" she asks in a maelstrom of confusion. I think for a moment on how to approach the situation when a funny idea however bizarre it may be springs to my mind. I flash a smile of stupidity but only for a moment before I begin my acting. I look at myself with a bizarre expression before smiling and looking at Megan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it really works!\" I say with glee, struggling not to laugh. She looks at me for a moment until asking \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run my hand through the dull blonde hair atop my head, pricking a few split ends on the weave through. \"I read somewhere that if you--\" I choke for a moment from how stupid it will sound but try my best to continue the charade. \"--H--have sex with another sibling you'll switch bodies.\" I finish, a hard to hide burst of laughter forming under my lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan grasps her face for a moment, a uncontrollable smile on her face. \"R-really? So I'm...\" She says, meandering off in her own thoughts. \"So you chose me?\" She asks. A dimwitted feeling comes over me as I think of how to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah. I just wanted to see if it was true. No denying it now, it's definitely true.\" I answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" She says as she continues to admire herself more, the same smile prominent on her face. I find myself curious on how Megan will respond to my next phrase and ask it accordingly...\"So umm.. anyways, I just wanted to see if it would work. I'd like my body back so can we do it again? I don't particularly want to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes flash for a moment and she looks down for a moment, mumbling nervous rambles until erupting off the bed in an exciting jolt. \"No-- I mean... well, I want to be you for a bit--- awhile. So you will just have to cope with being me until I get to experience being you.\" I find the answer about what I expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just take my body!\" I shout, sounding mildly unconvincing in my acting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...well you should of thought of that before you... d-did it-- that with me. I'm really sorry Martin but I want to try being you, no matter what. We'll talk about it later.\" She responds while dressing herself quickly and running off out of the room. I cover my mouth as I burst out laughing. \"Ah, how silly. Incest causes you to switch bodies but... it does make for an interesting change in plans on revenge.\" I say to myself as I press the yellow button on the remote, quickly returning out of ghost mode next to the bed in my original body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's face quickly turns to a glare as <i>she</i> opens her mouth to yell at me. \"What the hell did yo--\" <i>she</i> stops mid sentence, placing <i>her</i> hands on <i>her</i> lips, <i>her</i> gaze drifting to <i>her</i> naked body. <i>She</i> looks in shock for several moments before thrashing at me with the same question. \"W-what the fuck did you do to me?\" She-- or rather he asks. I grin at <i>her</i> in delight as, like I expected, Martin was transferred to Megan's body along with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly brush my hair behind my ear, thinning my eyes and grinning wildly with a chuckle. I begin to explain to Martin his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill grinning, I summarize my explanation to him. \"So in other words, in order for you to return to your body, you need to have sex with Megan or so she thinks. I quite like the rules though, so if you do get her to do it with you, you can return to your normal body and life, I promise that much. I don't think it will be easy though, Megan seemed quite ecstatic about her new body. Good luck nevertheless though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glare he gives me merely makes me laugh a little as I find myself really enthralled in this revenge. \"What kind of sick bitch are you!? Making me---\" He starts but I cut him off with a wave of the remote. \"Now, now, you are a click away from being Megan completely.\" I threaten. He folds his arms over his now clothed chest and turns his head away from me. \"Hmph, go ahead. Not much else you can do to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you really want to have the personality of someone who can barely talk to other people I guess that's fine.\" I threaten once again, a finger circling the green button. Sure enough he cries out not to do it and I do just that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K, I won't. Anyways, game start. You have to either live your life as Megan or have sex with your own body. Also, no trying to tell Megan how she really swapped bodies or you'll regret it, just pretend you really did switch bodies via sex, like I told you.\" I explain, his foul expression becoming filled with defeat and turmoil. I turn myself around and prepare to press the yellow button once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, by the way Martin. We're through-- obviously.\" I say as I vanish from his sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do, what to do?\" I ask myself as I hover in Martin's household. </span></div></div>",

I think I'll make Martin's life seem more appealing.\" I say in my ethereal state. I fly about the house until stopping in Jenna's room, where the beauty of the house resides. She is in there, surprisingly not doing much of anything, just laying on her bed. \"I suppose even the bitch Jenna needs a bit of relaxation. Still, I know of way to make Megan more happy with her position as son of the household.\" I say as I ravage my way into Jenna's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit up off the bed, my brown bangs falling at either of side of my face, the rest of her hair up in a ponytail, blonde streaks reeling in and out. I look myself over a bit, thoroughly impressed with Jenna's body. \"Jeeze, I can see bragging a bit about this if I had this body.\" I say, more so than anything wanting to hear Jenna's voice from first person. \"I find it chimes more beautiful when I use it to speak but I could be just obsessing over myself.\" I say. I stretch my arms and with amazement I find her body feels great, her arms feel just as if not more powerful than Martin's and yet maintaining a thin feminine appearance. \"Maybe I should work out a bit more...?\" I question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cease the admiration and leave the room, heading next door to Martin's room. I open the door to see Megan admiring her reflection in a mirror. She is disgusted when she sees me at the door and already begins to cower. I close the door and jump into the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Martin?\" I ask. She looks at me curiously before questioning my motives. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? I just wanted to hang out.\" I respond. She scowls from the obvious lie. \"All you do is bitch and annoy Martin and I-- I mean Martin-- Megan and I.\" She declares, stuttering to correct her current identity. I get up off the bed and wrap my arms loosely around Megan. \"Aww come on, Martin. I'm sorry if I hurt you earlier, I did get a bit too aggressive. I guess I should tone down my acting a bit, but I just need to look tough in front of the family, sorry for pretending to bully you so much. I'm sorry Martin.\" I jest in all seriousness. I actually find myself thinking it would an awful sweet scenario if Jenna really was nice to Martin in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Megan asks, her body loosening up from the preparation of being hit by me-- Jenna. \"Of course, we're super close but I am afraid I can't stop pretending to bully you in front of the family.\" I answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really hurt Megan though!\" She exclaims. I scowl a bit and turn my head. \"Well, yeah. That mousy little girl needs to learn to assert herself. I have no patience for people like her. I know you like her and defend her but I just can't. Sorry. A~nyways, I just wanted to talk a bit but I remembered I have something to do. If you need me just come to me in private, bye bro~\" I say as I further myself from the room and return to Jenna's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will totally make Megan want to be Martin more.\" I say in delight. I press the yellow button on the remote and remove myself from Jenna's body. Flying near her, I induce the quality of being nice to Martin in private into Jenna's personality as to not raise suspicions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna's body was nice. I didn't think I'd enjoy being another woman but it was interesting...\"</span></div></div>",

I reply in the same respect and ask if Martin is home, obviously I know that he is but she confirms my quarry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin! Sarah is here!\" She yells up the stairs. She lets me inside and as I wait for Megan in Martin's body to come out of her room, I notice the real Martin at the top of the stairs staring at me. I wave with a smug look on my face and say \"Hey Megan!\" He merely scowls at me, looking instead at his own body which comes out of the room beside his and down the stairs to greet me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Sarah.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby.\" I say as I wrap my arms around her body and kiss her, lifting a leg in phony delight to irritate the spying young <i>girl</i> up the stairs. As I pull away I take note of the goofy expression Megan has put on Martin's face and can't help but giggle. \"What's with that face?\" I joke. She just discards her eye contact and begins to blush.

It looks like you have been hitting the gym a lot as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going... rather, who are you?\" You ask and as the soft voice escapes your lips your eyes retrieve to your body briefly, reaffirming that you must be in Sarah's body.

Her head shaking plummets your heart into more turmoil but you don't voice your displeasure just yet. \"Sorry Martin. After you did what you did I kind of possessed you. I was originally going to make a fool out or you or even make you have sex with someone as revenge but I decided to try out your life for a little while. Before I knew it a day became a week and week became a month, I never realize that I'd enjoy being a man so much.\" She explains to you and while you can sense her uneasiness you can't deny that your anger overpowers any tiny sympathy you can muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you keep me trapped in my own body for 10 years!?\" You scream, your hands clenched and shaking. She passes a glance at you by rolls her head to another direction quickly. \"W--well, after a month went by my parents kind of thought I was dead or missing and I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to be myself and I was still furious with you so I just let it go by. I think I waited too long. I'm sorry.\" The further explanation while it helps in your deciphering of the situation does nothing for your uneasiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10 years!? Yeah, I think you waited a little damn too long Sarah. I can't believe this-- so why now? Why suddenly undo your stupidity?\" You shout. The volume must crack Sarah's shell a little as she spits back. \"Shut up! Look, I was talking to Jenna recently-- erm, you probably know her has Megan. I kind of swapped Megan with Jenna a couple weeks after I did--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about that! Jenna had it coming.\" You interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well, I started to feel bad for in a way removing someone's existence so I decided to remove you from my body. Not the most exciting reason I'm sure.\" She finishes. For awhile you just glare at her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So give me my body back.\" You demand but she shakes her head swiftly and you quickly snap back, shouting \"Why not!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! I've been 'you' for ten years now. I have a life for myself, I have a good job and I've already gone through college. Besides, even after 10 years, I still find being a man more interesting even if it does make me gay-- though I'd never have it any other way.\" She replies. Her playful smile that appears by her ending just makes you sick. You can't believe that this happening as you glance down at yourself, gesturing her towards your body. \"So what? I'm going to be you? Is that it?\" You question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, yeah. I can either A. Age you up 10 years and let you work out your life from there or B. Keep you as my teenage self since I never aged because of ghost mode and we can work out what to do about my old parents so they'll understand why and where I've been-- or you now I guess. So what do you want to do, <i>Sarah</i>?\"</span></div></div>",

When the two met, Brainwashed Jenna will see treat Sarah as Jenna, even though she IS Jenna. Heh Confusing much?). Program mode can be used multiple times, and you could have a whole family thinking their Martin or someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Traits Sub-Mode-</b><br>\r\nYou can also program certain traits and behaviors to a person if you wanted.

Where the fuck are my dolls? Ah Gwen, Goddammit Gwen YOU LEFT THAT ASSHOLE BEN STAY OVER?! HOW DARE YOU! MAX ISN'T GOING TO LIKE THIS ONE BIT!!!\" - Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bust a gut laughing and a little scared that your pretty innocent peach princess Jessie is acting normally with Jenna's mannerisms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully your folks are out of the house too if they caught that and Megan went to an anime convention with friends at a local gathering place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue laughing, Jenna emerges from the bathroom after a shower wearing an XXL sweatshirt dangling down to her long legs. She doesn't notice you and keeps walking trying to fix her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play 'house', Sis.\" - you say with an evil grin and think up Jessica in your head and hit the green A programming behavior trait button. A black thin beam emits from the remote and hits Jenna. She doesn't move or flinch and continues up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Must have not worked, but something should have happened.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jessica notices you still standing by her door. She changed her hair from pigtails to only one long ponytail EXACTLY like Jenna would have her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Puss booger! Go away you're standing in my spot!\" - Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh go wet yourself you rugrat!\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you exchange mean glares picturing energy coming from yours and her eyes in a deadlock stance. This tyke, you're not afraid of because she can not physically harm you that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever kid, I hope your dolls BURN in our fireplace come wintertime!\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slams the door and you can hear more muffled aggression of her playing with her dolls pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired from the exchange you head down to the kitchen and get a banana. You walk upstairs while looking at the remote pondering thing like why this thing doesn't have a slot for batteries and why it even feels light like a remote without batteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass by Jenna's room where you see something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlasting Miley Cyrus music and dancing around waving her arms and legs in the air was Jenna completely happy, excited and jumping like a crazy person. Jenna even had her hair in pigtails like Jessica always has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, are you okay? I didn't think you'd be the one to like those Disney Channel songs.\" - You say out of acting unaware of what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin. Martin. Martin. Martin. Martin.Martin. Martin. Martin. Martin. Martin. Banana. Banana. Banana. Banana. Banana. Can I have one little brother?!!\" - Jenna says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it DID work. Uh, are you okay? Shouldn't you be in punishment gear whipping the shit out of me and Megan in a dungeon somewhere?\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally I would, but now I wanna dance. Dance. Dance. Dance Dance!!!!!! Say, you wanna have a tea party with me me ME?!\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you wouldn't be caught dead in one of Jessica's Tea Parties because she would imagine in some way or form one of the Teddy bears would ALWAYS die from the team being way too hot. That was Jessica's trademark, but this was different and more entertaining to you so you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I got five minutes to spare, why not?\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!\" - Jenna jumps up and piledrives you to the ground on you back and hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!\" - You land on your back as Jenna hugs you into goo. You can't help but be paranoid as you feel your back become incredibly cold as if its a demon omen and you're agreeing with a deal with the devil or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen the tea is set up with cheap fake cups, stuffed animals and Jenna sitting crosslegged on a chair and you wearing a stupid little bonnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I don't care, I'm enjoying this too much, and I prefer her this way anyways.\" -you think to yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........Oh CRACKERS!!!!!!!! Mr. Burgers! YOU DID IT AGAIN!!!!! Don't drink the tea, and now you've gone and died!! I'll bury you and give you a great funeral, but I won't invite your family from your mothers side because they're still paying from that lawsuit.\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh and roll your eyes when Jenna's cell rings and its one of her friends Alma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Allie! Whats with you?! Me me? I'm not on drugs! I'm just happy happy happy happy happy HAPPY!\" The mall?! Oh GAWD! I WOULD SO TOTALLY LOVE TO HANG OUT! BERNICE IS COMING TOO?! COUNT ME IIIINNNNNNNNNN!!!\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mall? Uh oh.\" - You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen taters, I'm going to the MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL!! Marty, can you clean up this mess and appropriately bury Mr. Burgers maggot infested body in the yard? I'm going out with friends.\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna skips up and heads to her room to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, should I change her back to normal? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, that's a stupid question. She isn't worth being a bitch again. She is going out with friends so I wonder how she's gonna be around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHehehehehehe. I think I'll tag along too and watch the fun and if need be I'll possess her if she runs into problems. Ghost mode sounds like a safe bet.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see the remote. The Personality trait option is interesting too and you wonder what its like to be under a different personality. You could program yourself to be like Jenna, Megan, or even your own parents maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could program Jessica to be a slave for you taking orders and do the change to your personality because it can only be done by someone else and not you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you think?</span></div></div>",

If you make them into a radio or television, then they will mentally pick up signals and speak and \"play\" their commercials and shows by talking. Changing them to an animal will make them act like them of course. But being a lifeless object will more or less be the same. This is if you want time by yourself and don't want to bother with the family much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches the door and you hit:</span></div></div>",

Sarah stated looking in the mirror at her self, What you say next you almost couldn't believe, you saw Sarah grab her butt cheeks and whisper \"I could get this looking good by the end of this summer\".<br>\r\nAlmost involuntary you asked her \"Hey, are you feeling ok?\"<br>\r\nSarah turned around and walked up to you and wrapped her hands around you and said \"Hey, this morning I never had any idea this would be how my day went, but I just feel so good and this just feels right, and besides\" during this moments her armed moved from the back of your neck all the way down to your butt, giving it a nice firm squeeze. \"It feels right for me to take the next step\".<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you sure about this?\" you asked<br>\r\n\"My only regret is not doing this sooner\" Sarah stated.<br>\r\n\"Why so?\"<br>\r\n\"Cause I love you\" Sarah stated.<br>\r\nThen you heard a knock on the door, it was your sister<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah, I packed all my things and they are in the car, you can still back-\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm not backing out\" she said with an undertone of laughter, just give me a minute.<br>\r\n\"Hey, your sister ruined a bit of our fun so why don't you text me tonight and you can come over and we can take that next step\" and with that, Sarah gave you a kiss on the check and walked out your bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched from your window Sarah help pack the car with your sister, you thought about the situation, and to be honest you've never seen Sarah so sexual confident in her own body. You thought about this, and then you thought over you sister and her relationship. Jenna only dated one guy and when you teased her about marring her boyfriend she would tease you right back (though a little more harsher than you teased her), and when her boyfriend was over she was always protective of him and always wanted him to herself. You now started to realize that this might start to be yours and Sarah's relationship. and you wondered about what it would be like dating the new Sarah. On one hand the new Sarah is ready to take the next step, will work on her body to keep it in top shape, and would become fiercely loyal to you. but on the other hand you could never play video games with her (Jenna hated video games) and you don't know if you two would be best friends while also being boyfriend and girlfriend (though maybe having your sister be a friend would be a nice change).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you receive a text message from Sarah<br>\r\n\"Hey Sexy, can you make it to my place in 30 minutes, my parents are out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Gone were the video game and movie posters, and put it up were travel and boy band posters. You then looked at the person in the room. Sarah's hair was done up differently, normally she would just be wearing a ponytail but now she had curls in her hair. She was also wearing your sisters yoga pants and her favorite jacket. She turned around and looked at you, revealing that under her jacket their was nothing but skin. \"please take me, I feel like I have waited too long for this\". Sarah said. you obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">2 months later</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDating Sarah was quite the experience for you. You had a hard time convincing her friends that she has changed, I mean previous before the remote she would spend most of the time with her friends but since her personality change she has been spending most of her time with you, but you made it work. Her parent's thought she was going through a phase but they were starting to suspect that she won't grow out of it. Since Sarah was an only child Jenna's bitchness only came out when people were trying to bother the two of you. You've only used the remote once in the two months, and that was switching over your sisters muscle mass to Sarah (I mean Sarah made a good point, why let good muscle go to waste). Meanwhile, the personality change was going great for you, Sarah now had a type A personality, and really liked getting intimate with you, she became very goal driven and wanted to become a business major now. Sure you couldn't play video games with her now, but she made up for it in other ways. Meanwhile having your sister as a friend was really nice. She changed her major to nursing and you could just chill with her. you were so happy with the way it worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at School Sarah came over for a lunch kiss and saw Jennifer walking by, she commented on how jealous she was that she was main cheerleader and Sarah didn't even think to try out. It got you thinking, should you use the remote again or no?</span></div></div>",

The three girls sat on your bed, blankfaced and emotionless. Unmoving and Unblinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad had already left for work and your mum was taking Jessica to school. She'd be gone for some time as she was then heading off to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what to do now? Oh the possibilties! You figure that the person you want to screw around with most is Jenna.

The two of you confront each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the way, I'm using the john.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm using it first, ladies first you know.\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I find a lady, I'll let you know, now out of the way.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get to the bathroom but Jenna still blocks your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my way!\" - You say pissed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a break for it as you rush past, Jenna pivots and drags a leg under you, tripping you and falling hard on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAACK!!!\" - you say as your head and knee are slammed down by Jenna's fist after<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen little brother, what I say goes, and never forget as that I'm the oldest so anything goes.\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrrgh\" - You say, drag out your other leg to trip up Jenna but as you try to knock her over, her leg is very strong and resists your kick as she leans back making your offense ineffective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that!\" - Jenna says as she closes the door to the bathroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're struggling to get up, but your knee is gashed and bruises, you're suffering from a headache now after hitting your head. You find your sister Jessica staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" - Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! God that hurt! Help me up!\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sis helps you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna's mean!\" - Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only NOW realizing it? Remember this kid, stop listening to her, or she'll hurt you like me. Why don't you take a page out of Meg's book?\" - You say limping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hurt her back if I was older! I'll kick her butt for you!\" - Jessica says as she runs back to her room to go back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, I wish.\" - you say with an glint. Suddenly, you think back and limp to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bed you look at the small device on the bed that's no bigger than a gameboy micro, about four inches by 2 inches. You glance over at the notepad. The scribblings on the pad mentioned something about Aging and there was even a counter on the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick it up and inspect it. You're not sure if this thing is the real deal, but you might as well play along to keep your curiosity in check.<br>\r\nJenna gets out of the bathroom with mp3 player and water bottle in hand and runs down the stairs totally passing by you, but not before giving you the middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPissed off, you run towards your bedroom window, open it and see your sister get ready for her jog. You find the small number pad, hit the purple button once, this causes a small red light to light up. You enter a number on the keypad to 17 and aim it as carefully as you can to Jenna. You push the purple button again and this causes a small purple beam of light to sail, swerves a bit and touches the nearest person it hits which is Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna doesn't react at all, but the distance from your window to Jenna out on the front yard its hard to tell if any change was happening. Jenna just runs off and begins her jog. Kinda disappointed you take the notepad with you to the bathroom and keep reading. You learn you make people believe whatever they want using the Green programming button as well as a personality, with the purple Age change, by holding your thumb and thinking you can make the Age options be instant or gradual in a matter of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis remote is more interesting than you expect so you head to Jessica's room, find her asleep, enter 20 in the number pad, and hit the button again, the same beam of light travels, hits the girl and you immediately notice something happening. The small shape in the large bed begins to grow. You can't see anything but you can tell the person sleeping there has grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy..........................\" - you say stunned you back away and close the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to what you recently read about making people believe whatever you want so you tiptoe down and see your parents enjoying coffee. You put a thumb to the sensor and think of them believing that Jessica was 20 years old the entire time. You do this twice as both green beams shoot out hitting both parents unfazed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scurry back to Jessica's room and find that the girl has tossed and turned and that she's a 20 year old girl. Her normally short shoulder length hair which was always in pigtails is now very long and reached down to her back, you can immediately recognize her, her clothing has magically grown to fit her at this size. She looks to be about 5'7, but even as a young adult, her chest is reasonably flat. You didn't care about that since she was your sister after all, but she still looked strange at this age but still resembled her old 9 year old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to instill fear in her, you revert her back to normal again entering 9 on the remote. You wait awhile and see your mom hasn't entered her room as she usually does to wake her up for early morning breakfast, mainly due to believing that she was an adult and she has her own sleep schedule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait until Jenna returns, pooped from running you find her in the hallway again. You could see she was about 2 or 3 inches shorter than you at least. Your eyes went up to her nose normally, but this time, you were about even height. She looked a little different too and you could see that her skintight bra and pants were a little loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with you? Your clothes look a bit loose there? You lose another 40 pounds?\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw off! I'm tired! I'm going back to bed!\" - Jenna still sounded the same as she pushes you aside and goes back to her room. You wait a few minutes until you're sure she's asleep, enter 9 years old on the remote, open the door to Jenna's room, hit the purple button, as the beam of light hits her causing her to shrink in her bed. She doesn't move or fidget as you see her dark brown hair get shorter, the blond streaks disappear as her the body she's trained to have for years disappears in a matter of seconds......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin evilly, as you're not done yet. You go back to Jessica's room and revert her back to 20 years old. She looks the same as she did on the first try. You smile as you're not done yet as you go off and make a few additional changes before waiting around for the moment of surprise.....</span></div></div>",

An alarm?!\" - the voice says as she gets up, still groggy, finds the alarm and through some trial and error turns it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the covers stands a semi tall Jessica dressed in grey track pants and a sports bra. Her long brown hair reached down to her back, has an average figure but relatively flat chested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jenna's room?! Why the heck am I here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's alot smaller too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling around to find Jenna's mirror, Jessica finally sees her reflection and is in shock....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A........wh-wh-wh-what the HECK?!!!!'

No!\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With being little, you must have my brain or something which means I have a big girls brain now!\" - Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I wanna be back to normal! I'm seeing mom!\" - Jenna says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of the girls head downstairs to where Helen, Megan and you are sitting down. The three completely oblivious to the changes except for you who is holding an inner smile inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma! I'm older! How did this happen?\" - Jessica says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!

I can drive, stay up, kiss icky boys. Wait, why does that sound fun all of a sudden?\" - Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause you STOLE my age you THIEF!\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Jenna, get breakfast, were going to the dentist today!\" - Helen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

I'm going to wash out your mouth with soap missy, now go upstairs now!\" - Helen says in a commanding tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna, defeated goes upstairs while Helen gets breakfast and follows along.<br>\r\n\"Wrong room Jenna!\" - Helen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT MOM!! AUGH!\" - Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, you explode with laughter as you drop to the ground enjoying this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD!!!! That was FREAKING AWESOME!!

Just the switch between us from earlier today to prove I wasn't lying and that's all. \"  - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you two tell me what you're talking about? I'm shocked, I'm an adult now! I dunno how this happened but I LIKE it.\" - Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends, I'm going to go shoot hoops with Marco. You can hang with Meg and she could tell you whats up.

She has an average body, average height for a sixteen year old and didn't really have much to stand out with. She has long frizzy from the bottom dark-brown hair that lead down to her average B-cup breasts and wore glasses that made her look cute with them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the person who liked videogames and loved to draw. She has stacks of rubber cabinets full of drawings, books on anatomy and various drawing subjects. She also has posters of various RPG game heroes and movie posters on her wall rather than those crappy boy band posters. Megan was also a very shy kid who kept to herself. She tended to get embarrassed very easily and didn't like group activities, that made you feel bad for her and tried to help her on many occasions hooking up with some new friends, but it hasn't worked out that much before in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter her room and find her still asleep.in her small bed. You stand in front of her bed and aim the remote in her direction. You press the blue brainwash swap button and then black out. You suddenly wake up to find frizzy hair in your face and it seems you're lying on a bed which you are. You get up and take a look at your old body lying on the floor asleep blurry in the dim light. Megan is inside and she's programmed as you. You immediately jump out of bed not knowing you weight less and overcompensate and almost trip. You look around, but for some reason see everything blurry. You try to squint around and then find Megan's glasses next to her bed and you put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision comes back, in fact, alot better than what you normally see if not better. You run to the mirror and see Megan's cute reflection staring back at you smiling cutely wearing an extra large T-shirt and panties. You stop in your admiration and look at your unconscious body still asleep. You need to take your sister back to his room and act as if nothing happened. You sigh and grab Megan by his legs and drag him to your old room. Knowing from your siblings you tend to sleep like an ox and nothing hardly disturbs you, so hopefully Megan is just the same. You struggle trying to drag him to your old room hoping no one will see, but your arms are more weak and frail that it's tough dragging about 200 pounds of the old you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally get Megan in his room and get him to his bed. Unfortunately for you, now comes the hard part. You have to LIFT your brother back on the bed. Suddenly a thought comes up, why not switch with Megan again but this time lie on the bed and switch back. You realize you don't have the switcher with you, its back in your room. You tiptoe back to your sisters room, grab it and then tiptoe back to your old room still trying to be as quiet as possible. You return and open your closet and sit down on the floor. You aim the remote and then black out again. You wake up to find yourself in your old body again lying on the floor in front of your bed. Just as you get back up, your mother suddenly enters the room asking if you're alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin, are you okay?\" Your inquisitive mother asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah, uhh..... I'm Okay!\" You say with fright hoping your attentive mother doesn't find your sleeping sister in YOUR closet which would be one heck of a weird scene if you get busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay then.\" She looks at you with a curious look and closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is still racing like mad after that little surprise. You climb onto your bed and pass out. You grab the device and hit the button to swap with your sister. You then black out again and wake up back in your closet. You wake up in Megan's petite body again still aching from dragging your heavy body to this room. You get up and quietly open the door and tiptoe back to Megan's room hoping your mother didn't hear you this time.You lock your door clad with drawings your sister did and just drop to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggh, talk about a pain in the ass first day,\" you finally say in your new voice. You throw the device in a side drawer and knock out asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, you awake in Megan's bed after that little episode and get up. You look around and realize your new surroundings. Just then your door opens and its Megan whose brainwashed as you asking to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, can I ask you something?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggy, you find your glasses and put them on and say sure. Your old body enters the room as you get up yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask.</span></div></div>",

You quickly usher your old body out and lock the door behind him while you decide to get changed. You go to your full length mirror and take off your over sized shirt and are a little embarrased to have only been wearing a shirt and panties during that entire time of talking about periods, only a SHIRT and PANTIES. You try to avoid looking at your flat crotch only covered by some panties with a little mermaid desigh on them. You quickly find a bra which is bearly needed and try to put it on for several minutes befoe finalise eeding. You take a hollister shirt and some excersize booty shorts a pair of monkey socks and your sisters pink nikes to go jogging in, something sh never did and began to str jogging ethe length you usually did in the morning.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You're a 17 year old guy named Martin who stumbles upon a unique device that was in a crate that fell off a truck. Its actually a body switch device that you later find out and begin using. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main characters in this are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin Remy (17): You, the main character. You're a junior in high school, you have a big family, a mom, dad, and 3 sisters. You love sports although you hardly play any than watching on TV or going to games, not popular, but not a geek either. You are a bit of a joke-ster and love pulling pranks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom Helen (42): Your loving mother. She's a bit of an overprotective mother always wondering where you and your sibling are at and keeps tabs on you. She does love everyone but feels she needs to know where her poor children are at, at all times which is unfair to you and your siblings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad Bill (46): Your father. He's a professor at a University teaching Advanced chemistry, and is very smart. He's usually busy all day at the college. He's laid back but still a cool dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Jenna: (20): Your eldest sister. She's loves working out and exercising. She's on her college track team, the same college where your father works, and is obsessed with fitness and being in shape. She has a very good athletic figure and is the tallest of your siblings. She's also has a bitchy attitude to boot and is mean to you and your siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Megan (16): Megan is the middle child of your sisters and is the most shy and nerdy. She wears glasses, has average looks, and is usually the quiet one in the family. She loves to draw in her notebook. You and her are in good terms although she finds it rude that you keep telling her to lighten up and meet new people. Has strong admiration to your girlfriend Sarah and respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Jessica (9): Your youngest sister. She is a huge crybaby and will cry at every little thing. She's what you consider a drama queen, and love attention for herself directed for herself. She has an obsession with cookies that will make her do anything just for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirlfriend Sarah Johnson (17): Your girlfriend whom you knew since childhood. You and her are the best of friends. She's a bit of a brain and loves to laugh. She's black, has a great figure, size D breasts and great curves. One of the members in your circle of friends along with Martin and Marco having grown up together. Sarah has a tight friendship with Megan also protecting Megan from bullies. Meg's trust in her was slow at first but now Meg trusts her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParents: Jack (41) Alisha (40) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest Friend Marco Hermida (17): Childhood friend to both you and Sarah. The three of you are very close. Marco is a playboy and a pervert, but he is a reliable friend and buddy who you can trust. Lives with his father and sister Debbie. His mother passed away a few years back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParents: Edgar (45)<br>\r\nSister: Debbie (22)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================<br>\r\nGuidelines:<br>\r\n- No deaths<br>\r\n- Sex is fine as long as its not the focal point of every new chapter. Keep it to a minimum and not make the story all about it. There are other things to do as being someone else, so keep it moderation<br>\r\n- Keep the personalities of every character the same. You can do things like have the characters act like others in another body only if its for shits and giggles and that's it, otherwise keep everyone else the same.<br>\r\n- Keep the story flowing and don't end it abruptly. Keep the story going<br>\r\n- Have good grammar, unintentional typos are OK.<br>\r\n- Keep the story lengthy, as in write more than two paragraphs, unless you are putting up choice options that require more than two choices. This interactive is pretty lengthy as is some of my own entries so keep it flowing with story<br>\r\n- Have fun and enjoy<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n- I reserve the right of editing deleting chapters as I see fit that doesn't throw off the balance of the story. <br>\r\n- When telling the experiences of other people being swapped or others going through their lives instead of Martin, be sure to include whose point of view you're explaining the story from in the form of:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEx: P.O.V: Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Then write their side of the story)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Along with that you could also make the other characters experiences in first person experience (Ex. I went to........ )</b><br>\r\n</td>",
