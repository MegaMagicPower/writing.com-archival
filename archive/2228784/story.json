            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun was setting down that evening as you walked down the sidewalk while passing people of humans and anthros alike as you headed towards Freddy Fazbear's Pizza to start your job there. Though you knew you didn't really need a job during the summer before starting going back to college for your third year since you were 21 yers old. But you figured having extra money wasn't a bad idea, and plus it could help you start to pay off a loan you had to get out when you started college. And usre you figured the pay wouldn't be the greatest, but even a bit of money was cetainly better then bothering your parents about the matter, even though you knew they'd hlep out if you asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you knew that you had to be independent at some point in your life. And what better time then now to do so as you took in a breathe of air once you reached the pizzeria. You then ran one of your hands through your bangs on yoru hair and told yourself, \"Okay, you can do this, Chris. You're just going to be server here during the night shift. How hard could that be since this place closes at 9 and then 10 at night on Fridays and Saturdays?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after givng yourself a bit of a pep talk you placed your hand on the door handle and pulled it open and stepped inside. And upon doing so you looked on and saw that the small restaurant had tables all over the place and an arcade area, a stage where you saw the purple male rabbit named Bonnie, who was currently playing a light tune on his guitar and was only wearing a bow tie, and a pair of pants and a black vest which was currently close though that didn't do much to hide his heavily msucled body. You also noticed that his legs, and thighs seemed a bit tight in those pants, but not too tight to where he'd be uncomfortable or draw attention to himself. And every so often when you looked over at the doors that led into the kitchen you saw a yellow female chicken walk out and place various pizzas on a nearby table who was hearing a white shirt, black pants, along with an apron and chief's hat on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon hearing some kids letting out some giggles you turned your head and saw a second stage to your right though this was much smaller and it had a few kids sitting in a circle while they listned to the anthro fox named Foxy, who was only wearing an eye patch over one of his eyes, and a pair of light brown pants, a brown pirate's coat, and white shirt you thought you saw from the lower part of his abed stomach. Though when he did some motions you saw that one of his hands been replaced by a hook. So this made you wonder if his stories that he told were perhaps true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, you're finally here.\" A voice said, which made you turn to face the person who was now in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had done this you saw that the owner of the pizza franchise Freddy Fazbear was in front of you. And you could see right away that the muscle gutted brown furred bear was wearing a black suit which of ocurse included the top hat and bow tie. Though you did your best not to stare like what you hadn't done for the other two as you nodded your head and replied, \"Yes, sir. I'm your new server. I belive on the phone a few days ago I told you my name was Chris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"of course, why else do you think I approached you? I figured you were my new employee or a patrown waiting to be seated.\" The bear cheerfully replied, before you saw one his large furry hands had extended out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you saw this you reached out to it and shook it. Though after you did this you saw a very large muscled gutted golden furred bear in his own black suit who was walking around in the background, and he seemed to be checking various things. And it would seem that Freddy saw you do this as he informed you, \"Oh you're wondering about that big bear aren't you? His name is Golden Freddy, though he and I aren't related. He used to be used the former owner of this place before I brought it from it. But he stills likes to show up to see how I'm fairing running the business. And he is still in charge of small of the smaller diners that we own as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head in understanding as you then followed Freddy to the back to change into your server uniform. Though you were informed that you wouldn't be serving very many people at night since most people left at reasonable hours. So you'd pretty much be in charge of getting people boxes if they wanted to take any slices of pizza home with them. Or get them any drinks or take home cups as well. And once the patroens were gone you'd then work a few hours after closing time to help clean up and get thrings ready for the next day. And all of that seemed easy enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo once you had changed and walked out into the main room of the pizzeria you did your job right away for about two hours which just flew by. And once the last sets of customers had left you were going to help clean up. But then the question was who'd hlep clean up since Freddy was busy cleaning tables and chairs. Golden Freddy was busy picking up any trash that might have fallen out of the wastebasket. Bonnie was busy putting away his guitar and other equipment while Foxy was busy checking his cove for anything that one of kids might have forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you had given it some thought you decided that you should go and help out....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured that you'd help out Foxy check around his Pirate's Cove. Sure checking if anything had been left behind by the kids might not be the most exciting thing to do. But considering he only had one hand you figured that giving two extra ones to reach for things would be better then nothing. And as you approached him you saw his wide muscled brown coated covered back facing you along with his longe bushy tail as it swayed from left to right above the pants covered outline of his two firm and muscled looking buttcheeks as he hummed a jig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cuased you to blush a little bit though you did your best to get rid of it as you cleared your throat and let out, \"Um, excuse me, Foxy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this you saw one of the anthro fox's ears twitch before he sharply turned around and pointed the end of his hook at you as he told you, \"That be Cap'n Foxy, laddie!\" Though once he saw you were wearing a uniform with a name tag on it his expression quickly changed while he added, \"Oi, you're that new member of our crew aren't you? Chris, if me memory serves me correctly right?\" To this you nodded your head as he kept going,  \"Well why didn't you say that from the start? I thought you were one of those youngsters wanting another tale from old Foxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait if that's the case is that how you greet the kids?\" You asked, a bit more then a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw the anthro fox shake his head from side to side before he replied, \"No, no, most of the kids know to call me Cap'n Foxy or Captain Foxy, whichever they prefer.\" You then saw him cross his large muscled arm in front of his massive clothed pecs when he went on, \"Now why you don't tell me why you came over to me cove, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm well I was hoping ot help you check around it to see if any kids left anything behind.\" You explained, which you noticed caught the fox off guard a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't last long though as  smile spread across his face as he responded with, \"Really? That's awfully kind of you lad. Though remember that I'm the Captain here. So you listen to me when you're here in me Cove, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head in understanding before the two of you got to work looking the stage of the Cove to see if any kids had left anything behind. And well nothing major had been left behind other then some tickets from the arcade machines and a few rings from any toy rings that some of the little girls may have been wearing. And once very part of the small stage had been checked the anthro fox lead you to the storage room where the lost and found box was located to put the items in until the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon entering the room there wasn't much in it other hten a few boxes here and there one of them being the lost and found box. Though upon looking into it you noticed a funny looking gun instead of it. At first you thought it was a normal looking gun, though once you ahd pulled it out of the box you saw that it looked like some kind of laser or ray gun. But there's no way those were real, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since you were so focused on examining the gun you found to notice that Foxy had come up from behind you and was looking over your shoulder since well all four of the anthros were a good foot or more taller then you were as he broke you out of your curiosity when he asked, \"What did you find laddie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, I found htis funny looking gun. But I have no idea if it's works or not. For all I know this could just be some kind of toy or squirt gun.\" You explained, once you had turned to face the anthro fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm, well how about you test out that odd gun on me?\" Foxy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm are you sure about that?\" You asked, not sure how good of an idea this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you saw the fox's hook tap on the gun while he pointed out, \"Well if you look here it seems like there's different settings on this gun. So it must do something right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing him say this you looked and in fact saw different setting on the gun Though it just seemed to have different colors on it ranging from blue to red. You weren't sure what that meant, but if it was a squirt gun at least the fox could just change his clothes. And so you swallowed a lump in your throat and pointed the odd gun at the anthro fox's clothed chest and pushed your finger onto the trigger and fired the gun which then shot a laser out of it and hit the six foot Foxy square in the chest for s few seconds. And once the laser was gone you saw that both the laser and the setting were set on the color.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Green. Green was the color that the gun was set to. Though considering it seemed to be on the lowest setting you were hoping that Foxy wouldn't grow a whole lot. Though when you heard some grunts from the anthro hooked fox you looked up and end up letting out a gasp at what you were looking at. There right in front of you the orange furred fox was in fact growing. But thankfully while his entire body was growing so too was his clothes as well. Though from the looks of it they seemed a little snug for some areas on his even more massively muscled furry body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found yourself swallowing a lump in your throat when you saw Foxy's arms flex every so often even though they were at his sides. And same was for his pecs as they puffed in and out from him breathing in air. Even his abs looked a bit bigger and even looked like he now an eight pack instead of a six pack. And since you already had a light blush on your face it only grew darker in color when you looked down and saw his even larger thighs and legs along with the outline of his bulge in the front of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you looked at him from head to two you heard him clear his throat before he let out, \"Uh lad, me eyes are up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this snapped you out of your gaze as you then looked up at his own good golden eye and replied, \"O-Oh, sorry about that Cap'n. I guess I just wasn't expecting this gun to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, it seems that it certainly does. Though I suppose I can't blame you for staring at me, boy.\" the anthro fox commented, now with a grin on his face. You then saw him flex an arm before he added, \"Do ya have the hots for old Foxy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well...\" You stuttered out since you weren't expecting this question at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon letting this out though you heard the now seven foot fox let out a loud laugh before he walked up to you and placed his hand onto your shoulder and told you, \"No need to be nervous lad. I was just jesting with ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, I see...\" You let out, foolowed by releasing a light laugh of your own. After doing this though you cleared your own throat to regain your bearings as you went on, \"But um what should we do now? Because I doubt you'll fit in any of your other clothes since you're a foot taller now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, that's a good point lad. Though I guess you'll just have that gun with ya to grow my clothes for me. .....Unless there's a way to shrink me back to normal?\" Foxy asked, while he tilted his head to the right a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question actually made you curious as you hadn't thought of that being a setting on the gun. So you looked it from top to bottom and front to back. Sadly though from the looks of it, it didn't look like there was any way to reserve the affects of the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you looked up at he anthro fox with a frown on your face as you told him, \"Sadly it doesn't look like there's any way to reserve the growth. Though maybe I or a friend of mine might be able to fix add that to the gun when I find the time to really look at the gun more in-depth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, then I'll leave it to you Chris. Until then let's go to me ship and make sure that my other clothes are the same size as this outfit.\" Fox suggested, as he moved his hand from your shoulder and onto your shoulder blade. AFter that you then saw him point his hooked hand in front of you both before he continued with, \"So let's make this little trip an adventure shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this from the anthro fox prompted you to let out a light chuckle since you were glad that he wasn't really freaking out about this. Though he did only grew a foot in height. So who knows how he'd react if he gone any bigger then that. And so you both walked out of the storage room and turned off the lights and shut the door. After that you........</span></div></div>",

Plus you figured it might not be a bad thing to show your new boss that you were willing to help out in any way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you walked over to the brown furred muscled gutted bear and asked him, *Excuse me Mr. Freddy, did you need any help cleaning the tables?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce these words have left your mouth you saw the black suited bear look up at you and stand up at his full 7 foot self with a big smile on his face while he replied, \"Oh Chris, that's very kind of you. But no need for formalities. Just call me Freddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head in understanding and then got to work helping the anthro bear clean the many tables and chairs that the pizzeria had. And even though it took close to an hour to get done you felt pretty good about the work you did. You even found some things either next to the chairs or underneath the table cloths that people had left behind by accident. Though after you had pointed this out to Freddy the anthro bear informed you about a lost and found box that was in the back storage room. And while you followed behind the bear you did your best not to stare at his wide muscled back or outline of his two large, muscled, and firmed buttcheeks just like as you tried not to stare at his arms or pecs as he cleaned the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThou you were broken out of your thoughts when Freddy opened a door and turned on the light revealing a pretty much empty room that had a few boxes here and there along with a small box that read lost and found box on a small shelf a few feet away from door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt one of Freddy's large furry hands place itself onto one of your shoulders when he said, \"Alright Chris, you can go put the things we found in that small box over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right..\" You let out, as you walked up to the box and put the items into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this though you noticed a funny looking gun in the bottom of the box. So you figured it worked hard to pull the toy like gun out of it. And upon doing so you saw that it had five different colors on the die of it and looked like one of those toy laser guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's an interesting looking toy you found there Chris.\" Freddy said, which caused you to jump in surprise and turn around to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough once you had done this you failed to notice that your finger had accidentally hit the trigger on the gun. But you soon realized what you had done as you saw a laser shoot out of it and hit Freddy right in the middle of large pecs. Thankfully this only lasted for a few seconds before the laser stopped shooting out of the gun and turn itself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked up at the anthro bear with a worried look on your face as you asked, \"Oh gosh, I'm sorry about that Freddy. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you heard the large bear let out a light alugh before he reassured you, \"No need to worry Chris, that little laser didn't hurt at all. Though it sure was a surprise to see.\" You then saw him rub the back of his neck with his right hand while he added, \"Though I'm sorry for spooking you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, that's okay. I'm just glad that you're okay and this laser didn't hurt you.\" You told him to which you then looked over the gun again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon doing so you saw that the color the settings for the laser gun was currently set to was in fact......</span></div></div>",

And so you walked over to the large stage that he was currently sitting on thanks to a stool in the center of it. Though while you approached you did your best not to stare at his bare arms that were showing due to him only wearing a vest. Though even his large pecs were visible from edges of it which made you swallow a lump in your throat as you really didn't want to stare too much and thus draw attention to yourself or get on your new co-workers bad side on the first day of your working there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you shook your head and once you had fully approached the stage and cleared your throat you told the swix foot rabbit, \"Um excuse me, Bonnie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw one of his ears twitch before you saw his eyes look at you and asmile formed on his face. He then stopped playing his guitar and got up off of the stage and extended a hand to you obviously to hlep you get up onto the stage while he replied, \"Hi, you must be the new guy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. My name's Chris.\" You replied, as you were helped onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's nice to meet you Chris, the name's Bonnie.\" The large muscled purple rabbit told you, as he walked back over to his guitar. And once he picked it up you saw him put it away in it's case before standing back up again you and then went on with, \"So what brings you over here to my stage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know you've got a lot of equipment so I figured I'd help you take them into he storage room.\" You explained, with a smile on your face in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAFter saying this you saw the muscle rabbit's smile grow a bit bigger before he replied, \"Oh, that's very nice of you. Thanks a bunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two of you worked on moving all of his speakers and other equipment off of the stage and into the back area of it. AFter that you then each pushed a speaker down the hallway until you both reached the storage room. You then saw him turn on the light and push the speakers into a corner of the room since there some very large boxes in it. You even saw a small box that said lost and found on it. And when you walked up to it and looked inside of it you saw various things that people may have left at the pizzeria by accident. Though at the bottom of it you saw a funny loking gun with five different colors on the side of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you carefully pulled it out of the box and examined it more closely as you asked out loud to yourself, \"Huh, I wonder waht this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, that looks like one of those toy laser guns.\" Bonnie pointed out, as he approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Huh, I wonder what it was doing in there?\" You pondered, as you kept on looking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows since a lot of stuff gets left behind here by accident. Though no one has claimed that gun at all.\" Bonnie explained, to which you nodded your head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough while you moved the gun around one of your fingers accidently slipped and a laser shot out of the gun and hit Bonnie square in the chest which made you let out a gasp of both shock and worry since you were expecting that to happen at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it only lasted a few seconds and once the laser was gone you approached the purple rabbit and said, \"Oh shoot, sorry about hat Bonnie. I wasn't expcting that at all to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you saw the anthro bunny just give a soft pat on the back while he reassured you, \"Hey no worries man. Besdies I feel fine so obviously that laser didnt' hurt me in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing you let out a sigh of relief as you'd feel bad for accidnelty hurting one of your new co-workers.

If he was okay with it of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you slowly approached the massive bear who from the loks of it seemed even bigger then Freddy was as he seemed to stand at seven feet and six inches. Though even knowing this you did your best not to be afraid as you asked him, \"Um excuse me, sir? Would mind if I helped you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAFter these words had left your mouth you saw the bear turn around ot face you. And at first you figured you'd get a scowl or growl for approaching him. Instead you saw him stare at you for a few seconds before a smile formed on his face while he anwsered back, \"Oh hello young man. You must be that new employee that Freddy had mentioned you had hired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\" you let out, as you found yourself calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's nice to meet you soon. Though no need to call me sir. Just call me either Freddy, or Goldy if you don't want to confuse myself and Freddy at all.\" Golden Freddy told you, while he gave you a soft pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure Goldy, my name is Chri, and it's nice to meet you.\" You told him, to which you saw him nod his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the two of you then got to work picking either a few pieces of trash that may have been missed from the bins or had fallen onto the floor. You also made sure to pick up any items that may have been left behind as well. And once that had been done you were told to put the items into the lost and found box that was currently in the storage room for the night. Thankfully though Golden Freddy was nice enough to take you to the storage room in the back. Though while he walked ahead of you did your best not to blush a dark red as you saw his massive muscled and wide back along with his short tial which was above the outline of his two large, muscled, and firm  buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully you quickly got rid of your blush and staring at him when he had opened hte door to the storage room and had turned on the light. This gave you a view of the room which just had some very large boxes in it along with a small one that said Lost and Found on it. And so you put everything that you and Golden Freddy had found intot he box for the night. Though after doing this you noticed a toy gun at the bottom of it. And becoming quite curious of it you pulled it out of the box and examined it to which you saw that it had five different oclors on the side of it that went from blue, green, yellow, orange, and red on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough when you turned around your legs ended up twisting around you thus causing you to start to fall down towards the ground. But you never ended up hitting the ground as you as soon saw nothing but the outline of a large gut and two massive pecs in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt one of the golden bear's large furry hands gently pat your back again as he asked, \"You okay there, son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I am. Thanks for that Goldy.\" You replied, as you let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, thsi sigh of relief quickly turned into one of slight worry as you then saw that your finger had slipped during your fall and press itself onto the trigger of the gun. And by the way a bit of smoke was coming out it, you figured that it must of shot some kind of laser out it for a few seconds before turning itself off. And upon a closer look you saw that the setting for the gun had been set on the color......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured that you'd be a bit of overachiever and help out all four of the anthros that were out in the main dining area of the pizzeria. Plus you figured that since you wanted to keep this job for as long as possible why not help out them with what they were doing. It certianly woulnd' thurt to do right? And so that's exactly waht you did as you helped out Foxy clean up his Cove after introducing yourself to him. You then helped out both Freddy clean the tables and Golden Freddy make sure the floors were clean as well. And once that was done you helped Bonnie move his equipment into the storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough after you had done this you noticed a funny looking gun in the bottom of the Lost and Found box which did catch your attention as it looked like one of those toy guns. Howeve,r you did think it was a bit odd to see blue, green,yellow, orage, and red color panels on it which must of menat it had some kind of setting on it. And so you picked it up and looked it again while walking out of the storage room and back into the main room o the pizza place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this though you saw Foxy approach you as he asked, \"Oi, what do you have there laddie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure honestly. I looks like a toy gun or myabe it's a squirt gun of some kind.\" You thought out loud to yourself, which caused hte other three to approach you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this happened Bonnie commented, \"How weird, since I don't think anyone has taken that gun out of the Lost and Found box at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it sure is weird.\" Freddy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I think we should get rid of it. Who knows what it might do.\" Golden Freddy suggested, while he crossed his arms in front of the outline of his msssively muscled pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter suggesting this though you saw Foxy walk up to him and pointed the bottom part o fhis hook onto his suit coat as he remarked, \"What's the matter old man? Don't have thrill ofr adventure do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Watch it fox. You might be a pirate and sail the seas in the your spare time. But hat doesn't mean I'm scared of you in the least.\" The gold bear countered, while he let out a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just because you're bigger then me doesn't mean that I'm afriad of you!\" Foxy angrily shot back, as he let out his own growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, let's clam down for a minute here.\" Bonnie suggested, now trying to play the role of peacekeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw Freddy seem to agree with the purple rabbit as he joined in with, \"Yeah, besides what pciture are you guys showing to our new co-worker here. I know we all don't agree on everything. But I know we normally get along pretty well. So let's not let this small issue get to us alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to say your own piece to try and to calm down both Golden Freddy and Foxy. Though before you could do that at all you found yourself tripping over a chair. thankfully you didn't lose your balance, but your finger did slip and hit the trigger on the gun this shooting out a laster from it. But when you saw this you also saw that the laser had hit a nearby napkin holding on the table. And not only that it had reflected off of it and had hit all four of the anthro guys at the same time. Thankfully this didn't last long and once the gun had turned itself off you stood back up and saw all four anthro stare at you in concern obviously wondering if you were okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough before you could reassure them that you were okay you did this you stopped yourself from doing this when you saw that the gun's setting had been set on the color.........</span></div></div>",

That being that Freddy, Foxy, Bonnie, Chica, and Golden Freddy are all anthros and you the reader who's name is Chris, who lives in a world with both humans and anthros. And after getting a job at the pizza place you had gone to when you were a kid. However, when you and one of your anthro coworkers find a ray gun in the lost and found box while in the storage room. Well some BIG things might be coming if you aren't careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Only M/M interactive only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Be careful how big you might grow one or all four of the four anthro guys since they won't be able to shrink back down. So the smallest you can have them grow up to is 10 feet and the biggest is 500 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If one of the four or all four are giants, please do not have any gore, death or toilet stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The growth can only happen/take place at night because well otherwise it'd cause a panic during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Please try to use good grammar. Though I will fix any and all errors if there are any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. The clothes for the anthro guys MUST grow with them. Mostly since well if Foxy's hook is growing with him then it makes sense that everything else would grow too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Have fun.</td>",
