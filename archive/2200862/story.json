            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I awoke to the sound of a door opening nearby \u2013 opening my eyes, I turned to find my younger brother Glenn walking into the room.  I chuckled a little bit when I realized how different everything would be after tomorrow.  You see, I\u2019m in the hospital awaiting a procedure that would hopefully help me regain the use of my legs.  There was a catch, however, and that was that I\u2019d be regressed to a 13-year-old state; thus making Glenn my older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past Glenn, I caught a glimpse of Mom and Dad arguing in the background.  They were too far away for me to hear them, but I knew what they were arguing about.  Turning to Glen, I said, \u201cLet me guess; Dad\u2019s trying one last time to convince Mom this <br>\r\nisn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Pulling a chair up to my bed, Glenn said, \u201cI can\u2019t say I really blame him; I mean this procedure is untested.  What if, instead of helping you regain use of your legs, it kills you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctors wouldn\u2019t have suggested it if there was a chance it could kill me.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cYou can just admit it; you don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready to be the older brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not!\u201d looking at me, Glenn said, \u201cYou\u2019ve always been my older brother; it\u2019s just really weird to think that after tomorrow that\u2019ll be different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be that different, Glenn; sure I\u2019ll be your younger brother, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t kick your ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you think so, huh?\u201d grinning, Glenn said, \u201cYou really think you can take me?\u201d<br>\r\nFlexing my left arm, which was pretty muscular, I said, \u201cHey it\u2019s quite a workout pushing yourself in a wheelchair everyday for 4 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we please talk about something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Sitting back in the bed, I said, \u201cHave you heard from Kat or Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Williams was a childhood friend of mine, while Katherine Maddox was my next-door neighbor.  \u201cEric sends his regards; says he wishes he could be here tomorrow but he\u2019s got a lot of unpacking to do before classes start.\u201d  Looking at me, Glenn said, \u201cKat said she\u2019s going to stop by later; I think she\u2019s more excited about this then you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was 13 years old; ever since I told her about the procedure, she was excited about the fact that we were going to be the same age.  Before I could say anything, Mom and Dad walked into the room.  I could tell they were still angry with each other, but they were trying to hide it.  Looking at them, I said, \u201cPlease tell me we\u2019re still going through with this; because I\u2019ll be really disappointed otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from mom to me, Dad said, \u201cAgainst my better judgment, we\u2019re going to go through with the procedure.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, but your mother is convinced that the potential benefits outweigh the risks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPotential benefits?\u201d staring at Dad, Mom said, \u201cYou mean like our son being able to walk for the first time in almost 5 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want this to work as much as anyone, but I\u2019m just being optimistic.\u201d Pausing, Dad said, \u201cI think you\u2019re letting your guilt cloud your judgment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn and I just watched as Mom slapped Dad in the face.  \u201cHow dare you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose Mom did hold some quilt about what happened to me; after all, I was coming back from the store with groceries for her when I\u2019d been hit by a drunk driver.  I didn\u2019t blame Mom for what happened; after all this time I would\u2019ve thought she\u2019d have gotten past it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what he\u2019d said, Dad looked to Mom.  \u201cGloria, I-I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cI\u2019ve been a nervous wreck all day, I guess the stress just got to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry too, Kent.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s a big day; Marcus doesn\u2019t need to worry about us fighting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have some time to myself?\u201d Looking at everyone in the room, I said, \u201cI\u2019d really like to be alone for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course sweetie.\u201d Kissing me on the forehead, Mom said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be outside if you need anything.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Muting the TV, I said, \u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\nAs the door opened, I saw Mom standing there with a nurse.  \u201cMarcus, sweetie, it\u2019s time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what she was talking about; they\u2019d come to bring me to be injected.  Looking at the clock, a little disappointed, I said, \u201cMan, I was hoping Kat would have visited before this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer mom called and told me they got stuck in traffic.\u201d As the nurse started pushing my bed out of the room, Mom said, \u201cShe\u2019ll be here in a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat had been visiting her grandmother for the day; she lived about 2 hours away.  As I was rolled into the hallway, I saw that Glenn and Dad weren\u2019t anywhere to be seen.  \u201cWhere\u2019d Dad and Glenn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father is calling everyone to update them.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cYour brother...well he didn\u2019t want you to see him all nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he got to be nervous about?\u201d rolling down the hall, I said, \u201cI\u2019m the one being subjected to an experimental procedure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe assures me that he\u2019ll be here for you after the injection; he\u2019s just trying to remain calm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe procedure was actually a series of small injections; containing chemicals I couldn\u2019t pronounce.  Once it was done, Dr. Wilcox said, \u201cOkay Marcus, the injections are finished.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cI included a mild sedative in there as well; so don\u2019t be surprised if you start to feel a little drowsy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Dr. Wilcox.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI really hope this works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wheeled out of the procedure room a few minutes later; to find Dad, Mom and Glenn standing there.  Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were no complications.\u201d Smiling, looking at my chart, Dr. Wilcox said, \u201cEverything is on schedule and he should be finished tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for everything, Dr. Wilcox.\u201d Hugging him, Mom said, \u201cYou\u2019ve given my baby another chance.\u201d<br>\r\nAfter Dr. Wilcox left, the nurse brought me back to the room as my family followed.  Looking at Dad, I saw him shaking his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI truly hope this works out, son; but I still don\u2019t think you should have gone through with it.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cAren\u2019t you concerned that you\u2019re the first human they\u2019ve tested this on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay, Dad.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cAfter tomorrow, I won\u2019t need help going to the bathroom or have people on the street stare at me with pity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that, but there\u2019s still some risk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to walk again, Dad; and this was the only way to do that.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cEven if it means starting High School again, being a little younger is a small price to pay to be able to walk again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not just going to be a little younger, bro.\u201d looking at me, Glenn said, \u201cAfter tomorrow I\u2019m going to be the older brother and you\u2019ll be 13 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut not for long.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cMy birthday\u2019s next week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll still be the older brother.\u201d Pausing, Glenn said, \u201cThat\u2019s just going to take some getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with whatever problems come up.\u201d Taking my hand, Mom said, \u201cAlthough it was difficult to arrange everything with the school, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t handle.\u201d</span></div></div>",

What do you think I should do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin on his face, Glenn said, \u201cIs my little brother asking me for advice on girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my older brother yet, doofus.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cBut yes, I\u2019m asking you for advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you need to talk to Kat; figure out exactly how both of you feel and go from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point I started to feel a little drowsy, I guess the sedatives were kicking in.

It wasn\u2019t long before a nurse came running into the room.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Marcus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy legs feel like I\u2019m being stabbed with needles.\u201d Looking at the nurse, I said, \u201cIs that normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I should answer that.\u201d Turning off the alarm, the nurse said, \u201cI\u2019ll call Dr. Wilcox and have him come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took 20 minutes for Dr. Wilcox to arrive; followed shortly after by my mom.  Looking at her, not seeing Dad or Glenn, I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad and Glenn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mom could answer, Dad walked into the room; followed by Glenn.  I could tell that Glenn had just woken up; his hair was a mess and he was still a little drowsy.  Looking around, Glenn said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to get feeling back in my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly wide awake, Glenn said, \"A-Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could answer, Dr. Wilcox, said, \"Let's not jump the gun here; there are still some tests to perform to be 100% certain.\" Taking a pen from his pocket, Dr. Wilcox looked at me and said, \u201cOkay Marcus, I\u2019m going to run this pen down your leg.  Let me know when you start to feel it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, with apprehension, as Dr. Wilcox moved the pen down my leg.  It wasn\u2019t until he got a few inches above my knee, that I started to feel it.  Gasping in shock, I said, \u201cI-I felt that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn, Mom, and Dad tried to contain their excitement as Dr. Wilcox tested the other leg.  He barely even touched the leg before I could feel it.  Looking at me, Dr. Wilcox said, \u201cIt looks as if you\u2019re starting to regain sensation in your legs.\u201d With a smile, Dr. Wilcox said, \u201cNow let's see if you can wiggle your toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI concentrated on my toes for a few seconds; gasping again when I saw them move ever so slightly.  Mom was unable to contain herself; she started crying as she hugged me.  \u201cMy baby\u2019s cured!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dad and Glenn hugged me as well, Dr. Wilcox said, \u201cI\u2019d advise waiting a few hours before trying to walk, but I must agree that it\u2019s likely the procedure was a success.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streaming down her face, Mom walked over and hugged Dr. Wilcox.  \u201cThank you Doctor; for everything.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once I was finished, I got back on my feet and went over to the mirror.  It was then that I felt the same sandpaper-like feeling on my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalancing myself on the crutches, I undid the gown to get a closer look.  I was shocked to find that my nipples had gotten even puffier then they\u2019d been earlier.  A quick examination revealed they were somewhat firm as well.

When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to see that no one was in the room with me.  <i>Probably for the best, I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t be good company right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the urge to use the bathroom, I reached over to grab the crutches but they weren\u2019t there.  Looking around, I saw they were leaning against a chair about 5 feet away.  \u201cDamn it, what else could go wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was taken aback when I heard myself speak; my voice definitely sounded like a girl\u2019s voice now.  I started to wonder what other changes had occurred during the night.  With no one else around, and a pressing need to use the bathroom, I realized what I had to do.  \u201cWell here goes nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I slowly started walking towards the chair; using whatever I could to steady myself.  It took some effort but I managed to get to the crutches without much trouble.  With everything else going on, it was good to know my legs were getting stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to risk overdoing it, I used the crutches to go the rest of the way to the bathroom.  Once in the bathroom, I saw firsthand how much had changed overnight.  My face had gotten very feminine overnight, and my hair had grown to just past my ears.  There was no mistaking the fact that I was turning into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood there, looking at my reflection, I decided it was best to see what else had changed.  Undoing the hospital gown, I looked down and saw two unmistakable, albeit tiny, breasts.  Before I could even process that, I heard a knock on the door.  \u201cMarcus, are you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t want anyone to see my like this, least of all my mom.  Scrambling to cover myself, I said, \u201cM-Mom, don\u2019t come in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, Mom had already opened the door; finding herself face-to-face what appeared to be a young girl trying to cover herself.  Closing the door, Mom walked over and helped me cover up; at the same time seeing the unmistakable breasts on my chest.  Holding me in her arms, Mom said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-How can you say that?\u201d starting to tear up, I said, \u201cI look, and sound, like Cousin Maddie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a piece of toilet paper, Mom knelt down to my level; which was easy since I was probably no more than 5\u20195\u201d at the moment.  As she wiped the tears from my eyes, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll help you through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t want to be a girl, mom.\u201d Sobbing, I said, \u201cI-I like being a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you do, sweetie.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cBut unfortunately there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to stop this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI buried myself in mom\u2019s arms and cried for a few minutes.  Once I\u2019d cried myself out, I said, \u201cI-I came in to use the bathroom; b-but this was the first thing I saw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d wiping tears away, I said, \u201cI-I think I got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then excused herself from the bathroom.  Once she was gone, I sat down on the toilet.  It was only then that I got my biggest shock of the day \u2013 my genitals had shrunk down to almost nothing; probably no bigger than a toddlers.  <i>Could this day get any worse?</i></span></div></div>",

As he ran the wand around my belly button, I saw something strange. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think something like this was possibile until now.\" looking at me, gesturing towards the screen, Dr. Wilcox said, \"You're developing a uterus and ovaries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather explain it once your whole family is here.\" pausing, Dr. Wilcox said, \"You can get dressed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceeded to get dressed as Mom walked out of the room to get Dad and Glenn.

Of course, I was distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was arguing with my physical therapist over whether it's good or bad to turn into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's certainly nothing wrong with being a girl,\" Mom said. \"When you're ready, I'll get you some new clothes, and help you pick out a new name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, not right now, <i>please.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Glenn asked, \"about how long before you go on the rag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That did it.</i> I picked up my pudding cup and threw it right at his nose. \"Asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wiped the pudding off his face, I saw that the edge of the cup must have broken the skin.

We started watching some TV when my phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at it. \"It's Kat. What am I going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't keep her in the dark forever,\" Mom said. \"Sooner or later, you're going to have to tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI handed her the phone. \"Can you... get her ready for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me like I was being ridiculous, but she answered the phone. \"Hello? Hello, Kat, it's good to hear from you. How's Massachusetts? Did Marcus tell you about the side effects he's going through? Oh, he wasn't specific. Well, I guess the simplest way is to let the two of you talk. Here you go.\" With that, she handed the phone back to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way out, I took the phone. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marc, what's with the phony voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a phony voice, that's what I sound like now.\" I took another swallow of water. \"The side effects are, I'm turning into a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not,you big faker! What's really going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look.\" I took a picture of my face and sent it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God. Are, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as they can tell, I am. It's not like there's a lot of boys turning into girls that they can compare me with. As for my legs, I was getting around on crutches yesterday, and I got a walker today. I'd almost say I was doing better than expected if it weren't for me going girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Okay, but you're not hiding anything else from me, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Kat, that's everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll call you again tomorrow, I want to keep up with this. Don't worry, Marcus, we'll get through this somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dad and Glenn went home for the night, and Mom went to the room she was staying in, the nurse stopped by. \"We've got a surprise for you,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I need any more surprises,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndaunted by my mood, she brought in her surprise. It was a full-length mirror. \"In case you would like to check yourself out. That bathroom mirror won't show you everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" I said, though I wasn't feeling very thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" she said and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, I got to wondering what I did look like, and what all the full-length mirror would show me. I put my legs over the side of the bed, grabbed my walker, and went over to it. Once I got used to my face and hair, I bit the bullet and untied my gown again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still struck by my breasts and my toddler-sized junk, but now, I saw that my waist was narrower than my hips. <i>I'm getting an hourglass figure,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the side, I saw that my backside was growing just as much as my breasts were. <i>I'm starting to look good,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting those thoughts aside, I tied my gown back on and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

I wondered how long that would last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI needed to go to the bathroom, so I swung my legs over the side. I was acutely aware of the way my chest bounced as I did this. <i>Have they gotten bigger,</i> I thought, <i>or am I imagining it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one way to find out. I grabbed my walker and went over to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hair had grown longer overnight, almost to my shoulders. There was no way anybody who saw my face now would ever believe that I was a boy when I checked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff came the gown. \"Whoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy breasts were bigger. My hips were wider. My butt was bigger. The only thing that got smaller was my genitalia. It looked like a baby's. \"Can't call myself Marcus anymore, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime enough for that later. For now, to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I finished up, I came out of the bathroom, just in time for Mom to come into my room. \"Marcus, how are you - oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Guess it's time to start thinking of my new name, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Let's get you back in your gown, before your father and brother walk in here for breakfast.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking at him, I said, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Blushing, Glenn said, \u201cIt\u2019s just you look a lot like Cousin Mackenzie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was my younger cousin on Dad\u2019s side of the family.  Actually she wasn\u2019t my younger cousin anymore; if anything I think she was now a few months older than me.  \u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d Walking back to the bed, I said, \u201cFor a minute there I was worried you\u2019d seen me naked or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross!\u201d retching a little, Glenn said, \u201cTrust me, seeing you naked is not an image I want in my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I climbed back into bed, Mom turned to look at the two of us.  \u201cI suppose this means we\u2019ll have to change things at home.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cMarcus, sweetie, you\u2019re going to need longer to get ready in the morning.  Glenn, you have to make sure you don\u2019t accidentally walk in on your sister while she\u2019s naked or in the shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first time Mom had referred to me with female pronouns.  I suppose it did make sense; after all, I was more or less a girl at this point.  Before I could let that sink in, Dad walked into the room with his phone in hand.  \u201cI just got off the phone with the school; I updated them on our situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey said they\u2019re fine with it.  But,\u201d looking at me, Dad said, \u201cThey need to update Marcus\u2019 file; so they need his new name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone turned to look at me, I said, \u201cWell it was bound to happen eventually; so I suppose we should get it over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave this up to you, sweetie.\u201d Taking my hand in hers, Mom said, \u201cThis going to be your name for the rest of your life, so you should choose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually been thinking about this a little since yesterday.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the name Cassidy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a lovely name,\u201d looking at me, Mom said, \u201cFrom now on, you\u2019ll be my daughter Cassidy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I turned to look at Glenn and Dad; waiting for them to react.  Looking at me, Dad said, \u201cI-I should probably go update the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dad turned to walk out of the room, Glenn took one look at me before quietly running out after him.  I looked at Mom with a pained expression on my face.  \u201cThey\u2019re really not taking this very well, are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in, sweetie.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cBut I promise that they\u2019ll come around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, almost as an afterthought, I said, \u201cI just realized I haven\u2019t told Eric about what happened.\u201d Reaching for my phone, I said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be so freaked when he learns that I\u2019m a girl now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even dial Eric\u2019s number, Mom took the phone out of my hands.  \u201cI don\u2019t think you should tell Eric, sweetie, at least not right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiven your current situation, I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate to tell him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this have anything to do with that thing with Kat?\u201d concerned, I  said, \u201cWhat exactly happened between Eric and Kat, Mom?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Climbing out of bed, with the aid of the walker, I made my way to the bathroom.  Closing the door partway, I sat down on the toilet and waited for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes where nothing happened, I was about to get up when I felt a strange sensation coming from my genitals.  Looking down I was surprised to see my penis, small as it may be, going erect.  <i>That\u2019s weird.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as my penis, and what remained of my testicles, started to slowly disappear into my body.  I watched, fascinated, as the last vestiges of my manhood vanished before my eyes.  What came as a surprise to me was that I didn\u2019t feel any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the strange sensations ended.  Despite knowing what I\u2019d see when I looked down, I found that I was hesitant to do so.  When I finally got up the courage to look down, I was greeted by the sight of a fully formed vagina.  There was no denying it; I was now 100% female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off the toilet, I barely made it a few steps before I collapsed to the floor in tears.  Leaning against the wall for support, I got into the fetal position.  It was in that position that Glenn found me when he walked into the bathroom.  Looking at me, seeing me crying, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at him, between sobs, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn instantly knew what I was referring to.  Getting down on the floor, he sat down next to me and placed an arm around my shoulder.  That was enough to throw me over the edge, as I buried myself in his arms and cried.</span></div></div>",

There was nothing good to watch on TV and I found myself with nothing to do.  Grabbing my phone, I decided to call Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before she answered the phone, I could hear voices in the background.  \u201cMarcus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then I realized I\u2019d never told her my new name.  \u201cNot exactly.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cMy name\u2019s Cassidy now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name.\u201d sighing, Kat said, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad a pretty rough time after I texted you this morning.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI\u2019m 100% female now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat was silent for a moment, until she said, \u201cThat must be really weird for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, you have no idea.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI had my first pelvic exam after it happened; apparently I\u2019m now a healthy teenage girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must\u2019ve been a strange experience for you.\u201d Pausing, Kat said, \u201cI had my first when I was 12; all I could think of was how cold the doctor\u2019s hands were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I could think about was how a doctor had her fingers inside <i>my</i> vagina.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll probably be interested to know that I\u2019ll likely have my first period by tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it from me; your first period is going to be a tough one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, that\u2019s just what I wanted to hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go somewhere more private.  I, uh, want to ask you a question and I don\u2019t want my dad to hear me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Confused, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few seconds of silence.  Eventually, Kat said, \u201cFeel free to say no; but maybe you could, uh, send me a photo?\u201d<br>\r\nI was surprised by Kat\u2019s request and took a few moments to think it over.  \u201cI-I guess I can do that, but I\u2019m only doing above the waist and you have to make sure your dad doesn\u2019t find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting assurances from Kat, I climbed out of bed.  Wheeling the mirror into the bathroom, I got disrobed and took the photo.  Once it went through, there were a few seconds of silence before Kat said, \u201cThat\u2019s so not fair; everyone seems to have a better figure then I do.\u201d Chuckling, Kat said, \u201cEven your breasts are bigger than mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed again, I walked back into the room and climbed into bed.  \u201cNot to rub it in.  But,\u201d chuckling, I said, \u201cMy mom thinks they\u2019ll probably get a little bigger before they finally stop growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now I\u2019m jealous of my boyfriend\u2019s breasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I\u2019m a girl now, does it really make sense to keep calling me your boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d sighing, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019m just not sure I\u2019m ready to call you my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mom walked into the room carrying various pamphlets.  Looking at them, I saw titles like \u2018Your First Period\u2019 and \u2018A Parent\u2019s Guide to Teenage Sexuality.\u2019  I knew what was coming, so I said, \u201cKat, I\u2019ve got to go.  I think my mom wants to give me The Talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun with that.\u201d Pausing, Kat said, \u201cWe\u2019re landing tomorrow morning; if it\u2019s not too weird, maybe I could stop by the hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Your menstrual cycle is a major part of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence the pamphlets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Kat's mother could give her several books on the subject, but I've got to give you the crash course. Once a month, your uterus will get ready for the possibility of you getting pregnant. Your uterus will line itself with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, about two weeks after that, your ovaries will release an egg. This is called ovulation. You and your egg will be fertile for just a couple of days. If you don't have sex, the egg won't be fertilized, and you won't get pregnant. That's where your period comes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks after ovulation, if you don't get pregnant, your uterus will get rid of the unfertilized egg and the blood lining it. This can be a rough experience. A lot of women get cramps with their periods, and they can be very painful. And periods aren't quick. They can last between three and eight days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\" I said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that, the whole process repeats itself, until menopause. That's years away, and your doctor will help you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can anything stop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just pregnancy and menopause. Do me a favor, and don't get pregnant too soon, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm not ready to even <i>think</i> about getting pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you don't need to think about getting pregnant to get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mom, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now, starting with your next period, thanks to your accelerated puberty, you may experience PMS, or premenstrual syndrome. This is basically feelings of irritability and physical discomfort in the days before you get your period. A lot of men say that we go crazy once a month, but that's not true. We just lose our patience faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Any more horror stories you want to tell me about my own body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one: You'll get used to it.\" She kissed me on the forehead. \"Welcome to womanhood, Cassidy.\" With that, she left the room.</span></div></div>",

Thinking back to my talk with Mom, each time I would look to see if there was any blood; only to find nothing.  When I finally woke up the next morning, a little before 8:00, I still felt cramped and bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I looked this time, however, I spotted a rather noticeable bloodstain on the sheets.  Still half asleep, I panicked and pressed the call button.  I wasn\u2019t long before a nurse came running into the room.  \u201cCassidy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face going pale, I gestured towards the bloodstain and said, \u201cI-I think I\u2019m having my period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no big deal, girls have periods all the time.\u201d Pausing, the nurse realized what she said and winced.  \u201cExcept you used to be a boy, and this is all a new experience for you.  Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore the nurse\u2019s blunder, I said, \u201cCan you go get my mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Mom came running into the room with a plastic bag in her hand.  Seeing the bloodstain, Mom closed the door.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cHow are you feeling, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCramped and bloated.\" with a hint of sarcasm, I said, \"Other than that I\u2019m doing great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into the bag, Mom pulled out a box of pads and a package of undies.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d be ready to use tampons, so I bought a package of pads and some underwear for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was right; I wasn\u2019t ready to use a tampon just yet.  Grabbing the items, I climbed out of bed and walked towards the bathroom.  \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was alone in the bathroom, I found myself looking at the items on the counter.  Had anyone told me, a few days ago, that I\u2019d be doing this; I\u2019d say they were crazy.  After getting up some courage, I ripped open the package of underwear and saw, thankfully, that mom hadn\u2019t bought anything too feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I\u2019d pulled a pair of panties on, I quickly read the instructions on the box of pads.  It was pretty straight forward, so I walked out a minute later once I was finished.  Walking into the room, I saw Mom getting off the phone.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cThat was Kat\u2019s father; they just landed and wanted to know if they could visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing back into bed, I said, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you\u2019d probably welcome a visit.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cPerhaps Kat can help with things you\u2019re not willing to talk with me about.\u201d</span></div></div>",

With Mom and Dad visiting the school to put the finishing touches on my return, and Glenn at home, I didn\u2019t have anyone to really talk about it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the PT room, working on my exercises when the therapist walked over.  \u201cSo, Cassidy, I heard you had your first period this morning.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019d imagine that\u2019s a rather disturbing milestone for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cBut my mom and girlfriend are helping me through it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it, then, that Kat and you had a talk?\u201d sitting next to me, she said, \u201cHow did that go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all like I\u2019d expected.\u201d Sighing, I turned to the nurse and said, \u201cBefore I could even really bring it up, she said she was okay with exploring a bit and kissed me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s normal for a girl your age.\u201d Pausing, the therapist said, \u201cWith all the hormones coursing through your body, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what she said after I asked her about the kiss.\u201d Looking at the therapist, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a little weird for me; I used to babysit Kat when she was a kid.  Until she told me she had feelings for me, I never thought of her as being at that point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I could offer you one small piece of advice.\u201d Kneeling in front of me, the therapist said, \u201cTake advantage of this opportunity while you can; because there could very well come a time where both of you realize that you\u2019re interested in something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for me to realize what she meant - boys.  Not wanting to think of that, I simply got up and made my way towards the bars.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cSo what\u2019s my goal for today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn order for me to sign off on your therapy, so you can go home, I need you to reach the other side without stopping more than once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think I can do that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Seeing that as well, Kat said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that; I can help you get some appropriate posters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust promise not to go overboard.\u201d Sitting on the bed, I said, \u201cI may have a girl\u2019s body, but I still have a guy\u2019s brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\u201d Sitting next to me, Kat said, \u201cWhen we were in your front yard, I saw you standing kind of girlishly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, I said, \u201cI was not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing me, Kat said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that, Cass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing Kat back, I said, \u201cI guess this room could use a girl\u2019s touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it could.\u201d Smiling, Kat said, \u201cMaybe paint the walls something nicer, get some makeup for your vanity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is everyone focused on me getting makeup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me; you need some makeup.\u201d Pausing, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019ll even teach you how to use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to worry that you\u2019re too excited about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just looking out for you.\u201d Looking at me, Kat said, \u201cOf course your mom can teach you about stuff like hygiene and all that; but <br>\r\nI can teach you how to be a teenage girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense.\u201d Looking at Kat, I said, \u201cPerhaps my mom will let you join us when we go to the mall later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Inching closer, Kat said, \u201cIn the meantime, maybe we could make out a little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou took the words right out of my mouth.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They came from you. I couldn't get rid of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's so sweet.\" She returned to kissing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe managed to maneuver ourselves to the bed and sit down while kissing.

Of course.\" The funny thing is, the first time she said it, I could have sworn that she spoke in a child's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs agreed, we each took the other's top off, then the bra. Kat wasn't kidding about my breasts being bigger than hers, but I didn't mind, particularly when I felt her hands on my breasts. I had touched them occasionally, but not the way she did. I didn't even know it could have this effect. I did the same to her, and was rewarded with her quiet moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my nipples got hard, Kat began kissing them. I bit my tongue to keep quiet. No sense letting everyone else in the house know what we were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost might have been a good idea, though, because Mom knocked on my door. \"Feel like doing some shopping, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned. \"Just a couple minutes, Mom.

A friend might be more persuasive than a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That doesn't sound good,</i> I thought. <i>Judging by the conversations I've had so far, I can guess what she wants to persuade me to do.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur first stop was a department store. \"Kat,\" Mom said, \"I'll trust to help Cassidy pick out her new wardrobe. She'll need outfits for every mood, school clothes, and at least two dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dresses? No way! I'm not ready for a dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't make you wear a dress every day, Cassidy. But you will need dresses for special occasions, like the big celebration next week. Every girl in the family will be wearing a dress, and you wouldn't want to stick out like a sore thumb, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen me in profile, Mom? I <i>already</i> stick out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe everyday clothes we picked out almost made up for the dresses. Almost. I still had to put up with Mom gushing when she saw me in them. \"Wait until Mackenzie and Chris see you!\" Mackenzie and Chris were my twin cousins. They had been younger than me, now they were a couple months older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the clothes, Mom led us to the makeup counter. I had to know that was coming. But, I had to admit after the makeup lady taught me how to apply it, it did bring out my best features, even the toned-down look that I used to think was no makeup at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the shoe store. I quickly learned that I needed shoes to go with every outfit I had just gotten. The worst part was the high heels. I was afraid my ankles were going to snap. At least I was able to talk Mom into getting me some flats to wear as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sporting goods store was probably my favorite. After four years in a wheelchair, I was glad to be able to run and ride a bike. I got some good quality running shoes (I never would have imagined myself wearing shoes with pink stripes) and some clothes I wouldn't mind sweating in (also pink). I got a brand new bike, a helmet sized for my head, gloves, and elbow and knee pads (you can guess what color I picked out).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the swimming section, I got some one-piece swimsuits, some goggles, and a swim cap to protect my hair from the chlorine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a bikini, Cassidy?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one would look good on you,\" Kat suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was where I put my foot down. \"Swimsuits are for swimming,\" I said, \"and bikinis are for getting gawked at. I'm only interested in the one, thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that shopping, we were all ready for something to eat. \"I suppose you'll want your usual stomach-pounder, Cassidy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" I replied. \"My stomach doesn't seem as big as it used to. Must be the week of hospital food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a salad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\"</span></div></div>",

An older girl went jogging past the house, and I thought of how I used to envy the people who could do that. Then, it hit me: <i>There was absolutely nothing stopping me from doing that anymore.</i> After all, wasn't that the whole point of what I'd gone through? With that in mind, I changed into a sports bra and my new jogging clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my hair in a ponytail and a sweatband on my head, I walked out of my room.  I\u2019d barely made it 10 feet before Mom walked out of her room and spotted me.

That was to be expected, since I\u2019d been stuck in a wheelchair for the last four years.  As I walked into the park, I made my way to the water fountain to get a drink.  On my way there I noticed I was getting looks from some boys, and even a few girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looks from the girls I was okay with; however, I was kind of freaked out by the looks from the boys.  It was weird to think they considered me attractive; although that would probably change in an instant if they knew the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a drink from the fountain, I walked over to a nearby bench and sat down.  Leaning back, I started to look around at the other people in the park.  As I did so, I found myself comparing myself to other girls; how big their breasts were compared to mine, who had a better figure, those sorts of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked around, a couple of kids about my age came into view. They were both athletic, and they were arguing. I guess they must have spotted me, because the girl came stomping up to me and said, \u201cHey bitch, stop looking at my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, she knocked me to the ground with a punch to the face.</span></div></div>",

My... my ex-girlfriend is kind of clingy and jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" I said, pointing to the bag of peas. \"She's got some punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it, \" Mom asked, \"that my daughter was the last straw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he replied, \"the last straw was my sister, last week. Like I said, clingy. Also, there's this.\" He handed me my phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I didn't even realize I lost it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I'm sorry for what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to apologize,\" I said. \"It wasn't your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I don't,\" he said, \"but I needed to say something.\" With that, he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************************************************** </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mom decided I'd spent enough time with peas on my face to minimize swelling, I went to take a shower. After all, I was still sweaty from my run. When I was finished, I blow-dried my hair, wrapped a towel around my waist, and headed for my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom came down the hall just then. \"Cassidy, how about we - Oh, good God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom rushed over, pulled the towel off of me, and tied it on me again, this time, over my chest. \"It's a good thing your brother's not home right now. You've got to learn to think about what parts you don't want him to be looking at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"I was thinking about other stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no harm done this time. And I knew that what happened this morning might have shaken you up. That's why I came to see you. Your birthday's in two days, and we've got the get-together in less than a week. How about some mother-daughter time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What say the two of us get our hair done and get mani-pedis? That should help both our moods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll give it a shot.\"</span></div></div>",

The results of this experiment were negative, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this means we can't be girlfriends anymore, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat sat down next to me. \"We're still girlfriends, Cass.

As I stood in the hallway, I heard my Mom talking to Eric.  \u201cEric, I wish you would have called first.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cThis is a small get-together, and Cassidy is not in a condition to see you right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart practically skipped a beat when I heard that.  <i>Really, Mom!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassidy?\u201d confused, Eric said, \u201cWho's Cassidy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing I had no choice, I turned the corner and walked into the room.  The first thing I noticed was Kat standing behind her dad, who was glaring at Eric.  Everyone else had similar expressions on their faces.  \u201cI\u2019m Cassidy.\u201d Looking at Eric, I said, \u201cMy mom\u2019s right, I don\u2019t want to see you right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked at me for a moment as he processed everything.  After a moment he started to realize who was standing in front of him.  \u201cMarc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Cassidy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked towards me; looking me over as he did.  I couldn\u2019t help but notice he lingered on my chest.  What a pervert.  \u201cWhat happened to you, man?\u201d pausing, Eric said, \u201cLast I heard, you were going in for the procedure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were some unforeseen side effects.\u201d Covering my chest, I said, \u201cI got back the use of my legs; but, in the process, it turned me into a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you, like, a complete girl?\u201d glancing at me, Eric said, \u201cI mean, you definitely have the figure; but do you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to get my dad\u2019s attention.  Grabbing Eric by the arm, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s it; I think you should leave, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eric and my dad got too far, Glenn came back downstairs with Brian.  As soon as Glenn saw Eric, his face turned red.  <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is he doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Glenn, long time, no see.\u201d Pulling away from my dad, Eric said, \u201cI just came by to see my friend Marcus on his birthday, but, apparently, I\u2019m not welcome here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went pale as soon as I\u2019d heard that.  Brian turned to look at me; confusion in his eyes.  \"Wait, Cassidy, I thought this was your birthday.\" Pausing, he said, \"Who's Marcus?\"</span></div></div>",

However, what I saw next was not what I\u2019d expected.  Instead of an athletic-looking 14-year-old boy, I saw a girl with a figure not unlike mine about 36 hours into the transformation.

After watching a few older boys roughhousing in the pool, I turned to Rachel and said, \u201cWere we ever that immature?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering her sunglasses, Rachel turned to me and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think we were ever that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mackenzie walked out onto the pool deck, having gone up to the room to get her phone charger.  Looking at us, she said, \u201cNana\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been worried about how Nana would react to seeing me as a girl.  She knew everything that happened, but we hadn\u2019t sent her any photos yet.  \u201cI guess we should go say hi to her.\u201d Standing up, I said, \u201cAlthough part of me wishes I wasn\u2019t wearing a bikini the first time she saw the new me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wrapping towels around our waists, the three of us walked into the lobby.  Once we arrived on our floor, we walked down the hall and knocked on Nana\u2019s door.  As we waited for the door to open, I exchanged a sympathetic look with Rachel.  We were clearly worried about what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur worries evaporated immediately once the door opened.  Standing in the doorway, with a big smile on her face, Nana said, \u201cThere are my three beautiful granddaughters!\u201d looking at us, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you all give Nana a big hug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't need to be asked twice. The poor dear was nearly crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we finally let her go, I said, \"We were scared you might be more uncomfortable about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNana chuckled. \"Let me share a secret with you girls: Before you were born, your parents were asked a hundred times, 'Are you having a boy or a girl?' And, a hundred times, they replied, 'We don't care, as long as it's happy and healthy.' So, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"If I had it to do over again, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'd rather have a month of periods than still be in a wheelchair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is me,\" Rachel added. \"I'm finally the person I've always felt like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad for both of you,\" Nana said. \"Rachel, I suggest you make sure you have tampons in your purse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be some girl's first experience with a girl like you. Sooner or later, every girl gets caught off guard when Aunt Flo pays a visit. If word gets out before you're ready, those girls will remember you having tampons in their hour of need, and they'll know you were being nice for its own sake.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou know, if someone told me that I\u2019d be sharing a bathroom with you while you did your makeup, I\u2019d think they were crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the feeling.\u201d Putting a light amount of eyeliner on, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t say that I ever thought I\u2019d be doing this, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t even been a girl for 3 weeks; how did you get so good at doing your makeup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKat spent hours teaching me how to do it properly.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cIf you ask me, I think she got some perverse enjoyment out of teaching her former boyfriend how to do makeup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember, initially, being amused by the thought of teaching Rachel how to do her makeup.\u201d Putting her brush down, Mackenzie said, \u201cNow I\u2019m kind of jealous; since she does a better job than I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Rachel walked into the bathroom, wearing her dress and heels.  Even though she didn\u2019t have much of a figure yet, the dress still showed off what she had.  It was when I looked up at her chest that I noticed something off \u2013 one breast was larger than the other.  Before I could say anything, Rachel said, \u201cHey sis, have you seen my other breast form?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it fell between your bed and the nightstand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you used breast forms.\u201d Looking at Rachel, I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wear them at the pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not exactly waterproof.\u201d Wincing, Rachel said, \u201cBesides I also had an incident at a friend\u2019s pool where one of them slipped out of my top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rachel returned with the missing breast form, she started on her makeup as well.  I glanced at the three of us in the mirror; amused by what I saw.  We were all wearing dresses that showed off our figures.  \u201cHard to believe two of us used to be guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d Looking at me, mildly annoyed, Rachel said, \u201cI may have been a guy physically, but not mentally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing her annoyance, I said, \u201cSorry, I-I didn\u2019t mean anything by that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Sighing, Rachel said, \u201cI guess I get a little defensive about that; especially with my dad refusing to accept me as a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo lighten the mood a little, I grabbed my phone and said, \u201cHow about we take a selfie before we go outside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us bunched together in front of the mirror; making kissy faces as I took the photo.  Opening up my contacts, I sent it out to everyone with the caption: <i>My girls and I about to hit the town.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, I got a response back.  Looking at the phone, I saw it was from Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn girl, you look great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">\u201cThanks <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">!!\u201d</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, I got a text from Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m finding it hard to believe you used to be a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou look amazing BTW.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">\u201cThanks!!\u201d<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/blush.png\" alt=\"*Blush*\" title=\"Blush\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/blush.png\" alt=\"*Blush*\" title=\"Blush\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must\u2019ve been blushing for real, because Mackenzie came over and looked at my phone.  Seeing the message, she said, \u201cOoh, is that from your boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend!\u201d blushing even more, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ve only been out once, to the movies, and it wasn\u2019t even a date.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI have to see this guy.\u201d Joining us, Rachel said, \u201cDo you have a photo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through my gallery, I found a photo of myself and Brian waiting in line from the movies.  Showing it to Rachel and Mackenzie, I said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you might have some competition.\u201d Grinning, Rachel said, \u201cHe\u2019s <i>really</i> cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy good mood was shattered when I got another text \u2013 this time from Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look really good in that dress.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf only I was a 14-year-old boy; I\u2019d love to take you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t even been aware that I\u2019d texted him.  I must\u2019ve sent him the photo by accident; looking back through my messages with him, I went pale when I saw I\u2019d sent him the bikini selfie from earlier as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">\u201cThanks...I guess.\u201d</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot to mention, I\u2019m sending you a birthday present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something you\u2019ll get some enjoyment out of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point, Rachel and Mackenzie had walked out of the room.  Composing myself, I put my phone in my clutch and left to join them.  I walked into the main room to find my folks and Glenn waiting with Rachel, Mackenzie, and their mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting compliments from most everyone, I turned to find Glenn staring at me.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cGlenn, now\u2019s not the time for one of your inappropriate comments.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cRemember, I\u2019m your little sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Walking towards me, he said, \u201cI, uh...you look beautiful, Cassidy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing up a little, I gave Glenn a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending an arm, Glenn said, \u201cMay I escort you to the party?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Eventually, I found myself carrying a large teddy bear that he\u2019d won for me.  We soon found ourselves standing in front of a haunted house.  Looking at me, Brian said, \u201cDo you want to try it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m game if you are.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cUnless you\u2019re scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d With a smirk, Brian said, \u201cI was thinking you might be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u2019s in there, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll protect me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes before it was our turn to enter.  As soon as we walked through the entrance, my heart started to race.  I\u2019d never been a fan of haunted houses.  We were walking down a long hallway, as our eyes adjusted to the dim lighting when a knife-wielding monster jumped out at us.  I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that I screamed like a baby and grabbed onto Brian\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping an arm around me, holding me close to him, Brian said, \u201cIts okay Cassidy, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to feel safe in Brian\u2019s embrace as we continued walking through the house.  There were several more jump scares before we finally made it through.  By the time we were finally outside, I was shaking like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were far enough away from the haunted house, I stopped and turned to Brian.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let you take me through there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re outside now.\u201d Hugging me, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can scare you out here, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately pulled away and looked at Brian.  \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what he\u2019d said, Brian began to blush.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cIt was just a slip of the tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA slip of the tongue would be if you <i>accidentally</i> called me Angela.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cYou called me <i>babe</i> on purpose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew Brian had backed himself into a metaphorical corner with no way out.  After a few seconds on silence, he looked at me and said, \u201cOkay fine, I did it on purpose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cI-I thought you wanted to take things slowly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did, at first.\u201d Sighing, Brian said, \u201cThat was until I realized how much I cared about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped Brian was heading where I thought he was.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cWhat are you saying, Brian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Brian leaned forward and kissed me.  After getting over my initial shock, letting go of the bear, I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and returned the kiss.</span></div></div>",

It's only been 2 weeks since my sudden sex change, and I already had a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, I walked downstairs to find everyone sitting at the kitchen table.  Looking up from her eggs, mom said, \"You're in a good mood this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be too if you were me.\" Sitting down, pouring a glass of OJ, I said, \"Brian kissed me last night; we're officially a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was surprised to hear that; begging me for details.  When I'd finished talking about last night, leaving out some details about the Tunnel of Love, Mom said, \"I'm happy for you, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think this is too quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Looking at me, Mom said, \"After you kissed him in the family room, I knew it wasn't going to be long before Brian and you got together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Dad and Glenn, I said, \"Are you guys okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad looked at me and said, \"I'm not 100% okay with it; but so long as you're happy, I'm fine with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, daddy.\" Smiling, I said, \"I can't say I <i>ever</i> imagined I'd be dating a boy, but Brian really does make me happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Glenn said, \"If he ever hurts you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Looking at Glenn, I said, \"You'll be there for me.\"</span></div></div>",

Listening in again, I heard Brian say, \"You have my word that I would never do anything to hurt Cassidy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\" Pausing, dad said, \"You're the only one outside our family, and the Maddox's next door, that knows about Cassidy's secret.

It was the day before we started school again, and I didn\u2019t want to start school without her support.

Looking at Kat, I said, \u201cOh please, what Brian and I have is genuine.\u201d Scoffing, I said, \u201cYou just hooked up with Glenn because you were jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJealous?\u201d incredulous, Kat said, \u201cWhat could I possibly be jealous of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about that I got a boyfriend before you?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t stand the thought that a former boy got a boyfriend before you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Kat to lunge at me.  Pulling on my hair, it wasn\u2019t long before the two of us were fighting.  Kat managed to get a few good scratches in, while I gave her a black eye.  Before we got too far, Mrs. Maddox came running out of the house.  Separating us, she said, \u201cGet inside now!\u201d</span></div></div>",

If it's as innocent as you claim, why did you let me find out by walking in on the two of you swapping spit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't tell you because...

Kat, I asked Cassidy to look out for you because of what happened with Eric. I felt guilty that that happened on my watch, and I didn't want for it to happen again. And you should have been more forthcoming, young lady. Friends don't keep secrets from each other. And it's not fair to blame Cassidy for something that she didn't do and had no control over. Cassidy, while I did ask you to keep an eye on Kat, I didn't ask you to try and break them up if she found someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I can't ask you to pretend like this never happened, but I can ask that you try to move past it. High school is tough enough, there's no sense making it tougher by trying to go it without your best friend. Do you think you can try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her breath, and almost without moving her lips, Kat said, \"I suppose I could give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" I added, the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, how about you shake on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe shook hands almost robotically.

I was so focused on turning into a girl, it barely registered that I was walking for the first time in almost 5 years.  Using the sink for support, I looked at my face.  If I looked real close, I could still see some of my old self in there; but there was really nothing left to show that I\u2019d ever been a boy.  The light brown hair I typically left in a buzz cut was now darker brown and down to my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitated when it came to the next step \u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready to take it.  After a moment, I decided to take off my hospital gown.  I was shocked, to say the least, by what I saw; I now had breasts and a modest but still noticeable figure.  I didn\u2019t yet have the courage to look further, but I could sense something different between my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood in front of the mirror for what seemed like an eternity; until I decided I\u2019d spent enough time.  After getting the hospital gown back on, I slowly walked towards the door; my legs feeling like they were going to give out.  Once I opened the door, Mom saw me struggling to stay standing.  \u201cHere sweetie, let me help you to the bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was back in the bed, Mom said, \u201cBoth Kat and your brother have been asking to see you.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cWho do you want to see first?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I figured Kat would be the safest bet, since she probably wouldn\u2019t tease me as much as Glenn.  With a heavy sigh, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see Kat first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom silently walked out the door, leaving me alone for a few moments.

Until all this happened, I never thought about whether she had those kinds of thoughts.  Then again, until 10 days ago, I didn\u2019t know she had feelings for me.  Wanting to change the subject, I said, \u201cDid I miss anything over the last 10 days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really; honestly, I spent most of my free time here.\u201d Looking at me, turning serious, Kat said, \u201cI, uh, was really worried about you Marcus.  No one would tell me what was going on; it wasn\u2019t until a few days ago that your folks finally told me what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for putting you through that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey it\u2019s not your fault; it\u2019s not like you planned to turn into a girl.\u201d With a grin, Kat said, \u201cI will say though, I\u2019m getting used to the idea of having a close girlfriend my age living next door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t thought of that; with Kat and me the same age now, she would be able to help me cope in ways Mom couldn\u2019t.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI get the feeling I\u2019m going to be coming to you with a lot of questions over the next few weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou taught me how to ride my bike.\u201d Looking at me, Kat said, \u201cTeaching you how to be a girl is the least I could do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued talking for a few minutes, until Mom came in and said Kat\u2019s parents were here to pick her up.  Before Kat turned to leave, I said, \u201cI know nothing can come of it now, but perhaps, after I get out of the hospital, we could finish talking about that kiss you gave me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I wouldn\u2019t say that I was ever suicidal back then, but there were times that I wondered if I was going to make it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the nurses had just come into the room to take our dinner orders.

It wasn\u2019t long before the doctor, a woman in her late 30s, walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Dr. Card.\u201d Closing the door, she said, \u201cYou must be Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Doc.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cLook, can we skip the small talk and just get this over with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, both Mom and Dr. Card were kind enough to let my attitude slide.  Pulling a chair up to the table, Dr. Card said, \u201cNow, I know this is an entirely new experience for you, so I\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you might have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do have one question.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cWhat exactly can you learn from something like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost of the time, it\u2019s a simple check to make sure everything is in good condition.  We also use it to check for signs of cervical cancer.\u201d  Grabbing some gloves, Dr. Card said, \u201cIn your situation, I suspect we\u2019ll also be able to determine when you can expect your first period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hits just keep on coming; it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that I was going to have periods now.  Looking at Dr. Card, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll admit, that\u2019s something I never expected to hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never expected to have to say it to a... young woman in your position.\u201d  Pausing, Dr. Card said, \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to start the exam now; you may feel a little discomfort, but that\u2019s normal.  If you want me to stop, at any time, just say so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exam itself, while disturbing and uncomfortable, wasn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019d expected.  Dr. Card clearly had experience in this area, because it was obvious she knew what she was doing.  Once she was finished, she looked at Mom and me.  \u201cWell, Marcus, you may be happy to hear that you\u2019re a perfectly healthy teenage girl.\u201d  Pausing, she said, \u201cJudging by what I saw, I suspect you\u2019ll probably have your first period sometime in the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should be grateful that I\u2019m healthy.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cThanks, Dr. Card.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Marcus.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cNow, before you go, I have to give you a breast exam; and your mother said she wants measurements for clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breast exam mainly consisted of Dr. Card squeezing my boobs like she was kneading dough. \"Is this completely necessary?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a precaution,\" she replied. \"In later years, you'll get to experience mammograms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We put your breast on a metal platform, then we press it with another metal slab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered. \"And I thought the speculum was bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the breast exam out of the way, Dr. Card began measuring me. She wrapped a tape measure around my rib cage, just below my breasts. \"38,\" she said. Then, she wrapped the same tape measure around my breasts. \"D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D? Don't you mean C?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"D. And, at your age, you're not done filling out yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n38D, and sure to get bigger. Glenn will never take his eyes off of me.</span></div></div>",

As we waited, Mom looked at me and said, \"Once you're back in your room, I'm going to go clothes shopping for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't go overboard, Mom,\" I said. \"I know I'm a girl now, but I'm not sure I'm up for wearing anything too girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just get the necessities for now: a couple bras and some underwear.\" Smiling , Mom said, \"Perhaps I'll even get you something to wear once we leave the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the nurse came back in with the wheelchair; only, this time, she was also holding what looked to be a leg brace. Looking at her, I asked, \"What's with the leg brace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being moved up to the Pediatric floor, since there's no need for you to remain in the ICU,\" she said. \"The leg brace is just part of the cover story your folks came up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a precaution,\" Mom explained, \"in case someone asks why you're in the hospital. Just tell them you tore your ACL playing basketball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse went to work putting the brace around my leg, I said, \"I suppose this is better than telling the truth.\" Looking at Mom, I asked, \"I'm not going to have to wear this at school, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father and I are meeting with the school tomorrow.\" Sighing , Mom added, \"It's not ideal, but we think the best course of action is to tell them what happened.

As we got out of the elevator, I was surprised to see it hadn't changed much in the years since the last time I'd been in here. Having spent almost a month in here following the accident, I was pretty familiar with the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse wheeled me past the playroom, which consisted mainly of a TV, an air hockey table, and board games, I saw a boy about my age sitting on the couch with another girl.  Judging by her appearance, I figured she must\u2019ve been his older sister or something. I saw he had on one of those boots you wore when you broke your foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse left after getting me situated in my new room.

Well, it\u2019s pretty straight forward.  I used to play a lot of sports before the accident; basketball mostly, but I did do some running.  Anyway, after the accident, I was trying to figure out what I could do now that I couldn\u2019t actively participate in sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until the cheerleading coach saw my camera work during a segment of the school news.  Long story short, she asked if I\u2019d like to record the squad\u2019s routines for them.  I would occasionally help carry some equipment onto the field, but mostly I just recorded them.  At first they thought it was weird that I was willing to spend so much time with them, but eventually, they accepted me as an honorary member of the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho from the squad is here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Mom said, \u201cIt\u2019s just Morgan, Michelle, and Amber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, Michelle, and Amber were going to be sophomores this year.  The three of them had grown up together; with Morgan being the leader of the group.  She was around the same height I was now; with blonde hair.  I was the only one outside the squad to know that she used falsies \u2013 otherwise, she was rather flat-chested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle was the shortest of the 3, but also the oldest by a month.  She could be kind of ditzy at times.  I always got the feeling that if she just asserted herself more, than she would be better off.  But instead, she just followed Morgan around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was the one I was closest to out of the 3 of them.  I honestly don\u2019t know why she hangs out with Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mom, I said, \u201cHow did they even find out I was in the hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ran into Morgan\u2019s mother at the grocery store last week.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cI mentioned how you were in the hospital.  The next day Morgan and a few others came to the house asking if they could come to visit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo they know that I\u2019m a girl now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey know there was a complication, but they don\u2019t know exactly what happened.\u201d Taking a breath, Mom said, \u201cIf you want, I can ask them to come back later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cBesides; I\u2019m going to need all the help I can get adjusting to all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then stepped out of the room.  The girls must\u2019ve been waiting close by because I could hear Mom talking to them.  \u201cMarcus said you girls can go in, but you should know his appearance is going to be shocking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Amber, one of the squadmates, respond, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Scott; we can handle it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for this, Amber.</i>  I lay on the bed as the trio of girls walked into the room; carrying what looked to be a get well card and a bear.  \u201cHey Marcus, glad to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, the leader of the trio, stopped mid-sentence when she saw me lying on the bed.  The other two, Amber and Michelle, did the same.  Seeing the confused looks on their faces, I said, \u201cHey guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle, the first to find her voice, looked at me and said, \u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d pausing, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re not Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, I wish this was a joke.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cBut it\u2019s real \u2013 I\u2019m a girl now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to convince them, I had to tell them something only I would know.  Once they were convinced, they looked at me in shock.  As they got over their initial shock, the girls all stood around my bed.  Looking at me, Amber said, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in all, I\u2019m feeling pretty good.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI just had my first breast and pelvic exam, so that was an interesting experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis must\u2019ve been quite a shock to you.\u201d Pausing, Morgan said, \u201cI mean; I\u2019d be so freaking out if I turned into a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI freaked out a little bit after I found out; but other than that, I figure it really hasn\u2019t hit me yet.\u201d Looking at them, I said, \u201cI suppose that\u2019ll change once I have my first period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a piece of friendly advice about that.\u201d Looking at me, Amber said, \u201cAlways make sure you have an extra pad or tampon in your purse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmber, I\u2019m sure the last thing Marcus wants to hear is something like that,\u201d turning her attention to me, Morgan said, \u201cIf you need any help at all, you know you can count on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, after all the help you\u2019ve given the squad the last few years, this is the least we could do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you could even try out for the squad once you\u2019re ready.\u201d Looking at me, Michelle said, \u201cAll the times you recorded our routines, you probably know them just as well as us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I saw Morgan quickly glare at Michelle, but I figured it was nothing.  Turning to her, I said, \u201cThanks for the offer, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to be a cheerleader.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls hung around for a few more minutes until they had to leave.  After they said their goodbyes, they walked out the door.  As they left, I could hear Amber saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe his breasts are bigger than mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why is everyone so fixated on my breasts?</i></span></div></div>",

Grabbing the crutches the nurses had left for me, I decided to make my way to the playroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the room, I saw that the boy was spread out on the couch, reading a book. Going past him, I went to pick out a book for myself. As I looked through the selection, which was minimal at best, I found myself stealing glances at the boy. The more I looked at him, the more I started to feel a tingling sensation in my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my chosen book in hand, I made my way over to the couch. \"You mind if I sit here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" he said, moving to make room. \"Go right ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting the crutches against the couch, I sat down and said, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Looking at me, the boy said, \"I haven't seen you around here before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the cover story, I said, \"I had surgery a few days ago to repair my ACL. There were some complications, so they kept me in the ICU until this morning. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I messed up my ankle pretty bad skateboarding.\" Pausing , he said, \"My name's Troy.

After realizing I hadn't said anything for a moment, I looked at him and said the first name that popped into my head. \"My name's Cassidy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Cassidy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy and I didn't get much reading done after our introduction. We spent most of the time getting to know each other. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but, the more we talked, the more I started to like Troy. He wasn't really tall, maybe a few inches taller than I was now. He wasn't all that muscular, but he wasn't scrawny, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd just finished talking about some of our hobbies, when I asked, \"So, that girl I saw you with earlier, was that your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, she's not my sister.\" After a pause, he said, \"She's actually my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was genuinely surprised to hear this. \"She can't be older than 28, how could she be your mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got pregnant when she was 15 years old,\" he explained. \"After I was born, I was raised by my grandparents. For years, I thought that they were my parents, and that my mom was my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I had it rough learning that I'd been turned into a girl, but that was nothing compared to Troy. \"That must have come as a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to say something when I heard someone else walk into the room.

Opening the door, I walked out to show Mom.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cJust one piece of advice I want to give you \u2013 try to avoid walking around in just a bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that under advisement.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cI just wanted to show you how it looked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks good; but, more importantly, how does it feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to tell Mom that I felt as if I was meant to be wearing one, but I decided against it.

We both started blushing as I scrambled to cover myself.  \u201cH-Hey Troy.\u201d Feeling embarrassed, I said, \u201cH-How\u2019d it go with the checkup?  Is your ankle alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTits getting better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Troy\u2019s eyes bulged out.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean \u2013 it\u2019s getting better.\u201d Blushing, Troy said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe I just said that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Mom was just staring at the two of us.  I could tell she wanted to know what was going on.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMom, this is my new friend Troy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Troy.\u201d A little defensive, Mom said, \u201cPerhaps next time you should knock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am.\u201d Wincing, Troy said, \u201cI-I just thought Cassidy might want to play some video games in the common room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mom could question why Troy was calling me Cassidy, I said, \u201cSure, I\u2019d love to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll go get the system set up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Troy left the room, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cSo it\u2019s Cassidy now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I fixed the hospital gown, I said, \u201cHe asked me what my name was; I couldn\u2019t exactly tell him my name is Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cI guess this solves one problem \u2013 figuring out a new name for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom.\u201d Suddenly feeling anxious, I said, \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ve kind of got plans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019re already starting to act like a teenage girl; wanting nothing to do with her parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s just...I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax sweetie, go play video games with Troy.\u201d With a smile, Mom said, \u201cHe seems like a nice, handsome young man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but blush when Mom said Troy was handsome; not because of what she said, but because I agreed with her.</span></div></div>",

Seeing me, he said, \u201cThey don\u2019t have any M or T games, probably because kids use the room too.\u201d Smiling, he said, \u201cBut they do have a copy of the latest Madden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s play that then.\u201d Grabbing a controller, I said, \u201cIf I can kick my brother\u2019s ass, I can kick yours too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we both sat down on the couch, Troy looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I embarrassed you earlier.

With a smile, I said, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent almost an hour playing the game; I was beating him by 3 touchdowns.  The game was in the final seconds; my team had the ball and was making a run to the end zone.  It looked like Troy was going to catch me, but I got lucky at the last second and scored the winning point.  With a smile, I put the controller down and said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s how it\u2019s done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a good game.\u201d Putting his controller down, Troy said, \u201cI never met a girl who knew so much about football.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If only you knew.</i>  \u201cYou should get out more; there are a few of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back on the couch, Troy looked at me and said, \u201cSo what do you want to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we can get to know each other a little better?\u201d looking at Troy, I said, \u201cOther than your living situation, I know very little about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to tell really.\u201d Looking at me, Troy said, \u201cI\u2019m just your average teenage boy; I like the outdoors, playing video games and watching TV.  What about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh boy, where do I start?</i>  \u201cWell I live with my parents and my older brother.  I start my freshman year next week.  I\u2019m kind of a tomboy; but other than that there\u2019s not much else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt bad about lying to Troy; but I didn\u2019t think he was ready for my big secret.  We continued talking for a little while; during which I learned Troy\u2019s family had moved to town a few weeks ago.  We were going to be starting High School together \u2013 which part of me really enjoyed.</span></div></div>",

She felt bad about leaving me in the hospital, but there wasn\u2019t much we could do about it.  I assured her that I\u2019d be fine and would call if anything came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was lying in bed, with my leg brace off, watching TV, when my cell phone rang.  Reaching over to the nightstand, I saw that it was Kat calling.  Answering it, I said, \u201cHey, Kat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat new voice of yours is going to take some getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much, I was just calling to see how you were doing.\u201d Sighing, Kat said, \u201cI saw your mom parking in the driveway; thought you might be feeling kind of lonely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, actually.\u201d Thinking about Troy, I smiled and said, \u201cI met this boy; he\u2019s our age.  We\u2019ve been hanging out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this boy have a name?\u201d pausing, Kat said, \u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Troy; he\u2019s in here because he messed up his ankle.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI guess you could say he\u2019s sweet, kind of easy on the eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat\u2019s shock was evident in her tone.  \u201cDid you just say what I think you said?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me right.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, I think you have a crush on this guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what was more surprising; Kat calling me girl, or her saying I was crushing on Troy.  \u201cThat\u2019s crazy; I-I like girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus, I\u2019ve known you for years; I know when you\u2019re crushing on someone.\u201d Sighing, Kat said, \u201cI honestly never expected that you\u2019d be crushing on a guy though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t really paying attention to what Kat was saying; as I was thinking over everything in my head.  The butterflies in my stomach, the way I felt when he accidentally touched my hand \u2013 it all made sense.  \u201cOh my god, I\u2019ve got a crush on Troy.\u201d Shocked, I said, \u201cH-How can this be happening?  I-I like girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t pretend to understand the science, but you\u2019re a girl now.\u201d Pausing, Kat said, \u201cBoy's brains are wired differently than girl's brains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat did have a point; boys were wired differently than girls were.  I just imagined that, if anything were to change, it wouldn\u2019t be so sudden.  \u201cWhat does all this mean for, well, us?\u201d taking a breath, I said, \u201cYou were so psyched about us dating, but now that\u2019s all out the window.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, Marcus.\u201d Sighing, Kat said, \u201cWould I have preferred to love you as my boyfriend, sure I would have.

If you\u2019re up to it, I\u2019d like to come to visit tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cYou can give me advice on this whole Troy situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d very much like to meet this guy; make sure he\u2019s good enough for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me some credit, Kat.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I know which guys are the good ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, Kat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after we\u2019d hung up that I realized I forgot something \u2013 telling Kat that my name was now Cassidy.</span></div></div>",

After putting the tray on the table, I wondered what I would do now. It didn\u2019t take long for me to get an idea \u2013 Troy had mentioned he enjoyed the James Bond movies, and I remembered hearing about a marathon on TNT. <i>Maybe he\u2019d like to watch it with me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting my brace back on, I made my way down the hall to Troy\u2019s room. I noticed the door was ajar; I was about to knock when I heard voices inside. I quickly recognized them as Troy and his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed to enjoy spending time with Cassidy today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really did.\u201d Chuckling, Troy said, \u201cShe\u2019s not like other girls I\u2019ve met; she likes football and likes playing the same video games that I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds to me like you have a crush on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed when I heard that \u2013 my crush may have a crush on me. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go that far, Mom.\u201d Pausing, Troy said, \u201cI mean she\u2019s nice, and she\u2019s attractive, but I just met her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thinks I\u2019m attractive!! Moving closer to the door, careful not to let them see me, I continued to listen. It was a good thing there weren\u2019t any nurses around, because they\u2019d probably yell at me for eavesdropping. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be a little afraid, honey.\u201d Placing her hand on Troy\u2019s, his Mom said, \u201cI realize it didn\u2019t work out well with Amy, but I have a feeling this time will be different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to wonder who Amy was; and what had happened to Troy to make him hesitant to tell me something.  \u201cDidn\u2019t work out well?\u201d getting annoyed, Troy said, \u201cThat jerk, who I thought was my best friend, left me for dead because he found out I was born a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped when I heard that; too late to realize that it was loud enough for Troy and his Mom to hear. I turned to head back to my room, only I was stopped by Troy\u2019s mom grabbing my shoulder. Looking at me, she said, \u201cI think we need to talk, Cassidy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I felt like I was being led to the principal\u2019s office as Ms. Wilson led me into his room. As I went to sit in a nearby chair, I noticed a worried look on Troy\u2019s face. Once I was seated, Ms. Wilson closed the door and turned her attention to me. \u201cYou mind telling me why you were eavesdropping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, ma\u2019am, I swear.\u201d Getting scared, I said, \u201cI-I was just coming to see if Troy wanted to watch the James Bond marathon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI-I heard all of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Troy moved around on the bed; bringing his knees up to his chin. He looked upset. The more I looked at him, the harder it was for me to believe he used to be a girl. His appearance was that of a regular boy \u2013 brown hair in a crew cut and a boyish face. There was absolutely nothing to show that he was once a girl. I turned my attention back to Ms. Wilson as she said, \u201cI suppose you have some questions for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to politely say that I didn\u2019t, but I did have questions. Taking a breath, I said, \u201cHow did Troy go from being a girl to a boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Wilson went on to explain how Troy had become a boy. I\u2019d thought my situation was unique; so you can imagine my surprise when I learned Troy was also a recipient of the serum. I wanted to reveal my story, but I decided to wait until Ms. Wilson was finished. \u201cYou see, Cassidy, Troy is transgender; he was born a girl, but knew he was supposed to be a boy.\u201d  Sighing, she said, \u201cAfter he came out, his grandparents and I decided to move to another town, where no one would know. He was 11 years old at the time; he had just started puberty but hadn\u2019t begun to develop yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened as Ms. Wilson continued speaking; how they\u2019d gotten Troy on hormones to turn his female puberty into male puberty. That much I did know; since my cousin, Rachel, was transitioning from male to female. \u201cEverything was going well until about 4 months ago; none of Troy\u2019s friends knew that he was biologically female.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to contain my curiosity, but it still managed to seep through.  \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing this next part has something to with that Amy girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ms. Wilson could continue, Troy started talking.  \u201cAmy was my best friend Max\u2019s twin sister; I had feelings for her.\u201d with some hesitation, Troy continued, \u201cSo one day, during lunch, I decided to come clean with her; about everything \u2013 my feelings and my being trans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess she didn\u2019t take it very well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was shocked, but she seemed okay with it.\u201d Pausing, started to get emotional, Troy said, \u201cIt was getting close to the end of lunch, so Amy promised to meet behind the school later to talk about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point it became too much for Troy; he started crying, so Ms. Wilson took over.  \u201cTroy was all excited after that; thinking he was meeting with Amy to discuss plans for their first date.  When the final bell came around, Troy made his way behind the school; where he was suddenly confronted by Max and Amy.\u201d  Sighing, Ms. Wilson said, \u201cMax started yelling about how Troy was a freak and how he wouldn\u2019t let him go out with Amy.  I\u2019d like to think Amy didn\u2019t know what was coming, but suddenly Max starts beating and kicking Troy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked into silence; I\u2019d heard of instances where people attacked others for being trans.  I just never figured I\u2019d meet a <br>\r\nvictim of such an assault.  \u201cSo what happened next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome 8th-grade boy heard the screams and came to investigate; finding Troy all bloody on the ground and Max kicking him.\u201d Pausing, Ms. Wilson said, \u201cHe tackled Max to the ground while Amy came to her senses and ran for help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was on the verge of tears myself when I heard all that; how could anyone do something like that. Wiping my eyes, feigning ignorance, I said, \u201cWhat does this serum have to do with all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMax damaged Troy\u2019s spine so severely that he was paralyzed from the waist down; because of the nature of the injuries it\u2019s a miracle that he survived.\u201d Pausing, Ms. Wilson said, \u201cThe serum was an experimental procedure that was designed to help paralyzed people walk again. The fact that it made Troy 100% biologically male was an added bonus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was trying to fake being dumbfounded, hoping they wouldn't see through it.  \u201cWhy would a serum designed for paralyzed people change Troy\u2019s gender?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure; it wasn\u2019t something that we were told about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for saying, but you don\u2019t seem all that surprised.\u201d Looking at me, Troy said, \u201cIf I\u2019d just found out you used to be a boy, I\u2019d probably be shocked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured now was a good time to come clean.  \u201cFunny you should say that.\u201d Looking at them, I said, \u201cBecause I was a boy until last week.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ms. Wilson, however, looked at me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible, Dr. Webber said Troy was the first human test subject.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to wonder if each of us had a separate doctor in order to keep us from finding out.  \u201cI don\u2019t know who Dr. Webber is; but my doctor, Dr. Wilcox, said the same thing to me and my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to ask this, but do you have proof to show for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have photos on my phone, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d  Walking out of the room, I returned a moment later with my cell phone.  Flipping to a picture of me lying in the hospital bed the night before the procedure, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s me right before the procedure; you can check the date stamp if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking my phone from me, Ms. Wilson looked at the photo closely; Troy leaned over to get a look as well.  After a moment, Ms. Wilson handed my phone back to me.  \u201cWhy would they lie to both families about something like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe neither Doctor knew about the other, who knows.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cAll I care about right now is that I\u2019m walking for the first time in almost 5 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Wilson excused herself, saying she was going to make a phone call.  That left Troy and me alone in the room.  As I moved <br>\r\ncloser to his bed, he looked at me and said, \u201cSo you were paralyzed for almost 5 years?\u201d pausing, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to talk about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me what happened to you; I guess it\u2019s only fair that I do the same.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cYou mind if I sit on your bed, my arms are getting tired from the crutches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d As I proceeded to climb into bed with him, Troy said, \u201cI suppose, now that we both know the truth, neither of us really needs to the braces and crutches anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know the truth; but what about the rest of the kids in this wing.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep using these until I leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good point.\u201d Grinning, Troy lay back on his pillow and looked at me, \u201cSo why don\u2019t you tell me your story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near as traumatic as yours.\u201d Lying back on Troy\u2019s pillow, I said, \u201cI was walking across the street when a drunk driver hit me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceeded to explain everything that happened since then; from my recovery to learning about the procedure.  Once I was finished, Troy looked at me and said, \u201cOne thing I don\u2019t understand; how come you got younger while I didn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been wondering that myself.  Turning to look at Troy, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t figure that out either; all I remember is Dr. Wilcox telling me that it was a side effect of the procedure.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was almost 7:00 when Ms. Wilson walked back into the room.  \u201cIt seems that Dr. Webber wasn\u2019t told about Cassidy and her procedure; something about wanting to compare the results later on.\u201d Looking at us, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to look into this and get back to me tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom.\u201d Pausing, Troy said, \u201cSo what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go home for the evening; I figure you must be tired of me spending the night here.\u201d Looking at the two of us, she said, \u201cNow I don\u2019t want you two trying anything while I\u2019m gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Troy and I blushed; knowing full well what she was referring to.  With a groan, Troy said, \u201cGoodbye, Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she left, Troy and I decided to turn on the TV, flipping the channel to the Bond marathon.  After watching the tail-end of <i>Moonraker</i>, I turned to Troy and asked, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, what were you like as a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis may come as a total shock to you, but I was a total girly-girl.\u201d Grinning, Troy said, \u201cI was into gymnastics, and never wore anything but dresses and skirts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy retrieved his phone and proceeded to show me pictures of him as a girl.  The girl in the pictures was a far cry from the boy lying next to me.  Most of the pictures were either of her at gymnastics competitions or with her friends.  \u201cYou look really happy in those photos. So when...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did I realize I was trans?\u201d pausing, Troy said, \u201cIt was right before my 11th birthday; when I had my first period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could sense this was a sensitive subject for Troy.  \u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to talk about this if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine; it\u2019s actually nice to have someone to talk with that\u2019s not being all judgmental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a girl who used to be a boy, it\u2019d be hypocritical of me to be judgmental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d Chuckling, Troy said, \u201cAnyway, my first period came and I hated it.  I heard some of my classmates talking about how excited they were when theirs started, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I wasn\u2019t supposed to have one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Troy discussing his period reminded me that I was due for my first period at any time.  \u201cThe gynecologist said I\u2019m due for mine any day now; I\u2019m not looking forward to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get through it, just like I did.\u201d Pausing, Troy said, \u201cHow about you, what were you like as a boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore the accident, I loved being outdoors, so it was quite an adjustment once I was paralyzed.\u201d Sighing, I continued, \u201cThere were some tough times after the accident, but I managed to get through with the help of my family and friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I had that kind of support system after my accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Troy, I saw him tearing up a little.  Taking his hand in mine, I said, \u201cYou got through it, Troy; now you\u2019re the person you were meant to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Cassidy.\u201d Wiping his tears, Troy said, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t sound mean, but I\u2019m really glad we\u2019re both in the hospital right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, I said, \u201cSame here, Troy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed before a nurse came into the room.  Seeing the two of us in bed, she said, \u201cI hope you guys weren\u2019t doing anything inappropriate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am, we\u2019re just watching TV.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I hate to put a damper on things, but it\u2019s time for you guys to go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter acknowledging the nurse, I climbed out of bed and started towards the door.  Before leaving, I turned to Troy and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Troy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you tomorrow, Cassidy.\u201d Almost as an afterthought, Troy looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m curious; what was your name...before all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTracy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I told him how I\u2019d met Troy, and how we got along so well.

I\u2019m attracted to Troy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d expected Glenn to be surprised by that revelation; his older brother turned little sister just admitted that she was attracted to a boy.

It was three buttermilk pancakes, three sunny-side up eggs, two strips of crisp bacon, two sausage links, a thick slice of hickory smoked ham, a baked potato and a tall glass of milk to wash it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to eat all of this?!\" Stunned, I asked. \"I'm not that hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor gave strict instructions that you get a big meal this morning.\" Calmly, the nurse said. \"Eat as much as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was reluctantly eating the impossibly huge meal, a doctor I have not met before came in with my family who were understandably nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Doctor Shawn Hal.\" Politely, he said. \"I will be administering the injections that will hopefully restore feeling and movement to your legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by hopefully?\" Concerned, dad demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The procedure is still in its experimental phase, Mr. Scott.\" Patiently, Shawn replied. \"You were informed of this before your son was even considered for clearance to receive this treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly does the procedure work, doctor?\" Wincing, Glenn asked. \"Are there any  side effects other than him regressing in age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The procedure is simply a number of injections that trick your son's body and brain into thinking it is still developing.\" Serious, Shawn explained. \"All damaged areas of the body will essentially be rebuilt by his own internal systems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it have to do with me having to eat all of this?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, dad, and Glenn all looked at the huge breakfast I had been given then turned to Sandra, their eyes demanding an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a human being is developing in the womb, they take raw material from the mother in the form of nutrients which is why their appetite increases.\" Calmly, Shawn said. \"Your son's body will be rebuilding itself from nutrients already within him, hence the unusual side effect of age regression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, without the extra nutrients, he would regress further?\" Stunned, dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn nodded. \"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a small wonder why they had been gorging you the moment you came in here.\" Bemused,  mom said. \"You already look two months pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha...\" With a half grin, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The procedure will be given to you shortly before lunch is served.\" Calmly, Shawn said. \"By then, your breakfast should be for the most part digested.\" He then <br>\r\nleft the room to talk to Dr. Wilcox. I did not learn of their conversation until later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you tell them of the newly discovered side effect of the procedure?\" Worried Dr. Wilcox asked. \"I understand that it only happened once in clinical trials on mice but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is listed as one of the many possible side effects but it is marked as rare.\" Lightly, Shawn said. \"The chances of it happening are so remote why worry or even frighten them with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wilcox was not impressed. \"Would you not like to know if your son faces the possibility of losing all of his Y chromosomes and reverting to the female state?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to my room to find my parents and Glenn leaving, presumably to get some breakfast for themselves.  Later...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had just finished the massive breakfast and was about to buzz the nurse when four of them walked in with Dr. Hal following them in. All of them seemed nervous, which made me concerned. \"What's going on?\" Wincing, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has been a slight change in plans.\" In a forced calm, Dr. Hal said. \"The time for your procedure had been moved up.\" He looked towards the door as the nurses began to disconnect me from the monitoring stations then muttered, \"Quickly now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't it wait until my family gets back?\" Worried, I asked. \"They'll want to see me off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The procedure takes a little under an hour.\" Serious, Dr. Hal said. \"You will be back in your room before they even get back from running their errands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the click of my bed being released from the wall before I found myself being wheeled out of the room. \"Wait!\" Startled, I demanded. \"I just finished eating! Isn't the meal supposed to digest first?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to worry about, dear boy.\" Calmly, Dr. Hal said. \"Just rest and leave the rest to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to protest further, but I felt a slight sting in my arm that sent my mind spinning, before I plummeted into darkness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like only a moment that I was out cold but regaining consciousness was a bit of a struggle. Everything, inside and out was in torturous pain. It felt as if my body had been thrown into a giant blender and reduced to a pasty mess. I heard myself moan, which hurt my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's coming to...\" I heard a familiar voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already...?\"  Surprised, another voice asked. \"I guess you were right when you said he was a tough kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt something cold touch my chest, causing me to moan again as even the slightest touch seemed to hurt me. \"Sorry.\" said the low voice. \"You are going to be very sensitive for a while.\" he paused then the cold object was lifted. \"His vitals have all returned to normal, the worst is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a few sighs of relief around me and then a 'beep beep beep' somewhere nearby. By this time, I was conscious enough to realize that it was a vitals monitoring machine. Only was I back in my hospital room? Or was I still with that crazy Dr. Hal. I tried to shift positions as I was very uncomfortable but it hurt too much to move and I moaned again. \"He's starting to stir.\" I heard Glenn say. \"Hay, bro, can you hear me? Open your eyes, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did my best to do so but the light of the room stabbed my eyes, causing another moan to escape my lips as I snapped them shut again. A moment later, I felt the lights dim and I made a second attempt. This time I was able to keep them open and my eyes soon focused to see my family looking over me, smiling with tear stained faces. \"Welcome back to the world of the living, bro.\" Smiling, Glenn said. \"You gave us all quite the scare.\" He paused. \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to answer but it hurt to even moan. Still, I managed to quietly say two words. \"All hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn did not hear me and asked me to repeat it but mom cut him off. \"He said everything hurts, Glenn.\" Serious, she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard that from the other side of the bed?\" asked Glenn, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"When you work with children, sent to the ER for ten years like I have, you too will develop a good ear.\" Calmly, she said. \"I'm not surprised that everything hurts... He went from a tall, well built seventeen year old to a short, thin thirteen year old in less than four hours.\" she managed a small grin. \"Talk about a crash diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI weakly laughed at that but it came out sounding like a raspy cough, though I had a grin on my face. Seeing it, dad smiled. \"I'm glad that you can still laugh, kiddo.\" Softly, he said. \"I know everything hurts so, for now, just listen.\" He turned to a person out of my line of sight. \"Doctor Wilcox...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A mouse went from male to female in one of the test runs? I did not remember this ever being mentioned before, it was a bit alarming. With the added fact that the procedure being rushed might make the risk greater, I was feeling more than a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back first thing tomorrow, sweetie.\" Interrupting my thoughts, mom said. \"Glenn will be staying here with you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blew me a kiss then I heard her walking out of the room before Glenn's face came into view. \"Don't worry... little bro.\" Smiling, he said. \"You and I had enough rounds of fisticuffs to know who's still the top dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave another raspy laugh, knowing my brother's sense of humor. Dad would always stop any fight we had by offering us to take him on instead. We were smart enough not to take on a retired heavyweight champion. \"We... will... see...\" Grunting, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn smiled back. \"Get well soon, bro.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Glenn, who was watching television at the moment, heard my moan and hurried over to me as I opened my eyes and saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, bro.\" With a smile, he said. \"Feeling any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit.\" Wincing, I replied. \"Everything still hurts, though just not as bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you can talk better.\" Calmly, Glenn said. \"You've been unconscious for nearly ten hours, it's seven at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened in surprise. \"I slept the entire day!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn sighed. \"I'm afraid so.\" Softly, he said. \"I was scared that you had slipped into a coma or something for a while there.\" He paused, thinking. \"Do you feel up to having something to eat, you haven't had anything since that huge breakfast this morning and I think the procedure took all of that out of you.\" He gave a chuckle after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Worried, I said. \"I don't know if anything will stay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could run across the street and get you one of those nutrient shakes Kat got you hooked on.\" Kindly, Glenn offered. \"You have to eat something, Marcus, you need to rebuild your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not like the idea of Glenn leaving me alone for any amount of time knowing that quack doctor Hal could still running about, not that I'd tell him that. \"Maybe... Maybe I can try a hot bowl of chicken noodle soup.\" Trying to sit up, I said. \"The cafeteria should still be open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out.\" Grabbing the phone, Glenn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dialed the proper number and got the kitchen on the second ring. \"This is Glenn Scott in room 442.\" Calmly, he said. \"My brother, Marcus finally woke up and he would like to order a bowl of chicken noodle soup, please.\" There was a pause before he turned to me. \"Would you like some crackers with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced. \"Some white bread would be nice.\" My voice suddenly slightly higher, I said. \"Maybe some milk to wash it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn nodded, though he gave me a strange look and turned to the phone. \"He would like a few slices of white bread and a carton of white milk, please.\" Calmly, he said. There was another pause. \"Me? Oh, I'll have the same, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ending the call, he turned back to me and smiled as he found that I had managed to reach the bed controls to sit myself up. \"It's good to see you sitting up after lying motionless all day.\" Firmly, he said. \"You better try to get to the bathroom before your dinner gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my brother, uncertain. I knew that he he had helped me to the bathroom many times in the past but it was still embarrassing. Then again, it was that or have the nurses use some method for me to pee in bed, which did not appeal to me at all. \"I... I might need more help than normal.\" Blushing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here, bro.\" Firmly but kindly, Glenn said. \"I'll get you to the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully, I managed to slide off the bed. I was aiming to move right to the wheelchair only Glenn forgot to lock the wheels and it moved out from under me! Startled, I grabbed the railing of the bed and... stood up! I was standing! Standing upon my own two feet! Only before I could celebrate, the pain throughout my body caused my legs to cramp and I cried out, nearly collapsing onto the floor. Fortunately, Glenn was there to catch me and hold me up onto my feet. \"Easy now, little bro.\" With a chuckle, he said. \"One step at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed right beside me, helping me to steady myself as I took my first step. I felt my knees shake as I had not had the use of my legs in four years. Still, I was walking, actually walking! \"I feel like a baby taking my first steps.\" With a half grin, I muttered. \"It's exciting but yet so embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're walking bro, that alone is a miracle.\" Comforting me, Glenn said. \"Just look at yourself, you've lost five years and over fifty pounds within two hours after that quack not only went ahead with the procedure early but rushed it.  Such a shock to the body would have killed anyone else!\" He then gave me a grin. \"Now here you are, ten short hours later, already walking to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that. \"I didn't think about it that way... I guess I am very lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bathroom, Glenn blushed as she pulled my drawers down and guided me down onto the toilet. \"I'll give you some privacy.\" After washing his hands, he said. \"Just call me when you are ready to go back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as Glenn then left the bathroom and closed the door. Unknown to me, he suppressed a shudder and whispered, \"I just hope he doesn't get that weird side effect Dr. Wilcox told us about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, I was back in bed and noticed that Glenn suddenly seemed pale. I asked him about it to which he replied, \"I'm just tired, bro. It's been a long day for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then turned to the door as someone had knocked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The aroma that kissed my nostrils forced me to moan with a certain delight. Before I knew what was happening, I was hungrily but politely devouring the soup. As Glenn worked on his own dinner, he occasionally glanced over to me and chuckled, seeing how hungry I really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your going to need seconds.\" Amused, he said. \"I think there's a twenty four hour take out place nearby. I'll call dad and see if he can pick something up, he and mom should be on their way to relieve me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then we both quietly finished our meal before Glenn made a quick call to dad. \"I can't believe I'm still hungry.\" Hearing my stomach grumble, I said. \"That was a good sized bowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, that procedure left you skinny as a twig which meant it must have burned an insane amount of calories.\" Looking at me, Glenn said. \"Don't worry, dad is on his way up with some sandwiches from the take out place next door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled but it flattened as a thought came to me. \"Um...

Still, I highly doubt the staff would allow him to experiment on unsuspecting people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered at the thought of Dr. Hal experimenting on anyone as it seems he had done to me. \"He seems too excited by this breakthrough, even though its not really his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell mom and dad of your concerns.\" Softly, Glenn promised. \"Still, I'm fairly sure that is the last you've seen of Dr. Hal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Glenn was listening to his favorite tunes, running in beat to the music. I had stopped and was watching him when suddenly, I saw his chest beginning to slowly expand slightly with each controlled breath as he ran at a steady pace. His hair began to grow slightly with each landing of his foot. He began to hum to the music, apparently feeling nothing. His body became more slender before my eyes as a certain bulge in his sweat pants fell completely flat. Within seconds, there was no doubt in my mind, Glenn had transformed into a real girl. I turned to call his attention but screamed as I caught myself in a mirror on the wall. The same had happened to me! Then, I saw Dr. Hal looking into the window of the gym, a sinister smile on his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke with a start, raising a hand to my chest and froze... There was a noticeable lump there. Panicked, I ripped open my hospital gown to find that my chest was red and puffy! I began to hyperventilate in fear but managed to hit the call button. A tall redheaded woman I had come to know as nurse Fawn soon entered and saw my bare chest. A gasp escaped her lips before she called for more nurses. \"Get Dr. Wilcox, now!\" Firmly, the nurse barked. \"It's happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the other nurses ran off to call the doctor, Fawn hurried over to me. \"You need to calm yourself, Marcus.\" Firmly, she said. \"The doctor is on his way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glenn!\" Still panicked, you gasped. \"Glenn doesn't look too good! Please check on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn motioned for another nurse to look over Glenn. After a moment, she turned to fawn with a frown on her face. \"Nurse Fawn, we are going to need another bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn hurried over to Glenn and sighed. \"Oh dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Worried, I demanded. \"What's wrong with Glenn?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn walked back to me just as Dr. Wilcox entered, looking frustrated. \"That maniac!\" Angry, he fumed. \"I warned him that rushing the procedure would increase the chances of the patients experiencing side effects!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor...\" Whispering, nurse Fawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered something to Dr. Wilcox and he walked over to Glenn before sighing. \"How did he manage to get back into this room?\" Furious, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had to have done it between shifts.\" Frustrated, Fawn said. \"That or he bribed the last nurse on duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- What is wrong with my brother?!\" Worried, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wilcox sighed. \"Get another bed and bunk Mr Scott with his brother.\" Serious, he ordered. \"We have a huge mess on our hands.\" He then walked over to me and began to look me over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, doctor.\" Wincing, I demanded. \"What is wrong with my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We discovered that Dr. Hal had been experimenting on random visitors.\" To my horror, Dr. Wilcox replied. \"Slipping them sleeping pills then performing the procedure on them while they and the relative they were visiting were out cold.\" He gave an angry sigh. \"Fortunately, we caught him before too long but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Panicked, I asked. \"What did he do to my brother?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been proven in clinical trials on mice that the procedure on healthy individuals bring about random results.\" Darkly, Dr. Wilcox said. \"In a majority of cases, they...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I answered his questions, I could not help feel worried about my brother. \"He's not going to change too, is he?\" Wincing, I asked. \"I'm sure that mad man Dr. Hal rushed the procedures on those he was experimenting on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't jinx him.\" Serious, Dr. Wilcox warned. \"So far, all of the other five patients he had attacked merely came down with a <i>mysterious</i> case pneumonia or a temporary loss of use of their limbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, my parents are going to want to know for certain...\" Serious, I argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wilcox sighed. \"We'll run some tests.\" Whispering, he said. \"Unless we find that your brother has experienced a significant loss in weight or height, I would not worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I going to be okay...?\" Sighing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't sugar coat this.\" Serious, Dr. Wilcox said. \"You are going to have a rough few days. I'll order more pain medication and some Midol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midol?!\" Startled, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wilcox nodded. \"You are about to go through a second puberty only this one will pass in two to five days rather than years.\" To my shock, he explained. \"If you think waking up from the procedure was a tornado, this will be a full on hurricane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that then turned to Glenn as the curtain was pushed back. He was softly moaning and coughing heavily, looking completely miserable. \"Keep us posted, doc.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll order the tests as soon as we get your bother stabilized.\" Softly, Dr. Wilcox said. \"I'll have the nurses bring you another gown.\" He then managed a smile. \"Just ask for a nurse the next time you decide to walk to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that as the doctor then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could not hear what was being said and turned to Glenn to find him fast asleep in his bed. He looked even more pale than the day before, but at least his breathing was not as raspy sounding as it was earlier. I tried to shift positions, only to wince as I felt a bad cramp in my pelvic region. It felt as if I had done too many sit ups in one session but it was not the cramps I was concerned about. I also felt a warm dampness between my legs and blushed, thinking I had wet myself in my sleep. I paged the nurse before moving my sheets aside only to be surprised by the sight of blood in my underwear. It was not a lot but enough to force a shriek to escape my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Fawn ran in immediately with Mom and Dad right on her heels. Fawn took one look at me and sighed. \"Calm down... <i>Miss</i> Scott.\" Softly, she said. \"You are having your first period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom raised a hand to her mouth, stunned. \"Miss Scott...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was far from impressed. \"Is this some kind of a joke?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far from it, Mr. Scott.\" Serious, Fawn replied. \"We noticed the change when your son, or rather, daughter's vitals spiked around midnight last night.\" She then turned to me. \"You are now more female than male.\" Softly, she explained. \"Consider yourself fortunate it occurred while you were asleep, and could not feel anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began the process of getting me cleaned up while dad checked up on Glenn, still asleep in his bed. Once I was cleaned up, Fawn showed me a pair of panties along with a sanitary pad. \"I think I should handle it from here.\" Politely, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn nodded then handed the articles to mom before walking over to Glenn's bed to check on him while Mom called for my attention. \"The pad goes onto the bridge of the panty much like a sticker.\" Firmly but kindly, she explained. \"There are several brands, some with or without wings which help hold the pad in place.\" She then placed the sanitary pad in place with me watching, then handed the panty to me. \"The nurses will help you change the pad as needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, I put the panties on, wincing as I felt the soft cotton pressing against my now fully feminine groin. \"Is it always going to be this sensitive?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's basically new skin.\" hearing me, Fawn said. \"It will be sensitive for a while but it should get better in a few days to a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That lunatic Dr. Hal is in the hands of the police.\" Firmly but kindly, Dad said. \"You can rest assured that this family will pursue him the fullest extent of the law for what he did to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then winced as I felt another cramp. \"How long do these periods last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five days to a week.\" Calmly, Mom replied. \"They'll get a little easier to deal with once you get used to them.\" A bemused smile formed upon her face. \"You'll be getting them every month until you hit menopause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moaned, which brought a slight giggle from Mom and Fawn. \"Welcome to womanhood, Marcus.\" Calmly, Fawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus doesn't seem to fit anymore.\" To my surprise, Mom mused. \"Maybe you might want to think of another name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another name...?\" Gulping, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New name, new wardrobe, new life.\" sighing, Dad said. He pointed to Glenn. \"Your brother may end up going through it right along with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a tinge of guilt, remembering my brother's condition. Where I wanted the procedure done, he did not . Glenn was more a victim than I was. With a sigh, I turned to mom and dad. \"What would you have named me if I were born a girl?\" Curious, I demanded. \"You had to have had discussed it at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had our ideas, but we believe you are old enough to decide for yourself.\" Serious, Dad said. \"It's a name you will be stuck with for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, Dad had a point. After a few tense moments of thought, I said... \"Cassidy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"I like that name.\" Politely, she said. \"Why did you pick it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed slightly. \"Kat and I was sort of planning on naming our first daughter that if and when we ever started a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed at that, seeing the sad irony in it all. \"So you loved her too...\" Softly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly nodded. \"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur attention was turned to the door when Dr. Wilcox politely cleared his throat. \"Mr. and Mrs. Scott, I'd like to speak with you in the hall, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to have to say, you can say it in front of our children.\" Firmly, dad said. \"They have been through enough, we will not keep anything secret from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave a firm nod in approval, bringing a sigh from Dr. Wilcox. \"Very well...\" he walked up to mom and dad and showed them a small stack of papers. \"The test results on your son Glenn are finally finished.\" Softly, he said. \"I am truly sorry what had happened to him but he...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then noticed he was lying in a hospital bed, wearing a hospital gown and his worry turned to fear. \"What- What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched his chest, causing Mom to wince. \"Honey, Dr. Hal performed the experimental procedure on six healthy people while they slept.\" Sadly, she said. \"You were one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn's eyes widened as he again scratched his chest. \"I'm guessing that my chest itching like mad is not a good sign, then.\" Gulping, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mom could stop him, he quickly pulled up his gown to reveal that his chest was puffy and swollen, with his nipples slowly forming into two small orbs. He began to breathe more rapidly as he turned to me. I could only sadly nod and lift my own gown to show him my own more defined breasts. \"It seems we both got that one percent chance,... sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic flashed in Glenn's eyes as he threw the covers off of himself to find that his, or rather, her crotch was now flat. She turned back to me, tears falling. \"But... that big meal you had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was to enable Cassidy's body to repair itself.\" Serious, Dr. Wilcox explained. \"You, on the other hand, had nothing to repair, so, in tricking your body that you were still developing, it reset your body. This included some of its built up immunity, causing a case of pneumonia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it also brought the same risks.\" Wincing, I added. \"Right, doctor?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wilcox nodded then turned to Glenn. \"The test results showed that you had lost one year of age and about ten pounds in weight.\" Serious, he said. \"Fortunately, you were impressively muscular for your age otherwise...\" His voice trailed off, his expression dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn and I both gulped, realizing just how lucky Glenn was. She was very slender, not to the point of being unhealthy but still noticeably so. My new sister noticed this as well and was clearly panicked by it. \"What- What are we going to do?\" Now crying, Glenn asked. \"Is- Is that mad doctor still out there?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is in the hands of the police.\" Firmly but kindly, Dad said. \"If he's smart, he'll stay there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry... girls.\" Gently, Mom said. \"We are not letting either of you out of our sight until this is over and done with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... your jobs.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave Glenn a warm hug. \"Our job is to care for you two.\" Serious, she said. \"Right now, you both need us more than ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave me a warm hug then turned to Dr Wilcox. \"Unlike some other  people, we take our job seriously.\" Angrily, he said. \"I am certain the hospital has an explanation as to how this happened to not only our children but to five other innocent people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am asking you not to allow this to leak.\" Wincing, Dr. Wilcox said. \"Those Dr. Hal had attacked are not the only victims here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else did that maniac do?!\" Startled, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a lot of good doctors and nurses here who would suffer if this got out.\" Softly, Dr. Wilcox explained. \"Would you really allow one evil man to ruin the careers and reputations of dozens of medical personnel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how could anyone allow this to happen?\" Worried, Mom demanded. \"The patients here have the right to feel safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you that a strict internal investigation is being run.\" Serious, Dr. Wilcox said. \"I truly understand your anger, but, right now, we have to focus on damage control.\" He sighed. \"A legal representative of the hospital will be visiting you within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call my attorney.\" Serious, Dad said. \"There is no way I'm letting this get swept under the rug without a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still trust you, Dr. Wilcox.\" In a guarded tone, I said. \"Just try to understand, that trust is on shaky ground right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... understand.\" Softly, Dr. Wilcox said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Glenn as I heard her starting to hyperventilate, and had a good idea what was happening to her. \"Mom, Glenn is having her first!\" Frowning, I cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Oh dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed over to the bathroom and returned shortly with a sanitary pad, while I paged for the nurse, who came quickly. \"I'm bleeding!\" Panicked, Glenn screamed. \"Why am I bleeding?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, dear.\" Firmly, Mom said. \"You are having your first period. It's really nothing to be panicked about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say.\" Crying, Glenn grumbled. \"I feel like I've been kicked in the nuts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed, understanding the analogy. \"Just ride it out, sweetie.\" Softly, he said. \"Mom and the nurse will show you how to use a pad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced as the curtain between Glenn and me was closed, and turned to Dad. \"It looks like 'aunt flow,' as Mom calls it, is hitting Glenn harder than me.\" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like many things, it's different for everyone.\" Shrugging, Dad said. He then managed a smile. \"I just hope all three of you don't end up in that 'same mood' at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help giggle at that then winced as a cramp hit me. \"How do girls deal with this every month until menopause?\" Irritable, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little dark chocolate helps.\" Approaching me, Nurse Fawn said. \"Not only does it satisfy your sweet tooth during a period, but it's high in potassium which helps your muscles to function, ideal for when those cramps hit.\" She handed me a bar of dark chocolate then added, \"I gave a bar to your sister as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Blushing, I said. I turned to Mom as the curtain was pulled back. \"What- What are we going to call Glenn now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn gulped. \"Isn't Glenn a unisex name?\" Wincing, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yes it is.\" Softly, Mom said. \"You can keep it, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn sighed. \"Let- Let me think about it.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a retired nurse, it was easy for Dr. Hal to sneak me into the hospital as his assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You helped him do this to me, to us?!\" Angry, Dawn demanded. \"Just how do you plan to justify experimenting on innocent people?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn opened her mouth to answer only paused as her cellphone gave a ding. She had a text message. \"Excuse me...\" Crying, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was furious. How dare this nurse who had gained my trust, only to betray it, brush us off so lightly! I was about to grab her arm and pull her to face me but I caught a look of panic on her face as she was staring at the text message, her body trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fawn, by now I am well on my way to Venezuela. This country has no extradition treaty with the US. Sorry I cannot take you with me but I left a little insurance policy to ensure you do not develop a conscience. It should be kicking in right... about... now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I read the text, Fawn began to convulse! Her body was shrinking and becoming thinner and thinner right before our eyes! Dawn ran out of the bathroom and hit the 'code blue' button while I stayed with Fawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help is on the way.\" Firmly, I said. \"Stay with me... stay with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I say this because she came to confess to your daughters personally, rather than let them hear the details from us. Because of this, Dr. Hal's incriminating text message is now evidence against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How <i>is</i> Nurse Fawn?\" I asked.

How could she have possibly been turned into a little boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The injections can be time delayed for up to several weeks.\" To our horror, Dr. Wilcox replied. \"It was made that way for patients who first need to bulk up a lot more before the procedure.\" He then sobbed slightly as he turned to the window. \"As for how she became a boy,... she was two months pregnant with one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's jaws dropped as Mom raised a shaking hand to her mouth. She looked as if she wanted to scream but nothing came out. Dad seemed more furious than ever, only his anger had clearly shifted back onto Dr. Hal. \"That... bastard....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and the unborn child were fused into one being, making her a boy and half her age.\" A hint of anger in his voice Dr. Wilcox said. \"As a result, I fear his mind may be a blank slate at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A blank slate?\" Wincing, I asked. \"That does not sound good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my suspicions are right, the boy in there will have the mind of a new born baby when he wakes up.\" Softly, Dr. Wilcox said. \"Every trace of Nurse Fawn Winters will be forever lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you know for certain?\" Wincing, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wilcox shook his head. \"We have not yet had the opportunity to talk with him yet as we are still working on stabilizing his condition.\" Serious, he said. \"We will know the instant he tries to talk.\" he sighed. \"What is clear is that Dr. Hal had every intention to take her out of the equation completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was crying at this point... hell, we were all crying.

He was a trembling, sobbing mess on his bed. His face was flushed with misery, self hate, and grief. His hands were held on either side of his head, shaking uncontrollably. The very sight of him moved me to immediately pull him into my arms, where he fell into hysterical tears. Dawn was right behind me, joining the hug and the two of us cooed and comforted him until he again became calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You all hate me.\" Timidly, Fawn said. \"Who could forgive the horrors I had done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understand that I cannot forget what you had done to my family.\" Serious, Dad said. \"However, I understand why...\" His face became stern, causing Fawn to hold onto Dawn and I in utter fear. \"You were coerced, played and set up to take the fall, and the proof is in how Dr. Hal attempted to be rid of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As such, we can and do forgive you.\" Firmly, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded then forceful added, \"No one does that to our son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn's eyes grew wide in a mixture of shock, surprise and disbelief. He turned to Dr. Wilcox who politely cleared his throat. \"May I presume you intend to adopt Fawn Winters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fawn doesn't fit anymore.\" Thoughtful, Mom said. \"How about... Finn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\" Nodding, Dawn added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say... Finn?\" With a warm smile, Mom asked. \"Would you like us to adopt you? Want to become Finn Scott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFawn, or rather, Finn responded with another river of hysterical tears. Dr. Wilcox smiled before nodding at Dad. \"I'm certain our attorneys can handle the paperwork.\" politely, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a touching scene in Finn's hospital room, until I felt a warm dampness and pulled away from Finn in surprise. \"Ew!\" The word came out before I could stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn realized what I was reacting to and jumped back as well. \"I think Finn needs to use the bathroom, he's leaking a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn blushed profusely. \"I- I might need help.\" Softly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you... little bro.\" patiently, I said. \"I won't let you fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI helped Finn out of the bed and noticed how badly his legs were shaking. It reminded me of my own first time walking after so long. \"I'm still dribbling.\" Wincing, Finn muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think about it.\" Serious, I said. \"We're almost there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, I had Finn sitting on the toilet with his underwear down where I instructed him how to pee. His reaction was predictable... \"That feels so weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it.\" Calmly, I said. \"Just wait until you gain other boy issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying not to think about it.\" Pouting, Finn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to stand up but i pushed him down. \"You need to shake it.\" Calmly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn face flushed. \"I have to touch it...?\" Disgusted, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you have shake it.\" Serious, I replied. \"Just as girls have to wipe, boys have to shake. Otherwise, you are going to dribble all over the seat.\" I giggled and added, \"Dawn and I had our share of chewing outs from Mom over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn chuckled slightly at that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before, Mom would occasionally remind me of how long she'd been in labor to bring me into the world, but now she was holding nothing back. And I knew why: one day, I would be doing that, to give birth to a baby of my own. She wanted me to know beforehand what to expect, and maybe do whatever it takes to avoid that before I was damn good and ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we moved on to diseases. While Dad had told us about the big ones, Mom told us about diseases that either only women get, or they affect women differently. And there were a <i>lot</i> of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, The Talk centered around how some men treat women, and how some men will look the other way when it happens. The message was clear: She didn't want us to walk into such a relationship, and she wanted us to run straight out of it if we got into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finished, Mom gave us both a reassuring hug, and we went back out into what didn't feel much like a party anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as we came out, a group of boys came in. \"Excuse me,\" one of them said. \"We're friends of Glenn's, and we heard he was laid up in here.

We could not see what was going on, but we could hear, and we all strained to listen. \"Gentlemen, I assure you that my child appreciates your concern.\" Firmly but kindly, dad said. \"However... he was attacked and is facing a rough recovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys in the hall gasped before giving a growl only a true friend would give when they hear another had been hurt. \"Who did it...\" Anger in his voice, one boy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one responsible is in the hands of the police.\" Sternly, dad replied. \"Right now, we are all just trying to give the kid some space. She is hurt, and dealing with issues we hope none of you will ever have to understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's putting it mildly...\" Wincing, Dawn whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... <i>she</i>...?\" Surprised, a second boy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed before turning to Dawn through the cracked doorway. \"Are you ready to see either of these guys yet?\" Softly, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn sighed before saying, \"I'll see one of them, but not all of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded and looked at the three boys. The first to speak up was Dawn's height, with red hair and green eyes. The second to speak up was slightly taller and muscular, with black hair and blue eyes. The quiet one was a bit shorter than Dawn, with brown hair and brown eyes. All of them were wearing the school uniform. Dad guessed it was the only reason they were able to make it this far, with security having been tightened. \"One of you can come in and see her.\" Serious, he said. \"She is not ready for a crowd just yet, and her sister already has company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were again taken aback, but their curiosity moved them to quickly agree to Dad's condition, and the redheaded boy was allowed to walk in. Dawn knew him as Jack Strong. The other two were his brothers, Tex and Max. They were known to sort of look out for other kids against bullies and pranksters. Only it sometimes made them more of a nuisance for the school faculty, which was why Dawn was hesitant to join their little group as Glenn when they had offered. Jack's jaw dropped upon seeing his friend, now a girl in a hospital gown, and began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be Glenn?!\" Shocked, he asked. \"I mean, you're a number one hottie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn blushed profusely, shifting uncomfortable on her feet moving me to pull her behind me with Kat taking a stance beside me. \"Excuse me...\" Annoyed, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, young man!\" Sternly, Dad warned. \"My daughters are going through enough as it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just so unbelievable!\" Blushing, Jack said. \"I mean, what could even do this to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" Serious, I said. \"There may be more people involved in the attacks that left Glenn and me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That said, we need to keep a tight lid on all of this, until a full investigation is run.\" Serious, Mom said. \"That includes you and your curious friends saying nothing about what you saw and heard in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked beyond Jack to find Tex and Max peering in with their jaws dropped. \"I-I have to admit, I'm scared out of my mind.\" Shuddering, Dawn said. \"I was lucky. The last person who was attacked almost didn't make it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyebrows furrowed and his jaw locked before turning to his brothers. \"Not a word of this to anyone until they are ready to come out with it, understood?!\" Sternly, he demanded. \"Give them your word! You know Dad's rule of breaking it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Tex and Max gave their word to keep Dawn's and my condition quiet before Jack gave his word as well and handed Dad a piece of paper. \"Our dad is a lieutenant in the police department, Mr. Scott.\" Serious, he said. \"If you need help, call him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad placed the paper with the number on it in his pocket. \"Thank you, young man.\" Calmly, he said. \"I think its time for you and your brothers to move on now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded but turned to Dawn. \"I didn't mean to weird you out,... Dawn.\" Wincing, he said. \"I'm just saying it as I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn, still blushing, managed to squeak, \"Th-Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had left, Dawn collapsed into a chair, making everyone worry. \"Are you okay?\" Wincing, I asked. \"Are you hurting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I feel.\" Honestly, Dawn said. \"It's weird. My legs went weak, but I... didn't seem to mind it so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both Mom and Kat smiled while Dad sighed. Though I don't know why, it took me a moment to catch on, and I sighed myself. \"Does it really work that fast?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is just an initial reaction.\" Bemused, Mom replied. \"No girl knows how to react to their first swooning over a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was swooning over him...?\" Surprised, Dawn asked. She moaned. \"Why me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"It's natural.\" Softly, she said. \"He is cute, but it takes more than just one swoon to win over a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was getting around better, so I didn't need them to help me along, but I appreciated the moral support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I arrived, the woman there said, \"Hi. My name is Alex. I'll be your physical therapist. You must be... \" She consulted her pad. \"Cassidy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me. This is my mom, and my twin sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delighted to meet you. Well, let's get started by seeing how strong your legs are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis apparently involved pushing with my legs against her resistance. When that was done, she said, \"Well, your legs are quite strong for someone who's spent four years in a wheelchair. But you're going to want them up within normal limits. Let's try some exercises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exercises were difficult, but still things that I could do. After I did a few of them, Alex printed them out and said, \"I want you to do these 2-3 times a day. Your mother and sister can help, in the ways I've demonstrated. Now, for your next appointment, it looks like you'll still be here at the hospital. Next week, though, you're due to be discharged. Would you rather come to the clinic, or should I pay visits to your home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'd rather you came to the house,\" Mom said. \"With the current situation, we're worried about security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Alex made a note on her pad. \"I'll see you here at the same time in a couple of days. Have a good day. Take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got back to the room, Dad and Finn were waiting. \"I've made arrangements to take care of things at the house,\" Dad said. \"Marcus's room will be the girls' room, and Glenn's will be Finn's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's taking care of that,\" Mom asked, \"while we're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat's folks will supervise,\" Dad explained, \"and those young men who were here earlier have volunteered to handle the heavy lifting and the painting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Dawn. \"Is that a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the Strong kids,\" she answered. \"They want to be good, even if they sometimes have their own ideas on how to do that. More to the point, their word is their bond. If they say they're going to help us out, that's what they'll do.\"</span></div></div>",

Dad even got Dawn and me to giggle a little, talking about his boxing career. \"I had an opponent who danced around so much, I honestly thought he had too much to drink before the match.\" Smiling, he said. \"I was in for a surprise when he suddenly stopped and tried to deliver a right hook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was trying to throw you off.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"Fortunately, I was paying attention and managed to dodge it before delivering an uppercut to his jaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Curious, Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"He went down in the first round where I met his sister,\" eyeing Mom, he said. \"She jumped into the ring and clipped my jaw. It was the first time we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and I fell into fits of laughter. \"Mom, you were a boxer too?!\" Giggling, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom blushed slightly. \"Amateur kick boxer, actually.\" softly, she said. \"My little fit of anger disqualified me from my first ring fight, but I think it was worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled as he kissed Mom. \"She knows how to hold her own.\" Calmly, he said. \"We are a family of fighters, survivors, which is why I know we will pull through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Mom and Dad had left for a meeting with Dr. Wilcox, leaving Dawn and me to watch television to occupy ourselves. Dawn was dozing off when a soft knock came to my room. Looking towards the door, I gulped seeing a man with a reporter visitation badge. \"I was uh... hoping to find a Marcus Scott.\" Nervously, he said. \"I was told he was in this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had an idea what the reporter was looking for, a story on the new and remarkable breakthrough that had been televised for months before I was accepted for the procedure. \"I'm sorry.\" Shaking my head, I said. \"Who are you, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Karl West from Internet Viral News.\"  Still nervous, the reporter said. \"I am not exactly allowed on this floor, so I have to be quick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had heard of Internet Viral News, they were a 'B' rated news source, known for inappropriate to borderline illegal means to get their stories. They had been sued many times for deformation, and, with the hospital trying to keep a lid on what had happened, a nosy reporter was the last thing they or my family needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea why this entire wing's been cut off to all visitors except for family?\" Looking at me, Karl demanded. \"Do you know anything about the new medical procedure promising miracles to its patients?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about.\" Trying to sound sincere, I said. \"If you will excuse me, I need the nurse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I hit the nurse call button. Karl frowned hearing the dig out in the hall then angrily turned to me. I let out a gasp as the man then grabbed the front of my hospital gown, startling me into silence. \"I know when someone is hiding something, kid.\" His voice dark, he said. \"I'll be back, we'll talk more then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he released me and hurried off, leaving me shaken. When the nurse arrived, I was in tears, which she noticed and hurried over to me. My new nurse was a towering, muscular woman with long black hair tied into a neat bun on the top of her head. She focused her gentle blue eyes into my own, drawing my attention. \"What is it, deary?\" In a heavy British accent, she demanded. \"What has my little warrior shaking like a wee fawn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a reporter in here.\" Tears falling, I replied. \"He- He grabbed me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse's face turned dark. \"Not on my shift.\" Angrily, she said. She then hit a button on her call necklace. \"This is Nurse Helga Holmes. We have an unauthorized reporter in the ICU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga then began to look me over, inspecting every part of me to which I said, \"He didn't hurt me... he just scared me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared you enough into wetting yourself, lass.\" Softly, Helga said. She then showed me a small microphone. \"He also left a bug.\" she nodded at my startled expression. \"You let Helga deal with this, lass. I will help you to the bathroom and then change your sheets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, I allowed Helga help me to the bathroom. there, I took out my cellphone and called Dad, who answered on the second ring. \"Daddy...

When I saw her, I immediately requested she be your nurse during the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is our nurse tonight?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" surprising me, Mom said. \"It's strictly volunteer work, but, with the hospital being short staffed, they were happy to accept my help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't expect her to go easy on you just because she's your mother.\" Grinning, Dad said. \"We both want you, Dawn, and Finn back on your feet as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the meeting with Dr. Wilcox go?\" Worried, Dawn asked. \"He didn't mention anything about it to Cassidy or I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As well as can be expected.\" Calmly, Dad replied. \"It was just to prepare us for our meeting with the panel of attorneys from the hospital and pharmaceutical company tomorrow morning.\" He cracked a slight grin. \"This not mine or your mother's first legal rodeo, and Dr. Wilcox made certain those attorneys knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough chatter.\" Firmly but kindly, Mom said. \"Get ready for your shower, Dawn. I will be checking to make certain you cleaned everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn blushed profusely as she entered the bathroom, before Mom turned to me. \"You are next, and you will learn why it takes girls longer to get ready in the morning and night.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Seriously, the only thing that could possibly be more exquisite would be a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mom soon set me straight. \"Your first lesson: shaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long could that take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to shave your face, but girls are expected to shave their pits and their legs. Since that's more acreage, shaving will take longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't kidding. One leg took twice as long as it took to shave my face. Also, there was the matter of occasionally cutting myself. Mom was there with small circular bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"I'm getting the hang of shaving. Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly. Now you need to dry all that hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHo. Ly. Crap. Even with a hair dryer, drying my hair took forever. \"How am I supposed to do this every day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most days, one shower and shave will be enough. But we're not done yet.\" She produced a makeup kit. \"And there will be a few different looks we'll be trying out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe began with a basic look, which Mom said would be good enough for school. Then came a more embellished look, which Mom said would be for hanging out with my friends. Finally came the most embellished look, which was for special occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time to remove the makeup, which was done with cold cream and tissues.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little over an hour after entering the shower, I stepped out feeling a bit overwhelmed. I had no idea the amount of trouble girls had to go through. Now that I was one, I had a stronger respect for their morning and nightly routine. I turned to Dawn who seemed just as stunned. \"Here I thought we had a lot to do in the morning as guys.\" Sighing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my world, girls.\" Smiling, Mom said. \"I won't seem like such a chore, once you get into a routine.\" She then handed Dawn and me a number of fashion magazines. \"I got these from the hospital gift shop downstairs, they show the latest in teen girls' fashions and trends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to pick out a new wardrobe.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's all kinds of different hairstyles in here too.\" Blushing, Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just mark the pages that show the outfits and hairstyles you think you would like.\" Bemused, Mom said. \"I want to get an idea of your fashion sense and taste in clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and I turned to each other, uncertain. \"I'm not sure what would look good on me.\" Honestly, I said. \"I'm still getting used to how I look in a hospital gown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"We all have to start somewhere, girls.\" Calmly, she said. \"Look through them, you might be surprised by what you find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Dawn and I began to look through the magazines. It was not too long before she and I began to mark a few pages in the magazines. One that I found interesting was a pair of blue jeans with a baby blue shirt. Another was a simple skort and tank top combo that I had seen Kat wearing a few times. I marked a few skirts more to appease mom but tried to avoid the dresses. Still, there was one dress that caught my eye. It was a knee length short sleeve dress with a dark blue sash. There were teal inlays around the collar, which dipped low enough to show a modest amount of cleavage. Looking at it made me blush, but it somehow called to me, so I marked it as a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you found anything interesting yet?\" Wincing, Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few things.\" Honestly, I replied. \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn sighed. \"I found a couple of things that might work.\" Uncertain, she said. \"Tell me what you think, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and looked at Dawn's selections, while she looked at mine. Surprisingly, her picks were very similar to my own, only she completely avoided anything remotely feminine, except for one dress. It was a simple but gorgeous ivory ankle length short sleeve dress, with a lavender sash and beautiful pearl embroidery along the slightly dipped collar, showing a hint of cleavage. \"It looks like you and I have similar tastes.\" Smiling, I said. \"This ivory dress you picked out is very beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just spoke to me.\" Blushing, Dawn said. \"You seem to be a bit more bold than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you're just a bigger tomboy.\" Smiling, I countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn smiled slightly at that, then looked at the hairstyles. \"What hairstyle do you think you would like?\" Curious, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Shrugging, I replied. \"You and I sort of always went with short and messy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, who had been listening, smiled. \"I think a simple but elegant look would suit you both.\" Calmly, she said. \"Avoid anything too extravagant for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, I looked at the hairstyles again, and found a few simple styles that looked rather good for my long hair. Dawn smiled and marked a few of her own. Shortly after, mom took the magazines from us and looked them over. \"Well, it seems as if you two are not the complete tomboys I thought you were.\" Bemused, she said. \"You both made some rather feminine selections.\" She giggled. \"Though Dawn seems to be a bit more cautious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn winced but Mom dismissed it with a wave of her hand. \"I'm not judging you, honey.\" Calmly, she said. \"I'm just getting an idea as to where to start with your new wardrobes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe paused as a nurse came into the room and quickly whispered something to Mom and Dad. Mom hurried out of the room while Dad stood by the door. \"What's going on, Daddy?\" Wincing, I asked. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed and replied,...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Mom made certain to keep us busy with more fashion and hair style magazines, along with catalogues for purses, makeup, and accessories. As she explained it, she wanted a clear picture of our personal tastes and styles as teenage girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how everything is going.\" Curious, I said. \"They've been in that meeting for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me.\" Shrugging, Dawn replied. \"They did say it would take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped when the phone in my room rang. Suspecting nothing, I answered. \"Hello...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassidy, it's Dad.\" Serious, dad said. \"The meeting is over, and we are coming back up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound upset, Daddy.\" Wincing, i said. \"Did the meeting go sour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... man Finn had a nightmare about was at the meeting.\" Darkly, Dad replied. \"He didn't say much, but he was there, listening to everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't threaten you or Mom, did he?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad chuckled. \"Your mother and I had taken down people twice his size, in both the ring and the courts.\" Calmly, he said. \"My concern is what he intends to do while in the hospital, which is why your mom and I are coming to you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see him as a threat?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I'm not willing to take any chances at this point.\" Serious, Dad said. \"He seems insistent to speak to you and Dawn, but we won't allow it without us and our lawyer present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I heard Helga talking loudly to someone in the hall. \"You have no authorization to enter that room, lad!\" Forcefully, she said. \"You don't even have authorization to be on this floor without security clearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can wait.\" Calmly, a deep, dark voice replied. \"I was merely hoping to introduce myself before their parents arrived...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can introduce yourself to the elevator going down.\" Bluntly, Helga countered. \"Security is already on its way to escort you if you do not comply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear the man give a frustrated sigh before saying, \"As you wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Helga entered our room with a patient smile. \"That was some fancy attorney for that pharmaceutical company behind the procedure that changed you both.\" Calmly, she said. \"You need not fret, though. I know how to deal with unwanted visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that, Daddy?\" Wincing, I asked. \"That man was already here but Helga sent him off with security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad again began to work on his breathing. \"I know.\" Furious, he said. \"We just passed each other here by the elevators.\" I then heard dad say to the man, \"Pull a stunt like that again and I'll bring more than an attorney, I'll call in the feds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are overreacting, Mr. Scott.\" Calmly, the man replied. \"I am only looking out for the best interests of my employers. My only crime was forgetting to clear through security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then heard the ding of the elevator doors before Dad again spoke to me. \"That man is bad news, Cassidy.\" Serious, he said. \"Your mother is on the phone with our attorney, to complain about this incident as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Dawn, who looked at me, uncertain and fearful. \"Mom and Dad are on their way back to us.\" Forcing a smile, I said. \"They have this under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" Wincing, Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after ending the call with Dad, he and Mom entered the hospital room, looking angry and frustrated. \"The meeting was productive.\" Serious, mom said. \"A generous settlement was offered, which we are considering, but that man has us concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"He talks and acts much like the 'fix it' men from the unscrupulous big gambling racketeers I had dealt with during my career as a boxer.\" Serious, he added. \"We will need to stay on our toes until this is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we're in danger?\" Wincing, Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shook his head. \"No, I think his game is to intimidate you both, and likely Finn as well.\" Thoughtful, he said. \"It's a classic tactic to make those most directly affected drop the lawsuit, or at least agree to a smaller settlement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Fortunately, Helga is not so easily intimidated.\" Calmly, she said. \"She and I have dealt with bigger bullies in our time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to worry about it.\" Calmly, Dad said. \"We have another meeting with the hospital and pharmaceutical attorneys tomorrow, but it should be our last meeting. Hopefully, we can avoid a lengthy lawsuit, and simply move on with our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded at that, but I was still worried...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could hear him instructing Finn to lift the lid and seat. \"Here is where you need to touch it.\" Serious, he said. \"You need to aim for the center of the toilet bowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Finn moan in disgust before hearing him urinate into the toilet. \"This is uncomfortable.\" Groaning, Finn complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think too much about it.\" Calmly, Dad said. \"You're just going to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the sound of urinating stopped, I heard Dad say, \"Don't forget to shake it. You don't want to dribble in your underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn again moaned in disgust before I heard the water running. He was washing his hands. Soon after, he walked out, blushing profusely, with dad right behind him. \"It's really nothing to be embarrassed about, Finn.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Just one of the many things we boys have to put up with on a daily basis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any other surprises I should be aware of?\" Wincing, Finn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, soon your hormones will be running rampant within you, as puberty hits.\" Serious, Mom said. \"It's a completely different experience for boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Curious, Finn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys who go through puberty early or late tend to become more aggressive and antisocial than their peers.\" Serious, Dad explained. \"Painful growth spurts and heightened testosterone levels are at the root of it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I had raised two boys who were grizzly bears while going through puberty.\" Ruefully, Mom said. \"You will feel irritable and agitated, but not know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, though.\" smiling, Dad said. \"I have ways to burn off that aggression when it hits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For girls, their emotions become more intense, and tend to swing from one extreme to the other during puberty.\" Serious, Mom explained. \"This can include aggression, but not as strongly as in boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We- We're passed that,... right?\" Nervous, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"You are all going through a second puberty right now.\" Patiently, she said. \"Finn's should start any day now. Your phone call with dad after that encounter with the reporter is one example of the mood swings I mentioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He should feel lucky you did not fall into a fit of anger.\" Serious, Dad said. \"He would have been hard pressed to get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that. \"Dr. Wilcox told me that I was going to go through it in a matter of days, rather than years.\" Nervous, I said. \"Why am I still going through it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The worst is likely over for you.\" Calmly, Mom said. \"Your changes seem to have stopped, but Dawn changed after you, and Finn after her. They still have a few days to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely...\" Sarcastically, Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all fell silent as the family attorney, David Connor, knocked before entering. He was tall and well built, with short brown hair and brown eyes. \"I am sorry to trouble you, Mr and Mrs Scott.\" politely, he said. \"Mr. Victor Daemon, a spokesman for New Moon Pharmaceuticals, has requested an audience with you and your children, with me present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked passed David to see a towering man with crew cut black hair and green eyes wearing a black suit. He was muscular, but nowhere near as such as Dad, but his stone-carved face and neutral, almost blank expression, sent a certain chill down my spine. I was not certain I wanted to talk to this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a legal matter.\" Firmly, Dad said. \"Hearing from some spokesman or point man is not going to change anything. In fact, it will only make things more complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assure you that I will do nothing to damage the legal standing of my company, in this or any of the other five cases at this hospital.\" Serious, Victor said. \"I'm certain you all want a quick ending to this mess. I am in a position to offer just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and dad looked at each other, both apparently thinking the same thing, as they firmly nodded to each other.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I did get an earful from my employers for my lack of foresight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded but said nothing, and Victor took a seat near the door, while David took a seat near Mom and Dad, while Dawn and I remained in our beds. \"Start talking.\" Calmly, Dad demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First and foremost, congratulations on your renewed ability to walk,... Miss Scott.\" Calmly, Victor said. \"As you have seen for yourself, the procedure did exactly as my company has promised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except for certain side effects.\" Motioning to herself, Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hospital was informed of all the possible side effects in writing before agreeing to use the procedure on human patients.\" Serious, Victor said. \"I will be happy to give you a copy of the agreement between this institution and my company, as proof of my statement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Dr. Hal experimenting on patients and their visitors?\" Unconvinced, Dad demanded. \"From what we understand, Dr. Hal was under your company's employment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was subcontracted from this hospital to perform the procedure, due to his excellent track record in experimental medicine.\" Frowning, Victor said. \"Dr. Wilcox was to supervise, as he was among the brilliant doctors who made the breakthrough.\" He sighed. \"However, I can promise you, my company gave no such orders to experiment on innocent people without their consent. He did this on his own accord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised me. I did not know Dr. Wilcox was among those who came up with the procedure that allowed me to walk. Only, before i could react, Mom asked, \"Does Dr. Wilcox work for your company as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor shook his head. \"No, he does not.\" Serious, he said. \"My company merely duplicated and tested the medicated injections he and his team had developed.\" Frowning, he added, \"Dr. Wilcox knew of the side effects. We are surprised he did not inform you of all of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did some digging, and found that Dr. Hal has been banned from three separate hospitals for performing unauthorized experimental procedures on patients, Mr Daemon.\" Serious, David said. \"Why did your company see him as the right man to perform this procedure on anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although he was banned from hospitals for his unorthodox methods, he had never lost a single patient in his long career, and came highly recommended by this hospital.\" Calmly, Victor countered. \"However, we were appalled to discover that Dr. Hal was more interested in further research by any means necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This still makes your company liable.\" Calmly, Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hospital could have easily denied Dr. Hal the right to perform the procedure.\" Serious, Victor said. \"My company merely provided the medicated injections for use by this hospital, and approved the doctors this hospital had recommended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several further tense minutes of talking, Victor quietly left with security. Once he was gone, Mom turned to David. \"What do you make of that, Connor?\" Frowning, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's using a classic deflection tactic.\" Serious, David said. \"Trying to get us to question the hospital and forget the pharmaceutical company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"That's what I got out of that too.\" Annoyed, she said. \"Only why the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fishing.\" Darkly, Dad said. \"He doesn't know what knowledge our kids have, or how much Finn remembers from being Nurse Fawn.\" He turned to Finn, who seemed rather shaken. \"I'm guessing he got the sense you know something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I remember a few things.\" timidly, Finn admitted. \"Only its all fuzzy, like a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to need to piece together as much of what you can remember as we can.\" Serious, David said. \"The more we know, the stronger our hand will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think that Victor guy will do?\" Shuddering, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, nothing.\" Frowning, Dad said. \"For now, I think his job is to defect as much blame away from his employers and onto the hospital.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I had to bite my tongue to keep myself from laughing at the scene. It could have very easily been me on the receiving end of that shy pick up line. We talked to Cameron for a few minutes longer before a young nurse entered and sighed seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. West, you know you are not supposed to be wandering the halls.\" Lightly scolding, she said. \"Please return to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't mean any harm.\" Calmly, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse smiled. \"The poor boy can't sit still to save his life.\" Bemused, she said. \"He's stir-crazy with boredom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he can go to physical therapy with us today.\" Smiling, Dawn said. \"It will give him something to do and use up some of that built up energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might help.\" Smiling back, the nurse said. \"I'll check with his grandmother and see if she will allow it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the nurse escorted Cameron out of my room and down the hall. Dawn walked to the door and watched him leave to find that he was only three doors down the hall. \"I see you like him too.\" Bemused, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn turned around, blushing. \"I was just worried for him, that's all.\" Softly, she said. \"He was polite, and he seems like a nice kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded then turned to me. \"You too will face multiple suitors before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before lunch, we were escorted to physical therapy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing them, Dawn, Finn, and I sighed. \"More trouble...?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head, a warm smile on her face. \"For once, we have some good news.\" Calmly, she said. \"A cash settlement has been agreed upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hospital and New Moon Pharmaceuticals have agreed to pay us and the other victims a handsome cash settlement.\" Serious, David said. \"They in turn will sue Elite Visions Pharmaceuticals for the damages, as we have been able to corroborate Dr Hal's notes with audio notes he had kept in another safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean for us?\" Curious, Finn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"The moment your physical therapy is done, you are all being discharged.\" Softly, he said. \"From there, we can place this nightmare behind us and move on with our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and I hugged each other, crying happy tears, with Finn joining us.

When I finished drying off, I let Dawn take her shower, and went back into the room. Mom was waiting there, with two bags. Handing me one, she said, \"Let's get you dressed, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled a bit with the bra, but I eventually got it on. Then came the struggle to get my clothes past my wide hips to my narrow waist. While I was doing that, Dawn came out, and she began doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we were fully dressed, Nurse Helga and another nurse came into the room. My heart sank when I saw what they had with them. \"Really? Didn't I go through all this specifically to get <i>out</i> of a wheelchair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hospital regulations, dear,\" she replied. \"Besides, you wouldn't want to trip and break something, and have to be re-admitted, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing I had no choice, I plopped my tuchus into the wheelchair.

Zoe was two years younger than Kat, with long black hair and blue eyes. She was about as feminine as any little girl could get, with a love for fairy tales and princesses, with energy to match. Kat, on the other hand, was a strict tomboy, with a love for action movies and brave heroines. Dawn, however, did not agree with Mom's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Taken back, she demanded. \"I'm nothing like them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Zoe loves ballet, while you love ballroom dancing, both very graceful, if you really think about it.\" Calmly, she said. \"Kat is all tomboy, but she's a bit shy at times.\" She then smiled at her. \"You are a little tomboy, out of her element, so you are on the shy side, but I know you have that same fire and energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this all have to do with fashion?\" pouting, Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom motioned to a mannequin wearing a dark pink skirt and white blouse. \"This alone would not suit you; it requires an accessory.\" Softly, she explained. \"Tell me what you think, and remember, you are not a boy anymore, you're a teenage girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and I watched, curious, as Mom took a denim jacket and put it over the blouse, before placing a pair of women's boots at the base. I did not know why, but I could actually see myself in the outfit without feeling too uncomfortable. Dawn sighed and said, \"Okay... I suppose that's one outfit I could see myself wearing.\" Blushing, she admitted. \"How did you know I wouldn't outright reject it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Two reasons.\" Bemused, she said. \"One, I took notes as you and Cassidy talked about the fashion magazines in the hospital; and two, I know my daughters all too well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you now?\" Unimpressed, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded, amused by our half-hearted defiance. \"Neither of you take any major change lying down, unless you have some control over it.\" Calmly, she said. \"I'm not telling you what to wear or buy, I'm just showing you what I know you will like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, knowing mom was right, to her further giggles. She then continued taking us shopping, pointing out various accessories to make any given outfit more palatable to our individual likes and tastes. Dawn and I grudgingly admitted that Mom knew what she was talking about when it came to fashion and the styles we would like. Still, we both knew that there were many more challenges ahead of us. Upon gathering a small wardrobe for us to start with, Mom led us to the next part of the shopping trip, which I was not really looking forward to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Walking out of the changing rooms wearing the swimsuit we had chosen for mom to see was embarrassing as it was, but to hear a boy giving us a wolf whistle as he walked by was even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the swimsuit section, Mom took us to the lingerie department. \"Don't we already have bras and panties?\" Wincing, Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not enough though.\" Calmly, Mom said. \"Fortunately, I already took your measurements at the hospital, so you don't have to be fitted for a bra.\" She smiled. \"Why don't you two look at the sleepwear, and see which pajamas and nightgowns you would like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and I looked at the pajamas and nightgowns. Some of them seemed quite revealing, at least to our perspective. \"I think I'd prefer pajama tops and bottoms to a nightgown.\" Wincing, I said. \"I will be sleeping, not trying to impress anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at us for a moment then laughed with the saleslady joining her. \"I see you have twin tomboys.\" Amused, the saleslady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo me, my demands were simple and common sense, only to Mom and the saleslady, they seemed rather comical. \"I'm serious.\" Pouting, I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Cassie.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Still, do you really think your father or I will let you try to impress anyone in your room at your age?\" She giggled. \"My father wouldn't even hear of it if I suggested bringing in company after dark at your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were suddenly interrupted by a boy's voice calling out, \"Two hotties over here!\" It was a boy motioning one of his friends to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughters are only thirteen, young man.\" Protective, Mom warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I'm 14.\" Calmly, the boy replied. \"Not many pretty cheerleaders are left up for grabs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go there.\" Frowning, Mom warned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfazed, the boy walked up to me, smiling. \"Hello, miss.\" Sweetly, he said. \"I'm Kevin. Did the mall become more gorgeous today, or is it just you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really bad pickup line...\" Unimpressed, I thought. then i said. \"I'm not interested. Go do your 'shopping' somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin's friend chuckled before stepping up to dawn only she spoke before he could open his mouth. \"I don't care what your name is, creep! Keep walking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nate.\" Said a small voice, approaching behind the two boys. \"Looking for another date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate sighed. \"Nice timing, Tommy.\" Rolling his eyes, he said. \"I was about to ask this lovely girl her name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I turned to see a small boy, no taller than me, with red hair and green eyes. He smiled at his older brother as Kevin quietly walked away to find another spot where girls were gathering for better luck. \"Why not just ask her?\" Innocently, Tommy, suggested. He turned to Dawn and I. \"What's your name, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn giggled, finding it amusing that a small boy was trying to help his older brother pick up a date with a girl. \"I'm Cassie.\" Calmly, I replied. \"Sorry, but we're not interested at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy, forgetting his brother walked blushed. \"I have some extra dollars from my allowance.\" Shuffling his feet, showing some shyness, he said. \"Would you two like to have an ice cream with me?

Truth be told, I was not ready for this yet, and I don't think Dawn was either, but here we were, sitting with a young man who seemed to have a crush on us both. \"Um... thank you for the ice cream, Tommy.\" Softly, I said. \"It was very nice of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy smiled. \"You're welcome.\" Blushing, he said. \"I've never seen you around school before, are you two new to the area?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" Blushing, Dawn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's eyes lit up a bit. \"Would you two like to be my friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's okay.\" Shrugging, I replied. \"We'll see you around school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tommy shocked me by giving me a light peck on the cheek before running off, giggling. Mom, who had been watching, gave me a concerned look as I returned to her, rubbing my cheek, confused. I had not noticed that my ice cream was slowly melting onto my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay?\" Bemused, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-He gave me a kiss, then ran off.\" Looking lost, I said. \"What was that all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Remember last month, when Kat gave you a little peck and ran away?\" Smiling, she asked. \"I think Tommy has a crush on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly dropped my ice cream hearing that, and turned to Tommy, who waved at me, still smiling ear to ear. I shyly waved back, then turned to mom, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know better, I'd say you set me up for that!\" Hissing, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom merely smiled. \"I didn't give you girls a push.\" Calmly, she countered. \"It was your choice to go with him.\" She giggled. \"Now you know what it's like to be on the receiving end of a young man's charms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and I blushed at that, realizing just how easily we had fallen for Tommy's charms...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once everything was in the house, Dawn and I hurried up the stairs to see our new shared room. It had ocean blue carpeting, with horizontal stripes of light blue transitioning into lavender, then dark blue, into black on the ceiling, with random tiny white dots simulating the night sky. On the one wall where our beds were, side by side, was a light pink accent wall that was painted to look like the sail of a ship. With the two beds being side by side with two nightstands in between, it reminded me of a two-hulled outrigger canoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one window in the room, opposite of the beds, had a shade that matched the walls, giving the room a complete ocean scene. I would not say we were surprised, but we were certainly bemused.  Dawn and I both loved the ocean, so it wasn't too bad, but it definitely needed a few tweaks here and there. To the left of the bed was an en suite with a double sink vanity, a tub, and a shower that carried a beach theme. Again, it wasn't all that bad, but I believed it needed more of a feminine touch to make it ours.  As we were taking it all in, Mom peered in with a smile on her face. \"Well, girls, do you like it?\" Bemused, she said. \"The Strong boys outdid themselves on yours and Finn's rooms, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they mistook us for little girls.\" Amused, I said. \"It definitely needs a few tweaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn nodded in agreement. \"Never let boys decorate a girl's room.\" Grinning, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Kat and I were supervising.\" Calmly, she said. \"The ocean and beach themes were our idea, as the ocean seemed to calm you both as boys.\" She pointed to the window. \"You can see the sun rise from that window. That really gives the room a magical look in the morning, which is why we picked this theme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still needs some tweaks.\" Smiling, I said. \"We love it, though. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, Dawn, and I shared a hug. \"You are welcome, girls.\" Softly, Mom said. \"Let's see how Finn likes his room, before we unpack and have lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we having?\" Curious, Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Your father is firing up the grill for some hot dogs and hamburgers.\" Calmly, she replied. \"Lunch will be ready in about ten minutes, so we better get moving.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn and I walked across the hall to Finn's room, to find an almost science fiction theme. All four walls and the ceiling were painted to look like windows gazing out into space, with images of Saturn on the east wall and Jupiter on the west wall. The carpet was a dark blue, and the one window had a shade that matched the mural surrounding it. His bed, under the mural of Saturn, was normal, but had star themed sheets and pillow cases. His nightstand and desk were also normal, but his dresser was built into the north wall, next to a door that was painted to look like a hatch, that led to a en suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Looking around, I said. \"I'm blown away by your room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit much.\" Wincing, Finn said. \"I prefer something simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked out of his bedroom and entered ours, where he let out a low gasp. \"Wow,... an ocean themed bedroom!\" He turned to the window with the shade up, and marveled at how the light from the setting sun seemed to make the room come alive. The carpet shimmered as if it were real water, and the light upon the walls gave the illusion of the sky at dusk. It was truly beautiful to witness. \"I underestimated the twins.\" Smiling, I thought. \"Not bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn turned to Dawn and I, hopeful. \"Um... Want to switch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Finn first asked me when I first saw our shared bedroom, I would have jumped at the chance, but now I was not so sure. \"Let's see what your room looks like at sunset.\" Calmly, I suggested. \"Perhaps there is a similar surprise there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all walked back to Finn's room, to find that the paintings changed as the sun set! The murals on all four walls changed to that of a forest scene, with the night sky on the ceiling! Curious, I gave the murals a closer look and found that they were actually sliding panels that moved on a timer to different scenes. Seeing this, Finn was speechless. \"Never mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really underestimated the Strong Brothers.\" Softly, Dawn said. \"They put some serious thought into these rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit that our new bedrooms were incredible. At first glance, they were not much to look at, but once the sun went down, the real magic of their work showed itself in an epic way. Eager to see my room after dark, I went back to my new room, and found that there were glow in the dark dots that I did not see on all of the walls and carpet, mimicking the night sky, just like the ceiling with carpet mimicking the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's incredible...\" In awe, I whispered. \"It's as if we are actually out on the ocean at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, who had been watching it all, giggled. \"I take it you won't be tweaking your bedrooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"No,... it's perfect.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was not that we wanted to get up so early, we had to get used to getting up in time for school. Summer vacation was nearly over, we would be going back after the weekend. \"I wonder if I will be graduating this year or going back to eighth grade...\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likely eighth grade, as we are now twins.\" Wincing, Dawn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came to our door and Mom peered in. \"Rise and shine, girls.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"You go back to school on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what grades are we going to be in, since we are now twins?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled at that. \"We will discuss that after you are all more awake.\" Kindly, she said. \"Get dressed and come down for breakfast, before it gets cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, Dawn and I got freshened up and dressed before coming down, where Finn was already seated at the table. \"I still can't get over how quickly I can get dressed and ready as a guy.\" Softly, he said. \"It's almost mind-blowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should know from experience that girls have more to do in the morning to get ready for the day.\" Serious, Mom said. \"You may start eating now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad walked in shortly after, looking slightly drained. He almost literally plopped himself down in his seat, as Mom poured him a cup of coffee. \"Rough meeting with the school board, dear?\" Wincing, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"I've been through worse.\" Honestly, he said. \"They understand that the situation involving our kids is complicated, but they did not write the laws surrounding their education.\" He took a sip of his coffee before turning to us. \"We have a few options available to us, to make everything easier for everyone involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn swallowed a spoonful of oatmeal before asking, \"What are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, despite their new ages, Cassidy has gone through enough classes to graduate this year, and Finn has enough education not to return to school.\" Serious, Dad said. \"However, Dawn will have to finish school, unless she takes and passes an advancement test that will move her up into Cassidy's graduating class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the other options?\" Wincing, Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"Cassidy could agree to go back to your class, and go through school again.\" He chuckled seeing me wince then added, \"You could also all take online courses until graduation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn smiled. \"It looks like I'm getting a long summer vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does not mean I'm going to let you just laze around, young man.\" Sternly, Mom said. \"You will be helping me with chores, and you will be taking college classes online.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn winced. \"Yes, Mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So either I go back in grades with Dawn and graduate with her, or she takes an advancement test and graduates with me next year.\" Musing, I said. \"That, or we take online courses...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave it up to you two.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Only, I need your answer now. If Dawn agrees to take the test, she has to take it this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn and I turned to each other, startled. Only, like before, we were both certain of our answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I quickly paused the episode before turning to face the door.  \u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got a smile on my face when I saw Kat standing in the doorway; an equally big smile on her face.  Running into the room, she hugged me and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad I got to see you before they took you in for the operation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an operation, Kat; I won\u2019t even be giving anesthesia.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cBut, I am glad you got here before they brought me in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d pulling a chair up to my bedside, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019d be pretty nervous if I were in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous; mostly out of fear that it won\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to work.\u201d With a goofy grin, Kat said, \u201cIn a few days, once you\u2019re out of the hospital, we\u2019ll be able to hang out without you being in a wheelchair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard in a long time.\u201d Looking at Kat, I couldn\u2019t help but notice she was nervous about something.  <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m nervous; while you look worse than you did before your ballet recital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seem to recall breaking my leg at that recital; so I guess I had good reason to be nervous.\u201d Sighing, Kat said, \u201cBut, you\u2019re right, I am nervous; because there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you for a while now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel hurt that Kat seemed to be keeping something from me.  We never kept any secrets from each other; after all, she was the first one outside the family that I told about the procedure.  \u201cAre you keeping something from me, Kat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s only because I\u2019m afraid of how you\u2019ll react to it.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you since 7<sup>th</sup> Grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I\u2019d had any liquid in my mouth, I probably would have done a spit take at that news.  Looking at Kat, dumbfounded, I said, \u201cY-You have a crush on me?  Why\u2019d you never tell me before this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said told you because it felt wrong to think of you that way; you\u2019ve been like my big brother since I moved in next door.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cPlus there was the fact that you were 5 years older than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s not going to be an issue for much longer.\u201d  Pausing, I said, \u201cOnce we\u2019re the same age; perhaps we could see where things go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!?\u201d louder than she probably intended, Kat looked at me and said, \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not joking right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t think Kat was attractive; because she is.  I just felt weird thinking about her that way; because, like she said, I thought of her as my little sister.  We\u2019re talking about a girl who I taught how to ride a bike.  The more I thought about it, however, the more I realized there wouldn\u2019t be any issues once we were the same age.  \u201cI\u2019m not joking, Kat; I\u2019d like to go out with you sometime.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cJust promise me one thing; you won\u2019t get mad if, for one reason or another, one of us decides that the two of us dating is weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I could agree to that.\u201d Leaning over, Kat kissed me on the cheek and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat left a few minutes later; walking past Mom and a nurse as they came into the room.  Once Kat was out of earshot, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cKat seemed pretty happy; is there something I should know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot right now, Mom.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Gesturing to the nurse, Mom said, \u201cAre you ready for the procedure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse helped me into the wheelchair, I looked at Mom and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for the last four years, Mom.\u201d</span></div></div>",
