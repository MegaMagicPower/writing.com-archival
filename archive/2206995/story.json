Know even though i'd like to have this story written from the 2nd person the character is indeed based on myself. So let me tell you a little bit about myself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a 31 year old 5'6\" white male born and raised in the southeastern united states. I have an engineering degree, and i'm single with no kids so even though i'm not making six figures or anything money is not a big concern. I have my own place, and travel internationally when i have the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any other questions which may help you come up with potential chapters please let me know<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow unlike my other stories i don't think we need to worry about how or why i find myself in a different body with a different life, its not like i pissed someone off, maid a wish that was misinterpreted, or needed to learn a lesson i figure i can just wake up one morning and be like WTF?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo i could be a different skin color, relationship status, or social status, but i think for right now lets keep me the same age so we can focus on the cultural aspect of it instead of age which is a different change entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that should be enough to get us started so lets start the story lines with a few common races/cultures and go from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what Female body and life would you like to see me wake up to?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In travel, their is a term known as culture shock which is defined as the feeling of disorientation experienced by someone who is suddenly subjected to an unfamiliar culture, way of life, or set of attitudes. So in this story we will be taking this idea and applying it to gender change reality altering transformations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will go into more detail about the life of our main character in the first chapter but i'll go ahead admit that i'm basing him on myself. And i am really looking forward to reading everyone's input on what i would have in store for me were i to find myself as a different race/culture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Gender Change Porn is not what i'm going for here, all of my stories are supposed to be about sexy hilarious situations that the guy gets into which a he would normally never have to deal with as a guy. And as a white guy from the united states i'm fascinated by other races and cultures but id like to come up with realistic yet hilarious scenarios which go beyond common stereotypes, that is why i'm hoping for the support of my readers here on Writing.com :D<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for basic rules:<br>\r\n1) No mental changes, i feel like if the person doesn't know they have changed then their is no point<br>\r\n2) No extreme violence, light conflict is one thing but on need for death, or an ambulance, or anyone to call the police<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if you would like to link images in your chapters (which are always a nice touch in my opinion) please indicate that in parenthesis in the title of chapter, which will make it easier for me to find and replace expired links in the future if necessary. (which i'm noticing on some of my older stories lol) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that's what i have off the top of my head, i will update this as needed, if you have any thoughts or questions feel free to email me because i love brainstorming ideas. And as usual I do reserve the right to remove anything I believe to be inappropriate or just a pointless filler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but not least keep in mind that even though i'm basing the main character on myself and the character has done nothing to trigger this world turned upside down change, he is still going to freak out about it and want to change back lol <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with all that said, bring it on, i'm a white guy that's asking for interested experiences as a woman of different races or cultures lol<br>\r\n</td>",
