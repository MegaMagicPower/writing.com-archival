Rather than using wands, most channel magical energies through their bodies, realeasing it from their hands. Various schools exist across the globe, teaching and training children how to use and control magic in various ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who do you wish to follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed - Often called \"Ned the Nerd\" by pretty much the whole school, Ned is an outcast with glasses, braces and an acne covered face. Just about everyone abuses him in one way or another because of his feeble magic skills. Or at least, they used to be feeble. See, Ned's been studying a lot of spells lately, and practicing them every night before bed. He also happens to have discovered a spell of his own creation, one that lets him drain another's powers and add them to his own. Now it's time for some payback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira - The resident goth. Has a morbid fascination with the dead and death in general. Secretly practices necromancy, which is highly illegal. Wants to turn herself into a lich to gain greater power, as well as immortality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinnie - Adept at magic, but is more interested in alchemy. Specifically, a potion to make her more beautiful than the most popular girl in school so she can take her place.</span></div></div>",

The artificial light is bright, and the colors really shine, a mixed blend of pink and purple shell, spread apart dots, and an almost cartoonish size. You feel like you're the last person on Earth to finally get one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, they're more affordable. When the celebrities were taking selfies and they were pumping out movies every month with trained ones, the cost skyrocketed. But like with all trends, people had more or less grown bored with dinosaurs. Besides, the wild ones are too much trouble. There are breeds that are more docile, and a bustling illegal trade of the dangerous kinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you can finally afford one (a starter egg, nothing fancy), and after putting a down payment, the cashier brings out one of the eggs from the storefront. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll take care of it, right? These people, they come in, they spend their whole life savings, and they realize they can't even take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently hands you the egg wrapped in a blanket. \"These models have an accelerated phase, so just leave it in light and it should take no longer than a week.\" The salesperson rummages beneath the cash register and brings out a pamphlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will give you the basics on feeding and care. Shouldn't be too hard to feed it. They're genetically modified to adjust to whatever you have in your backyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank him and leave the store, holding the egg to your chest.  You don't even care that this is not a natural egg - this is the only reason they're more affordable now. It doesn't matter, you'll give your dinosaur the best care ever.</span></div></div>",

You live pretty far and since you don't get a chance to come here often, exploring sounds tempting enough to stay longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the place to be to catch a sight of all the different types of dinosaurs co-living with humans. You spot families walking their herd of gallimimus, walking speedily to catch up with the leashed, growling beasts that extend their long necks to snap and snip at each other. A businessman rudely cuts them all off, walking along a protective velociraptor, as he chats on his phone while the dinosaur eyes anyone approaching too close with a frightful suspicion. They really were incredible guards and conveniently, too expensive to only  be owned by the wealthiest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the glass dome of the mall ceiling, you hear the screech of pterodactyls circling around the building. They weren't uncommon but not typically owned as house pets. Too much upkeep and it was impossible for anyone in any neighborhood to get any sleep. Mostly they were attracted to the peak points of the buildings in cities where they gathered to roost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou protectively press the egg against you as you people watch. Towards the atrium near the food court, you see a group of people in bandanas raising their fists. <i>Protesters</i>, you realize when one of them begins to loudly yell about freeing the \"imprisoned innocent creatures subjected to slavery\" right before he flips over a metal table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt security will be here soon, you think, and there will be some big scene in the middle of the mall. Sighing, you look down at the egg. Are you going to worry about someone trying to snatch your new friend from you? You don't understand why they make such a big deal about it. The liberationists. After all, they don't have any complaints about dogs or cats, also the result of domestication after thousands of years to become the perfect house pets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scuffle in the food court grows louder as a protester shoves a man in a suit. The two begin to swing fists at each other as a crowd gathers to watch the scuffle. Surprisingly there is no security guard around yet and you are disturbed by the lack of response so far. The tram to exit the mall is just up the escalator. Perhaps this outing has come to a natural conclusion and it is time to go.</span></div></div>",

Suspiciously enough, the first booth you approach looks vacant. The outside of it has been vandalized with juvenile graffiti and you can see that the inside is also a mess. Paperwork scattered everywhere, a broken tablet, and a pack of pepper spray have been torn open and spilled on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around before pocketing one of the sprays. Meanwhile in the food court, the altercation has become a full blown fistfight, with the crowd of patrons shoving and scrapping against the liberatonists. Families begin to pack tightly against the hallway to exit and load onto the tram back to the city. The entire building is chaotic and loud with the screeching of pet dinosaurs. Even the pterodactyls flying in the air have become frantic and landed on top of the dome, clawing at the glass furiously. What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the egg wrapped around your jacket, you spot one of the other security booths. You don't even bother walking to it since it also appears to be deserted. A man and a woman dash by you with their own pachycephalosaurus catching up to them. The top of its ridged spiky head looks damp and the animal snorts annoyed as it walks around you. The oddest feature is the bandana tightly wound around the dinosaur's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are gonna want to go ahead and get out of here ASAP,\" the man tells you. His companion nods in agreement. \"The liberationists found a way to undo millions of years of symbiosis by putting something in the vents and <i>all </i>the dinos are going berserk.\" Before you can ask another question, the trio run off. Despite the quick encounter, you worry if the bandana they were trusting was going to protect anybody...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there has been an attack? And where is security? You can't think about it for much longer because a loud siren begins to blare. Red emergency lights from the upper portions of the mall flash wildly. Then, a voice is heard throughout the building. Loudspeakers of the mall boom with static until you hear the sound of a throat clearing. \"Attention all! The natural order has been restored by the <b>SBL</b>. Abandon the ones you have unjustly subjected to slavery and head to the nearest exits in an orderly fashion. This is your first and only warning to cooperate - your control ends today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the danger increasing by the second and the situation in the mall worsening, you consider your options and what to do with the egg that has cost your life savings...</span></div></div>",

The veneer is soft and cracks easily, forming a large fist-sized hole in the drywall. You can come back for it later, you realize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you have to get out of this mall and once they send in the State Police and clear up this mess, you can claim it again. It just makes you sick to your stomach, the thought of abandoning your dinosaur before it has even hatched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a spot where the egg is safely out of view, you crawl back out of the booth and to the commotion of the mall: crowds scurrying to exit and the increasing aggression of the protesters who have taken over in a swarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, far from the food courts, you hear a terrifying roar. The fleeing families scream and their stampede becomes even more frantic. You haven't seen any of their dinosaurs around... Whatever is spraying toward the vents makes them frightened of humans. Primal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to join one of the groups running, when a woman with a brown ponytail, her face hidden by a bandana blocks your path. She looks you up and down. When she sees you are holding a rag in your first and that your raggedy clothes mean you are no elite, she nods with approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you,\" her eyes flash dangerously. Your cheeks, still wet from the tears are sure to make you look guilty in the eyes of the hooligan. <br>\r\n\"They pepper sprayed you too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother looking, we took all the good stuff when we got rid of the guards.\" She hands you a cloth so you can wipe your eyes. Then with her back turned, with some type of firearm strapped, she turns to a pack running for safety. \"That's right, get out of here bougies! Leave your dinos here or you'll regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SBL girl appears to have mistaken you with one of their own.<br>\r\nYou know you can use this to your advantage, even though you aren't sure if socializing with the enemy is a safe way to stick around and make sure Egg isn't destroyed in the ongoing takeover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more of it,\" you blurt out to the girl. Purposely vague, you are unsure at first if it'll catch her attention. What are these <i>terrorists </i>using? Some type of hormone disruptor? A drug that just makes large reptiles become wild with rage? If you are going to stick around, you might as well find a way to destroy whatever is in their supply, you realize. You never imagined yourself in this situation but something had to go wrong, didn't it? <br>\r\nYour first time almost having a pet dinosaur...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More what? \" The girl replies. \"Oh...\" She realizes. <br>\r\n\"You have to go to Sarge, he has the stash on him.\" Hey, I heard these sickos kept the dangerous ones somewhere underneath. Wanna go with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell the girl is smiling through the cloth in front of her mouth. </span></div></div>",

You are beginning to suspect that she is a high-ranking member of this organization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've freed an apatosaurus from the petting zoo, Mei.\" <br>\r\nOne of the boys says. \"What do we do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get everybody out of here first. We're going to barricade the entrance and have our base set up before State Police is deployed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they don't want to get moving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are armed - they aren't, I am sure you'll figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe excuses herself from the group and the two of you head to a seemingly locked door by the escalator. The keys jingle as Mei unlocks the door. It opens with no issue, leading into a narrow stairway that descends down beneath the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closes the door behind and it shuts with a definitive slam. <br>\r\nThere is little light here and it only gets darker as the two of you walk underground. \"Hmm, it should be here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of you make it to the bottom of the stairs, this lower basement portion of the mall is illuminated with artificial lights reflecting off bright blue. Instead of walls, there is now a circular tank that takes up the entire space. You almost forget how dangerous this whole situation is becoming. You are in aw of the creature that resides down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the glass, you are rewarded with a view of the plesiosaur lifting a mighty fin and splashing around. It is surprisingly roomy here, but you can tell the creature is distressed being in such a confined space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't been able to gas it for obvious reasons,\" Mei says. <br>\r\n\"Sarge doesn't want any dino left untreated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could they just leave it here?\" You are disgusted. Even though you don't agree with the protestor's methods, they might have a point about how the dinosaurs are being treated here. Mei doesn't seem to be paying attention to your anger. Instead, she has the mission in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we drug some of the fish, we can get it to infest the chemical. After that, we can find a way to release it.\" It seems like an improbable outcome. However, she is looking at you as if she expects you to do the job for her - both of drugging the plesiosaur and somehow releasing it. </span></div></div>",

They went through the effort of decorating with replicated ferns and algae that would've been prevalent millions of years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful enclosure, only accessible for the moment, by an expensive VIP pass. Like most corporate exposures to dinosaurs, not a lot was known about what went on behind the scenes. To see the plesiosaur splashing around, emitting a confused screech that made the water ripple, was an astounding sight that would've once cost you thousands of dollars. Now, you felt sympathy for the being in such a small space, on a mockery of its own and all by its lonesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what the sick bastards call him?\" Mei interrupts your thoughts. \"Chompy! Even for a pet, he is supposed to be pretty temperamental.\" The liberationist is inserting vials of a chemical into the insides of fish. From the way up, you saw that Chompy's feeding time was just about to approach. Mei had herself been reluctant to join you on the other side, but access to the enclosure required two people - it was also a group effort to release the lock on the gate blocking the mighty dinosaur from swimming out into the bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we just drop them from up here?\" You look down into the pool where the beast is waiting to eat. If the drop isn't incredibly painful, even onto a wet surface, you don't want to think about what a creature like that would do out of curiosity.

The fyrd who'd been resisting this portion of his army could see that the men opposing them were thinning out and were about to launch a charge against the impending retreat when they found a large force of horsemen coming right at them; they responded with a sudden release of a great quantity of projectiles. Leading the charge the Duke of Normandy receives one of these right in his neck, killing him within seconds and leaving his head hanging limply from his neckbones and fronds of flesh. The cavalry charge had too much momentum at this time and slammed against the shield wall, sending William's body tumbling into the fyrd where it lay among the men for a matter of minutes while the charge was resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a key gap in the assault of the Normans opened up and the Saxons could add still more projectiles upon the army, prompting the cavalry to withdraw with a contingent of the fyrd on the Saxon right-flank in pursuit while the remaining men set upon William's corpse and severed his head completely. Gyrth Godwinson, brother of King Harold, received news of the duke's death and called for the Norman's head to be stuck upon the longest spear the men under his command could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor half-an-hour the forces of Normandy and her allies continued the struggle in earnest, blissfully unaware that their commander had been killed, although the left-flank had all but collapsed into a retreat for Hastings. The remainder of the fyrd on the Saxon right-flank turned to engage the exposed flank of the remaining strength of the Norman army while those who set off in pursuit cornered the allied infantry in a copse where they slaughtered the men and plundered their bodies bare; only the cavalry forces reached Hastings where news of William's death spread faster than on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Gyrth had lifted William's head high into the air on the end of a spear and began to carry it towards the king's position. Harold saw it soon enough and sent a message for his brother to carry it forwards to bolster the will of his men and sap the morale of the enemy. Sure enough the sight of their duke's severed head in the hands of the Saxon nobility led to a major drop in the Normans' morale, starting a wave of routing men from the Western end of the Norman forces to the East until the whole force fled with a strong contingent of the Saxon army in pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forces who'd come directly from Normandy made for Hastings to re-join their cavalry, intending to hold out until William's successor could send reinforcements. The allied forces under command of Alan the Red, having been heavily reduced during the collapse of the army's left-flank, had fled to Pevensey and had begun the process of re-embarkation. The remaining allies under command of Eustace of Boulogne, having the strongest available force, made camp at Bexhill with the intention of guarding communication between the other two surviving contingents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nightfall King Harold has a decision to make.</span></div></div>",

Aside from the prospect of attack by the Anglo-Saxon forces their choice of encampment was not as good an idea as it might've appeared from Eustace's point of view; William's policy of pillaging and burning to goad King Harold into joining battle had left the parish devoid of any viable shelter and any food they could've salvaged was now split amongst the three contingents of the allied forces and that was much lower than it could've been as a third of their supplies had been left behind for the English to plunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Harold opted to break the largest of the enemy forces and, thusly, keep the remaining two split and morale low. Gyrth, having lost the most men and achieving the glory of taking William's head, was set the task of laying siege to Hastings and given first choice of reinforcements but was under strict instruction not to storm the town until Harold sent the word. Leofwine Godwinson, another of Harold's brothers, was allowed a smaller force than he'd commanded at the Battle of Hastings and sent to harry the Bretonic forces at Pevensey while the king retained the majority of the available strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEustace of Boulogne had anticipated that a small force of Harold's men would be sent to Pevensey, but he'd assumed that they would be sent along the main road from Hastings while most of the Anglo-Saxon force would besiege the town. He'd readied a defence despite the weariness of his men on the morning of the 15th October, but no attack came. The weather was dry but the wind had turned bitter out of the East. In the afternoon Eustace ordered some scouts to check on the situation at Hastings where they each reported a large army in the vicinity by sunset, although what they'd actually encountered was Harold's men making ready to march upon Bexhill while guarding the road to London against any attempt by the Normans to sally. While this was occurring Leofwine and his men slipped past the sentries by a wide route to the North.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the morning of the 16th Harold's forces appeared on the road from Hastings. Eustace, having assumed that Harold was more concerned with taking Hastings, was taken by surprise as he was actually about to send some of his men to Pevensey with instructions to bring the boats along the coast. Eustace hurriedly sent out orders to establish a defence but Harold's army were already opening the battle with a mass of projectiles, which now included arrows released from Norman bows, and rendered the redeployment disorganised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle concluded with...</span></div></div>",

The result of this was that many of the rank-and-file serving under Eustace were either killed or injured to the point of being unable to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with the prospect of another defeat in the same week Eustace, Count of Boulogne, decided that he'd have to try and get the wounded out of danger and appointed one of the late duke's closest confidants, William FitzOsbern, in charge of the contingent that was to escort the wounded back to Pevensey. His orders were for Alan the Red to commence loading of the wounded and camp followers onto the boats and send them back to Normandy while the remaining strength was to ready the remaining vessels to receive the rest of his men in a fighting retreat but not to cast off until he himself boarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time William had began the evacuation of the wounded Harold's men were running low on designated projectiles, permitting Eustace a reprieve while they readied themselves for an advance. Eustace had been so pre-occupied with organising the evacuation with William that he didn't really think much of the lull in the missile attack until he heard the war cry of Harold's huscarls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEustace wouldn't reach Pevensey; the only men under his command who survived the close-quarter fighting arrived at the beaches in frantic disarray with a notable reduction in their arms and armour.

Looking between the assembled men and the approaching infantry Alan the Red had to make a decision to either stand and fight or embark and set off. The wind was currently flowing from the North-East and a number of his own men had already gone with the boats to defend against any possible Vikings or pirates that might be snooping around the Channel. An hour before noon Alan made his decision as the huscarls were now close enough for him to hear their taunts and he could see members of the fyrd forming a rear guard or reserve force, what's more the banner of King Harold could now be seen on the road from Hastings. Alan called for a retreat with the aim of reaching Rouen to recuperate and send a report to Robert, who'd now be the Duke of Normandy in his father's stead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome men stayed voluntarily to fend off the huscarls closing on their position, prompting Alan to identify each of them individually by name so that they'd be written into the chronicles for posterity.

The three met in the one tavern in town known to be frequented by members of the nobility with the widow Matilda, Robert's mother, and her younger son Richard. A quantity of men also stood in attendance but they were there to stand guard of these noble personages and were not to speak of the plans being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert had intended to start preparations for another invasion of England for revenge against Harold Godwinson's army slaying his father, but Matilda talked him out of it by speaking of how it hurt her just as much and how she wasn't calling for the English king's head, also she looked to passages in the Bible that highlighted the sinful nature of vengeance. Alan supported her statement by recalling how the bold actions of Duke William and his men led to the collapse of the alliance within the forces that had crossed. FitzOsbern brought out matters of logistics and the cost of the expedition, prompting Robert to look at the prospect of making peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the Channel, with the forces in Hastings having surrendered, Harold was discussing what would be the best course of action from here. He'd called a meeting of the Witan to present his available options and the viability of them. The most obvious option he had was to send an emissary to Normandy to expound over how their army was trounced and that they'd have to accept peace terms as he'd provide, but this could lead to later attempts to take the crown by disgruntled members of the French nobility. Another possibility was to launch a retaliatory strike against Normandy, but this could lead to all-out war with France. Also Harold could send an emissary to Normandy with the intention of hearing what kind of peace terms they'd be willing to discuss, but this could be misconstrued as a sign of weakness and lead to another attempt to claim the throne. Remaining options were to send an emissary to the French king himself to discuss the fact that the Duke of Normandy went to war without representing France itself, but there was some talk among the members of the Witan that this could be found as being a falsehood should Philippe choose to interpret it as such. Or, finally, a representation could be made to the Pope on how the Duke of Normandy had sinned against the people of England and paid the price; the danger here being that Harold's men had taken a banner indicating that the head of the church had ordained the invasion and, as such, could potentially excommunicate the whole nation in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set, casting a ruddy glow over the River Thames, the king of England and his appointees came to a conclusion.</span></div></div>",
