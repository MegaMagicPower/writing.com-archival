He hops out of his hut and heads to the cave where his banana pile is. He picks one off of the pile and takes a quick bite from it and expecting a delicious flavor but as he chews on it he finds it rather lacking in taste and it melts away in his mouth! His eyes go wide from this discovery! But he scratches his head as he doubts that could be true for the other bananas and he picks up a second one and takes a bite out it... It lacks flavor and it dissolves in his mouth! He couldn't believe what was happening but it was! He tried a third one but the same thing happened! He tried again and yielding the same results!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ape couldn't comprehend nor would he wanted to! He beats his chest a few times and hollers angrily at the sky to vent his frustration. After that outburst he rubs his head a few times before spotting a couple of kritters outside and they yelp from surprise and run off to Jungle Japes.</span></div></div>",

Donkey Kong hollers in anger as he pursues the kritters but they split up and the gorilla stops at the point where they separated. He scratches his head a few times before his belly lets out a low grumble and he blinks a few times and groans from it being empty. He lets out a small sigh and looks at the two sets of footprints... One left to the deeper part of the jungle while the other one was heading to a lake. The ape shakes his head a few times before beating his chest a few times getting himself ready to take on what was in store for the path that he took.</span></div></div>",
