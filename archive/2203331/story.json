You have a variaty of spells and just aquired a new one called shrink. In the booklet, you read that the shrunken object/person becomes immune to damage or pain, so it was perfect for a macrophile like yourself. You also had the ability to enter different realities by the form of the spell teleportation, which you had confirmed also worked on fictional works such as anime or cartoons. Even books or live-action shows weren't exempt. If you went to a live-action show there would be no sets, the characters would just be themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cast of your spell, you decided to transport into your favorite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Anime<br>\r\nB: Cartoon<br>\r\nC: Live-Action<br>\r\nD: Book<br>\r\nE: Something Else?</span></div></div>",

You snap out of your trance at the entrance of the village, your shrinking spell already applied, because it wouldn't take a genius to find out how ninjas would react to a person just appearing out of nowhere in front of their village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had transported yourself into the world of Naruto, the first season in specific. The main reason for this was that it would be much easier to find who you want to find by simply going to the ninja academy since most of the main characters were still in school. Of course, the fact that they were still pre-teens was a little bit of a turnoff, but at the size you are, anything is big, including both male and female body parts from all ages. You easily navigate through the village, using a flying spell to get a high vantage point and Zeroing in on the Ninja Academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou propel yourself forward through a window and you find yourself in the class of the main cast of characters.

In front of you were a bunch of toes, things that you were interested in, but for later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Sakura's plain legs and know that despite her lack of training, she would still be able to feel you on her skin, so you decide to charge power into your legs and grab onto her red combat dress. You climbed up the dress with relative ease, until you reached her waist section, to which you saw her kunai pocket.

First being, if you get caught Naruto wouldn't be a cruel person like say, Kiba or Sasuke. Naruto also has the least skill at detecting people caused by the blatant improper teaching aimed towards him. Also, he was a hyper kid, and hyper kids were always active meaning your journey would never be boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, you used a speedup spell and took the long way around the room, making sure not to catch the attention of Mizuki or Iruka at the front of the class. At last, you arrived at Naruto's sandals and jumpsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there were a couple of ways to go about this. You could hop between his toes, but that might lead to you getting caught. You could also climb his jumpsuit which would make you impossible to detect, but you would have to get to his pocket before he started walking. The next option was the exact opposite of the first, to climb inside his jumpsuit. The risk of falling when he moved was smaller, but the chance of being caught was increased. The final option was to purposely get Naruto's attention and become friends with him, which would allow you to do a lot more things, and with his permission to boot!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thinking it through you decided that climbing up the inside of Naruto's Jumpsuit would be the best option. The point of your trip was to get up close to some giant forms and the risk was part of that. Casting a few quick spells to enhance your agility and grip strength, you ducked under the rim of Naruto's pant leg which seemed closer to a giant stage curtain at your current size. After dropping the thick 'at least to you' fabric you leap up and catch hold of one of the folds in his jumpsuit, the force of your movement swinging you dangerously close to the Ninja's bare leg. Despite a magically enhanced jump, you were only just above the boy's ankle and the heat and stench were already intense. From your understanding of the show, it wouldn't be surprising if Naruto had spent all his time before class running about, so the sweat wasn't exactly a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the entire region shook as Naruto mildly adjusted his position. The minuscule piece of fabric you were clinging too was hit by the shockwave and you were launched straight into the pale white skin of Naruto's leg. Reflexively you grabbed onto the flesh, the smell of his sweat heavy in your nose. For a moment things seemed still until the fabric of his jumpsuit was pushed in as Naruto leaned down to scratch the itch on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clothed digit moves ever closer you look up. If danger weren't so close at hand you might have been amused by the foxes printed on his boxers. If you used a large amount of magic and jumped you might make it to his butt. On the other hand, you could try and dodge the finger and hope he assumes the itch is gone?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided getting Naruto's attention would be the best route to take, he was a nice enough in the show but, making him mad by invading his person might ruin your chances of spending time with your favorite character. Having walked into the classroom, you got to see all the young characters from your favorite show and your heart almost bursts out of your chest! This was such a dream come true! Among the crowd were the obvious favorites but you were looking for the one and only and, soon, your eyes fell upon Naruto, true to his character, sleeping in class. With your speed spell already cast, it didn't take you long to make it to his feet, the boys large open toed shoes looked enticing, to your perspective, his toes appeared to be huge flesh colored walls expanding for miles. At your size you could easily make out his foot sweat which was almost dry by now, no doubt from his running around earlier in the day and, his massive toes, even while asleep were fidgeting and moving as he dreamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping your eyes away from his appealing boy feet, you had to keep yourself in check. Getting his attention first could allow you to explore him at your own will but, you needed to do that first, so, you quickly make your way up the desk towards his face, which, once again, thanks to your speed spell, didn't take long. Arriving at the top of the desk, you had to think of way to get his attention, it wasn't going to be easy, he was after all, a pretty heavy sleeper. As you were about to enact your plan, your eyes fell on his boyish features and you started getting devious thoughts again. He certainly was cute at this age, his mouth slightly agape, you could make out his two front teeth as well as his huge wet tongue which was sticking out a little. You could easily enough climb in and explore, maybe even get a full tour of the boys digestive system.. No, no no! Once again pulling yourself out of fantasy, you realize you had failed to see Naruto moving his head around on the desk, before you knew it, his huge nose was coming towards you fast, and before you could get another spell off, the suction from him breathing lifted you off your feet as the air pulled you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTumbling through the air, you pass by huge strands of nose hairs before colliding with the inside of Naruto's nose, you quickly stick to the huge sticky interior of his nostril as mucus quickly binds you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH</b><br>\r\n<b>WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant gusts of air flow in and out of Naruto's nose as he breaths, this wasn't quite what you had in mind to get his attention, your plan was a bit more sophisticated than this but, it did present an opportunity to be found, so, you began to fidget and move around inside his nose and soon you felt the fleshy cave begin to move as the boy's nose scrunched in his sleep, irritated by something in his nose. It wasn't long and you felt like you were on a roller coaster ride as he raised his head up from the desk as you hear. \"Ahh... ahhh.. ahhh... <b>CHOOOOOOO</b> !! Immediately you were pulled from the inside of his nostril and shot out like a bullet, colliding into Naruto's hands as snot rained down on top of you. Now, completely covered in mucus, you had to wait and see if he managed to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his hands away from his face, Naruto lifts up his arm as he wipes his nose on his sleeve. Being a young boy, he brought his hands up to his face to see how much snot came out of his nose when he caught a peculiar sight. It looked like a small person was plastered to his hand, covered in his snot! Just as he was about to make a move, his attention was pulled away as his teacher addressed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, look who is back from the dead, have a good nap?\" The rest of the class erupts in laughter at the teachers remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha.... well, you see, I wasn't napping, I was just focusing you see!\" Naruto says clearly lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you know Naruto, someday you might find yourself in a situation where you wish you had 'focused' less and paid more attention to my teachings, you will do well to remember that. Now go clean yourself up, I can see that snot from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto excuses himself from class to go clean his hands off. Being a young boy, he simply picks you out of the snot and rubs the rest on his pants. Pretty soon, your whole world is consumed by Naruto's piercing blue eyes as they focus in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you? Why are you so small? Are you some kind of assassin? Why were you in my nose?\" Question after question, he fires at you before you can even answer. \"So what is it?\" He finally finishes his game of a thousand questions. Not trying to come across as some kind of pervert, you feign stupidity. \"I don't know! Last thing I remember was waking up on your desk and being sucked up your nose! I'm no assassin! I promise!\" you say, not very convincingly. Naruto being young though, couldn't tell you were lying thankfully and pretty soon you could tell he was deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't remember anything else aside from waking up on my desk?\" He asks. \"Not even where you're from or who your family is?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a thing.\" You answer back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I know! I can help you! Being so small is going to make it impossible to really take care of yourself so, I can help you until your memory returns!\" Naruto says back to you with so much enthusiasm. Suddenly, Naruto realizes he's been away from class for a little too long. \"Oh man, I need to get back to class... where can I keep you though? My pockets are full and I don't want you getting hurt from any of the sharp weapons and other things...\" He says puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chest fills up as you realize this was a good opportunity. \"Well.... you could always, you know, put me in your boxers, it would be safer than your pockets.\" You say sheepishly, concerned you might have crossed the line. You notice Naruto turn beet red at your suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. you would be okay with going in there? I mean, it's probably pretty warm and sweaty in there, not to mention you'd be in there with my... you know, wiener.\" He says to you, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're concerned about that I could always go in the other side?\" You say, slightly reinforcing that you're okay with going in his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.. what if I sit on you? I could easily crush you if you were caught under my butt cheeks and, I doubt you want to go between them, it's probably realllly stinky back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize he brought up a good point, obviously, you knew you couldn't be crushed but, it's not like you could tell him that. \"I don't think the smell would be a problem, but I see your point. If it makes you feel better, I don't mind going in the front, promise.\" You reassure him. You see him mulling the idea around in his head and nod slightly. You watch as his free hand pulls his pants open as he brings you over the dark chasm. Looking down, you can vaguely make out the outline of his huge cock, based on the small amount of light, it looks like he's easily above average for his age as his monstrous uncut cock laid limp in his boxers. You feel his hand tilt and you're soon free falling towards the huge beast, your environment quickly becoming humid as the heat and sweat mix into the air causing a really musky smell to surround you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming down onto the boy's moist sausage, you hear his pants slap shut as he begins to walk back to class, his giant dick was sweaty enough to make staying on top of it easy but, you could also do whatever you wanted to and easily play it off as an accident... With that in mind you...</span></div></div>",

All you wanna do is prove you\u2019ve got what it takes to be a good mage as well as take a quick trip to explore another world. It would only be for a little while so what could go wrong? You and your master have done it plenty of times and you feel like you can handle it. You decide to visit a place called Konoha and see what makes it so special. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cast some of the strongest protection spells you know to prepare for any unfriendly encounters and start creating on the teleportation ring. Making the ring with what you think is the right measurements and amount of magic, you step inside and cast the right spell to activate it. In a flash of light, you feel your body becoming lighter and lighter until you feel your feet hit the ground again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere have you landed?</span></div></div>",

A sharp breeze of cold wind pierces you, which makes your tiny body shiver in shock. Wanting to get shelter, you spot a nearby cave and run your little legs as fast you can towards it. Once inside you take a rest as you get some momentary relief. A groan of pain startles you as you hear it coming from deeper in the cave. Following a path of blood, you see a giant woman laying against the cave wall. Blonde hair flows from her head and golden eyes look dazed as she holds her arm against a wound on her torso. Her torn robes gives off a tremendous view of breasts that are gigantic even for a regular sized person. Her hips are pretty big too, with some extra padding on her thighs. She seems to have a lot of other wounds on her, ranging from cuts to even burn marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only know a few healing spells but you decide to do your best to help this giantess. Walking towards her, you do your best to assure her that you\u2019re here to help. \u201cUm, hi there. I\u2019m gonna try and heal you up as best as I can, just please don\u2019t move too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman\u2019s eyes look down and widen at you in surprise for a few seconds before returning back to her previous dazed look. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but simply nods her head slowly to show agreement. With a grunt, she slowly removes her arm to reveal a deep gash with strange symbols around it. You get as close as you can to it and cast the best spell you can think of to heal it. It takes a few minutes or so but you managed to close most of the wound. As you work on healing some of her other wounds, you feel yourself losing your senses and as you start casting another spell near one of her thighs, you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold sensation makes your body shiver and starts to wake you as you hear the voice of a mature woman talking to you. \u201cHello? Are you alright down there? Finally, you\u2019re waking up! I was beginning to think you\u2019d never wake up again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you\u2019re greeted with the sight of a giant woman and her golden eyes looking down at you with both curiosity and concern. You appear to be laying in her giant set of hands as you feel the strange texture of the ground you\u2019re laying on. Her thick lips form a curved line to give you a cautious yet relieved smile. Your eyes are having a hard time peeling away from staring at her giant breasts as they sway side to side as she moves her face closer towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho, who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Tsunade, I\u2019m a medical ninja from Konoha. Now who are you? And why are you so small? Don\u2019t get the wrong idea, I\u2019m quite grateful for you saving my life, but it\u2019s not everyday I meet someone as tiny as yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my names Y/N, I\u2019m a mage, well, a mage in training. I wanted to go explore different worlds so I made a teleportation ring to travel here. But I think I messed up my spells again because now I\u2019m as small as a toothpick. I think it\u2019s safe to say I still need some more training along with some better habits...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may be true, but I think you\u2019ve done a wonderful job with me. You managed to heal wounds that were bigger than your entire body! So don\u2019t feel too bad, you just need some more experience.\u201d she reassures you as she pats your head with one of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of pride strikes your heart after you hear these words and can\u2019t help but feel more optimistic about your future with magic. \u201cThanks Tsunade, that means a lot to me, really it does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try standing up but after 5 or so steps you fall back down. Your body seems to be pretty weak at the moment and moving too much seems to wear you out. A frosty breeze flows through the cave which makes your body shivers in the cold as your skin turns frigid underneath the thin clothing you\u2019re wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy there little guy, you probably used up a lot of energy patching me up. Just take it easy until I heal you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey Tsunade, can we move s-someplace warm? I\u2019m kinda freezing my butt off at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think I have an idea that\u2019ll heal you as well as warm you up. I don\u2019t have as much energy for my usual healing techniques so I\u2019ll have to use one that\u2019s a little...unique.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnique?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, basically, I\u2019m gonna help you using my....\u201d</span></div></div>",

She brings her hand closer to it until you are brushed against the doughy flesh. It\u2019s incredibly soft, not to mention warm, and you wouldn\u2019t mind snuggling up against her belly in order to warm up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean...you\u2019re gonna eat me?\u201d you ask as you hear a few gurgles and groans emit from inside her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but there\u2019s nothing to worry about, you\u2019ll be fine. With this technique my stomach becomes a place where the occupants are healed as well as protected. I can tell you it\u2019s not a technique I\u2019ve ever had the need to use before until now. So what do you say? Up for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take much of the piercing cold to convince you to go along with her promise of someplace warm and bale to rest. Besides, it doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad idea to be in the belly of a beauty like Tsunade...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I trust you Tsunade. I just hope it\u2019ll be comfy enough...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me kid, you\u2019ll be in for a real treat. Conveniently you\u2019ll also be a treat for me, hehe.\u201d Tsunade reassures you with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a firm yet gentle grasp of her fingers, you are brought towards Tsunade\u2019s plump lips. Suddenly, she leans in closer and soon enough you\u2019re enveloped by her pillowy lips in a massive kiss. The two walls of lip cover your entire head and most of your torso as they envelop you in a hug. Her lips feel warm and you can\u2019t help but lean into the kiss to soak up the warmth and enjoy the softness around you. A few seconds later she brings her lips back with a sultry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy that? Just consider that one of my ways of thanking you for saving my butt earlier. So, you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart flutters from that wonderful experience but you manage to answer back quickly with a reddened face. \u201cY-yeah I\u2019m ready when you are Tsunade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Y/N hope you taste as sweet as you look!\u201d she says as she opens her mouth in preparation. Inside her mouth rests a long, meaty tongue as her throat pulsates in anticipation of your arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is placed inside her mouth and onto her saliva drenched tongue. You can\u2019t help but let out a small shriek of surprise as you feel it move and rub itself against you. It\u2019s slimy and soft surface gives a long lick all over your body and eventually your entire face. It\u2019s a nice sensation and feels like a massage that relaxes and above all warms your body up. You can hear a distinct humm come from Tsunade as she continues to savor your taste with more licks. After a few more licks, her tongue rests flat for a moment until it rises to slide you down Tsunade\u2019s throat. Her throat caresses your tiny body as it slides down slowly until you pass through the esophagus and finally drop into her stomach with wet squelching sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back onto your feet as you try to adjust yourself to your new surroundings. Pink, fleshy, slimy walls surround you in a spacious area that seems to be as big as a house to you! Your body becomes relaxed as the warmth courses through it as well as feel something else inside your body being restored. The walls in here look puffy and even pillow-like. Curious, you press against the walls and find that your hands sink into the squishy flesh like some sort of slimy beanbag chair. You decide to lay against the wall and to your surprise and delight, it contorts around your body like a meaty hug. Just as you\u2019re starting to relax and take in the softness of stomach flesh, the entire stomach suddenly shakes as you hear a sound rumble above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Tsunade lets out a satisfied, wet belch that echoes throughout the cave. \u201cUUURRP! I gotta hand it to you Y/N, you taste pretty good! You feel pretty nice in there too. So, how\u2019re you holding up in there? The quarters to your liking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! It\u2019s a bit strange, but it\u2019s actually quite cozy here in your stomach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to hear it sweetie. Now, it\u2019ll be a long trip back to the village so just kick back and make yourself comfortable.\u201d she replies with a pat of her plump belly and makes her way out of the cave with the speed only a ninja could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snuggle back against her stomach walls and start to drift off as you soak in the soothing flesh and heat of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Of course, you couldn't do it back then, but now you could. Let alone just joining the show, you could use your powers and surprise no one because those existed in the form of devil fruit. Joining Luffy's crew would be hard at any time other than the start, mainly because of Zoro, being the hardass that he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to meet Luffy as a child right after he ate the Gum-Gum fruit and integrate yourself into the lore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you started shrinking to a pretty small size, maybe 6 inches or so. Not super noticeable but also not too small. After your shrinking was complete, you chanted the spell to go into the fictional world. As the spell finished you blinked your eyes. As they opened again, you were in a small village by the ocean. The town was named Foosha Villiage, or Windmill Villiage. You see where the windmill part came from, as there were many windmills scattered along the town. The area was quiet, the only sound you heard was the calm wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the silence, however, was the shrill voice of a young boy that you recognized as Monkey.D.Luffy. It was a somber tone of voice, contrary to his normal cheer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"How come Shanks let that bandit pour Sake all over him. I thought he was a cool pirate but it seems he's just a chicken.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled softly, knowing that Shanks was just being the bigger man and not starting a conflict. As he walked in your direction you quickly grew yourself, surprising him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Hey, what's wrong? I couldn't help but hear you moping over there.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"HEY, I'M NOT MOPING!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, Luffy blinked, seemingly just now registering that a person suddenly appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"WHERE'D YOU COME FROM!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hands up jokingly. <span class=\"cindigo\">\"Easy there, I just wanted to know what was wrong. To answer your question though, I was here the entire time, just smaller.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Smaller?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"It's my Devil Fruit Ability, to change sizes from small to big.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Ooooh, like that thing Shanks got mad at me for eating a while back. I can stretch myself reaaaal long.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a grin. <span class=\"cindigo\">\"That's pretty cool. You planning to be a pirate with that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"HECK YEAH! I'm gonna be a better pirate then dumb Shanks ever could be.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Is that so? Well, you wanna be in the same crew when we grow up?\" You put on a mock depressed face, \"I wanted to be a pirate too but people think the power to shrink is useless so no one I ask cares.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"They're dumb heads then, shrinking is super awesome! Yeah! Let's be pirates together!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Thanks... Captain\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>With that, Luffy and Y/N grew up together.

WHO OR WHERE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spread your arms out and knocked into a shelf, which knocked down a few disc covers onto the floor. You proceeded to clean up after yourself until one cover caught your eye. The cover was labeled, \"No Game No Life.\" You remembered that this was the first anime you watched when growing up. You also remembered that you had a crush on one of the character's; Shiro. Too bad it only had 1 season. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both questions have been answered. Without hesitation, you grabbed your staff and focused your power on both your size and dimension. After a few brief moments, you were absorbed by a blinding light. When you recovered your vision, you were standing on a fancy looking chair. You looked around your surroundings, but it's hard to tell, you believe it to be some sort of outdoor patio of the castle. Not even long after, you heard footsteps approach you. It's Shiro! And she has no idea that your there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe positions her dress so the back of the dress is on the seat. Now you are face to face with her white panties. You looked at the bottom of the chair to find that she has taken her shoes off revealing her purple feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Panty shots and feet?! How could this get any better?\" You thought to yourself as you were filled with joy. As luck would have it, Shiro was eating a small snack, when a chunk landed beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Enter Shiro's Panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Jump down and enter Shiro's shoe.

Her red eyes observed the cookie piece with a blank expression. Without any warning, she threw the cookie into her mouth, unaware of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of her tongue threw you off the crumb and you almost fell down her throat, but thankfully, you were able to roll to the left and grabbed the back tooth. You didn't want to enter her stomach yet. You then hurled  yourself back onto her tongue. It last long because after 2 or 3 bites, you and the crumbs were thrown toward the back of her throat and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the walls of her throat squeezes you further down. You could hear Shiro's heart beating as you traveled further in. Eventually, you were dropped into her stomach. Bits and chunks of other cookies were already turned into mush, ready to be delivered into her body. You were about to get comfortable until a waterfall of white liquid fell from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this......milk?\" You asked yourself.

You were right to question yourself, WHY DID YOU NOT THINK ABOUT THIS SOONER?! \"To Love Ru\" and \"To Love Ru: Darkness\", both are known for having really good fan service. You started to focus your spell on where you want to go and its obvious; The School! You didn't need an object for this spell, you already know the series by heart. As soon as you started focusing on the smell, you were immediately engulfed in a blinding white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your vision returned, you were standing in the middle of the school's hallway. You immediately noticed the classroom on your left. The door was open wide enough for you to squeeze through and see who's there. However, you were only able to see one person and that was Tearju Lunatique. She appeared to be at her desk, grading some papers. You could sense some form of magic inside, which would mean that Lala, Momo, and Nana are there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the hallway, you could see two girls talking to each other. Those two girls were Yui Kotegawa and Haruna Sairenji. It looks like the hallway continues past them, probably if you explore, you could find more girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was the holy land for perverts; the girl's changing room! The door was closed, but you could slide under it and do some peeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Enter the classroom. (There are more girls there then what I listed, so Mikan is there also.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB:Head down the hallway (Like I said, if your not interested with these two, you could head further down to probably the nurse's office, plus she's hot!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Crawl into the Girl's Changing room (Do I need to explain this one?......... ok: Mio, Risa, Saki, Rin, and Ayako are here. I needed to fill the space somewhere.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. If you have NO idea who these characters are or what this anime is about, please look it up and proceed with caution around other people. I called it \"fan service\" for a reason!</span></div></div>",

Still a bit too tired to fly, you jump off the couch and land on the soft carpet as Lincoln walks through the living room, you're quick to make your way in front of him, ready to jump on his sweaty foot. <br>\r\n<b>thoom <br>\r\nthoom <br>\r\nthoom</b> <br>\r\nYou're so small, his footsteps are almost enough to shake you to your very core, even with him being so far away. Suddenly, out of the blue, he comes to a stop, a curious look on his face. Before you could react, your ears are assaulted from behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THOOM <br>\r\nTHOOM <br>\r\nTHOOM <br>\r\nTHOOM</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around just in time to see four year old Lisa Loud in nothing but girly panties, running directly for you! Not being quick enough, her huge sweaty left foot eclipses your view as her ring toe and pinky toe land perfectly around you. You're so small that her foot sweat and the microscopic grime built up between her toes are enough to whisk you away with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUT OF MY WAY LINCOLN!\" She yells, as she somehow uses her small size to push Lincoln aside. \"I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM FIRST IT'S AN EMERGENCY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're ears are ringing as her stinky feet carry you with them to the bathroom, each time her foot comes down, your brain rattles around in your skull causing you to get dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THOOM THOOM THOOM THOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Lisa finally makes it into the bathroom and onto the toilet, her girly panties fall from the sky and cover you and her feet, the smell of her sweaty privates washes over you. While your original plan involved exploring Lincoln, this presented a whole new option! Lisa would undoubtedly end up running experiments or having dinner with him later, giving you the option to switch at a later time, meaning you had free range to explore Lisa in the time being. Up above you hear the giant four year old begin to release her bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS</b> <br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been to Niagara Falls, but you can only assume it sounds pretty similar, she must have been holding it in running experiments. You look around at your surroundings, the smelly foot grime has both your arms bound so spell casting was out of the question, you needed to get out of it quickly before she finished using the bathroom if you wanted any kind of chance to explore the rest of her, so you begin to wiggle your body in an attempt to dislodge yourself. Unbeknownst to you, your actions attracted the unconscious side of Lisa's brain as she felt a small irritation between her toes, out of nowhere, her two toes crash into each other as she attempts to scratch the tiny itch you're causing, the heat from the hot day was nothing compared to the intense friction Lisa was causing as your body was rubbed up and down her sweaty toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was done scratching, your grimy binds were almost completely broken, you're quite curious why she was still on the toilet until you heard a couple of plops and realized she was emptying her bowels as well. A sense of relief washed over you as you realized her pooping was buying you extra time, but not much because you can hear her ripping some toilet paper off to wipe herself. With your clock dwindling down with each passing second, you...</span></div></div>",

It was only an instant for your surroundings to change. As opposed to the beige colored walls of your room, the surroundings were now blue, confirming you had gotten the right place. You had also thought about being before the Great Calamity because Mipha was the reason you came here and she uh... kinda died in the Calamity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used a spell of flight to hover in the air about 10 feet off the ground to look for the fish waifu. You hovered around the entire domain and eventually found Mipha, walking around with her light-scale trident in hand. She was wearing essentially nothing, not unlike the rest of the Zora. Unlike the games, however, she had genitals that were just in the open. You decided that following her would be the right call, considering you couldn't really have much fun while she was walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of walking, Mipha entered her room and shut the door behind her. You swooped in at the last second and made it in. Mipha, thinking she was alone let out a big sigh, before jumping back on her water bed. She then turned to start reading a book that she had by the bedside. Since she was distracted, this would be the perfect time to tour her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Of course, you could reveal yourself to her by flying in front of her book and she'd certainly be a kind and gentle person like in the games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final option would just be to wait for her to fall asleep, lowering the risk of being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was engaged in her hidden pastime of writing books, although you knew from the games that she wasn't really good at it, despite being very well-read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of how to approach this situation. There was the sneaky way, where you have fun with her body while she's little the wiser, but it could end to a very dicey situation if she finds you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother way to approach this would be to pretend to be a random citizen who got shrunk like in all those stories online. Blanc was a responsible Goddess, especially towards her citizens, which would likely mean Blanc would keep you safe and probably wouldn't unleash her anger on you if she got upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third way was similar to the second one, except you reveal your abilities and say you wanted to meet her. She likely already knows about the whole \"game\" situation because of Neptune so this would be a great way to make a sort of business relationship with Blanc that could possibly lead to the other CPU's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn regards to the second or third option, she might appreciate if you say her boobs are big and to you, even her's would be pretty big.</span></div></div>",

It was wide enough for you to slide on in and closed back up her panties once you entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you entered, you accidentally hit Vert's Clitoris on the way down.

She was standing above you, thinking on what her to add for her comic. Her figure was amazingly beautiful from her pelvis to her large bust. The downside was her mask.

You probably might have a hard time putting it off, but you'll think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your right was Minori. She was drawing some sort of picture.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to teleport to the Heijo Clandestine Girls' Academy. It was pretty simple really, you just had to think of someone who was a big of a pervert as you, which, of course, was Ryona. You focused your mind on that specific person because remembering that Academy name is way to long and hard. (That's what she said!) Regardless, you were able to focus your magic towards teleporting to the Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself within the Academy. The interior resembled an ancient Japanese temple, but was painted black. Probably because of what there motto was: \"Where good accepts few, evil accepts all.\" There was an open window to your right, revealing more of the Academy an judging by the lights outside, it was night, probably around 10:00 P.M. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice something strange. You could see the window clearly and you were close to the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the spell not work?\" You asked yourself. \"I know I did the spell correctly.\" You then looked at your hands to see if it was true. Sure enough, you were shrunk, your hands looked smaller when you made a comparison with your hands and the window. However, you noticed something on your hands, strands of yellow hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm small, the spell worked, and this is someone's hair. Does that mean I'm on-\" You said, but before you finished, you heard a girl yelling close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOD DAMMIT RYONA! STOP BEING A PERVY BITCH FOR ON MINUTE!\" The girl screamed. The spell did work, but you focused on Ryona as a reference that you teleported right on top of her head. And if you were on Ryona, then the girl that was screaming before had to be her sister, Ryobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, yes, please call me a bitch again!\" Ryona said with delight<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"Ughh, why bother, it's no fun if you enjoy being yelled at.\" Ryobi replied with a disgust tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ryobi and Ryobi are kinda like twin sisters, but not by appearance. They had different colored eyes and a completely different personality, Ryobi was the one with brown hair and a flat chest, but you didn't mind. You accept all sized breasts! Ryona was her sister. She had blonde hair and a much larger breast size (like every other character in this game.) Ryobi's left eye was blue and her right eye was green. Ryona was similar with the eye color, but its switched around, her left eye was green and her right eye was blue. Both of them were wearing a fully black school uniform which revealed their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both continued arguing, or probably not? Ryona was enjoying being yelled at. At your size, you could slip into Ryona's shirt and play with her breasts or vagina. Ryobi was across from you, so you could probably make the jump or teleport if you didn't. Plus, there were other girls besides her to perv on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Stick with Ryona and jump into her shirt. You could play with her breasts or fall further down towards her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Jump to Ryonbi and perv on her. There's nothing wrong with a flat chest and besides, her shinobi transformation makes her boobs bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Jump off Ryona's head and try to find the other girls.</span></div></div>",

Ryobi and Ryona were still in the middle of their \"argument\", so it makes this easier to slip into Ryona's shirt. You quickly used the hair to launch yourself into her shirt and dived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ryobi noticed that Ryona's breasts jiggled for a bit. She scoffs at the fact that Ryona's breasts were larger than hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister, what's wrong? Don't you like my breasts?\" Ryona said seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, No, it's nothing. Just learn to control yourself.\" Ryobi responded in an annoyed tone and walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside Ryona's shirt, you slid your way towards her left nipple. What was noticeable was that it's erect. When you landed on it, you could hear Ryona moan and shiver with delight. As much as you want to play with her nipple, you couldn't risk getting caught already. The only way to escape suspicion was to head further down into her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Stay on her nipple and play with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Fall further down and into her panties.</span></div></div>",

You look down and see the leather thong that just endured this monster's ass. You lean down and inhale Fiona's aromas, making your mouth water for the real thing. Looking upward, you see that Fiona is resting on her bed. The late evening sun is shining through the window, illuminating the pages of her book. She is fully nude. The sweat on her body glistens in the sunlight, and you can make out the details of her flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up her bed carefully to avoid disturbing her. You climb up beneath the blankets to avoid being seen. Once up, you're hit by a wave of heat as you find yourself in an enclosed space with this fat slob. You maneuver yourself into an army crawl, and ahead of you, you can see fiona's sweaty feet. She flexes them briefly, highlighting her disgusting toenails. Between her feet, you can see your ultimate prize. Her mound is covered in rich red hair that contrasts with her green skin. The plump lips ooze with sweat and grime. She bends her knees, lifting up her fat cheeks as she rips another fart, unintentionally dutch-ovening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to contemplate your next action. On one hand, you're dying to approach this goddess and truly experience her, but on the other hand, encounters with fully grown ogres aren't known to go well, let alone as a home invader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

You have to be careful not to alert the princess before its time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPests in the swamp were all but impossible to avoid. Rats, toads, snakes, and all manner of insects were common sights for the former princess of Far Far Away. This is why it wasn't immediately alarming to Fiona when she felt a minute grazing sensation between her thighs, but she didn't need a rat to crawl onto her private area. Fiona lifted up the blanket...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were nearing your goal, light shines from above you as Fionas face twists from one of annoyance to shock to pure malice. You're snatched up from the bed by her clammy hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what in the fuck is a wingless pixie doing between my thighs? Don't you know what ogres do to pixies?\" You were too stunned to speak. \"Alright, you little pervert, lets see how much you REALLY want this ogre's bod.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Fiona let out a monstrous belch directly onto you. The stench was overwhelmingly rancid. In your dazed state, you barely register the feeling of cold glass on your back. When you open your eyes and look up, you can see a large cork with holes punch in it seal up the top of the filthy jar you're now trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will fiona do to you next?</span></div></div>",

This would be no fun without you writhing around like the little worm you are.\" She pries the cork off and reaches a fat, sweaty hand in to grab you. She pulls you to her face, you can make out a faint trail of snail slime oozing out of the corner of her mouth and the excessive amount of hair in this woman's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just cut to the chase. I read in a magazine that fairy dust is a sure-fire way to make your lover absolutely insane over you.\" She's not completely wrong. Fairy dust is technically pheromones that they release to tell others of their kind that they're ready to mate. \"So now that I have a fairy with no wings all to myself...\" You were both dreading and excited for what she says next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe doesn't say anything. Instead, she unceremoniously crams your naked form directly beneath her fat tits. You're covered in a viscous fluid that smells like a gym locker room. You start to get dizzy from lack of air, but you're pulled out with a sickening squelch. You barely have enough time to get another breath in before she gets to work on her next breast. After getting covered in fiona's filth for a second time, she moves you to her flabby armpit. She lifts her arm up and you watch steam rise up from the fetid swamp of her underarms. Once again, you recieve little fanfare as you are plunged into the crevice of this fat, disgusting ogress. This time, Fiona lets go of you and allows you to stew in this hell. The stench is nearly unbearable, even for someone with as sick and twisted desires as yourself. After nearly passing out, she withdraws your tiny form from her folds and repeats the process on her other armpit. When she finally finishes that armpit, she pulls you out yet again and gives you a sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, looks like you're doing your job in there! My stink is even more attractive than usual.\" She sniffs you again. \"But it looks like your fairy dust got washed away, which means you're nearly useless to me. If you can survive this next part, you've earned a place at my bedside from now one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do next?</span></div></div>",
