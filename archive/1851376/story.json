            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world is much as it always has been. Internal combustion engine powered vehicles ride down the streets, planes fly across the sky, skyscrapers tower over cement roads, and people hustle and bustle through the streets trying to get to homes, jobs, or wherever else they may have to be. The only difference, is the populace. Humans have lived side by side with the anthros for as long as they could remember. Average Joes walking down the road right next to upright, bipedal fox men chatting it up with busty Rabbit women. Lions, Tigers, Bears and every other animal imaginable littering the streets across the world, intermingled with humans at every turn. Even dinosaurs, dragons, and other mythical creatures are intermingled in with the other anthros and humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world adjusted slightly for some of them, of course. New clothing lines made specifically for those with tails, some airplanes made to support the 'larger' furs such as the dinosaurs and dragons, who tend to be bigger than the average person, New food chains cater to more specified diets, and a multitude of other miniscule, tiny changes that fill the cities and suburbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday would start as just another day for all of these people, but little do they know that a few of them are about to experience something abnormal, unusual and potentially amazing, or terrifying. Things they never would have dreamed of are about to come forth, and the only question that can be asked is... How will they handle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story starts in a small suburb on the outskirts of a major metropolitan city. Its a quiet little neighborhood. No real crime to speak of, no major natural disasters of late. Just a modest, almost generic looking compilations of homes and those that live in them. But that's where it always starts, doesn't it. An unsuspecting person in an unsuspecting town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Today, that unsuspecting person is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Tyler Matthews: A little 5 foot tall dragon with smooth, scaleless purple flesh that lives at home with his  older brother, David. He owns a small game and hobby shop near the edge of the city, and spends most of his time either there, or at home playing video games or reading. He's always been a bit Jealous of David's size, and his lack thereof, and though they fight a lot, they don't really HATE each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: David Matthews: A big, beefy 7'3\" tower of athletic dragon. He lives at home with his brother, Tyler, and spends most of his time either at College, at football practice, or hanging out with the rest of the football team. He teases Tyler rather frequently about his size, bordering on bullying at times, but never really seems to notice how bad he can be, as to him he always does it jokingly, and Doesn't think Tyler takes it seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: Jessica Hallows: A lean, modestly curved and endowed 5'8\" tall arctic fox, with her hair Dyed bright pink. She's a fireball of forward, aggressive little fox that loves to party and hates not getting her way. She likes to 'toy' with guys, teasing them with playfully mocking insults usually veiled as compliments, or compliments veiled as Insults, rarely ever being actually up front with anyone. She'd never admit it but she secretly has a 'thing' for big guys, and has had a crush on David for a while now. She shares an apartment with Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: Allison Parker: A Towering, curvy, endowed and plump amazonian behemoth of a 8'2 green scaled rex. She towers over everyone else and even if she didn't, would probably beat any other girl in the curves or chest department with ease. Though despite all that shes incredibly shy and self conscious, usually hating to be the center of attention despite Jessica always trying to make her into one, which she can't often escape since she lives with Jessica. </span></div></div>",

His minor success in the business has awarded him a few luxuries and some extra cash flow, something that allows him to exercise a certain amount of control over his older brother.\u00a0 On multiple occasions Tyler has found himself \u2013 rather smugly \u2013 looking down at his older brother when the cobalt drake has come asking for cash to take out one of his latest girlfriends.\u00a0 While being forthcoming and generous with his extra cash Tyler is not shy about asking his older brother to return the favor, a practice which often puts David in the very rare position of doing something humiliating at his brother\u2019s request.\u00a0 In this manner, Tyler takes advantage of his brother\u2019s weakness for wining and dining various gorgeous females, and has renewed the fire of competition between himself and his brother.\u00a0 Because although Tyler is often able to manipulate his brother into doing humiliating things \u2013 such as portraying a comic book or D&amp;D character in front of Tyler\u2019s shop \u2013 David has begun to eagerly and viciously \u201cwage war\u201d to get a little revenge on his younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd thus is the state of David and Tyler\u2019s fraternal relationship.\u00a0 While Tyler exercises a keen wit and the occasional bribe to keep his brother at bay, he often has to endure physical torment at the hands of his stronger older brother.\u00a0 Tyler\u2019s learned to enter and exit the house with stealth, and often keeps his door locked to avoid any extra harassment from his brother.\u00a0 Despite the volatile nature of their relationship, Tyler still has affection for his older brother, and recognizes that David, too, is showing affection in his own way.\u00a0 Tyler\u2019s greatest pastime is to continually search for ways to outsmart his smug older brother, tiring as it may be for him to do so.\u00a0 And when he sleeps, Tyler dreams of being able to best his brother in an outright physical confrontation, rather than being wrestled and teased on a near-daily basis\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If it hadn\u2019t been an unusually busy day at the shop, he might\u2019ve opened it there. But instead, he\u2019d put it aside with his personal mail and ended up taking it home with him. The short walk to his building was uneventful, but as always he felt a bit of dread as he climbed the steps to the house he shared with his brother. There was always a chance that David would be home, and he never knew exactly how that would end, though it usually wasn\u2019t in his favor. David was too much bigger and stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed softly as he stopped on the porch and pulled his shoes off, splaying his bare toes on the porch and wiggling them against the wood. He crept up to the door and listened carefully, but didn\u2019t hear any sounds from inside. He\u2019d learned that the quiet didn\u2019t necessarily mean David wasn\u2019t there\u2026but it did increase the odds that the purple dragon could make it to his room before his brother could catch him. He put his key in the door and turned it quietly, peeking his head inside. He let go of the breath he\u2019d been holding as he glanced around. The coast seemed to be clear, at least for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the door and locked it behind himself, sorting through the mail, feeling a little more relaxed now. He tossed the bills and things aside one by one before reaching the package and giving the label another glance. There was no return address, no name, just the address of his shop. Could it be a gift? Maybe something from his brother? Or an admirer? He slowly peeled the tape off and opened up the box, digging through the packaging until his fingers closed around something hard and firm. He raised an eyebrow as he pulled the object out, his eyes widening as he saw what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about the size of a revolver, but the color was more of a gray metallic than the average gun metal. There was no obvious place to load it, either, but there was a dial on the side. There was only a sliding scale, smaller on one end but rising as the dial moved right. It looked almost like the volume on a radio. He stared at it blankly for a moment. \u201cWhat...is this? Why would someone send me a gun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe toyed with it for a moment, fingers playing over the trigger, adjusting the dial. It made an audible click as he moved it from the center setting, turning it \u2018up.\u2019 He was moving to put the gun back in the box when his finger brushed the trigger, the gun firing with a hum. Tyler let out a gasp of surprise, expecting a bullet. Instead, a ray of red light flashed from the barrel of the gun, hitting the house plant in the hall way dead center. As the dragon watched, the plant began to change, the leaves seeming to shift. It took him a moment to understand what was happening, his mind having trouble processing it at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant was GROWING. Not just growing faster, but growing bigger, the leaves expanding, the stalk thickening...In just moments, it grew from a small shrub about half Tyler\u2019s size to something resembling a small tree, nearly as tall as he was and just as thick. The pot actually cracked from the new, thicker roots, the soil forced upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026does this mean\u2026?\u201d He stared at the gun in disbelief. \u201cIs this some kind of growth ray?\u201d He went back to the box immediately, inspecting it closely for any kind of logo or instructions, but there was nothing he could see. \u201cWell\u2026guess I\u2019ll just have to test it a little\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe toyed with the knob, this time dialing it back the other way, hearing the click at the center and pushing it all way \u2018down.\u2019 He looked around the room and found the perfect target: David\u2019s recliner. It was a big, bulky chair, just like his brother, and Tyler had been the one who wound up paying for it. He smirked, as he imagined his brother laying back in the chair, blissfully unaware that his brother had a shrink ray pointed at him. A smile curled his lips as he took aim and fired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked even better than he expected. A soft Green light fired from the ray, striking the chair and washing over it in a quick wave. Within seconds, the chair began to shrink, growing visibly smaller as Tyler watched, dwindling down, three feet, two feet\u2026finally slowing until it was only an inch or so tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grinned widely, walking over to the chair. \u201cWhat\u2019s that David?\u201d he said to the empty chair. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you all the way down there.\u201d He smirked, hovering his bare paw over the recliner. \u201cOh, man\u2026I could totally crush him at that size!\u201d He pressed his foot down lightly, and even that light pressure caused something to snap in the chair. He laughed, bringing his foot all the way down, crushing it into the floor. \u201cOoops,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cBetter watch out, bro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, but his smile slowly faded into a more serious look. Could he really use the gun on his brother? It\u2019s not as though he wouldn\u2019t be justified in doing it\u2026David was always lording his size over him, how much bigger and stronger he was. He thought about the look on his face as he walked through the door to find Tyler waiting for him, ray in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so lost in thought in fact that he almost didn\u2019t hear his brother\u2019s footsteps approaching, the steps creaking with his weight. Tyler felt a flash of fear run through him. He had only seconds to decide what to do\u2026if David saw the gun and got it away from him, it would be all over for him. He couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what kind of hell he would go through if David were suddenly much, much bigger than him. He was obnoxious enough at just a few feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat to do... what to do...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rather than the beam of red light that shot out before, with the gun set to the shrink setting a bright green ray of light shot out of the end of it, hitting David square in the chest, causing his eyes to widen in surprise. The beam seemed to 'wrap' around his body, engulfing him from head to toe in a glowing emerald colored aura, that seemed to pulsate every fraction of a second. With each 'pulse' his body seemed to push inwards in all directions, body compacting downwards in size, smaller and smaller with each passing moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was stunned, and having trouble even understanding what was going on. The Plant near the door (Why was it so big?!) had suddenly shot a beam of green light at him, and now his whole body was filled with a strange tingling, and he felt somewhat dizzy, like he was in a fast moving elevator.. an elevator going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments his 7'3 height had reduced down to 7 foot... then 6'6... then 6... His head swinging around in shock as he watched everything around him growing larger and larger. The plant, the walls, the couch, everything was raising up higher and higher above him... He was shrinking. He had no idea how it was possible, but somehow he was getting smaller...! The top of the doorframe that his head nearly grazed every time he walked through it was now well out of reach, his height dwindled under the 5 foot mark and the couch that stood near the door, that he usually simply lept over the back of was now too tall for him to do that without having to climb over the back like Tyler did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was scared. He was shrinking and he didn't know why... or worse, didn't know how small he was going to get...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 foot passed. Then three... then two... Everything was becoming absurdly large. Furniture that he usually had to be careful not to smack into and knock over, was now towering over him like small buildings... and his shrinking was only continuing to progress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyes were just as wide, but instead of an expression of fear and confusion, his lips were curled back into a wide, self satisfied grin. Watching the towering 'beast' of a brother rapidly dwindling down smaller and smaller infront of him, until soon even Tyler would tower overhead was more than enough to make him the happiest he had been in years... in more ways than one. He reflexively reached down to adjust the front of his pants, pushing the swelling erection straining the front of his pants downwards, so it had more room to stretch out down one of his pants legs... the sight of ANYONE being so much smaller than him, was an incredible turn on... even moreso to see that it was his brother. (His mind far too distracted with the size difference, to make note that he was being turned on by his brother in any fashion)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the green glow had started to fade... David was barely 6 inches tall. He stood in the middle of the tiled entryway infront of the door, looking around in awe and horror at the sight of how everything that was normally so small to him, was now much, much larger. The back of the couch looked like the side of a cliff to him... the legs of the small table beside the front door, each one was thicker than the biggest treetrunk he had ever seen... The shoes sitting next to the door were the size of small cars, he could probably crawl into one if he tried...! Then he felt the shaking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThump. Thump. Thump. Thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was noticeably starting to shake in a slow, rhythmic pattern, and a dark shadow cast across him... his head turned and saw something massive infront of him, that made his jaw fall open in surprise and terror... his eyes slowly starting to trail upwards, following those massive white clawed, purple toes... up the length of lean purple flesh for his calfs, and along the denim of his jeanshorts (And thankfully too awed by the rest of him to notice the obvious bulge pushing against one of the legs of those jeanshorts) as his eyes traveled farther up to the lanky shirt clad torso of his brother Tyler... his brother who, a few hours ago, would have been lucky to have been eye level with David's upper stomach... was now towering over David like a massive skyscraper, or some monster out of a movie... David's 6 inch form only as tall as Tyler's lower calf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cooooh... Lookey here...\u201d David heard Tyler mutter... his normally meek, quiet voice sounding deep and powerful with him a dozen times David's size. Tyler's face screwed up in a massive, self satisfied grin. \u201cSomeone left me a little David doll... Its even got Cute little doll clothes...\u201d he rumbled. That shadow growing dark, as the giant that was David's brother started to bend down, his free arm reaching out for David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first reflex was to yell and try to run away, but from either shock or fear, his legs seemed glued to that spot, only able to widen his eyes in horror as a palm almost as big as his mattress had been to him, pushed against David's front, and telephone pole thick Fingers wrapped around his back, pinning David's arms to his sides, before suddenly lifting him rather dizzily quickly High into the air, to be held infront of Tyler's massive, grinning face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I'm gonna have a lot of fun with my new David action figure...\u201d Tyler rumbled out ominously, lips pulling back to expose his sharp, well kept fangs, as his tongue slid out to lick hungrily over them. Oh yea... he was gonna enjoy this.</span></div></div>",

He cried out, tiny voice cracking in protest, \u201cTyler quit fucking around, I\u2019m not an action figure!\u201d  He squirmed in those steel-strong fingers, but could not even move a millimeter in any direction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler growled softly and squeezed, increasing the pressure of David\u2019s chest and waist.  He smirked at the sound of his tiny brother wheezing, the air forced out of his lungs, \u201cGood, I think I turned off that annoying little voice\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes bulged out as he was squeezed so mercilessly, his vision going black around the edges as he started to lose consciousness from oxygen deprivation.  He gasped for air, squirming weakly and struggling to push those enormous fingers open.  David didn\u2019t have the oxygen to even be frustrated or angry at his brother; all he could feel was fear and desperation.  He croaked weakly, before going limp in his brother\u2019s grip, completely unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked and loosened his grip the instant he saw his brother go unconscious, \u201cSo fragile, my little toy brother\u2026\u201d  He got to his feet and took the limp-bodied male to his room, amazed and amused at how easily he was able to make him pass out.  He lazily tossed the six-inch male the short distance to his bed, smirking at the sight of him limp body flopping about on the sheets.  Tyler stripped down to his boxers and knelt before the bed, resting his chin against the sheets and watching his brother closely for signs of consciousness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groaned and rolled onto his back as his mind finally slipped out of the darkness.  He stared at the ceiling above, sighing, \u201cWhat a horrible dream\u2026.\u201d  As his mind cleared, David frowned, something not feeling quite right.  He curled his fingers and toes against the sheets beneath him, finding they felt much coarser than they should have been, almost as if they were woven with massive threads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d David muttered.  He flinched when a gust of hot air blew over him, immediately sitting up with a start.  That tiny drake\u2019s eyes widened when he saw the massive, purple wall of flesh that was his brother\u2019s snout.  He immediately scrambled backward a few inches, crying out, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chuckled thunderously and leaned forward, his throat rumbling with a purr of pleasure.  His brilliant white teeth flashed, his fangs easily as long as David\u2019s arm.  A low growl emerged from his throat, growing in volume when he saw David quivering with fear, \u201cNo, my little action figure, you\u2019re not dreaming!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snapped out of his fear when his brother rumbled his amusement and called him an \u2018action figure\u2019 once more.  He stepped forward and snarled, \u201cI\u2019m not an action figure, and you know it!  I\u2019m your goddamn older brother and I deserve some respect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rolled his eyes, \u201cOh please, my brother\u2019s huge!  You\u2019re like a teeny tiny version of him.\u201d He smirked and poked the drake square in the chest, sending him flat on his ass, \u201cSee?  I could never hope to knock my brother down with a finger!  You\u2019re just a copy, a cheap imitation.\u201d  He growled playfully, \u201cA worthless toy, really, I don\u2019t even know why I keep you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid got back to his feet and leaped at his brother\u2019s snout, absolutely fed up with the way his brother was treating with him.  Not only had he reduced him to this ridiculous size, but he was doing one worse by pretending it wasn\u2019t truly him!  He hated Tyler\u2019s mindgames, and this was one of the most aggravating versions yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lifted his snout out of reflex, laughing thunderously when the drake\u2019s momentum carried him over the edge of the bed.  David went careening off the edge, his little body slamming against Tyler\u2019s lean pectorals, before falling down, down, down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler giggled with delight, leaning back after his brother landed, \u201cDefinitely not my brother.  He\u2019d never dive in my boxers!\u201d  He snickered.  David\u2019s descent had sent him headfirst along his brother\u2019s smooth belly, until he finally landed\u2026unfortunately for him, Tyler\u2019s loose waistband \u2013 an artifact of his scrawny figure \u2013 had given way, allowing the top half of David\u2019s body to slide right in, his snout buried against that warm cockflesh.  Tyler\u2019s shaft twitched against his brother, especially when he began to squirm.  However, instead of taking advantage of the awkward positioning he lifted his brother by the tail, dangling him at eye level.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like what you see down there, little doll?\u201d  He smirked, giving his brother a wink.  David merely snarled and started flailing, his tiny fists pummeling the drake\u2019s snout.  Tyler merely chuckled, \u201cOooh, action fists!  I like that feature\u2026Maybe I need to investigate what other features you have\u2026That is, the ones that don\u2019t involve you squeaking at me, or diving into my boxers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes widened at this, and he immediately stopped his absolutely pitiful assault on his brother\u2019s snout.  He had no hope of winning; everything he did only amused his brother.  He growled softly at himself, wishing he\u2019d realized it sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler pouted slightly when that amusing barrage of feather-punches ceased, but he knew he could probably get his brother pissed-off enough to do more.  That or he could just keep humiliating him until he broke down and started begging.  He tossed his brother \u2013 shouting obscenities \u2013 onto his bed, happy just to shake him up.  He nodded, \u201cOooh, based on some graphic novel, with all those horrible words!  Interesting\u2026certainly a cute feature, having one\u2019s action figure curse you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid got to his feet, panting and sore from having been tossed about more than once.  He staggered, causing Tyler to burst into giggles, already inspired to observe more, \u201cRealistic reaction to battle damage!  I wonder how long it takes for him to heal\u2026\u201d  He sneered, licking his lips and flashing his teeth, as if suggesting more pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear I am gonna kick your ass when I get back to normal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler knelt down before the bed, shaking David up when his massive knees slammed to the floor, his arms landing on the bed shortly after and making the drake bounce up a few inches, \u201cKick my ass?  What a brave, reckless little action figure.  Nice little attitude you have there, though I don\u2019t think a scale model like you could kick a mouse\u2019s ass.\u201d  He stuck his tongue out at the drake, reaching forward and sweeping his legs out from under him with a finger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed shook beneath David as his brother chuckled at his misfortune.  He had to get back his height!  He remembered that device his brother had used\u2026But how could he hope to get access to it?  He\u2019d have to figure out a way to get away from his brother.  But how\u2026He surely couldn\u2019t run away\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid got his chance.  A loud knocking at the door caused Tyler to flinch.  He rose up, but not before playfully flicking David and sending him sprawling across the bed once more, \"You stay right there, you little toy...I've got company, it seems...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid waited for Tyler to leave the room before taking his chance.  He'd be damned if he just sat there and listened to his brother's demands.  No, he had to take action!  He climbed down from the bed quickly and took off sprinting down the hallway.  He had to get to the sizeray while his brother was distracted.  It should be simple enough...He just had to use the time he was given by whomever was taking Tyler's 'playtime' away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David ran toward the living room he looked up and caught a glimpse of who was at the door, eyes widening when he saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey there little guy\u201d David heard a deep, but obviously feminine voice murmur out. The voice was heavily familiar, but from the deep tone that the size difference made it sound like he had trouble placing it until he got around the hallway corner and could see past Tyler to the visitor's identity. Jennifer... No, Jessica. That's who it was. He remembered talking to her a few times, and always having trouble figuring out if she was making fun of him or flirting with him. He always did think she looked somewhat cute, especially with that unique mix of her plush, snow white fur, and the contrasting bright pink color of her hair, but her personality kept him unable to keep track of whether she was being nice to him or making fun of him. Suppose it could have been worse... He didn't even want to think what would've happened if Fang had come over and found him in such a predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, David started to make his way across the floor, trying to run as fast as he could through the 'open space' between the hallway and the couch, silently pleading that Tyler and Jessica wouldn't notice him. All the while the two were idly chatting it up at the door. Jessica asking if David was around and Tyler trying to make up some excuse of why David wasn't around. If the situation were a bit less 'desperate' David might be laughing at what were obvious attempts for Tyler to try to get Jessica to come in anyway. He'd seen Tyler checking Jessica out once or twice when David had drug Tyler to one of his football games, though he never knew Tyler had any actual interest in her other than a passing glance. More still, it was somewhat surprising that he had gotten the balls to ask her to come in when, at least as far as he told it, David wasn't around. He could only guess that his 'toying' with David in his current predicament had given him a much needed boost of confidence. Not that it made David approve of the situation anymore, he was still going to kick Tyler's ass when he was back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I meant to just come over and see if David was around...\u201d Jessica would murmur, though the coy tone in her voice portrayed that she wasn't exactly saying no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe might come back around later, I'm not quite sure where he went off to, but if you want, you could just hang around till he shows back up.\u201d Tyler offered with a bit more hope evident In his voice than he probably should have let slip. That seemed to do the trick, and with an affectionate pat on Tyler's head, she stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren't you just the adorable little gentlemen...\u201d She cooed coyly as she gave an overly exaggerated swish of her hips when she walked in, even going as far as to let them teasingly bump against Tyler's side, who immediately began blushing heavily in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while David had been desperately struggling to climb up the side of the couch, using both his hand and foot claws to dig into the fabric of the couch covering to drag himself up along it. With a final grunt he hefted himself over the top of the couch's front and landed, sprawled out on his belly, atop the far left cushion, chest heaving and fingers sore from the effort. He didn't have much time, he could hear the two sets of 'thumps' from Tyler and Jessica's footsteps as they approached the couch. He glanced across the piece of furniture where he saw that large device Tyler had used on him, magnified several times larger than it had been previously thanks to his reduced size. In a final, desperate attempt at salvation he took off running across the couch, a bit unbalanced from the way the cushioned 'ground' sank beneath each of his feet every time he took a step, trying to make it to the device before he was spotted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck or fate, whichever was deciding the outcome, seemed unwilling to cut David a break today as he heard Jessica's loud voice rumble out overhead... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David had hardly any time to dive to the side, wedging his tiny body between the couch cushion and the back cushion, managing to squeeze into the crack and hide.  He\u2019d been lucky that \u2013 at his size \u2013 he\u2019d been hidden by the couch\u2019s armrest from the towering foxgirl.  He\u2019d barely escaped her gaze, however, but was lucky that she was more focused on the shiny, futuristic-looking device than the brief flash of blue that was his tiny form diving for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s booming voice was muffled by the thick cushion, but David could still clearly hear both giants as they spoke to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey be careful with that, that\u2019s a very delicate device!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hefted the device, cradling it carefully in her fingers.  She smirked at Tyler and playfully waved the raygun-like device around in the air, as if she were threatening to break it, \u201cOhh, IS it?  I couldn\u2019t tell\u2026Looks pretty sturdy to me!\u201d  She playfully released it from her fingers, causing Tyler to cry out in surprise.  She deftly caught it in her other hand, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh, you\u2019re awfully skittish about this!  It must be important\u2026\u201d  She teased, slowly running her fingers along its sleek design.  She gazed at its construction, noting the dial on the side and wondering what it was used for.  The purpose of the gun, entirely, was a mystery to her.  She had a suspicion, at first, that it was some silly toy.  However, now that Tyler had reacted so obviously, she knew it had to be something quite valuable!  She needed to get the information out of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler whimpered when Jessica aimed the device at him, \u201cH-hey watch where you point that thing!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?  And why should I?\u201d  She gazed at the sizeray carefully, before focusing her aim at Tyler\u2019s chest, \u201cI\u2019ve shot handguns before, shorty.  This is no handgun, so it ain\u2019t a lethal weapon.\u201d  She growled playfully, \u201cUnless you tell me otherwise?  Either way\u2026if you lie, you aren\u2019t going to like the consequences.\u201d  She narrowed her eyes at him, daring him to try and slip something past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler whimpered softly as Jessy kept the sizeray trained on him, wishing he\u2019d hidden it before answering the door.  He gulped and nodded, \u201cOkay\u2026erm\u2026This is gonna be hard for you to believe, you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smirked and rolled her eyes, \u201cAre you trying to warn me?  You\u2019d better be telling me the truth, whatever it is!  Or I\u2019ll fire this at something\u2026maybe even you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head quickly,\u201dN-no you shouldn\u2019t fire it at me!  That wouldn\u2019t\u2026W-well I certainly wouldn\u2019t like the outcome!  Why don\u2019t you fire it at an object, to test it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy seemed to consider this for a moment, casually relaxing her grip on the sizeray and glancing around the room.  She then growled and swiftly raised it back into position, \u201cOh no, if you won\u2019t like, then I definitely will.  And it sounds like it won\u2019t kill you, maybe it won\u2019t even hurt you\u2026Then what could it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed hard against the lump in his throat, hardly able to speak.  He stammered and struggled to make his tongue move the way he wanted it to,\u201dI-I-I-It uh\u2026It...shrinks things\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink-haired fox stared at Tyler for a few moments, before bursting into laughter.  She rolled her eyes and let the hand holding the sizeray fall to her hip.  She snickered all the while, unable to help herself.  What a joke!  She smirked and shook her head, \u201cSheesh, you really thought I\u2019d believe that?  It must not be that big of a deal after all, if you\u2019d tell me such a blatant lie.\u201d  She held the sizeray up, \u201cMust be a really fancy water gun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and aimed the sizeray at Tyler, simply squeezing the trigger, \u201cHehe, splash!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler cried out, much too late, when she squeezed the trigger, his body enveloped in a green flash of light.  It permeated his entire form, and within seconds he already.  He felt dizzy, even nauseous, as that energy surged through him, reducing his entire structure within seconds down to hardly anything at all.  While David had shrunken down to 6 inches, Tyler\u2019s size was a bit smaller, his overall smaller body mass making him so susceptible that he went right down to 4 inches, which \u2013 in the scheme of things \u2013 meant he was smaller to David than he\u2019d been before, proportionally speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stared with surprise and confusion at the dwindling drake before her, absolutely floored \u2013 for a few moments, at least \u2013 that the sizeray had done what he said.  However, this didn\u2019t last long.  She burst out into thunderous laughter, kneeling down and mockingly crooning at the screaming little drake, \u201cAwww look at you!\u201d  She snickered, \u201cLike a little dolly, huh?  Hehe, my goodness, if David got a look at you now I think he\u2019d never stop laughing!\u201d  She growled playfully and snatched Tyler up, \u201cI should keep you until he comes back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler whimpered and struggled in those massive fingers, the vixen\u2019s booming words hardly making sense to him.  He cried out when she made that last suggestion, \u201cNo!  You don\u2019t understand, I shrank David with the device!  He\u2019s tiny, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy\u2019s eyes widened at this, the vixen not sure how to handle such an idea.  Her crush shrunken to the size of a doll?  Ooh, she\u2019d at LEAST have to see him!  And after all, she could always reverse the process; she\u2019d already figured out that the dial indicated the magnitude of sizechange.  With arrows in either direction indicating that growth and shrinkage were possible, she was confident she could make David as big or small as she wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, and where is your fellow brother-in-miniature, little guy?\u201d She cooed sweetly, her furry-soft fingers squeezing him a bit gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had been watching the exchange from his hiding place between the cushions, his little head poking out after realizing that Jessy was too busy teasing Tyler to notice his tiny form on the couch.  When she shrank Tyler down David could not help but feel a spike of brotherly protection.  He scrambled out from under his cushion and stood on the very edge of the couch.  He shouted at the towering vixen, quite aggravated already from having to deal with his brother\u2019s antics while he was small.  He sure as heck didn\u2019t need to play \u201chide and seek\u201d before being found by Jessy.  No, he\u2019d approach the situation head on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessy, you overgrown bitch what did you do to my little brother!?  If you wanted to come see me you should\u2019ve left him out of it!\u201d  He shouted to her in his tiny voice, stamping a tiny footpaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica turned \u2013 with a bit of a shock on her face \u2013 to see the little male standing on the couch.  She stared at him for only a moment before bursting into giggles.  She immediately leaned down and snatching David up in her other hand, discarding the sizeray for the moment.  She lifted both brothers to her eye level, smirking, \u201cHehe, what a cute little family reunion\u2026and David\u2026\u201d She snorted, \u201cThe only bitch I see here is you, with all the whining you\u2019re doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let out a soft snarl at this comment, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to say anything more, if only because he didn\u2019t want to provoke any more biting comments from the huge vixen, or hostility.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler cried out, still shivering violently in Jessy\u2019s palm with fear.  He\u2019d not had time to adjust to his new size, and likely would take longer than David, \u201cWhat are you gonna do with us!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gave the two males a devious grin, licking her lips before speaking, \u201cWell obviously\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Winner gets turned back to normal!\u201d She exclaimed happily, leaving the two tiny dragons trapped in her grip staring up at her in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA contest?!\u201d Tyler yelped out worriedly... He couldn't think of many contests other than video games he could have beaten David at normally... and at current proportions, he could tell he was even smaller to David than he normally was. \u201cBut... but.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell do you mean a contest?!\u201d David interrupted, snarling out loudly and, to Jessica, adorably. The sound eliciting a new wave of giggles from the looming girl as she listened to David 'yell' up at her. \u201cGod damn it Jessica enough of this you turn us both back right this instant! If anyone's gonna kick screw with Tyler over this it's gonna be me, I'm the one he shrink first!\u201d He yelled out, His words making Tyler that much more nervous about a 'contest' between the two of him after David's declaration for vengeance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Now little guy... you're supposed to suck up to the Judge, not Yell at them... you wanna be on my good side...\u201d Jessica rumbled out rather ominously, grinning widely and showing off her teeth to David, who seemed to immediately loose his luster and shrink back into the fingers holding him. (Metaphorically of course) \u201cI think I know just the contest for you two\u201d She cooed, as she stood up. The paw holding Tyler suddenly jerked to one side, and he felt his back shoved up against David's as they were both transferred to one paw, held somewhat akwardly, and rather tightly, back to back in one of the Fox's fists, while the other reached down to grab the size ray. With a playful giggle, she winked coyly down at them and then gave a swish of her hips as she made her way back towards their bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bathroom, she knelt down, struggling a bit to use her elbow to pull on the shower stall door, then dumped the two little dragons out into the bottom of the shower stall. The 'curb' of the shower stall, normally meant to keep water from pouring out into the bathroom, would act at least as some level of barrier to hamper the two trying to escape, as she walked over to start digging around underneath their sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What do you think your doing!\u201d David yelled out, leaning against the 2 inch tall 'curb' that separated the shower stall from the rest of the bathroom. \u201cget out of there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coooooh!\u201d Jessica giggled out, raising up a large bottle of clear liquid with a purple stripe on the side \u201cWell aren't you two naughty, just leaving your Lube laying under the kitchen sink \u201cShe growled playfully. Both the dragons started blushing intensely as they saw the mostly full bottle of liquid held up as if in 'victory' over Jessica's head, before she lowered back down onto her hands and knees and started crawling back towards them. It didn't help that crawling in such a position let her chest hang down freely, and with the revealing V neckline of her shirt, showed off an ample amount of her, while normally modestly sized, to them massive cleavage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ... Just grow us back already!\u201d Tyler squeaked out to the looming fox as her head leaned in to hover above the two toy sized dragons, Tyler doing his best to avert his gaze from the blatantly exposed cleavage hovering almost right in front of them. To be honest he was kind of worried as to what exactly kind of 'challenge' she was going to have them both do... especially with that particular bottle of slick liquid. After all, Jessica was kind of a Wild card, it was hard to predict what she was going to do... and the situation even without that was rather unpredictable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're going to have...\u201d She giggled softly, dragging out her explanation as if trying to further unease her two 'captives'. \u201ca.... Weightlifting contest!\u201d she finished suddenly, leaving the two dragons blinking up at her momentarily in disbelief. David immediately let a wide, smug grin spread over his lips, while Tyler's earfins wilted and his tail curled around one of his legs. Even if they were both the same size there's no way Tyler could have out lifted his brother... and currently, he was even smaller compared to David than he usually was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but...\u201d Tyler started to protest, but was quickly cut off by the looming fox as, THUMP, the massive bottle of lubricant was dropped down between them, standing roughly 5 inches tall, Smaller than David, but taller than Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever can lift this up the easiest will be the winner.\u201d She giggled softly, licking almost as if in anticipation over her lips as she stared down at the two little dragons...It seemed a simple enough challenge, but with Jessica, who knew what twist was hidden just around the corner...</span></div></div>",

Part of her wanted David to win so she'd have a shot at wooing the handsome blue dragon, but now she couldn't help but feel a little bad about stacking the odds so heavily against his little brother. He was kinda cute in that nerdy sort of way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she knew just how to make things fair and square. She fiddled with the odd little ray in her hands, twisting the knob that seemed to be related to size and giving it a once-over. That... seemed right? This thing was so unusual that it was hard to tell how to operate it. Only one way to tell, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stumbled back from the 'curb' of the shower stall, almost falling over as he looked up into the barrel of the gun that had already caused him so much trouble. He didn't even get a chance to cry out before that familiar light washed over him, changing his size yet again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWait what?!\u201d David yelped out in surprise. Any further protest was cut off by a nauseating sense of vertigo overtaking both of the dragons when Jessica abruptly stood back up to her full height. While short to David normally she now towered over him well over 10 times his current diminutive size, and poor Tyler was even smaller in comparison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just kidnap us like this!\u201d Tyler protested, having gained a bit of his voice back as he struggled to adjust to his new viewpoint, and to the vertigo of suddenly rising so fast and so high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why not? You gonna stop me?\u201d She teased, grinning toothily down at her two captives. Still giggling softly at the whole situation, Jessica suddenly shoved both of the little dragons against each other, grinding them front to front as she pushed them both into one hand. With her other hand now free she bent back down to pick up the size ray, which she quickly stuffed into the back of her pants. Unfortunately for her captives, rather than take them both in separate hands once again she left them both tightly pressed together in her left hand. With a fresh bounce in her step, devious thoughts fluttering through her mind, and a playful grin on her muzzle the fox trotted her way to the front door and left the two dragon\u2019s now vacant house with her new toys in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back to her house was thankfully uneventful and not very long. She only lived a couple of blocks away, so cutting through a couple of backyards had her home in a matter of minutes. The fox\u2019s roommate didn\u2019t seem to be home this evening, which meant at least for the time being Jessica had the house all to herself. Just to be on the safe side she quickly made her way into her room where she closed and locked the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was comfortable in her perceived safety she finally turned her attention back to the two dragons in her hands. That devious grin grew that much wider as she once more transferred Tyler into her other hand and raised both of them to eye level with her grinning muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then boys, how about we play a game?...\u201d she cooed softly, giggling under her breath. The two dragons gulped nervously, glancing at one another then back up to their captor. \u201cSo much fun I could have with my own personal little dragon toys. Maybe I could have a tea party with you, or play Dress up, or play Godzilla\u2026\u201d She would giggle under her breath, each idea seeming to unnerve the two dragons more than the last. Finally after another few moments of deliberation she came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she used the tip of one of her shoe clad paws to press to the back of her other shoe, and used it to slip her foot out of it. That shoe found itself carelessly kicked across the room, before her now sock clad foot did the same to the other, leaving both of her footwear left carelessly thrown near her desk. Her bed creaked ever so slightly as she sat down on the edge of it. She bent forward, and gently placed the two dragons down onto the carpeted floor, between her two sock clad paws. They didn\u2019t have a chance to run however, before a sudden impact knocked them both to the ground. David and Tyler both let out soft groans of surprise and discomfort as they found themselves pinned face down onto the carpet, as one of Jessica\u2019s broad sock clad feet shoved down on top of them. Another giggle seemed to rumble from the sky as Jessica enjoyed the amusing prospect of so easily manhandling and controlling people as such, especially one like David who was commonly known for being one of the strongest guys around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeehee\u2026 sorry little guys, looks like even one of my feet has you two beat\u201d Jessica would tease, licking softly over her lips. The prospect of so easily controlling them was defiantly appealing to her in more ways than one. She had always been one of the shorter people and her fiery personality had manifested to make up in personality and force of will what her body lacked in physical strength. But now that she could control someone with a single limb so effortlessly\u2026 she was starting to like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two dragons trapped beneath her paw, she raised the opposite leg to cross it over her knee. Carefully she leaned forward, grasping the hem of her sock to peel it off and toss it across the room much the same way her shoes had been discarded. The two dragons were released from their imprisonment for a brief moment, only to have one of the now bared paws of the massive fox shove down on them instead, so that Jessica could then remove her other sock as well. Only once she had fully undressed herself from the ankle down did she finally release the two and allow them to groggily push themselves to their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately David turned to glare up at her, yelling in his squeaky, high pitched voice about how she couldn\u2019t treat people like this, how they weren\u2019t toys for her amusement and how this was akin to kidnapping. Of course the sound of his ranting in such a squeaky, high pitched tone only served to make her giggle once again at the hilarity of it. David\u2019s rant started to die off when he saw the fox slowly pushing herself back up into a standing position, broad footpaws planted to either side of him and Tyler as the, to them, massive fox loomed intimidatingly overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you guys a 5 second headstart\u2026\u201d Jessica murmured, licking almost hungrily over her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid simply stood there, staring wide eyed for the first couple of seconds, before a swift kick to his shin from Tyler snapped him out of it. the two doll sized dragons turned and started running as fast as they could across the sprawling landscape of Jessica\u2019s bedroom, desperately trying to get away from their giant tormentor. Of course, at such a small size their headway was laughable at best to Jessica, watching them scramble at a dead run to go as far as she could cover with just a couple of steps. She made a point to let her voice rumble out above the two as she slowly counted down from 5, and when she hit zero she raised one of her legs, and SLAMMED her foot down as hard as she could on the floor in taking a step towards them. the impact while to a normal person would probably not even be felt, was like a small earthquake to the two dragons, sending Tyler stumbling and having to be caught by David.  The second step she took, while softer, still caused the ground to rumble to the two Dragons, and by the time Tyler and David had recovered the third step had brought her paw almost directly behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFe Fi Fo Fum\u201d She giggled teasingly, as she raised a paw over the two dragons. A dark shadow cast across both of them as they stared wide eyed up at the massive pawpads lining the underside of her white furred foot. As she started to lower it down David shoved Tyler to the side and leapt in the opposite direction, leaving the paw to THUMP down right between them, where the two had been standing only moments ago.  \u201cAww\u2026 I missed\u201d She murmured, clearly enjoying herself despite her \u2018failure\u2019.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t help but continue giggling nearly nonstop, as each impact of her feet on the ground knocked one of the two dragons onto their ass or on their sides. She was careful to be a bit slow, enough to give them a fighting chance, and she did do a fairly good job of stomping in their paths of escape. She wanted to keep them crowded in the middle of the room so they couldn\u2019t dive under her bed or a table to hide from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMeanwhile the two dragons were running themselves ragged, trying to run from the giant fox who seemed intent on stepping on them. At least that\u2019s how it appeared at first. After the first few misses it became apparent that she was just toying with them, but neither Tyler nor David was willing to call her bluff and instead kept doing their best to dodge those massive feet. Each impact sent them stumbling even when it was the other one that was the target of that particular stomp. Each word she spoke rumbled from the sky and simply further taunted them with how she was so amused by tormenting them as such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat none of them realized is that the more wild she got with her movements, the more dangerous all of their situations was becoming. As she continued to twist and turn on her heels, legs turning and slamming down onto the floor, the back of her pants shifted back and forth with each movement. The tight denim was pulling against the size ray still held in her back pocket, rubbing against the setting dial, and causing it to wiggle upwards. Each stomp caused it to wiggle a bit higher, come a bit looser in its \u2018holster\u2019 of her pocket. The dragons were far too preoccupied with trying to keep themselves \u2018alive\u2019 to notice such a thing, and Jessica was having far too much fun to notice such a thing. At least, not until she felt it slip out of her pocket. That defiantly got her attention, when she felt it slip free from her pocket and hit the floor with a soft Thump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll three of them stopped mid movement and turned to look at the size ray on the floor, hearing a soft, familiar hum rapidly building up within it. all three of their eyes went wide as a flash of green light exploded from the end of the size ray as it went off, engulfing one of them in that glowing green light!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The green aura from before rapidly engulfed her entire body in much the same way she had watched it do to Tyler. The two dragons watched with rapt attention as they watched their \u2018giant\u2019 kidnapper begin to rapidly diminish in size before them. In only a few seconds she was under the five foot mark, 5 seconds after that she was less than half that size. Less than a minute had passed before David\u2019s 6 inch tall form was eye level with her chest\u2026 and yet she continued shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe fox\u2019s worry increased exponentially the smaller she got, especially when she turned to the side and saw that she was now looking UP at the shrunken David! Five inches dwindled down to four\u2026 then to three\u2026 even Tyler was starting to look huge to her. The poor fox dwindled yet smaller still, until that glowing green energy finally dissipated when she was barely a single inch tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNervously the now bug sized fox glanced up at the two dragons standing to either side of her, letting out a high pitched, audible gulp of nervousness. The top of her ears, were they not flat against her head, would just barely be level with Tyler\u2019s knees, and she probably couldn\u2019t even reach David\u2019s knee if she stood on her tip toes and stretched her arms as high as they could go. A nervous smile spread across her lips, as she raised an arm up and waved timidly at the two tiny \u2018giants\u2019 now towering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201ceheheh\u2026 hi guys?\u201d She muttered nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTyler and David glanced at each other, then back down at her as they pondered what to do now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The expression on the massive purple drake's face was terrifying, unlike anything he'd ever seen; Tyler looked pleased to see him tiny and frightened, eager to see him squirm and wriggle in those mighty fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older dragon gulped and shivered as Tyler's hot breath washed over him, his massive, sinuous tongue and great, sharp fangs causing the pit of fear in his belly to swell. He whimpered and shook his head, trying to plead with the titanic, terrifying version of his brother, \"T-tyler, p-please, it's me, David! C-c'mon, I'm your brother, you can't just do this to m-\" He yelped, flinching and shutting his mouth as Tyler's massive, strong fingers suddenly squeezed him, grunting as the air left his little lungs, leaving him with nothing to retaliate with as Tyler spoke, the thunderous, powerful sound overwhelming his puny ears with its intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I really can, David...\" He giggled deeply, his voice booming thunderously as he thundered to his brother, smirking as he held the once powerful male in his fist, \"After all, who do you think did this to you, huh?\" Tyler thundered deeply with laughter as his brother's jaw dropped wordlessly at his revelation, his tight, unyielding grip preventing his choking sibling from replying as he continued, \"I'm so glad I've finally got something to take you down...and to think, I was prepared to put up with your shit for the rest of my life!\"  The massive, lean dragon let up a bit with his strong, thick fingers, finally allowing David to breath as he grinned smugly, watching the muscled little dragon gasp for air in his fingers, \"I finally get you right where I want you...and believe me, David, I have all sorts of things I wanna do with my little big brother...\" He laughed deeply, his titanic form lurching into motion as he moved down the hallway, his paws shaking the floorboards as he walked rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid yelped as Tyler began stomping along, clinging tightly to his brother's thick fingers, the ones he'd be struggling to escape just moments before. The tiny blue dragon shook his head as he whined, his body shaking with every massive footfall, \"B-but I-I'm your brother! You can't just leave me like this!\" David's pleas were greeted by deep, bone-rattling laughter from Tyler as his little brother moved inside his own room, kicking the door shut behind him as he chuckled, raising the little dragon up to his snout as he boomed, \"Oh, but I want to leave you like this! Think of how much fun you'll be when you're not constantly pushing me around!\" He added, snarling a bit as he lowered his brother to his bed, letting the tiny blue dragon roll onto his blankets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid yelped as he was tossed to the soft sheets, groaning as he shakily got to his feet, his head spinning from the roll as he righted his tiny body. The puny dragon's jaw dropped as he gazed up at his towering, monstrous brother, his stomach plummeting as he watched the dragon toss his shirt to the earth, exposing his unchiseled, vaguely lean upper body. Tyler grinned toothily down as his brother, able to see the tiny dragon's terrified expression, \"Aw, what's the matter, David? You could see I was excited about all this!\" The purple drake giggled, letting his jeanshorts and boxers fall to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's heart nearly stopped at the sight of that massive, pulsing cock, the head pointed straight at his puny form. The girthy, purple member was longer than he was tall at eight inches, and he could see every powerful throb from his position beneath his monstrous brother. The gaping, eager slit was already dribbling a small amount of hot, sticky pre, and the younger male's musk filled the room. The purple drake's massive sack and testicles, each the size of a golf ball, hung and swayed above him, heat radiating from that mighty package. David could only whimper at the magnificent sight, the thought of his own brother being sexually aroused or attracted to him sending a new wave of terror through his veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puny blue drake whimpered and stumbled backwards as Tyler stomped heavily forward, a massive quake shaking the bed as his huge, pulsing cock and hefty sack swayed above, the purple, skinny dragon looming playfully as he boomed, \"There we are...hehe, seems I'm bigger in more ways than one, now...\" He laughed thunderously, licking his lips as he gazed down at his puny brother, his huge, sinuous tongue slurping loudly as he rumbled, \"Now, let's start having some real fun David...get out of those clothes, before I rip them off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid whimpered as he lay on the bed, Tyler's shadow engulfing him as he stared up in horror. He didn't want to go through with pleasuring his titanic brother, but he couldn't tell what Tyler might do if he refused; he could be crushed to a pulp if Tyler so much as twitched the wrong way!

High up on the massive plateau that marked the edge of Tyler\u2019s bed, although there was technically room for escape by flying off and away there was no guarantee he would be able to find a suitable hiding place fast enough to wait out until he grew back to normal\u2026 IF he grew back that is. Nor did he want to make his towering brother angry.  He had already felt the unnerving amount of power the younger dragon had over him JUST by holding him casually; he stared down at the ground at his removed clothes in frustration at the reminiscion he could not shake away.  What\u2019s worse is he could only imagine what kind of damage the normally feeble Tyler could do should his temper flare up, and how he could find any of this attractive was beyond him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looks up when his thoughts are interrupted from the sound of throat clearing, only to find his huge younger bro\u2019s head resting on the edge of the bed, his sharp eyes and leering smile fully emanating his intent.  David wordlessly shoots the most intimidating glare to illustrate his disapproval of the situation.  Too bad at his harmless stature this wouldn\u2019t be doing much but create a rumbling chuckle from the violet reptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting something, \u201cbig\u201d brother?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh!?  My clothes are removed!  What the hell do you want now!?\u201d David replied full of anger and scorn, causing Tyler to grin mockingly.  Now in reality David long knew what the obvious answer was and when the focus point of Tyler\u2019s eyes alter every second from his own to between his legs.  In rage the elder sibling stomps his foot into the comforter\u2019s cushiony surface before putting his hands at his waist and hurling down his underwear.  \u201cThere, you happy now?\u201d David asks, both embarrassed and disgusted at how he was stark nude.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler reassumes his towering position over David by standing up quickly, not able to resist a giggle at his hard cock bobbing up and down, and flinging a small glob of pre nearly on top of the micro\u2019s head.  Tyler rubs his shaft lustfully and murrs at the sensation of feeling so powerful for once in his life.  \u201cYes, very much.  See?  That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?  I\u2019m going to enjoy having you like this so much, David.  You know\u2026 this\u2019ll be a great way for us to get to know each other.  And what better way than having my toy give me some much needed relief?  But\u2026 how should we do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miniaturized dragon looks on in dull silence at his brother turn his back on him as if he were in a manner of deep thought.  Perhaps if he weren\u2019t so infuriated and humiliated at the way he had been literally and figuratively belittled he might have chosen this moment to may a break for it as a head-start.  Instead, out of his nature of taking the role of \u201clarge and in charge\u201d, he defiantly yells up, \u201cI\u2019m not jacking you off if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking!  You\u2019re sick if you are finding pleasure from all this, you know!  You\u2019re a fag for doing this to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry.  I\u2019ll think of something better than that real soon.\u201d Tyler muttered after turning his head just enough to get a look at David in the corner of his eye.  \u201cIn fact\u2026 maybe I should take a seat and mull it over\u2026\u201d  Quick as his last word is uttered, Tyler lets gravity pull his weight down onto the bed, chuckling as it bounces in response to the energy transferred to its springs and right on top of his sibling.  Between his legs he could feel David struggling under his heavy mass much how he did when David forced him to play wrestle.  Having the tables turned a full 180 made things that much sweeter\u2014and made him that much hornier too while David rubbed against his parts.  \u201cOoooh, David that feels so amazing.  I hope the smell\u2019s not too strong for your little nose\u2026\u201d     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown under him, David hadn\u2019t planned on a mammoth taint, balls, and ass cheeks just all out dropping down from the sky.  At only a few inches tall time seemed to slow when all is eclipsed by Tyler\u2019s shadow when his legs and buttocks spread apart, revealing a brief glimpse of his purple tight sphincter the moment before everything goes dark as he is smothered by his once smaller brother\u2019s private region.  Now lying flat on his back, David squirms, scratches, and pushes against the squishy flesh in a panicked frenzy, for his nose is immediately assaulted by the overwhelming musk emanated full force out of Tyler\u2019s moist______ pressing on his face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMmm\u2026 playing hard to get I see\u201d Tyler rumbled out deeply, voice vibrating through the air with the sheer bass and depth of his voice. Well, to any normal person it was somewhat high pitched, but with Tyler literally 10 times David\u2019s size, even his timid and quiet voice sounded like it was being projected through a bass boosting loudspeaker.  The looming purple \u2018giant\u2019 smirked as he watched the small doll sized dragon dashing across the blankets of his bed, occasionally stumbling over wrinkles in the comforter that, to David, had to be like street curbs. It was almost laughable to watch the little dragon trying to escape. At his normal size David could literally run circles around Tyler, but now it was taking him nearly a minute just to get from one side of Tyler\u2019s bed to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNot content with simply playing a passive role, however, Tyler\u2019s footsteps started to vibrate through the bed faintly, further unbalancing the already panicking, frantic blue dragon, as he watched Tyler casually walk around to the other side of the bed. Each footstep caused that throbbing log of an erection to bob and jostle in front of him, occasionally flinging a few tiny droplets of pre across the floor, the bed, and one or two even splattering against David\u2019s arm and tail at one point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow\u2026 enough of that running, Toy, Big bad Tyler\u2019s ready for some fun\u2026\u201d he rumbled ominously, watching David\u2019s eyes go wide in terror as one of Tyler\u2019s huge handpaws started reaching out towards him again. He started to turn and run, but as Tyler reached in for him, his other paw pressed to the edge of the bed for support, which sagged a bit under his weight and caused the \u2018ground\u2019 beneath david to bend inwards and send him tumbling back towards Tyler. Those massive purple fingers wrapped tightly around his action figure sized body\u2026 but rather than raising David up to his face to further taunt him, Tyler decided on something a bit more fun\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDavid was dropped, to him, what felt like several feet, tumbling around in midair and making it difficult to even keep his bearings. When he felt himself land on a hard surface that dipped downwards from his weight, immediately he flailed about till he was laying on his belly and wrapped both his arms and his legs tightly around the surface, clinging to it as if scared that he might fall again.<br>\r\n The squeezing pressure elicited a low groan of pleasure from Tyler, as he felt David land on his cock and then immediately cling tightly too it, Those little arms and legs still holding a suprising amount of strength considering his relative size. He couldn\u2019t help but continue grinning as he watched David slowly start to realize where he was, watching the blue dragons head swing back and forth to get his bearings, nostrils flaring and taking in the powerful masculine scent he now was at the source of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeehee\u2026 Look, \u2018big\u2019 bro\u2026 my dick is bigger than you\u2026\u201d Tyler rumbled tauntingly, as he lowered a paw down to cup the underside of his dick in his fingers, hefting it up a bit to compensate for David\u2019s weight making it hang down at an angle. \u201cMmm\u2026 god damn that\u2019s hot\u2026 your so fucking small\u2026 straddling my dick like a couch\u2026 \u201c Tyler would growl out lustily, his tone mixed with his fingers slowly rubbing back and forth along the pre drenched underside of his dick further signifying just how much he was getting off on this whole situation\u2026 and only further terrifying David. David was entirely at Tyler\u2019s mercy\u2026 smaller than his dick, unable to fight back in any significant way that Tyler couldn\u2019t just easily overpower\u2026 and Tyler was getting off on that power he had over David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t have very long to ponder that, however, as Tyler\u2019s paw shifted position, and soon his palm shoved down against David\u2019s back, pinning the shrunken dragon tightly against the side of his dick. His paw was already covered in his own pre and it only further soaked David in it too, as that fist slowly started to push David forward, roughly grinding his front across Tyler\u2019s erection until his face was pushed against the crown of Tyler\u2019s cockhead, only to start dragging him backwards towards the base. David could only offer a weak, token resistance as he strained and struggled to squirm his arms and legs around, uselessly trying to push Tyler\u2019s palm away, and ultimately only further stimulating the \u2018giant\u2019 purple dragon. Tyler was jacking off, using David as a jerk off toy, and there was nothing he could do about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmmmph\u2026 f-fuck\u2026 not gonna last long at this rate\u2026 rrrg\u2026 keep squirming down there\u201d he growled out somewhere between desperately and demandingly.  He half walked and half stumbled his way over towards his desk, shoving his keyboard out of the way as he stood straight up, dick sticking out infront of him as he continued rubbing his paw up and down its length, dragging David\u2019s diminutive body up and down along his cock as well. That smooth, firm skin, those flailing, squirming limbs, all mixed together with the thoughts and sensations of raw power that he had over David, was driving him wild, and from the powerful throbbing David felt pulsating through Tyler\u2019s dick, he had seconds before Tyler\u2019s lust peaked. But just as David thought Tyler was ready to finish himself off, suddenly the paw holding him in place relaxed its grip, and instead it pulled him away from that pillar of ebony flesh and somewhat roughly dropped him down onto the hard wooden surface of the desk below. Realization dawned on David far, far too late, as he looked up at Tyler and that massive prick hovering overhead. One of Tyler\u2019s paws gripped the edge of the desk to support his hunched over position, while the other continued mercilessly pumping that massive erection of his\u2026 with it aimed right at David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh\u2026! Im\u2026 im gonna\u2026 gonna\u2026!\u201d Tyler groaned out in bliss, before a loud moan of lust escaped him and cut off his sentence, his cockhead flared and David had less than a second to let out a yelp and try to turn away, before his vision simply went white. His body was smacked backwards over and over again, as spurt after spurt of thick, heavily musky draconic cum splashed and splattered across him like small bursts from a firehose. Coating him from head to toe in the gooey, runny white liquid as Tyler emptied himself onto David. It took nearly half of a minute for Tyler\u2019s orgasm to ebb and the barrage of cumshots to dwindle to a faint trickle, leaving David and most of the surrounding part of the desk soaked in Tyler\u2019s cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looming purple \u2018giant\u2019 panted heavily as he struggled to get his breath back, eyes slid half closed and a blissful grin spread out over his lips. That had been the best orgasm he\u2019d ever had. The physical stimulation of David writhing against his dick with the mental component of him having his way with a helpless former \u2018giant\u2019, it was like a fantasy come true. When he seemed to have recovered enough to reorganize his thoughts, he smirked down at the cum-soaked dragon that lay before him and gave a playful wink down to him \u201cmmm\u2026 that was great\u2026. We definitely need to do that again\u2026\u201d he rumbled out ominously, before reaching dwon to carefully grab David by the base of his tail, as if trying to get as little of his own seed on his fingers as he could, and then carried David over to his bookshelf. David found himself suddenly dropped into the current unoccupied terrarium that had once housed his pet Iguana, and watched as Tyler then put the wire mesh roof back over it, trapping David inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, small fry\u2026 you stay in there like a good little pet while the big man of the house goes to get cleaned up, then we can find some more fun to have\u2026\u201d Tyler rumbled with a devious glint in his eyes, as he turned to make his way out of his bedroom and to the bathroom to wash up\u2026 and plot his next move. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With David safely secured away in the terrarium and no one else in the house Tyler didn't bother putting his clothes back on, he was the big man of the house now and he could do whatever he wanted. He smugly struts his way out of his room and down the hall, his mind still swimming with the possibilities of what he could do with his freshly shrunken brother. He makes his way to the bathroom and clicks the door shut behind him before turning on the shower so the water can warm up.<br>\r\nWhile he waits he takes a look at himself in the mirror, a wide satisfied grin covers his face. Within moments the water is warm and he steps inside to begin washing himself off. The water flows over his smooth purple skin, causing it to glisten in the light, he lathers himself up and begins cleaning off the leftover seed stuck to his body from his 'playtime' with his brother, all the while he was wondering to himself where to go from here. If he were to restore his brothers size David would surely try to get the size ray for himself and get revenge, it would be safest to keep him small for as long as possible.<br>\r\nHe chuckled to himself as he imagined the various things he could do, play with his brother again like he did a moment ago, keep him as a pet, shrink him to the size of an ant and pretend to be a massive stomping Godzilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've got it!\u201d Tyler said to himself as he steps out of the shower and begins towelling himself off, drying his body before wrapping the towel around his waist, 'I may be bigger than David now, but I'd still shorter than most people.... but that's about to change.' the thought as he began making his way downstairs to where he left the size ray. Once he got a hold of it he started making his way back to his room, altering the settings as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back inside his room he smirked as he saw the tiny David jumping and flailing around desperately to try and get out of the terrarium. Tyler stepped closer, his face all but filling the glass for the little occupant, \u201cHey Davey. You know how  you've always made fun of me for being a short shrimpy guy? Well I've got another little surprise for you. Just watch.\u201d He said, taking a few steps back and pointing the size ray at himself, a little nervous about what to expect having never used it on himself before, but he couldn't pass this opportunity up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls the trigger and a bright red ray blasts out from the gun, enveloping him in a pulsing aura similar to what happened to David. Tyler could feel the slight pulsing feeling rushing through his body, each pulse pushing his body upwards and outwards, making him steadily grow bigger.<br>\r\nTyler could hardly believe his eyes as the room around his seemed to become smaller and smaller, his once short 5'1 height was already creeping up to 5'8 and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched in horror as his 'little' brother was shooting up in size, already massive compared to him and growing more so right before his eyes.<br>\r\nTylers body was staying the same, not overly muscled, rather slim which didn't make him look so strong, but his ever increasing size made him appear more intimidating with every added inch.<br>\r\nThe towel he was wearing was growing along with him, much like David's clothes shrank along with him, giving him at least some decency, though he would be taunting his tiny brother again before long, if David was smaller than Tyler's dick before, he would be positively minuscule next to it before long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon continued pushing upwards, now easily 7ft tall, everything around his was looking comically undersized to him now, the feeling of increased size and power was starting to get him hard again, that towel starting to tent at the front as his cock pushes against it. He walks over to his body length mirror to get a good look at himself, able to see himself growing, soon he would not only reach his brothers original size but surpass it, he wanted his brother and everyone else to know that he wasn't some weakling who would be pushed around any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later he surpassed his brothers former 7'3 height and started to walk back over to the terrarium, \u201cwell well well David, looks like I'm more of a man now that you ever were\u201d he said with a wicked laugh, still growing strong for his shrunken brother to see, 8ft...8'5....9ft.... the process finally slowing to a half once he neared the utterly massive height of 10ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I may have to borrow some of your clothes for a while David. Though even those will be a bit tight for me now\u201d said Tyler as he examined his room, marvelling at how small everything was now, this would take some getting used to that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow... What's a giant dragon to do eh?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looks pretty slick, I gotta hand it to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler growled softly at that tease, squeezing the sizeray\u2019s grip a bit more firmly.

The muscular, towering drake stepped forward and loomed over his little brother, a soft growl in his throat, \u201cYou wanna try saying that again, with a little more respect, bro?\u201d  He laughed and took a swipe at Tyler\u2019s hands, his claws grazing the sizeray as David\u2019s meaty palm purposefully fell short of smacking the ray out of Tyler\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake yelped when he nearly lost his grip on the sizeray.  He quickly took a step back and \u2013 without aiming at all \u2013 took his shot at his brother, snarling, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be sorry that you\u2019ve fucked with me today, David!\u201d  He grinned toothily, sending a brilliant red beam of light toward his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let out a cry of surprise when he saw that bright red flash, stumbling backward as\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tyler couldn't keep himself  from giving a wide, self satisfied grin as he watched that beam turn into a glowing red aura around David.. though his grin slowly turned into a frown, then an exclamation of surprise and horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than watching david starting to shrink dowards closer and closer to the floor, Tyler watched ast that red aura seemed to be 'pulling' David outwards in all directions. His large sneakr clad footpaws spread out wider and wider across the floor, his head raised up closer and closer to the ceiling... the glowing red energy that was forcing him to expand larger seemed to be growing his clothing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW... what the hell?!\u201d David yelped out in suprise. His voice getting noticably deeper with each passing second. His formerly rather large 7'3\u201d form stretched up to 7'4... then 7'6... 7'8... 8...! within a fe wmore moments his head smacked against the 8 and a half foot tall ceiling, horns tearing small gouges into it before he reflexively leaned down to keep his head from shoving against the ceiling. Though, within seconds after that, his shoulders were shoving against the ceiling as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler leapt out from behind the plant, watching his brother stretch higher and higher. Small cracks starting to form along the ceiling from where his shoulders were shoving against it. Desperately, Tyler started fumbling with the dial on the side of the gun, all the while staring up at his ever growing brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler? What the hell is going on, what is that thing?!\u201dDavid yelled out in confusion, his voice still growing deeper as he passed the 9 foot mark... then 10! Finally, with a dull THUD that seemed to vibrate through the whole house, the pressure on the ceiling lessened, as he flopped down onto his ass in front of the front door, though even then he still cotninued to grow. His legs stretching out farther and farther across the floor towards Tyler, as his back slid up the wall behind him. 11 foot... 12...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ch-hang on I can fix this!\u201d Tyler yelled out, raising up the gun again to aim at his still growing brother.</span></div></div>",

He saw David pressing up against the ceiling even while sitting down and knew he had to get out the house, and fast. The small purple dragon turned and ran towards the door, he dashed out of the house and over to the other side of the street where he cupped his hands over his face, \u201cOh god what have I done?\u201d he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely a couple of minutes later when loud cracking and crunching sounds echoed through the street, followed by a loud crash.

Much more space for me to stretch out\u201d he said thunderously, and in an instant those people who had stopped to look started to run away screaming in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked around, searching for his little brother, eventually spotting him still standing across the street, \u201cI guess I should thank you Tyler.

The first shot of the ray seemed to have worn off, so his growth wasn\u2019t as fast as it had been a minute ago but he was still visibly inching higher and higher with each passing second. Tyler could only stare up in awe and worry (Not to mention poorly hidden envy) at the sight of his massive and still growing brother. He had intended to make David the short one for once, and now instead he had turned him into the biggest guy on the planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry little bro. I\u2019m gonna put this new size to good use!\u201d David rumbled deeply, a toothy grin spreading across his muzzle. The ground began to rumble with slow, rhythmic vibrations as the now nearly 50 foot dragon began stomping his way down the street. The size ray was (Thankfully for David) growing his clothes with him so he wasn\u2019t suddenly in his birthday suit, and something about that seemed to only further amuse him. He would stop a couple of times as his sneaker clad foot would slam down into the street, visibly cracking the pavement beneath his weight, as he stopped to compare the size of his still growing shoe to a car parked on the street. Seeing massive footwear that was rapidly threatening to rival pickup trucks in size was almost as intimidating by itself as the entire concept of the massive and growing dragon. Though David was easily one of the nicer of the \u2018big guys\u2019 at the college they went too, the alpha male in him still was reveling in the raw, ego boosting power rush of being so massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what better way to make use of that power rush, than to show it off too his other alpha male friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pace quickened noticeably as he continued on his way down the street, heading for the park where he had come from only moments earlier. With a bit of luck the guys would still be hanging around, and he could introduce the new him\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang, Marcus and some of the other jocks were still messing around at the park, casually throwing a football back and forth or shoving and wrestling with each other as they usually did. None of them seemed to notice the faint vibrations beginning to rumble through the ground, too absorbed in their own rough housing to notice until a lengthy dark shadow was cast across them and the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was the first to notice, the leanly built Kangaroo noticing the shadow, just as a thunderous CRACK of a tree trunk snapping in half snapped the other\u2019s heads in that direction as well. For behind them, David now stood in all of his 75 foot tall glory towering over them, with one of his sneakers having stepped down on top of a knee high oak tree and snapping it clean in half. While no longer growing anymore, simply the fact that he was bigger than a 7 story building was enough to intimidate and terrify just about everyone present, much to the massive blue dragon\u2019s amusement. The only one who didn\u2019t seem intimidated, or at least didn\u2019t show it, was of course Fang, the formerly biggest of their group. A 7\u201910\u201d behemothian wall of muscle and wolf that could easily overpower anyone else on the team before, now even he was toy sized to the enlarged David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeehee, hey guys!\u201d David\u2019s voice rumbled, vibrating through the air and making the others wince, unused to the new volume and bass of his voice. \u201cLooks like I hit my growth spurt!\u201d The ground shook violently, hard enough that a few of them fell over onto their asses, as one of David\u2019s knees smashed down into the ground when he knelt down in front of them. Even kneeling he towered over any of the surrounding trees, not to mention their comparatively tiny bodies. \u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d David asked, letting his grin grow wider. Fang was the first to speak up, though surprising to David instead of awe, worry or amazement, it was irritation that filled his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell did you get so big?!\u201d Fang growled up at the giant dragon, glaring upwards. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare say something stupid like eating your veggies! Tell us how you did it, don\u2019t hog the size all to yourself!\u201d He demanded. The others seemed to snap out of their own little trances as they followed Fang\u2019s words. Whether it be them agreeing with Fang that David should share, simply their \u2018follower\u2019 mindset forcing them to go along with Fang who had for so long been their \u2018alpha\u2019 and leader, or their own simple minded power greed overpowering any sense of amazement or fear, all of them immediately began yelling up as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea! Tell us how you did it!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCmon David share the wealth!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe want to be big too!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMake me taller! I\u2019m always the short guy!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t hog it all to yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid winced a bit at the sudden onslaught of demands from his friends. He had expected them maybe to be scared, or amazed at seeing him big enough to pick them all up like dolls. He even expected Fang to be pissed that now he wasn\u2019t the biggest anymore. But Fang turning them all against him to make them big too was something he hadn\u2019t expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on David\u201d Fang growled up at the blue giant. Either fang was so overconfident and cocky that even in the face of someone almost 10 times his size that he was unphased, or he was an expert actor hiding his fear as he stared David down no differently than he would have when David challenged him before his sudden growth spurt. \u201cHow\u2019d you get so big? You aren\u2019t going to leave us all hanging\u2026 Are you?\u201d he rumbled, his last question laced with the slightest undertone of threat, speaking in the same passive aggressive way Fang always did when he wanted something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This should fix things\u201d Tyler spoke, looking up from the guns controls only to see his brothers head once again touching the ceiling even while he was sitting down, he had to be at least 17ft tall now and was still steadily growing larger before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid on the other hand was enjoying his ever increasing size, when he heard Tyler's voice he realised that he didn't want to go back to his normal size, in fact the bigger he was the better he felt, he couldn't let his younger brother take this away from him, \u201cNot so fast 'little' brother. You made me this big so you're just going to have to put up with my new size.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that David began to reach forward so he could snatch the gun away from the smaller purple drake, though it wasn't easy for him to move now in the small confines of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen David reached forward it caused Tyler to panic, he pulled the gun's trigger and a green light shot out of it, striking the giant dragon's growing body, causing him to yell out a frustrated \u201cNO!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly David's growth stopped and he began to shrink instead, within just a few seconds his 17ft of height became 15ft, then 13, then 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me that gun!\u201d yelled David, as he carefully moved over towards his brother. Tyler backed up against the wall before being pinned against it by his brother, \u201cI said give me that thing!\u201d he yelled once more and grasped Tylers arm, trying to wrestle the gun away.<br>\r\nBy now he had returned to his original height of 7'3\u201d but was still shrinking even smaller. <br>\r\nDavid was shocked and paused for a moment to look at his body as it continued to shrink, seeing his younger and smaller brother slowly growing in front of him, \u201cW...What the hell have you done?\u201d he said as he grabbed Tyler's arm once again and tried to desperately get the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally David would have no problem overpowering his brother, but Tyler was so determined not to let David grow back up again that he was able to keep hold. They both tugged the gun back and forth, each dragon trying with all their might to keep the size change device... Then David yelped as his vision went a pale green colour again. Through their wrestling one on them had accidentally pulled the trigger, and the barrel was pointed at David at the time, giving him a second dose of shrinking energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking sped up, a moment ago David was looking at Tyler eye to eye, now he was about level with the purple dragons chest and shrinking smaller by the second. All Tyler had to do now was hold the gun up in the air and push his brother away his foot, causing the shrinking drake to stumble and fall back onto his rump.<br>\r\nTyler could only watch and laugh at the sight, \u201cWho's the 'big' brother now eh?\u201d he said smirking over as David dwindled down past the 2ft mark. He stepped closer so he could loom over now small blue dragon who was shuffling back, to get away from the towering Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gulped up, shocked at this turn of events, though he pointed assertively up to Tyler and shouted, \u201cJust how small and I going to get?! You better fucking grow me back to normal now or else!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply smirked down again and stomped his huge foot near the now 1ft and still shrinking dragon, \u201cOr else what?

Though the defiant threat only made Tyler grin wider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think you'll be kicking anyones ass anytime soon, David\u201d Tyler's voice rumbled. Though nornmally his voice was light and fairly high pitched, with the size difference between the two now it rumbled down like thunder from the heavens. David was still shrinking, and his size was getting almost rediculous. His extra shoes beside the door were taller than he was, the doorknob of the front door looked to be over a dozen stories above him... and Tyler. Tyler was just gigantic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the shrinking stopped, David couldn\u2019t have been more than an inch tall. Literally bug sized. And though to any other person in the world Tyler was a shrimpy little runt. A little midget of a dragon David could pick up with one arm without breaking a sweat. But now, Tyler was a giant. His toes were as tall as David was, his foot was bigger than an SUV from David's perspective... and the rest of him was big enough to shame most skyscrapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod damn you're tiny David... \u201c His voice rumbled deeply. The ground shook slightly for David as Tyler stepped forward, footpaw slamming down on the other side of the diminutive blue dragon and knocking him back onto his ass. A dark shadow cast over him as the behemoth that was his little brother crouched down over him, hands on his knees and lowered his head down to get a better look at him. \u201cHell. I had only meant to shave a couple feet off, give you a taste of my size for a while\u201d he rumbled softly, more speaking aloud his thoughts than talking to David \u201cThough this could be just as fun...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slowly pushed himself up to his feet, eyes wide with fright as he stared up at the giant that was his brother. All of his bravado was gone, replaced with fear of the enormity of his brother. Tyler could step on him like a bug without any effort at all. Tyler could swallow him whole without a second thought. Any number of things seemed possible now, and none of them good for David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-change me back, damn it!\u201d He yelled up at Tyler, his voice trying to still sound confident and demanding, though his words were studdered from fear, and his barely audible, high pitched voice didn't do anything to help Tyler take him seriously at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha\u201d Tyler's voice boomed out, louder than he intended and loud enough to leave David's ears ringing, as he covered his earfins with his paws. \u201cOops. Sorry, 'big' brother. Guess I'm not used to you being so puny that my voice can hurt you\u201d he teased, clearly enjoying the whole situation. \u201cThough I think we should explore this a bit before I change you back... why squander an opportunity to experience a bug's life\u201d he murmured rather ominously, causing David's eyes to widen a bit as Tyler began to stand back up. \u201cIll give you a 5 second headstart...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid started to yell up at Tyler, somewhere between demanding and pleading for Tyler to stop screwing around and to fix this. It wasn't until Tyler had counted aloud to 3, and started raising up one of his huge sneaker covered feet that David finally got the message, and turned to run. He ran as fast as he could off to the side, which was pretty damn fast normally, being a football player and all. But at an inch tall the progress he made was almost laughable. The carpet fibers were like thick grass to David, coming up nearly to his knees as he ran through them, and occasionally he'd trip and stumble, only to shove himself back up to his feet as he desperately made his way deeper into the living room to try to get away from his brother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive...\u201d Tyler rumbled out as his foot slammed down onto the carpet. He was far enough away that the impact was felt, but didn't unbalance David, though it certainly urged him to try and run faster. His head swung back and forth as he tried to think of a plan, though was constantly interrupted as he looked back behind him to see Tyler casually strolling forward at a leisurely, taunting pace. Each footstep causing the thick white sneaker to slam down into the carpet and send a tremor in his direction. David was at a full dead run, and Tyler's casual stroll simply from the sheer width of his stride was easily catching up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had seconds before those footsteps overtook him, and from the look in Tyler's eyes, he wasn't sure whether Tyler would really step on him or not, and was too scared to find out. So he went for the only place he saw that he might help him get away, the couch! It was a low hanging couch, with only a couple of inches of clearance between the floor and the bottom of it. More than enough for the diminutive David to get in, but far too big for Tyler to get in. and David knew from experience the couch was too heavy for Tyler to move, as he used to have to move it for Tyler.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFee Fi fo Fum. I smell the blood of a bug sized brother\u201d Tyler would taunt, clearly getting far too into the situation, as he 'chased' after David. Each footstep coming closer... shaking the floor more for the tiny blue dragon... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was at the home stretch. And Tyler realized where he was going. An annoyed growl filled the air, and the next footstep hit the ground harder, as Tyler increased his pace. David lept forward, trying to dive for the goal, to 'safety' beneath the couch...!</span></div></div>",

He stepped forward swiftly and snatched the sizeray out of Tyler\u2019s hands before the smaller drake could even react.  He smirked and lifted the sizeray up to inspect it, a playful growl in his throat, \u201cSo you try to shoot me with some kind of raygun?  What, were you trying to kill me!?  That blast looked pretty gnarly, certainly more dangerous than some simple toy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply stared forward, his eyes locked on something out in the front yard.  David glared down at his younger brother, absolutely stunned and angry with his brother for what he thought was an attempt to inflict bodily harm.  His own younger brother!  David was impatient with Tyler, and didn\u2019t wait long before shoving his brother roughly and demanding, \u201cWell!?  What the fuck do you have to say for yourself, you irresponsible little bastard!?  This is completely unlike you!\u201d  He snarled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler refused to respond, his eyes wide as he stared at something outside.  David felt the ground tremble beneath his feet, but didn\u2019t seem to pay it any mind.  He held the sizeray up for Tyler to see, \u201cWhat does this thing do!?\u201d  He shouted angrily, \u201cWere you trying to hurt me, or worse!?  I thought I could trust you; you\u2019re my brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook again, more violently this time.  David yelped and stumbled in place, glancing around with confusion.  Tyler raised an arm and pointed out of the door, his mouth agape.  He seemed to be struggling to form words, but he could only let out a weak whine of fear.  David\u2019s gaze finally turned to follow his brother\u2019s.  Outside he could see that the view to the street was blocked by one massive wall of fur.  A wall of fur!?  David\u2019s eyes widened at the sight, and without understanding what he was seeing, he stepped forward, murmuring softly, \u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunderous, booming chuckle caused David to cry out with surprise.  Damn that was loud!  But where did it come from\u2026His heart started to pound as he crept forward, before freezing on the spot when he heard a deep voice resonate through the entire house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t yell at your little brother for what he did, David\u2026I\u2019m a little surprised myself, but I think this is quite the development.  Why don\u2019t you two come out here and show me how you did this?\u201d  The voice asked with an obvious tone of amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stammered softly when David turned to him once more.  The purple drake crept forward, gulping nervously, \u201cI\u2026I found a size-changing ray\u2026W-who is that outside, David!?  Who did I turn into a giant!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed weakly and peered out the front door, gesturing for Tyler to follow him, \u201cWell, after practice I wanted to hang out with\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both drakes felt a sense of dizziness overcome them as they gaze upward into those big, eager eyes, and David especially was disturbed at how playful Marcus appeared to be.  He figured that Marcus was easily 100 feet in height, though he couldn\u2019t be sure.  He hoped that he was wrong, and even more he hoped that it was some kind of disturbing dream he was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s the view from down there, pipsqueaks?\u201d  Marcus boomed at both of them, a deep chuckle following that playful question.  He shifted his weight and crouched down to get a better look at the tiny drake between his feet, a movement that caused both of them to stumble as the ground trembled beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus\u2019 eyes lit up at this, and with a grunt he lifted his footpaw and slammed it to the ground, compacting the earth beneath by nearly a foot and sending both Tyler and David flat on their asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, looks like I don\u2019t even know my own strength!\u201d  Marcus boomed giddily, clearly amused that he could knock over his former \u201csuperior\u201d in strength with a mere footfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid got to his feet first and shouted up at Marcus, \u201cGo easy, you\u2019re gonna crack the foundation on my house if you keep that up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, I didn\u2019t mean to almost break your little DOLL-house, David.\u201d  He snickered.  The roo\u2019s tail thumped heavily against the ground behind him, the tip sweeping sideways and smashing through a house.  This caused Marcus to flinch in surprise, before bursting out into thunderous, joyful laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I definitely didn\u2019t mean to break that one!  That was kinda fun though\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Tyler both watched in growing terror as Marcus looked over his shoulder to watch his own tail smash through the house in the other direction.  They could already hear screams from inside both houses, the sound sending shivers up their spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus you have to stop messing around, someone\u2019s gonna get hurt!\u201d  Tyler shouted, his voice quivering as he tried to remind the kangaroo that he was destroying people\u2019s homes.  He immediately whimpered when the kangaroo turned back to give him a toothy grin, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a little fun, Tyler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood closer to his little brother and put an arm around him, trying to stand firm as he shouted up to Marcus, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re really understanding the problem here, Marcus!  I-I mean\u2026this new size is amazing, but you\u2019re ruining people\u2019s lives in the process of having your fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus chuckled softly and shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think you quite understand what\u2019s happened to me, David.  But I\u2019m willing to show you.  Now why don\u2019t you be a good little friend and grab that device you used to grow me, just in case I wanna get bigger.\u201d  He smirked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid hesitated for a moment, before that massive kangaroo slammed his palm down on the ground in front of them, \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait, David!  I don\u2019t WANT to destroy your house\u2026\u201d  He sneered, \u201c\u2026but I certainly would find pleasure in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled softly under his breath before turning back to his house and running inside, plucking the sizeray up from the floor and bringing it outside.  He lifted his palm from the ground and held it out expectantly, \u201cNow, give it to me so I can be sure that I am the one in control of my size\u2026I don\u2019t quite trust you with my new stature, you see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobalt drake\u2019s heart pounded as he stared at that huge, furry palm.  Out of the corner of his eye he could see Tyler\u2019s eyes widening as fear took over.  David stepped forward and \u2013 with great reluctance \u2013 dropped the sizeray onto Marcus\u2019 palm.  He was rewarded with a smirk and a snort of amusement, \u201cGood.  Keep listening like that and maybe I\u2019ll let you hold onto it for me\u2026maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gulped nervously and nodded, unable to say anything for a moment.  He was terrified and infuriated at the same time.  How DARE Marcus do this to him and his brother\u2026or anyone else!  He\u2019d become a giant and in a matter of seconds he\u2019d let it go completely to his head.  It was a side of his friend that he\u2019d never even imagined could exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobalt drake finally managed to speak up, \u201cSo Marcus,\u201d he began, unable to hide the impatience in his tone, \u201cwhat exactly are you going to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus grinned toothily and without warning snatched both dragons up in his fingers, causing Tyler to scream in terror.  David wasn\u2019t much better off, though he managed to contain his fear at being suddenly caught in the impossibly strong grip of Marcus\u2019 fingers.  Both drakes struggled to breathe for those few moments when Marcus seemed to forget how fragile they were.  After standing to his full height and lifting them up to his chest level Marcus arranged both drakes so they were in his palm, instead of being crushed in his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you two are gonna come watch as I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ground shook and rumbled with each step he took, car alarms began going off well before his paws actually landed near them, and more than a few of the neighbors immediately ran into doorways, believing it to be some kind of an earthquake rather than something as absurd as a giant football player. \u201cI'd say Fee Fi fo Fum, but I have a feeling even the giant from jack and the beanstalk might be a squirt compared to me now!\u201d Marcus rumbled out to the two 'captives' in his left paw, grinning happily down at them and, at least in their opinions, having far, far too much fun with such an absurd situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus suddenly paused mid step, the sudden jerking halt of his swinging arms nearly sending Tyler flying out from between his closed fingers and down to the ground below. \u201cOooh...\u201d They heard the giant Kangaroo rumble out, spying One of the large City Metro buses stopped at one of the bus stops down the street. It was almost comical to see how little people seemed to be reacting to the giant Roo. Psychologists would have a field day talking about how people refused to acknowledge things they considered impossible. It wasn't until Marcus had raised an enormous Kangaroo paw up over the top of the bus that those inside seemed to realize something was wrong... eyes going wide as they looked out the windows to see the giant kangaroo holding his foot over the bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeehee... I always did like crushing soda cans... wonder if this is the same... \u201c His deep, rumbling voice boomed out ominously, giving those inside only a few seconds to flee from the bus before his paw abruptly slammed down, sending a small shockwave across the area, and the sound of screeching and warping metal mixing with the dull THUD of the impact, the bus reduced to little more than a crushed pancake of warped metal and fiberglass beneath Marcus's Enormous sole. \u201cMmm... oooh that feels even better...\u201d He rumbled, licking rather hungrily over his lips in enjoyment. He could feel the glass as it had shattered before the frame began bending inwards, feel the sudden brief drop and the loud BANGS as the tires exploded and the frame crushed downwards into the ground, all in fast forward as the several tons of high powered vehicle, was reduced to rubble just from him stepping on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and David had a different expression on their face, looks of amazement and horror...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Marcus seemed to not have noticed (or, worse, not have cared) Was that there had still been people inside that bus. So when his foot smashed down onto it... now they were nothing more than red stains smeared into the wreckage... Marcus had crushed almost a half dozen people, and didn't even seem to care!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoo man what a rush!\u201d He boomed out loudly, beating one of his fists against his chest as if in 'victory', clearly enjoying his achievement... and what he didn't notice was his fingers slipping open breifly when he did. The two captive dragons watched with wide eyes as if in slow motion, they saw the size ray tumble down from Marcus's fingers, smashing down onto the road below and begin to shake, before a massive beam of red light exploded from it... and smashed right into Marcus's ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa what the...?!\u201d The already giant Kangaroo rumbled out as he felt his body beginning to tingle again, his paw starting to spread out wider and longer, covering more and more of the bus underneath his sole, his head starting to raise higher and higher into the air, and those huge fingers wrapped around Tyler and David began thickening and expanding around them... Marcus, already at a massive 100 foot height, was growing again...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, how big is that thing gonna make him?! David yelled out in worry as he tried to squirm his way free of the growing roo's grip, Tyler simply staring up at Marcus's face so high above in awe and worry... Tyler didn't know much more than David did at this point, he'd only had the gun for minutes before Marcus had taken it away...and could only guess how much of an effect it was going to have on the already enlarged Marcus.</span></div></div>",

Marcus was barely able to hear their screams of discomfort as he enjoyed the sensation of growth spreading through his body.  With a deep chuckle the kangaroo simply crouched down and dumped them unceremoniously upon the grass by his right footpaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you pipsqueaks catch your breath while I finish enjoying my new growth spurt\u2026\u201d  He smirked and rose to his full height, the kangaroo letting out a thunderous groan of pleasure as he continued to surge upward.  It was dumb luck \u2013 and not Marcus\u2019 foresight \u2013 that had the massive, expanding kangaroo take a step forward, away from the discarded drakes.  In their state of breathlessness they would not have been able to escape Marcus\u2019 expanding footpaw, which \u2013 both from his widening paw and his widening stance \u2013 would have quickly crushed them against the earth as it grew toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus\u2019 first step crashed down hundreds of feet away.  His stride had already lengthened considerably, and he was fast approaching his final height of 500 feet.  Screams rose up from the houses and vehicles all around them as David and Tyler watched that huge kangaroo test his growing legs.  Bits of rubble bounced upon the crushed pavement nearby, and both dragons were fast understanding that Marcus was becoming as terrifying as any force of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler got to his feet and cried out, glancing all around, \u201cWe have to find the sizeray!   We have to get him back down to his normal size before he destroys the entire neighborhood!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled and got to his feet, his eyes scanning as quickly as Tyler\u2019s, \u201cForget the neighborhood; at this rate he\u2019s probably gonna only be satisfied with destroying the entire damn city!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth drakes stumbled as Marcus slammed his left footpaw to the ground, his second step larger and heavier than before.  Tyler fell to the pavement and snarled, his hands stinging from having to catch himself against the sharp bits of crushed pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn him!  Where the hell did this sudden zeal for destruction come from, anyway!?\u201d  Tyler snarled, glancing back at David as he picked himself up off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled as he kept desperately scanning the grass and pavement around Marcus\u2019 massive footprint-crater, \u201cAs if I should know!  Just shut up and find the damn sizeray before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCRRRRRRRRUNCH\u2026THOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes rose upward to see the source of that new, terrible grinding sound, just before Marcus\u2019 footpaw slammed down once more.  He fell to his knees just as he saw the newly-grown 500 foot behemoth turn on his heel \u2013 thus grinding the rubble beneath his heel into powder \u2013 and step back in their direction.  He shivered and tried not to watch as Marcus lifted his footpaw high into the air.  His last stride would easily carry him back to where he\u2019d started; right on top of them.  David\u2019s pounding heart and frantic mind hardly gave Marcus the benefit of the doubt; if he took that next step he might accidentally crush them beneath tons of fur and flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as that massive, dark shadow loomed above, both David and Tyler heard that deep, nearly incomprehensible voice boom from overhead.  Marcus\u2019 resonant speech filled their ears, nearly deafening from so close, \u201cWhat are you two up to?  You\u2019re crawling around like ants\u2026\u201d He snickered deeply, \u201cYou must be up to SOMETHING\u2026Are you trying to find the sizeray?  Because I thought I said I didn\u2019t trust either of you with it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Tyler both screamed when that titanic footpaw slammed down in the middle of the decimated street, sending them both sprawling on their bellies.  David rolled over onto his back and shouted up to Marcus before the kangaroo could continue making such dangerous assumptions, \u201cY-yeah we\u2019re trying to find it, but we\u2019re just\u2026securing it for you!  You won\u2019t be able to find it\u2026but just imagine if someone ELSE found it!  You can trust us more than you can trust a stranger, right?  We\u2019ll find it and keep it safe for you!\u201d  David argued urgently, hoping Marcus would believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus smirked and leaned over, his hands on his hips as he gazed past his enormous, swaying genitals at David, deciding that he would...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus had a thoughtful look on, carefully scrutinizing the two dragon brothers. \"Okay, sounds fair to me. Careful though, I'm watching you two. One wrong move and...\" he said as he raised a paw over yet another house and finished his sentence with a heart stopping stomp. Tyler and David remained silently horrified, imagining themselves inside that house. \"Oh man that is never gonna get old. I could really GROW to enjoy this,\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, the kangaroo leaned down and unclenched his paw, shaking it slightly until Tyler and David rolled out onto the fractured street. They were almost knocked down again as they stood up though, as the huge kangaroo's paws created tiny earthquakes from just walking. While David quickly ran off to try finding the gun, Tyler watched the roo as he started having his own \"fun.\" Tyler was dumbstruck as he watched Marcus rampaging around, using his tail and paws like wrecking balls across the whole neighborhood. Nothing stood a chance against someone that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, David pushed away drywall and bricks as he searched. \"Tyler, quick! I found it, over here!\" David yelled, breaking Tyler away from his thoughts. Tyler rushed over to the wreckage of a house, their former neighbors, to see how bad the damage was. David held the gun in his hands, which thankfully was still all in one piece. But there was a large dent in the side, and the dial to switch between grow and shrink had been completely removed. There was no choice for bringing Marcus back down to size now, at least not without more time to find the dial and fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we just need to find the dial and fix the size changing gun that we don't understand before Marcus stomps us into the ground like bug. No problem, right?\" Tyler gulped, realizing how screwed they were. \"Oh god, it's hopeless. We can't shrink him anyway, he'll crush us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snorted in thought. \"You know, I don't think he would do it. Marcus wouldn't hurt his friends on purpose,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just saw him crush that bus, the people in it, and those houses,\" Tyler argued. \"This isn't the same Marcus. Look at him, he's enjoying it! I think he gets off on stomping around with his paws this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid bit his lip and turned to watch Marcus down the street. He sure looked... happy. \"Yeah, but I know him better than you. I've been with him on the team for years. He might be getting his kicks now, but he's not evil,\" David said, though he didn't sound very convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to take that chance David?\" Tyler asked, putting a hand on the gun. \"There's no choice, we need to grow him. We can figure out how to stop him once he leaves us alone, but we can't do that if we're stains on his sole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore David could open his mouth to argue the point, the tremors started getting stronger and stronger, and a gigantic shadow passed over the two tiny dragons again. Marcus smirked down at them as he approached, coming to a stop with one paw covering the whole street, another resting on the roof of a house that creaked under the weight, and his tail draped off in the distance on top of a car. \"Good news guys, remember that Trig teacher we all hated, Mr. Driver? Well I found his car, and... boom!\" the roo said as he showed off a humongous paw. Jammed between two of his massive toes was the front bumper of a red SUV, and a popped tire was flattened against his paw pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a teasing wiggle of his toes, the warped piece of metal fell from the sky and landed with a clang in front of David. \"No more car,\" Marcus chuckled. \"Ohh, you even found the size changing gun. Nice job dude, just what the doctor ordered for a growing boy like me. So go on... grow me!\" the kangaroo said, not even trying to conceal his excitement,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was do or die time. David gulped and looked all the way up at Marcus, then down at the gun in his hands. What if Tyler was right... what if there really was no choice? If Marcus grew again, he might leave them alone long enough to figure out a way out of this mess. But... what if he didn't? What if he just brought them along with him anyway? There had to be a way out of this somehow. Maybe... maybe someone else could grow to Marcus's size! Then he'd have to listen, and that someone could try to talk some reason into him. David closed his eyes and made up his mind, bringing the gun up as he aimed and pulled the trigger. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

David hung his head as the beam connected, softly cursing himself for what he\u2019d done.  The city was in enough danger and had experienced enough torment beneath those massive kangaroo paws\u2026what would happen now?  Tyler shook his head in disbelief, before shoving his brother roughly, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy, that\u2019s enough!  You\u2019ve given him enough of a shot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus smirked at the tiny voice beneath him.  He lifted his massive sole and slammed it back down, shaking both brothers up, \u201cDon\u2019t be so eager to tell your brother he\u2019s wrong, Tyler\u2026The biggest guy in town gave him a suggestion, and he followed it.\u201d  He folded his arms and grinned smugly at the little drakes beneath him, \u201cAnd you boys know to follow my suggestions, right?  Tyler?\u201d  He almost growled the name, the sound of rolling thunder making the name almost impossible to hear properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler merely whimpered and nodded, unable to speak after being so firmly admonished by that towering giant.  David lowered the ray and put an arm around his brother, whispering softly, \u201cI bought us some time\u2026wait until he leaves to have his \u2018fun,\u2019 and we\u2019ll look for the dial, got it?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler couldn\u2019t bring himself to even nod, so gripped by paralyzing fear that he couldn\u2019t acknowledge his brother.  Even the thought of the kangaroo discovering their plan was enough to keep him firmly rooted in place.  He gulped nervously, finally letting out a soft whimper and putting an arm around his larger brother, hugging him close.  David managed a smile, giving his little brother a firm hug, \u201cChin up, he\u2019s not so big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler managed to squeak a reply, \u201cSpeak for yourself\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus, of course, had heard none of this.  Even if their voices had been loud enough to attract the attention of his bus-sized ears, Marcus was too busy enjoying the spreading energy of growth.  At his size, the tingling sensation of growth energy spread slowly through his body, radiating outward from his chest and spreading at a delightfully slow pace through his body.  The titanic \u2018roo \u2013 while eager to grow \u2013 rather enjoyed knowing that even the powerful, physics-bending sizeray had to struggle to modify his body.  It was empowering, even intoxicating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, as that slow, creeping growth energy reached his toes and fingertips, the roo lurched into motion.  David and Tyler both were shaken out of their mutual embrace, the drakes stumbling backward as the roo pushed off with his footpaw to begin his slow, lumbering pace.  The ground trembled at the slightest shifting in weight, and as Marcus\u2019 massive footpaw lifted into the air the pavement beneath his other paw cracked, crumbled and finally was ground into dust that couldn\u2019t be told apart from the soil that once supported it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus grew slowly before their eyes, almost imperceptibly at first, even to every tiny eye that looked skyward to the kangaroo that dominated the skyline.  Marcus took slow, deliberate steps, wanting to feel the growth as he lumbered along.  His stride lengthened, and time seemed to slow for all eyes watching, an effect that would have delighted Marcus if he even acknowledged it existed.  And although the perspective and fear of the tiny anthros beneath would surely amuse him, Marcus was even more focused upon his own perspective.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first step taken.  Marcus\u2019 soft chuckle escaped his throat, the sound closer to rolling thunder for the \u2018insects\u2019 beneath him.  He stumbled slightly, caught off-balance by the unexpected change in stride length.  Marcus let himself stumble, his trailing paw sliding forward against the pavement.  David and Tyler bolted as those massive toes \u2013 easily as wide and tall as a city bus, and slowly growing to make such a comparison obsolete - splayed widely, those heavy toes scouring tons of pavement and soil from the earth and creating vast trenches.  Those tiny drakes fell to the grass, staring up from prone positions as that house-crushing footpaw slid forward a good fifty feet.  At the end of its journey they could see the roo\u2019s toes suddenly curl, digging savagely into the fragile crust of pavement and soil.  And then, it all started again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Tyler could only stare in horror as that trailing footpaw lifted, the ball of his foot crushing deeper into the pavement as the heel lifted, that heavy calf muscle flexing with enough force to drive the kangaroo\u2019s toes another ten feet deeper into the soil, compacting it so firmly that the soil was nearly hard as rock.  CRUNCH.  At the very moment before that paw lifted, David and Tyler both could hear something deep beneath the soil crack.  Bedrock, Marcus\u2019 toes had split the bedrock deep beneath the soil.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ground trembling beneath their rumps, David and Tyler looked at each other, both realizing that something had to be done.  Tyler spoke up, \u201cLook at him, he\u2019s already gained, like, fifty feet!  And we don\u2019t know how big he\u2019s gonna get, without the dial on the sizeray!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled and shoved his brother, \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that!?\u201d  He nearly roared, tensions heightened by the sensation of the roo\u2019s every motion making the earth tremble.  He got onto all fours and started crawling through the grass, \u201cLook, just shut up and save your talk for later, we have to find that dial and reverse this before he gets too big to shrink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded quickly and began the search, though the outlook seemed as grim as the growing shadow from their massive friend.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHaha, this is fuckin\u2019 amazing!\u201d  Marcus boomed at no one in particular, feeling perfectly alright with talking to himself as he walked along.  Just the sensation of putting on a few feet of height every second was enough, at first, to give him pleasure.  But as the swelling titan approached the city he found that the novelty of simply walking at that deliberately slow pace was not enough.  His lengthening stride had been a brief curiosity at best; now he was more interested in his growing strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a single thought as to who might be beneath him, Marcus increased his pace, turning a slow lumber into a steady, stomping pace.  What had been a rather inconvenient, but constant trembling due to Marcus\u2019 smooth, rolling steps now became a sharp, jarring quake every few seconds.  Vehicles within the immediate area bounced on their shocks with each step and the pedestrians \u2013 those poor sole-fearing souls \u2013 fled the titan\u2019s paws in all directions.  The quick-witted, the observant and the clairvoyant made their escapes easily, either ducking into alleys or side roads, or taking refuge in the subway tunnels beneath.  The rest, well, the rest were forced into a life-or-death game of chance, a game they had no control over.  Where the footpaw landed was something they no hope of bending.  And so they mindlessly ran, praying they would not be crushed to paste beneath that massive sole.  But even the \u201clucky\u201d didn\u2019t escape entirely, as the great dust clouds the kangaroo kicked up hid the foot-paw shaped craters from their eyes.  Many of them ran headlong into them, where the occasional rift into the subways beneath would swallow them up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe as the smartest of anthros thought they were, it would not last long.  Because, as Marcus grew, so did the pressure he put upon the earth beneath him.  Each step carried an exponentially growing amount of tonnage with it.  The shockwaves the propagated with each step grew in radius, and it would not be long before the entire city was feeling those jarring footpaws, and then no structure would be safe, neither above nor beneath the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Marcus, he was rather enjoying the increase in pace.  As he rose above 650 feet he could observe a rather curious phenomenon, that \u2013 if he kept his eyes on the street below him \u2013 he could see smaller buildings collapsing in an ever-increasing ring, centered on his leading paw.  With a playful, window-rattling growl he focused on this.  Those powerful kangaroo legs \u2013 known for strength even at his normal size \u2013 slammed mercilessly to the ground beneath him.  Great clouds of dust billowed, and behind him he left craters of increasing size.  Even the places where he didn\u2019t step weren\u2019t spared; these spots were littered with rubble and soil that was kicked up by the roo\u2019s massive toes whenever he lifted his trailing footpaw.  Needless to say that man had never before engineered a force so sinister in its destruction.  Atom bombs wiped out entire cities in an instant, yes, but those footpaws did more than collateral damage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus could, in fact, hear some of that damage.  Psychological damage, that is.  Beneath the sound of crumbling shops and screeching tires he could hear the screams.  Oh what a confounding sound!  So soft, yet so high-pitched that it grated upon the ears.  And yet \u2013 because Marcus relished every effect he had upon the city \u2013 he could not help but want to cause the sound to grow.  His odd fascination with destruction of property and anthro psyche grew along with his titanic frame.  Soon even simple stomping wasn\u2019t enough.  He focused on the chaos of the screams beneath him, experimenting with ways to make it grow.  He giggled deeply as he did this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he would try lurching forward, hovering a massive footpaw over the crowd, wiggling his great toes to taunt them as he let soil, rubble and the bodies of crushed furs rain down upon them.  Oh the trauma of such a sight.  But Marcus knew he could do better!  He kept up his stomping pace, stooping down mid-stride to rip the corner of a building off in his hand.  Again the screams rose, but it wasn\u2019t until he hurled it ahead of the crowd that the chaos really started.  Bits of raining rubble separated from the main hunk of building, crushing bits of the crowd in the process.  And then the rest smashed to the ground ahead, sending the crowd into a frenzy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, where will you go now?  Climb over the rubble\u2026or\u2026\u201d  Marcus brought his paws together and let his center of gravity shift.  His massive tail lifted into the air as he bent at the waist, legs straight.  All time seemed to slow to a crawl for every tiny watching, as that 750 foot tall kangaroo\u2019s rump descended from high above.  Before, he\u2019d been diligent \u2013 oddly enough \u2013 about sticking to the main boulevard of the city, one of the few streets wide enough for his form to fit through.  At least, at the ankles.  High above his thick, muscular thighs and rump widened enough to threaten any building tall enough to go past his knees.  Those buildings he particularly enjoyed.  Each one would get a particular treatment, whether it was with a rough hip-check from his massive rear, or \u2013 much more cruelly \u2013 a savage slam from his tail after he\u2019d already carefully crept by.  But now that fun was over.  The kangaroo roared with laughter as he sat, his rump and thighs obliterating the front face of every building along a 200 foot strip.  Rubble rained from above as that glorious ass smashed through the solidest of constructs, until finally it slammed to the earth below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery building within a half mile swayed on cracked foundations, and the crowd ahead of Marcus became crazed.  With a playful pout on his face the towering roo leaned forward, \u201cAww, you\u2019d rather climb rubble than play with me?\u201d  He questioned, his thundering voice hardly comprehensible to the anthros before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus smirked and spread his legs, happily sweeping them against the pavement and slamming buildings on either side of his body.  Before him a great patch of bare earth opened up, nearly scoured to the bedrock.  His powerful, hardened calves had swept every bit of pavement, rubble and earth away, and the only material that remained was spillage from the crumbling buildings he\u2019d demolished in seconds with his legs.  He giggled softly, wiggling his toes and flexing his ankles, pushing those deadly digits as far as they could stretch in order to crush smaller buildings beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, that\u2019s lovely\u2026now...\u201d Marcus growled deeply and glared at the mass of tinies attempting to flee him.  He dragged his massive rump forward, closing the distance between him and the crowd.  More than any building in the immediate area, the kangaroo\u2019s throbbing pillar between his legs was the most prominent landmark, aside from the \u2018roo himself.  The air was thick with his musk, and after even those few minutes\u2019 worth of play, he\u2019d grown aroused, almost intoxicated with his power.  He used a hand to push his meat to the earth, groaning as he ground his thick cockhead against the bare earth, \u201c\u2026I want some toys to play with\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus grinned toothily and \u2013 showing remarkable flexibility \u2013 leaned forward and slammed his fingers down into the crowd, his digits perpendicular to the earth.  This sent the crowd running toward his throbbing meat.  Slowly he dragged his fingers back, forcing the crowd where he wanted them to go.  All the while he taunted them in that incomprehensible, god-like voice, \u201cYou little insects are gonna love this\u2026Or at least, you should, if it makes me happy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus chuckled his amusement at his, even his \u201cgentle\u201d laughter causing the earth to tremble.  He\u2019d get his pleasure, one way or another.  All he had to do was take it, and take it he would\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two struggled to search across the ground, looking near the wreckage of their home and then following the trail of increasingly massive paw prints Marcus had left in the street, trying to find the missing piece of the size ray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was still struggling to wrap his head around how things had come to this. He hadn't even decided what to do with the device when he got it, when that fat-headed jock had gotten enlarged and taken over for himself.  If anything Tyler should be the one to be towering over everything in the city, stomping on cars and buildings and making people run in fear. It was his gun, and he was the one that had always been small! Why did Marcus get to be the one to be a giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, I found it!\u201d David yelled out, interrupting Tyler from his thoughts as he looked over to see his brother holding up a slightly cracked dial dug out from near one of the paw shaped craters. Tyler quickly hefted the size ray up and ran over to his brother, holding it up so David could carefully try to push it back into place. He swore he heard something cracking, Silently pleading it was just his imagination, as with a final forceful SHOVE the dial slipped back into place and seemed to catch and turn whatever mechanism inside would change the setting properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, lets do this!\u201d David exclaimed, turning back towards the massive and, to their horror, still growing kangaroo, who had surpassed the 800 foot tall mark and was still continuing to visibly expand. His ass was swelling outward sin all directions, shoving into and smashing through the sides of nearby buildings as it and his hips forced their way outwards, demanding more room. His massive, muscular back raised higher and higher into the air, an ever growing cliff face of roo muscle as it grew with the rest of him. Even the dull, low moans of lust escaping the kangaroo were deepening and growing in intensity and volume from his increasing height, as he forced himself on the crowd of people... (at least, the ones that were surviving.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhile the two brothers had been desperately trying to repair the device that caused all this, the Roo had been continuing to play with the trapped crowd of people between his legs. His massive fur covered shaft flopped down heavily infront of them, making buses look like toothpicks in comparison. Thick, massive globs of pre leaking out and forming a growing puddle of the thick, musky liquid where his cock head dug into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCmon little runts... get to work pleasing your new master, or I might have to get a bit more... 'proactive' \u201che would rumble out thunderously, ominously. Marcus couldn't help but grin widely when he saw some of the people, whether desperate out of fear or drunk off that intense musk, turn and slowly walk over to start grinding themselves against Marcus\u2019s enormous, and still expanding prick. His moans thundered across the entire city as he basked in their desperate attempts to pleasure him, and gave the others a few moments of 'peace' as he enjoyed the attention, before he decided it was time to put the slackers to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmmm... now for you little shits...\u201d he rumbled lustily, leaning forward (unintentionally crushing a few of the willing as his dick slid across the ground and buried them) as he reached a huge handpaw out and grabbed a handful of those miniscule, terrified people. His other paw slid down and hefted up his mighty ball sac, then dumped the handful of people down in the two visible craters where they had been laying... simply chuckling sadistically as he murmured \u201cSquirm for me, runts...\u201d before he simply let his nuts drop, smashing down on top of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cgood god... look at him\u201d David groaned out when the two got to the top of a hill closer to where the growing, 900 foot tall Kangaroo was more easily visible, both dragons panting from their running. \u201cWhat the hell has gotten into him... hes just massacring the town now!\u201d David would yell out in disbelief as he watched what Marcus did with that handful of people.  \u201cWe've gotta stop him.\u201d David took a few steps to the side, glancing back at Tyler before looking up at Marcus again. \u201cOk... if we shoot him from right here with that thing on max shrink... maybe it'll shrink him fast enough that he won't be able to find and kill us before hes back to normal. Alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply nodded and knelt down, carefully starting to turn the dial, afraid of breaking it again. The gun was already in bad shape. Several cracks ran across the casing, the dial was cracked and felt loose and jerky when he turned it, and he swore he heard rattling inside of it when he moved it. More than likely the thing was going to overload if it fired again... so they could only hope that it would be enough to get Marcus back down to size. Otherwise, well, they were just fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was starting to have second thoughts, however... not about shrinking Marcus, but about the whole situation. If this last shot broke the ray, then he'd never be able to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was snapped out of his thoughts as David yelled at him \u201cCome on Tyler, shoot, what are you waiting for?!\u201d as he turned around to see Tyler...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hurry up and shrink him down before it's too late!\u201d He bellowed, obviously worried about what would happen if the kangaroo was allowed to become much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler snapped out of it and nodded back his older brother, then started adjusting the settings some more, hearing a few more cracking sounds as he moved the slider,  \u201cIf we shoot him now and he doesn't shrink fast enough we're done for\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, if he starts coming this way while he's still huge we'll take cover somewhere and stay hidden until he's brought back down to size.\u201d David replied as a few more stomps in the distance caused him to turn his attention back to the still growing roo, \u201cMy god, look at him now, he's still growing!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Marcus had grown to a staggering height of 1000ft with no sign of his growth ending any time soon, he was so big now that he was pushing buildings apart with no effort from his expanding body alone. He was drunk with power, laughing evilly as he slammed his gigantic feet into the ground again and again, crushing cars and people alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply shook his head, he had another idea, he turned the gun to himself and quickly pulled the trigger.... yet nothing happened, he tried again but still no luck, \u201cCrap I think this thing is still broken.\u201d he said with an annoyed growl, causing David to look back at his smaller brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean broken?\u201d David said, then noticing that Tyler had the ray pointed at himself, \u201cTyler? What the hell were you doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stared down at the ray, disappointed and annoyed that he wouldn't get his chance to be big too, \u201cI.. I didn't think it would be a good idea to just shrink him down... I thought if I were big too then I'd be able to keep him busy and make sure he doesn't destroy anything else while you get another shot to shrink us both down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a lie isn't it? You just wanted to be big too didn't you? You can't wait to lord your size over everyone for once, and.....\u201d  David stopped mid sentence as without warning the ray started to shake, rattling the insides some more with the force, then a bright red beam blasted out and hit Tyler in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both gasped in shock at the same time, Tyler dropped the ray on the ground and watched as the world around him started to get smaller and smaller as he began to grow. In barely a few seconds he was much bigger than his older brother who was now staring up at the 20ft and quickly growing purple drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid dived for the raygun and quickly quickly picked it up off the ground before it was crushed under Tyler's growing feet, he struggled to move the slider back down to the shrink setting and pointed it up at Tyler, pulling the trigger to try and reverse or at least stop the growth. But again it didn't fire, instead David chose to turn and run, occasionally looking back at his now towering 100ft brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler could only laugh as David ran away in fear, this is what he wanted to see right from the very beginning, \u201cWhat's wrong Dave? Don't like being the 'little' brother for once?\u201d he chuckled out, watching his brother and everything else become more insignificant by the second.<br>\r\nHowever, he then heard the loud crashes and booms of Marcus still stomping around in the city, he was still going to be a problem and was probably the only person now who could challenge him.<br>\r\nTyler could only hope that the ray hit him with enough power to at least match the growing roo's size.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus couldn't help but just lean back as he felt what had to be hundreds of little beating hands against his massive rod. To think, that just a day ago he'd have been called a shrimp by most of these little people. Hell if he looked hard enough, he may have been able to spot a few of his old football buddies in the crowd. However by this point, they were all one mass, one singular entity, all of them helplessly clamoring to escape what was quickly becoming the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. You all are so nice to just let me kick back in your city. Mmmm... I could get used to a pad like this. All the food I can eat, all the toys I can play with...\" He grinned, licking over his teeth as his hand started to go faster, rubbing his 'toys' up and down his still growing shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, his entire body was still steadily growing. The charge he had been shot with was slowly dying down, much to Marcus's chagrin. He'd have to find those two damn drake brothers again after this. By now they had to be concocting some sort of plan to get rid of him. But for now, he was having too much fun to worry about something, or two someones, that were so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus closed his eyes as he just felt his paws grow into the rubble in front of him, blasting through it with a groan. He wiggled his toes with a breathy chuckle, just admiring the sensation of their casual power at this point, and grinning wide as through half lidded eyes he could see them in front of him, just painfully slowly but steadily growing, thickening, muscle adding onto to muscle to desperately keep up in a race to the top. He didn't know what size he was by now, but he didn't truly care. He was a God to these people, and if he wanted to get bigger, all he had to do was threaten them, and he'd have whatever the hell he'd want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout all of this his hand kept up, rubbing up and down that massive throbbing meat, elliciting groan after needy groan from Marcus's lips. He could really get used to this.  The feeling of hundreds of tiny hands, slowly being snuffed out one by one against his dick, passing out either from lack of oxygen, having taken one too many breathes of his solid -thick- musk, or being bruised and battered from his increasingly fast and rough thrusts. He shivered as he could feel himself getting close, and with a grin, decided to slow down, to edge himself. After all, he had all the time in the world. Playfully he just kept getting close, feeling his pre blast out copiously, dripping down against his hand, mingling with the hundreds of toys, most of which had stopped their useless struggling by now, coating them and lubing them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus groaned, his toes curling, tail WHUMPING behind him, casually blasting away a few dozen cars and untold amounts of people as they desperately tried to flee out of the city. He could feel them struggle behind him, eliciting a chuckle from the roo, and nothing else. He had bigger plans in mind. As he stroked his mind started to wander. What if he could just grow forever? What would he even do when he got so big he couldn't even fit anywhere? Would this size ever wear off? Did he even want it to at this point? After all, this was by far the best jerk off session he had -ever- had. All this power, all these things to toy with, all these people to get back at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... how are you liking me down there pipsqueaks? You think I'm big enough for all of you? Good. That makes all but one of us. Unfortunately... I'm that one.\" He chuckled breathily, stroking faster, wanting to finally get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... I don't think I'll stop until I can fit this entire city under one of my paws. Just... Boom! And all of this will be nothing but dust. How fucking cool would that be?\" He chuckled until a groan cut it off, his cock throbbing, starting to tense up as he got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah... you all ignored me whenever you came out to my games, you remember that?\" he groaned louder this time, his hips arching up. \"Mmmm... well why don't I return the favor, huh? You came to the game to see that idiot David and that dumbass Fang run around the field... mmmm, you got your rocks off dreaming about both of them. Well here's my dream. Every single one of you, on this whole damn planet, underneath the shadow of my fucking paw!\" He growled as he finally came. Rope after rope flied out of his thick meat, crashing down across the city, drowning some immediately. Quickly enough it started to move, mini flash-floods popping up wherever his lovely seed landed. He groaned louder as he watched through half lidded eyes, just chuckling evilly at the damage he could cause by just his cum. He wanted more though, -craved- more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally tapered off, cum drizzling down the side of his cock across the long dead first batch of toys, when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Do you see any better options at the moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe we should have just it on one of us. Least then we'd have a bargaining chip.

Even if you grew a thousand feet bigger than him, there would -still- be a time that you'd be helpless against him once more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed and rubbed his head. He didn't like their chances, not one bit, but sitting here and debating it while his city was burning and getting covered in that damn roo's cum wasn't going to help anyone either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Here goes nothin', hey bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah lets hope its something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes and hit the trigger. With a sudden brrring noise he could feel it start to rev up. However it seemed to not be stopping, brrring and not firing the shot for over a minute. Whatever it was he was about to fire, it was for all the marbles. Those crystals seemed to be overloading themselves something fierce. What you get when two people who both didn't pay attention much in shop class try to repair a weapons grade sizeray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shit, I don't think its going to last but one more shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David concentrate! That's all we need remember? Do you see any other big macro dudes around? No. So focus the shrink ray on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid once again aimed the laser at that massive target. He could see the big roo just lazing back, seeming to be enjoying his afterglow, casually pawing at his cock as he just reveled in the constant growth he had been afflicted with. It didn't help David's concentration as he mentally compared him the the rest of the town. He -had- to be at a thousand feet already. He had to be! His foot alone was dwarfing a lot of the smaller skyscrapers at this point, and still he was steadily getting fueled. David nodded, confident that his bro was right. He could grow himself, but at what cost? He'd still damage the city around him, he'd still have to deal with the problem that Marcus isn't going to -stop- growing without their interference. It was all or nothing. Now all that was left was to hope they had calibrated the crystals correctly, and to hope that the dial was set more to the side of 'shrink' than 'grow.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the gun just blew up in his hand. At first, David just watched shocked as all he was holding was a handle. However, he soon realized that the crystals that had been so overcharged not a moment ago were hovering in the air, a massive beam flowing from it, striking Marcus in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drakes could hear him stirr, hear a stark sudden growl of surprise... before, disturbingly, it took on a longer growl of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh... you two bastards couldn't leave well enough alone could you?\" Marcus chuckled breathily as he started to move, slowly getting up, the beam striking him still. \"Mmmm, but it seems at least... that you little boys chose the right path. After all, who wouldn't want to see their new god... just get even. BIGGER...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drakes fell flat on their ass as Marcus's foot came down a few blocks away, the earth shaking. And then, to their horror he could hear him chuckle, and just watched as that foot started to grow... and grow....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-s-s-s-s-shit! David what did you do! Turn it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it look like I have a ray in my hand bro! It's the crystals! They malfunctioned or some shit, I don't know what happened. They just overloaded themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well grab them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid reached for them, not having considered that earlier, but as his hands clasped against one of those crystals, it immediately was repelled by the scorching hot temperature of them, leaving a heavy burn mark on his hand and the smell of singed flesh in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fuck! They are too hot to touch! I can't even hold on to it long enough to see if it would budge.\" David shook his hand out, before looking back at Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them could hear him growl, see him just ballooning upwards. This wasn't like the last times. This time, it was going -fast-. Already he looked like he had doubled in size, standing at a good two thousand feet, his entire body standing above the skyline of their former city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh dear, look at this view! I can see a few more cities full of playthings in the distance. Mmm, its like a carpet of them. Or a buffet. Mmmpf, a growing boy must have his protein.\" Marcus chuckled breathily. \"Mmm, though at the rate I can blow a load with this new power in me, I doubt that protein will stay in me long. Thanks for that too by the way. I was actually thinking of taking a break from blowing up the city, maybe laying by a nice lake and enjoying the sensation of my paws filling it up. Mmmm, but you just made me all -kinds- of horny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Tyler could no longer sit where they were. Thinking quick, David grabbed the dumbfounded Tyler, dragging him away from his resting place, as seconds later that expanding paw just engulfed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Look at you two. I mean, seriously, I can barely see you down there. Is that really you David? Star of the football team indeed. I mean, do you even need a kicker? I hear the one in town is fantastic.\" Marcus just flexed, kissing his still growing bicep as he hit two thousand five hundred feet. \"Kicks a ball from here to next week. And what a stud~.\" David couldn't help but scoff as he watched Marcus's hand start to tease against his drooling cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, but what am I saying. I don't need your fucking team. I don't need anything but the adulation of those I'm about to use. Perhaps I can just have this town come and clean my feet off. I haven't had a bath since the last game, you reckon how filthy I must be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just continued to move Tyler through back alleys, trying to get out of the way of Marcus as well as the crowds of hundreds of fleeing people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, its still going! Look at those little champs. Just blasting away at me like I even give a damn anymore. I'm a fucking GOD!\" As if to accentuate the point, Marcus lifted up his paw. To the horror of everyone, they could all see the shadow it caused, blotting out two... no three... no four and growing city blocks. He wiggled his toes, debris and dirt falling down upon those unlucky to be directly beneath it. And then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven David was tossed, quite literally, a few feet across the pavement from the impact. He could see the ground shatter underneath him, crack and blast away, revealing once hidden infastructure underneath. Gas lines lighting fires as they burst. Dust just fanning the growing flames. An entire four city blocks just gone, and David but two or three blocks off. Not that it mattered now, as it was an open crater from there to where he was sitting now, 'protected' by the small business around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god that felt so good. Mmmpf! Miniscule little buildings... tiny little ant people. Why not take out the proverbial magnifying glass and just destroy all that they find dear?\" David heard Marcus panting, getting into it more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcus got ready for his literal next step, the crystals...</span></div></div>",

That one singular paw of Marcus filled up their entire vision, each wiggling toe able to crash over a city block at this point with relative ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could hear him panting, just getting progressively more into it the bigger and stronger he became. And to their horror, they could still see minor changes in him, watching his body readjust, growing muscle here and shifting it there to make sure his new giant form wasn't clumsy and awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shit bro...\" David finally broke the silence. Even Marcus seemed to have paused, for what they couldn't tell. They could hear him shifting, could still hear the screams of innocent bystanders as they ran around the city helplessly. Finally, they heard him, that booming laugh of his erupting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Look at those fires go. Doing a better job at getting you all into one little bitty place than I ever could.\" David peeked out the window, Tyler simply fell against against a nearby wall, mumbling. As David looked out and saw what was going on, he kind of wished he had joined his brother. Thousands had all been forced into a single park from the fires, and even then the fires were quickly surrounding them. Marcus had taken note of this, and seemed to be having fun watching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, though I can't let the fire have all the fun. After all, this is my world now...\" With that, David watched, in a mixture of terror and awe as one of Marcus's massive paws moved, cresting from the right side of his field of vision, and just started moving down against the crowd. Even thousands of people couldn't spread across enough space to completely cover the underbelly of Marcus's -massive- paw, something that even Marcus seemed to notice as David heard him suddenly just laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah. Look at you all. Little pipsqueaks could fit comfortably under my toes. How do you like my foot little scared ants?\" David shook his head as he watched Marcus just wiggle his toes, grunting, obviously enjoying the sensation of lording his new-found power over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little musty from all the crap I've stepped on so far don't you think? How bout you clean it for me. Don't worry, I'll keep the fires at bay... so long as you do what your told.\" Marcus chuckled, and David watched as his paw lowered down. The people were stuck, unable to do much else but just give in, and he watched as thousands just licked and moved around under that big paw pad, cleaning it from what must be a horrible amount of debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid almost gagged, looking away from it after a moment. To think of himself down there! And worst of all was the low groan of pleasure from Marcus. He wasn't just enjoying this, he was actively getting off on this! David just thought about this until he noticed something peculiar... it was oddly quiet. David looked out the window, only to see the fires raging closer. By now where they were had to be lit up in flames. He was glad he got Tyler out of there, saving them both at least temporarily. And with Marcus's growth having slowed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blinked, ears going back as he suddenly saw from his former location a sudden brillant flash, and then a broad red ray shoot forward, striking Marcus's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww fuck...\" David rubbed his temple as he saw it, knowing what it meant by now. Somehow the heat must have rejuvenated those crystals. He had no idea how, but it wasn't important. What was important was that he get the hell out of dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...\" He could hear Marcus groan, and then heard thousands scream in unison as that paw simply outgrew the park, smashing down into whatever unlucky souls were underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! You aren't done yet little crystals? You just want to see me get bigger do you? Well then by all means, lets do this...~\" Marcus growled, and as David grabbed Tyler, dragging him out of their makeshift shelter, he was struck immobile as he watched Marcus's other paw, the one which nearly got them the last time. It was growing, obviously, but it was the speed that caught him off guard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus growled and looked down at the slowly vanishing city. He saw at his feet the tiny crystals blasting away at him still. God it felt good, better than those little people, better than the sensation of just laying waste to an entire city block with his single toe. It felt better, because he knew at the end, he could just do -worse-. He chuckled as he flexed, his entire body just bloating upwards and upwards. His vision was hazy, but he could tell this was something major. He was growing and growing -fast.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, how David and Tyler must feel at this point. Hah! Didn't you two pipsqueaks want to play with all this power yourself? You sure you little idiots would have been able to handle it? Because I can tell you from experience that this is some heavy stuff. If I were you I wouldn't have just let it fall into any ol' strangers hands. It might end poorly!\" Marcus snorted indignantly as his vision cleared, only for him to smile broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to be close to double his previous size. He could see the St. Andrews Real Estate Tower, the largest building in his former home city, standing at a good thousand feet tall... and he could see how it went up to about his knee. He saw massive groups of people, not quite looking like the insects they truly were, but looking more like unrecognizable blobs. He licked over his lips and just flexed, just relishing the fact that even as he looked down at the city now with power hungry eyes, that every second he was just looking down at them even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm,  you all are starting to become bores and liabilities. I wouldn't want any other city knowing what actually grew me. They might get the bright idea of reversing it! And we can't have that can we? Noooo... So here is what I am going to do. I am going to thank you all for being -so- much fun for me. I'm going to recognize that a lot of you were there for me at every football game, cheering on me, Fa-... oh wait! You DIDN'T cheer me on! You didn't even know who the hell I was did you? Hmm, my my. How times have changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus grinned as he lifted up his footpaw, just relishing the fact that the paw crater left behind had destroyed buildings in it he never knew he had blown up, his growing paw simply engulfing them as it steadily grew wider, grew broader, grew more destructive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"look up pipsqueaks. You've all seen this by now I'm sure. You would have seen it at the games you went to had you been paying attention. I work hard to keep my leg muscles in shape. Shame really, if I hadn't you might all be able to live through this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus smiled wickedly, and then just... kicked downwards. -Hard-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned as he felt the earth beneath him even giving up, just blasting apart into dusty chunks, flying to the four winds. He watched as shockwaves blasted from ground zero, crashing into skyscrapers, blasting out windows, demolishing a good chunk of downtown. He licked over his lips as he could watch the tide of debris flow and demolish even more, trillions of dollars of life and buildings smashed by one single kick. And he couldn't help but just laugh ecstatically, as even before all this was done, even before the debris even settled... his paw had outgrown the crater it had left behind not a few seconds ago by a large margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down as he was at a half demolished city, just relishing in the continuous bath of power still flowing into him from those overcharged crystals, Marcus contemplated his next move...</span></div></div>",

The crystals seemed to have become unbalanced, directing most of their energy towards the development of his genitalia. The colossal roo was by now nearing six thousand feet, and his shaft was beginning to blot out the sky as well, reaching up past his well-defined chest and nearly as thick as his arms. His massive, bloated sac hung down to his knees by now, overly full of cream.<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s have our party, shall we?\u201d He snickered. Grasping his cock in both hands, he knelt down in the midst of the wrecked city. He slammed it down into the earth, carving a wide trench out, and flattening several more skyscrapers with its immense weight. Rocking back and forth now, Marcus began working himself up to climax again. Each thrust reached a little bit further, the roo still growing larger, and larger, and larger, more powerful by the second. The precum oozing from the tip was causing small floods on its own. <br>\r\n\u201cBehold\u2026 your new\u2026 Master\u2026\u201d he gasped, nearly there.<br>\r\nJust before he hit the point of no return, though\u2026 </span></div></div>",

A small, approaching dust cloud, carving its way through the city, ignorant of the fleeing civilians, the sound of crunching metal reaching his tall ears as something destroyed cars left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave him pause, his stroking hand faltering in its cadence, slowing until it merely grasped his cock, holding the massive spire of meat upright. \"What's this?\" He rumbled, not moving from his spot. Marcus had all the confidence in the world. Nothing so small could move the world's new god. So he waited, until the cloud stopped, and then, began to clear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a convoy of tanks, five of them. The giant roo felt almost disappointing. He had hoped maybe there was another macro in the world who had come to try and stop him. He would have loved to feel something tangible and wiggling under his paws again. The rest of the city had grown too small by now. Indeed, from the streets below, Marcus' resting foot rose over the buildings. Had he been standing, his smaller toe would have been taller than any building around. He was behemothic, a true god. And frankly, a convoy of vehicles was an insulting attack. They hadn't even fired yet, the kangaroo yawning as he began stroking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motions of his hands, despite not touching the earth at all, still caused apocalyptic destruction throughout the city. Already damaged buildings finally toppled, while cars juddered across the earth, leaving skidmarks. Pedestrians found it hard to stay standing, falling, or finding themselves smears under collapsing rubble. A steady \"THOOM...THOOM\" shook the city as Marcus drove himself to the edge again, pre squirting from his massive, and growing, cock. A single drop was enough to crush a building, and as bits of rubble pressed into the underside of his cock, he almost didn't notice when something fired right into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as not a shell, or a missile, but a beam of colored energy burst from the central tank, hitting his hand, and then, as he jerkily moved it up his cock, into the underside of his shaft! Marcus jumped at the unexpected flash of light, wincing, his motion causing a shockwave that obliterated the area for a dozen city blocks. Then, Marcus waited. And waited. But the pain never came. \"What kind of weapon is this,\" he rumbled as he turned to loom over the collection of metal, tracked boxes. His cock rose far, far above the collection of military personnel, blocking out the sun, cum pouring from his shaft. \"It feels,\" he rumbled, his mouth curling up into a wicked smile. \"Kind of good!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few city blocks away from the gigantic Marcus-made crater, Tyler stirred from his unconsciousness on the ground to a world of chaos. Dust congested his lungs and obscured his vision as he attempted to breathe and remove the debris that pinned him to the uneven asphalt below him. Groggy and disoriented, he sat upright and looked himself over for any major injuries. Aside from being incredibly sore and covered in small cuts and bruises, Tyler was glad to find no life-threatening injury on his person. He also felt slight tremors all around him, not strong enough to destroy or disturb anything else, but noticeable to be felt by his entire body. Racking his mind to clear up his thoughts, Tyler recalled some unbelievable force knocking him down as he was attempting to run away from something with David\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?\" Tyler blurted out, just realizing his brother was not there with him. \"Oh no! David, where are you!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, is that you?\" a distant voice behind Tyler called back. Tyler quickly turned around from his sitting position on the ground to view David running up to him in the settling dust, dodging chunks of broken buildings and open cracks in the ground that most likely led to ruptured sewers below. \"Tyler! You're okay! I thought you were a goner after Marcus attacked!\" He cried out as he kneeled down and hugged Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're safe, too, David,\" Tyler said, expressing a sigh of relief. \"I guess I was knocked out by his attack while we were running away. How long was I out? Is Marcus still around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't out long, but that kick Marcus delivered fucked everything up! I think it was a shockwave or something that did this, because we were running one moment then all of a sudden I was blown away from you by a huge gust of wind.\" David stared off into the distance around them, attempting to look or pinpoint the source of the tremors in the dust rather timidly. \"But everything's been rumbling since then. I haven't seen Marcus since the dust went up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better find out at least where he is, then immediately turn around and head off in the opposite direction. This situation is completely out of control,\" replied Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, David extended his hand to Tyler to help him up from the ground. Keeping their stances low to avoid losing their balance with the periodic quakes, the two brothers set off down the broken road to find a clearing and pinpoint where they are. All sorts of cars, trucks, and other vehicles were completely skewed around the area or haphazardly tossed into smaller broken buildings. The larger buildings, mostly reduced to rubble, continually blocked their path as they made their way forward. After a few minutes, light started to break through the dust ahead of them as the quakes started to get stronger. Passing the fading dust cloud, both Tyler and David gasped at what they saw before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from their vantage point on the ground, the brothers were able to make out the outcrops of distorted and completely broken infrastructure of buildings and sidewalks from either side of them. A couple of city blocks further in front of them, the landscape showed a gradual reduction of standing buildings until the terrain was nearly flat and compressed with debris in a wide circle. The flatten city area was nearly a mile wide and had a sudden dip into the ground about a quarter-mile wide at the center of the flattened circle. Within this crater, an impression of Marcus's paw dozens of feet deep could clearly be seen in the center, with an even bigger but softer impression of Marcus\u2019s paw encompassing it and the crater, showing that the giant kangaroo must have grown larger after kicking the ground. But what really surprised the brothers was what was beyond the other side of the destroyed city area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should have been the great skylines of the downtown area dominating their view was instead replaced by the domineering presence of the growing kangaroo; now as large as the flattened area that encompassed the crater he created earlier. Marcus was busily masturbating his torso length cock across the ground of the now squished downtown area. To the brothers' dismay, they noticed that with each thrust brought more and more destruction to the surround buildings, as Marcus and his cock slowly grew bigger and bigger, increasing the size of the tremors the brothers felt all around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is fucked up... I fucked up...\" David said in defeat, dropping to his knees as he watched the manically lusty kangaroo before him enjoy his growth spurt over the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give up yet, David. We should reconvene outside the city and figure out what to do from there. We won't be able to get anything done if we stayed here\" replied Tyler. \"I think our only chance to get out of here is to head back to the suburbs. Unfortunately, I believe that requires us to go through this crater area in order to get there quickly, since almost everywhere else is blocked off by destroyed buildings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping David up from his knees, Tyler began to set off around the perimeter of the flattened city area with David following closely behind. Despite the clearing of buildings, the steady tremors of the Earth got more intense as the brothers got close to the behemoth. Just as the two were about to reach the edge of the clearing that headed to the suburbs, the brothers noticed that the steady tremors stopped. Looking behind them, they saw that Marcus had stopped masturbating and held up his mythical mast of a cock against his chest with his hands. The great giant appeared to be staring down at something blocks away from them, far into the ruined part of the downtown area. Suddenly, out of the corner of a ruined building about a half dozen blocks to their right, a small fleet of tanks was rolling up towards the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world? Is that the armed forces?\" Tyler said, curiosity briefly stopping him from continuing onwards to the brothers' escape. \"I don\u2019t think they can do anything that can even remotely harm Marcus. If anything, whatever they plan on doing will piss him off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we better hurry and get out of here before Marcus decides to drop a kick on top of them and blast the city apart again.\" David replied, grabbing hold of Tyler's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was saying something completely deep and inaudible to the convoy due to his size as they stopped a few blocks away from the growing giant, but whatever Marcus had said didn't stop him from continuing to stroke himself. Just as he was about to turn around and follow David, he noticed that one of the tanks in the convoy fired what appeared to be a laser at Marcus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, wait! Those tanks over there are doing something,\" Tyler yelled. \"Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quickly looked back at the convoy to see what they had done to Marcus. From their standpoint, a bright energetic beam struck Marcus's hand, which caused him to wince in response. The resulting motion immediately caused a small earthquake that shook the brothers off their feet and on to the ground. Immediate buildings nearby began to further crumble into disrepair as cars and other motor vehicles swayed across the broken roads from the titanic shift of the kangaroo. Getting back on their feet from the short quake, Tyler noticed that Marcus's cock was now being fully exposed to the energetic beam. However, Marcus looked more surprised than in pain. What in the world are they doing, Tyler thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers then saw Marcus slowly move his upper torso and cock closer to the convoy of tanks, looming over them and inspecting them closely as the beam continued to strike Marcus's cock. The giant kangaroo's deep voice rumbled something, again completely inaudible to the brothers. But as soon as he said it, his surprised expression turned into a wicked smile. Then all hell broke lose with another inaudible mumble from Marcus...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Loud and sudden cracks reached the ears of the brothers, followed by strong tremors shaking up their surroundings once again. Startled, both dragons saw that the behemoth kangaroo was again stroking himself with both hands with increased fervor. Keeping his cock upright while closing his eyes and allowing his tongue to hang out from his massive maw, Marcus's head was starting to push away the lower clouds above him at a quickening pace. His labored breathing began to turn into Earth shaking groans, each one causing his increasing weight to slowly sink further into the Earth as he stroked his growing cock vehemently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What are they doing!?\" yelled Tyler, desperately trying to stand upright during the stronger tremors. \"We need to stop them, this can't go on any further!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning across the quaking terrain and avoiding buildings crumbling down from their foundations across their path, the brothers hurried to the convoy of tanks. As they ran, buildings near Marcus began to fall down as the size of his growing body began pushing them aside in all directions. From the brothers\u2019 perspective, just the nails of his paws alone were as big as buildings as he unknowingly grew past 9,000 ft. Soon, nothing but the sight of Marcus's gargantuan balls and shaft were all the brothers could see passed the toppled buildings to the right of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting close to the convoy of tanks, Tyler and David immediately began yelling out to them to gain their attention. Someone from one of the tanks immediately peaked out to see the commotion and spotted them. Disembarking from their tank, the commanding soldier began to yell out, \"Civilians! What are you doing here? You need to leave the city immediately for your safety as we handle this catastrophe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" spouted David, approaching the solider out of breath from the running. \"That thing, whatever it is you're firing at him, is only making him grow bigger! You need to stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of the plan,\" replied the uniformed soldier, \"this here is a growth gun developed by the government, tested and guaranteed to grow anything we shoot at it. Fortunately, it can also shrink anything as well, but it needs a ramp-up time to charge in order to grow or shrink anything quickly. Right now we are trying to fool the monster into thinking we are growing it, but as soon as the commander has this baby warmed up to fire at full power with a pulse, we'll flip the switch to shrink the bastard down before he has any time to realize what we are doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is insane!\" screamed Tyler, finally catching up to his brother and equally out of breath. \"This can backfire if he grows too large and destroys the entire city before the gun is warmed up to quickly shrink him down. You need to stop now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative, shorty, the plan is in action and it must be followed through. If we stop now, he'll surely come after us. Now you need to leave before the monster notices what we're doing,\" replied the solider, just as he began making his way back to the tank convoy, \"Don't worry about us, we'll make sure this plan works out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we tried a similar plan before and it backfired on us, we know what we're talking about.\" Tyler replied, authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have your own growth ray technology? Preposterous. No civilian has that type of technology. Leave while you can, you two,\" yelled the solider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, we... I-I found a growth ray gun with a glowing crystal in it. It had a dial on it to grow and shrink anything as well. The monster kangaroo you see before you was caused by m-me, and my brother here is helping me out to fix my mistake.\" Tyler stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solider looked back at Tyler incredulously. But before he could reply, a massive quake suddenly took over the surround area. Marcus, now with his cock reaching above the clouds, was quickly closing in on 12,000 ft. What appeared to be causing the new earthquakes was Marcus's newfound pleasure of bucking the air with his hips to add to his frenzied strokes of his cock. The steady rhythm of his shifting momentum on the city below had the ground shaking within a 10 mile radius of his position, and growing larger with each buck. There was no way any building, stout or partially demolished wasn't completely destroyed by this new development. Looking above them, the brothers and soldier noticed that massive amounts of precum were dropping from his cock above the clouds, instantly demolishing the rubble below and flooding the area underneath him. If they didn't seek shelter soon, the precum would be upon them and wash them out like a biblical flood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gather inside the tank! I guess you're with us 'till the end!\" yelled the solider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering their senses, Tyler and David immediately made their way to the tank and embarked on it. Once inside the cramped space of the tank, the soldier closed the hatch from above and got in the command seat and picked up a receiver. \"General, I've got two civilians inside with me that were unable to flee the city, but they might have useful information on how this situation might have happened,\" said the soldier, \"what are your orders? over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of crumbling infrastructure and the feeling of shaking ground beneath them made Tyler nervous. Certainly they were safe in an armored vehicle, but not being able to see what was going on outside irked him the most. Perhaps, thought Tyler, Marcus is simply biding his time to squash this convoy when we least expect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good lieutenant, so long as you are in your post to make the switch, keep them with you, over,\" replied the general over the line, snapping Tyler out of his thoughts. \"To all, the laser is almost powered up so prepare to make the switch on my command, then I will pulse the beam, over. We need all switches on shrink for this to work when I pulse the beam, so I repeat, prepare to switch, over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solider immediately opened a latch up on the console in front him that had a simple dial on it with two options, grow and shrink, with grow already in the preset position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, over,\" replied several voices over the receiver, including the solider's own response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my mark,\" said the general. \"3...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sounds of buildings crumbling near them stopped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movement of the ground relative to the tank also stopped. Confused, Tyler and David looked at each other to confirm that indeed everything was at a complete standstill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overwhelming silence of those three seconds enveloped Tyler as he waited for the last command. Even in that short amount of time, time seemed to stretch out as he began to wonder what was happening outside. Whatever it was, it was probably bad and he and his brother were about to experience it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tank was suddenly jolted out of position as the command was given. Tyler, David and the soldier were immediately tossed around inside the tank from the sudden impulse. Loud bangs could easily be heard all around the them, as if though the tank were being pelted by a continuous barrage of rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SON-OF-A-B... *kersh* ... THE GI... *kersh* ... NO CHOICE ... *kersh* I'M AIMED AT... *kersh* -CH NOW!\" yelled the general over the receiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON OUT THERE!\" yelled Tyler, gathering his bearings and helping up a disoriented David from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solider immediately pulled down a scope from just above his head and picked up his receiver, \"General, are we switching? over, I repeat, are we switching? over.\" He pulled the scope down to his face to peer in it, and made some adjustments on the knobs at its sides. \"Shit, I can't see anything. Something is splattered over the lens and is preventing me from seeing anything. General, I repeat, are we switching? over,\" the soldier asked into the receiver, again with no response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatic silence filled the air as the tank continued to be pelted by loud bangs and knocks from the outside. David and Tyler huddled near the back wall of the tank, away from the console and soldier. This can't be the end, thought Tyler. We're trapped in a tank with no idea what's going on outside, whether death awaits us or not. Marcus could be looming over us right now ready to squish us. Tears streaked down his cheek as he embraced his brother in a deep hug. \"I'm so sorry David, this is all my fault...,\" Tyler started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the general's voice yelled loudly out of the receiver, \"*kersh* -ING TO FIRE. I RE... *kersh* -IRE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler immediately perked his ears. Did the general say he was going to fire? The soldier in hasn't turned the switch in this tank yet, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General, can you hear me? over. Are we still switching, sir? over,\" replied the soldier over the receiver waiting for any audible order to be given, despite the intense situation that everyone was most likely in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next occurred in rapid succession over a span of a couple of seconds in Tyler's mind. First, Tyler heard \"FIRING...,\" from the general over receiver, apparently not having heard the solider's question. Thinking quickly, Tyler leapt up from his position and jumped towards to switch on the console. In that fraction of the next second, just as Tyler's managed to grab the dial on the switch, the general's final word over the receiver was heard: \"... NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The warm and steady flow of energy coming from the main tank pointed at Marcus's cock filled him with renewed excitement as it allowed him to continue to grow faster and unhindered. He gave no second thought to what the pipsqueaks were doing below him as he shifted his weight slightly to make his growing body comfortable, unknowingly causing his bulking mass to slide over several city blocks and effectively flattening anything in his wake. As far as he knew, they completely accepted him as their beloved god, and they were only serving him by making him more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by Jove, it felt incredible! With the strange power of the tank pouring into his body through his cock, the twitching bliss in his loins were amplified many times over than normal as he worked his inflating shaft, coaxing the thickening semen bubbling inside of him to its fullest capacity and building up to his eventual messy release. What's more, since his cock was receiving the strange energy from the tank first before redistributing itself in his body, his reproductive organs were growing more quickly and pronounced as his other organs and body systems were catching up. Marcus\u2019s sensitive cock head could now easily graze his fur under his chin, while each of his balls expanded well past any of his outstretched paws, stretching his sac comfortably tight over the city blocks below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcus's head started to part and push the clouds around him, he carefully repositioned himself from his sitting position to a kneeling stance over the city, splaying his legs to make room for his heavy balls and gargantuan cock for the viewing pleasure of the insignificant people below him as he continued to masturbate. Despite making more room for himself, he could still feel the creeping pressure in his gut and swelling fervor in his sac, signaling the mounting presence of the ocean of jism he was likely producing. Taking one of his massive paws from working his slick shaft, he gently cupped one of his balls and began to massage the growing orb, further flattening the city blocks beneath him and sending slight waves of tingles up his spine as his cum factories responded in kind by making more spunk for him to play with. Gods, he wanted to release so badly, but he knew if he just waited a bit more he'd likely be big enough to douse the entire city below him with his virile seed. Maybe that's what the people below him want \u2014to have their city drown in the lewd lusts of their magnificent and powerful god! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe malevolent thought excited Marcus so much he stopped stroking himself momentarily to quell his rutting body before he went over the edge. Shivers traveled all around his expanding body as he attempted to calm himself, clenching his eyes, and steadying his breaths while flexing his internal muscles to hold the dam within him from breaking. Simultaneously, his cock tensed up and twitched from his body\u2019s response and caused a large dollop of pre to lurch from his urethra. The lake sized precum droplet fell and crashing down on the city blocks nearest to his balls, flooding and pushing the tanks back due to the force of the splashing liquid. Catching his breath from the close call, Marcus continued his careful strokes with one free paw and began to massage his balls to edge himself again with renewed vigor and letting out Earth-shaking moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was approaching 12,000 ft. and reaching his next edge, he noticed that the power flowing into his cock began to subside. Briefly looking below with one unclenched eye, Marcus saw that the tanks were no longer in formation, but were instead skewed over the toppled buildings from the rushing river of precum he released earlier. The main tank was now firing off into the river of pre, expanding the viscous fluid immensely within the vicinity of the tanks and flooding the surrounding city blocks. Not wanting to end his pleasure session, Marcus halted from fondling his balls to reach out to move the tank back into firing position of his cock with his outstretched paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Marcus could lay any of his building sized claws on the tank, a bright and immense burst of light shot out that blew past the thick precum and struck the behemoth on his shaft. In a quick series of events that only lasted a few seconds, the trunk of Marcus\u2019s penis expanded quickly to the thickness of his massive tail and then some, while his length shot straight up past his one stroking paw and over his head to 18,000 ft. The immediate gain in weight of his prick shifted his center of mass forward, throwing off his balance momentarily as his balls expanded greatly between his splayed thighs, anchoring his muscular body to the ground as they started to lift him up slightly from the city below. Startled, Marcus began to reach out his arms to pull his penis back from falling on the city, but the slick fluids that drenched his shaft prevented him from getting a good grip. Instead, his now hypersensitive cock took the sensation of his failed attempts to regain composure as grotesque pleasure and stimulation, shooting spine tingling lighting up his back. A fraction of a second later, Marcus\u2019s body size began to blow up to catch up to his genitals, further compounding the toe-curling pleasure coursing through his body as his penis came swaying back with a large thud against his chest, cock-head leveled with his maw at 24,000 ft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the various sensations eventually shot back to Marcus\u2019s two cum factories between his legs, putting them into overdrive as his gut finally couldn\u2019t hold back his dam of lust. Shutting his eyes closed and moaning in delight, the first explosive shot of his orgasm sent a rush of hot liquid out of his broad cock and into his open mouth as his body ballooned to 30,000 ft. Surprised, Marcus\u2019s mouth quickly filled to capacity as he rode on the first crest of his growth-orgasm for a few seconds. Reflexively, Marcus turned his head away from his dilated urethra, paws flailing about attempting to move his penis away while splashing torrential loads of cum over his face and torso, and swallowed his spunk to prevent himself from drowning. Surprised, he found that his thick, pearly white seed was sweet and tasty. But before he could even complete that thought process, the next crest of his orgasm came baring down on his body, bigger and stronger than the first one, eliminating all critical thought from his mind. Marcus\u2019s cock twitched in response and fired out a stronger and longer stream of cum over his face, coating his nostrils and suffocating his sense of smell with his foaming seed before pushing his stream over his shoulder, creating a large lake outside the city behind him as he grew to 36,000 ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations proved too much for the growing kangaroo, as his very own jizz filled his world. His eyes rolled up as another wave of intense pleasure shot through his body, enhancing the feeling of the cum sliding down his torso and face. As if by instinct, Marcus once again started to cup and massage his balls to increase his production, forming an intense zeal in his scrotum and not noticing that although he was emptying his balls at an alarming rate, they were quickly filling back up to capacity for the next load. As his orgasm progressed, the kangaroo opened his maw wide to take in his own cock head to receive his nourishment directly, bloating his mouth from the amount of cum he was shooting and swallowing as much as possible longer than before, spilling some over his chest like a waterfall as he grew to 40,000 ft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came down from the third crest of his orgasm, Marcus had a brief moment of lucidity to take note of his immense size and looked back down on the city. He was easily half its size now, noting that his splayed legs almost reached from one end of the city to the other, and he was still growing! Thinking back on what he thought earlier, he noted that he would be able to send out the city with a bang sooner than he thought. After all, the munchkins below gave this gift of growth to appease their god, so they deserve to be rewarded just as quickly in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, before Marcus could complete his thought, the next crest of his orgasm slammed harder and longer over his body, making it shiver moderately from the intensity of the pleasure. His cock pulsed with a long unbroken stream of white alabaster spunk, causing his maw to bloat once more with even more cum than before as he attempted to swallow his heavenly fluids. Slightly out of breath from the aftershock of his experience and growing to 50,000 ft., but still delighted to taste his own delicious seed, Marcus quickly took out his cock from his mouth and moved his massive body to the outskirts of the city, leaving massive amounts of jizz over the land as he crawled on his paws and knees, positioning himself over the crater he made a while ago with his massive kick. A thought immediately occurred to him of what to do, and he smiled mischievously as his sac bloated up again, signaling to him that the endless ocean of jism still stirring in his gut was ready for his next release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Marcus was about to enter the next wave of his orgasm, he\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, the giant roo had grown so much that his girth almost filled its circumference, which caused his advance into the Earth to gradually slow down as his prick continued to expand. He managed to get a quarter of his shaft into the ground before the next wave of his orgasm blasted out of him. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith nowhere else to go, the immediate spray of his cum exploded around his glands, sending a large eruption of freshly made jizz back toward his groin and splattering it everywhere over his crotch. The enormous pressure of his release managed to further crumble and split the ground below him, allowing more of his shaft to immediately slip into the Earth. The feeling of his cock being firmly sleeved into his make-shift orifice pleasured Marcus greatly, just enough to give him one last miniature orgasm that assisted him to plunge his pride halfway into the ground as the last of his reserves from his balls disappeared into the Earth. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSatisfied with himself, Marcus reached underneath him to feel the fruits of labor. Cupping his balls once more, he felt they were now empty enough to be held individually with one of his paws. Moving to his exposed shaft, he gave one last slippery stroke that sent shivers to his core and moved up to feel his firm abdomen and pecks plastered with his warm fluids. He marveled at how massive he was now, how the power was still flowing through his body, how the thick musk of his excitement saturated his senses and further enhanced the feeling of his afterglow. All of these erotic thoughts and sensations excited the giant roo, causing his pride to swell up again as he withdrew it from the hole he created. Looking back down at the city, he saw that a good portion of it was upheaved due to his cock. All across the ground, there were small geysers doted over the city erupting the roo\u2019s cum in order to release the pent-up pressure from underground. He was impressed with himself and was glad that his goal was almost complete. He was close to flooding this city, all he needed to do was release one last time... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nGrabbing his enormous cock with both of his paws, Marcus came to the conclusion that he would finish off the city by grinding against it until climax. That seemed like the most appropriate way to send the city off. Giving his shaft a few good strokes to make sure he was prepared, Marcus lifted it up against his chest to give his tip one last teasing lick before he released it to fall onto the ground below... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d shouted a muffled voice <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe noise jolted Tyler back into consciousness, causing him to cough instantly as his first deep breath resulted in a large intake of dust. His body ached badly as he coughed, and it worsened as he moved his arms and legs while he was spiraled on the ground of the cold tank. He attempted to squint his eyes open to see his surroundings, but his vision was heavily blurred. He focused on where the sound was coming from, and saw the blurred outline of his brother, David, in front of him.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDa\u2014 ack, *cough**cough* \u2014 Da-David. Are \u2014are y-you there?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTyler? Tyler! Oh, thank goodness! You\u2019re alright...\u201d he heard David reply, moving closer in Tyler\u2019s vision. \u201cI thought we lost you there, man. *Cough**cough* We were tossed around in the tank for a while, and you got knocked out sometime in the tumble. We were pushed off from our position from all the cu... well, from Marcus. *Cough* ack, but the tank saved us, Tyler. We\u2019re still alive...\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTyler suddenly felt a small pressure on his back as David attempted to prop his body up. The pain was sharp and excruciating to Tyler as he was lifted up. He yelped weakly in response, but David ignored it as he embraced him in a hug. \u201cDav \u2014david, please, do-don't crush me...\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just so glad you\u2019re alive!\u201d He heard his brother cry. Tyler felt tears smear on his shoulders as his brother continued to cry and suffocate him. Looking over his shoulder, Tyler could make out another blurred object in the background, coming in and out of focus in front of a bunch of dancing small lights. Tyler\u2019s eyes slowly began to adjust and he noticed it was the soldier in front of the control panel of the tank, attempting to see if anything worked.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDamnit,\u201d the soldier yelled, \u201cAlmost nothing works in here... Hello, out there! Over! Is anyone out there! Over!\u201d The soldier was holding the receiver that he was previously using to talk to his commanding officer, shaken and slightly disarrayed from the recent ordeal. Nothing but static met his response as he attempted to listen back to the receiver, however, and he grunted in frustration as he held it once more to his mouth. \u201cSir, are you still there? Over! Damnit... hey, hey you two, are you okay?\u201d the solider said, looking back at the brothers. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d replied David, loosening his embrace of Tyler, \u201cYeah, Tyler\u2019s up now. What should we do?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, communication seems completely cut off in here, and nothing seems to be working on the control panel,\u201d the soldier said as he was pushing some buttons. One button seemed to respond though as the soldier clicked it, which caused the tank to jolt backwards and shake slightly, as if though it were firing something in front of them. Startled, the soldier quickly pressed the button again to stop whatever it was that it was doing, and the tank returned back to normal. \u201cWell... that works... fat luck that will do us... *sigh*everything upside seems to have calmed down for now, though. We should take a look to see where we are now after all this... mess.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d David said to the solider, before looking back at Tyler. \u201cTyler? Are you okay to stand up?\u201d said David. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just help me get up...\u201d Tyler replied weakly. David carefully kneeled and lifted one of Tyler\u2019s arms over his shoulders to support him. As he began to lift him up, Tyler also attempted to regain control of his legs by pushing up. They felt weak and bruised, but he managed to at least stand up a bit. Propping himself against his brother, Tyler and David slowly made their way to the ladder that led up to the exit of the tank. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOpening the tank top that sealed them away from the outside world, the first thing that immediately hit the brothers was the strong musk and odor of the kangaroo\u2019s fluids. Gagging, the brothers looked about in front of them and to the sides to make out where they were. Nothing but crumbled infrastructure and broken pavement surrounded them, and everything appeared to be slathered with the fluids of the kangaroo. Looking closely at the broken infrastructure, though, Tyler could make out some broken parts of roof tops and wooden walls. In fact, now that he could focus his eyes more clearly, he could even make out the destroyed foundations of buildings that were way too small to be buildings from the downtown area. Were they pushed back to the suburbs? But the suburbs were miles away from the downtown area... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge quake struck the brothers and the ground around them, knocking them off the tank before they could get their footing. Tyler landed painfully on top of David as the shaking continued, while the soldier was still making his way out of the tank. \u201cW-w-what\u2019s g-going on n-now?\u201d yelled the soldier.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI-it mu-must be M-M-Marcus a-again,\u201d David began, moving Tyler aside and stammering to complete his sentence, \u201cbu-but where is h-he... oh n-no...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust in front of them, Marcus was knelled before the ground while holding his massive tool, pushing it forward as it appeared to sink into the ground. As it sunk further, the ground around the brothers shook more and more violently. Tyler hastily crawled to the tank to prop himself up against it, while David trembled on his hands and knees with the ground nearby. Peering back over to Marcus again, Tyler noticed that his member appeared to be sinking into a premade crater. Then it suddenly struck him what that crater was. That crater was the one Marcus created earlier from his kick, where he and David went by before they joined the soldier and the tank. That thing must have been at least a mile wide when they transversed around it ... and Marcus was now using it to pleasure himself... <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTyler? David? Is that you?\u201d A feminine voice called from somewhere behind the tank. Staggering to the Tank\u2019s side, Tyler rounded the corner to find a female artic fox holding on to the tank for balance, along with a physically imposing, buff black wolf stubbornly trying to keep his balance by her. It was Jessica and Fang! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, oh my god! You\u2019re here!\u201d she exclaimed happily. Looking back at the tank, and then at the giant kangaroo out in the horizon, her happy and joyous voice immediately changed to worry and fear. \u201cWhat ar\u2014\u201d she started to mutter, but was immediately interrupted by Fang falling forward, stopping his decent ungracefully by stretching out his arms. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFUCK! What the hell are we still doing here, Jessica!? We should get the fuck outta here before that monster tears this city up!\u201d Fang yelled, attempting to get up and regain his balance. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, Tyler? Think you can go up against this giant fucker with a tank? In case you haven\u2019t noticed, he\u2019s fucking huge! God damnit, why are we here? I don\u2019t want to see this giant asshole jack off in front of me...\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFang, shut up. I heard someone this way, and we found Tyler.\u201d Jessica stammered. \u201cWe need to make sure survivors can get out, too, Fang. Remember, you promised me...\u201d She said, stating it almost as a matter-of-fact. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nFang just growled in response, but kept his big muzzle shut, clearly admitting defeat as everything shook around them. \u201cLook, David is here, too. I\u2019m so glad you two are okay. But what are you guys doing here with a tank?\u201d  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTyler sighed and leaned back against the tank, signaling to David to come lean against it as well. \u201cDavid and I were caught up in something,\u201d Tyler started, raising a hand to point at the giant roo in the distance. \u201cLong story short, we are kinda the reason why Marcus here is des\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!?\u201d Fang exclaimed, dumbfounded. Jessica looked equally surprised. \u201cThat... THING is Marcus? What. The. Fuck!?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cLook! Fang, Jessica, we\u2019ll tell you more along the way, but you\u2019re right that we need to get out of here,\u201d Tyler said, just as the soldier joined the brothers at the side of the tank. \u201cCan you help us out?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try,\u201d Jessica said, somewhat in a worried voice. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to find a way to get out of the neighborhood for a while now, but since the recent devastation, we can\u2019t find a clear path out.\u201d  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cEverything is covered in this fucker\u2019s jizz. Hell, he\u2019s even flooded some areas that are now almost impossible to pass. There's almost nowhere to go.\u201d Fang said, calming down a bit from his earlier outbursts. \u201cDoes the tank still work? Maybe we can plow through the debris?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNegative, son,\u201d the soldier said sternly. \u201cNavigation is shot, and the control panel doesn\u2019t work except for firing the special weapon on board.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of weapon? Can it be used against Marcus?\u201d Jessica said, pointing back at the roo as well.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThe giant kangaroo? No, unfortunately it\u2019s not set-up correctly to help us in any way. The other tanks need to be set as well before I can fire this one...\u201d the soldier said, trailing off. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWait, this tank has the ability to grow and shrink as well?\u201d David said, incredulously.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYes, all the tanks we brought in did,\u201d said the soldier. \u201cJust in case the others went out, but we all needed the dead switches set to shrink or grow in order to work. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think we can assure that right now. We might be the only survivors from the battalion...\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDamnit!\u201d yelled out Tyler. \u201cWhat can we do now?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c... you said you know that giant?\u201d the soldier asked. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we all go to the same school,\u201d replied Fang. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIs there a way you can talk him down from doing all this destruction?\u201d the soldier asked, furrowing his brow as he did so. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, we tried before when we had the size ray gun and failed. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to do that again. But even if we could, how can we reach him or talk to him at this point now? He\u2019s too big!\u201d David said. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThen I have an idea, but this is a huge risk. I need one of you to talk to the giant kangaroo and distract him for a moment while I rewire the tank to overpass the growth setting and switch it to shrink. But in order to do this, you\u2019ll have to be as big as him, if not bigger to make sure he doesn\u2019t overpower you if he decides not to play nice.\u201d said the soldier, making his way up the tank. \u201cSomeone will have to get a running start in front of the tank as I prepare the shot to grow them. But keep running so you don\u2019t accidentally squish us from behind! If I power this up enough, they should grow big enough to charge him and take him down.  The rest of you will stay here with me in the tank, since this is likely the only safe place to be in right now.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis was ridiculous, Tyler thought. We can\u2019t have two giants running about... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI volunteer!\u201d exclaimed Fang. \u201cI\u2019ll teach the bastard a lesson for destroying my home! Motherfucker thinks he\u2019s all tough because he was artificially grown to be what he is, but he\u2019s not me! I\u2019m all natural! You\u2019ll always be smaller than me, Marcus, AND YOU CAN\u2019T BEAT THAT!\u201d Fang began yelling out in rage. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFang, stop. Egomaniac much...Look, maybe Tyler or David should do this?\u201d Jessica said, patting fang on his back to calm him down.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can. Tyler\u2019s messed up from our earlier ride in the tank, and I\u2019m beat from the ride we just had,\u201d said David, sitting down on the ground. \u201cMaybe you can do it?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMe?\u201d Jessica exclaimed. \u201cWhy should I do it? I mean, we dated before...\u201d she said, trailing off as she looked back at Marcus pushing his thick member further into the ground, causing her to blush deeply. \u201c... briefly. But not anymore. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d listen to me. And I also don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to fight him if he got violent.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you can sway him your way?\u201d David replied. \u201cYou always get along with everyone, Jess, you\u2019re like the party girl that everyone likes to hang out with. Maybe you can make him see it your way if you try.\u201d  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut before Jessica could reply, a gigantic earthquake struck the group. Marcus had just plunged his cock halfway into the Earth and was releasing his pent-up lusts. The ground below them began to crack and break as white geysers started popping up around them, shooting Marcus\u2019s newly released hot spunk high into the air. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFuck, we don\u2019t have much time! We need to do something!\u201d Fang yelled, once again falling over the unstable ground. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOut in the horizon, Marcus was removing his shaft from the ground and fondling himself, apparently basking in the afterglow of his recent orgasm. The group was still attempting to stabilize themselves when Marcus took hold of his cock in front of him with both paws, still turgid between his hands, and gave it a few strokes. Its size was simply mind blowing, Tyler thought. It clearly reached across the city and was now looming over the group! Just how big was he? <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t good! Quick, we need to grow someone and stop him!\u201d the soldier yelled out from the tank, while a bright light emanated from the barrel as he was powering up a shot. Not soon after the soldier gave his command, Marcus\u2019s gigantic shaft was lifted up into the air, settling vertically against the giant roo\u2019s muscular and well-toned body. His presence took up the group\u2019s entire view as he gave his massive cock head a teasing lick before letting it go. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHE\u2019S PLANNING TO SLAM IT ON US! WE NEED SOMEONE IN FRONT OF THE TANK, NOW!\u201d The soldier yelled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWithout waiting for anyone else to say anything, the one who jumped up to run in front of the tank was... </span></div></div>",

There wasn\u2019t much room to run through due to all the debris, but the fox was now committed to this plan. She just hoped it would work... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nA surging energy suddenly struck her on the back as she was just clearing a light post. In the blink of an eye, her body felt as if she was suddenly catapulted into the air, despite her feet still touching the ground before her as she ran. There was a brief moment of tight constriction around her being as her clothes were torn to shreds, leaving her completely exposed to the elements as they fell to the ground. Her line of sight started to shift higher and higher in spurts, while the obstructing debris she was reflexively trying to avoid suddenly disappeared below her. She had no frame of reference for exactly how fast she was growing, since everything around her was pretty much leveled and she wasn\u2019t going to bother to look back at the tank since she was told to keep running, but all she knew was that Marcus in front of her was still bigger. In a matter of seconds, she felt she must have covered a lot of good ground, since now it appeared that Marcus was just a few strides in front of her. However, so was his descending dick and she hadn\u2019t prepared for that. Tossing her arms up in a resisting stance while running, she hopped that she might be able to withstand the blunt force of his giant member like this... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTHWACK! Marcus\u2019s cock managed to break through Jessica\u2019s outstretched arms and struck her over the head, knocking her out momentarily. The momentum from her legs kept her body going, though, and she eventually found herself slipping right up against the underside of Marcus\u2019s monstrous member as the paws from below her left the ground. But all the while that was happening, Jessica\u2019s growth continued on and she quickly grew past Marcus\u2019s length as she landed hard on her back, sliding butt first into Marcus. The impact of the arctic fox threw off Marcus\u2019s focus on his prick for a moment as the titans found their bodies clumped together and dragged backwards across the ground due to Jessica\u2019s momentum. Thinking quickly, Marcus poised his powerful legs against the ground and grabbed Jessica\u2019s hips for support to slow their bodies down. The large paw pads on his feet skidded across the ground as their momentum carried them backward, kicking up a tremendous dust cloud around them that obstructed Marcus\u2019s view. Finally, Jessica\u2019s growth slowed to a stop as Marcus brought their bodies to a stop as well, the vixen\u2019s head and body still in a daze from the hit she just took. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShaking his head and clearing the dust before him with a few swipes from his hands, Marcus regained his composure to look at what had just struck him. As the dust settled, he noticed the outline of a giant laid before him. A giant that appeared to be even bigger than he was! As more dust settled, Marcus could make out the glimmer of snow white fur that covered the giant, eventually showing the body of a voluptuous vixen. Her curvaceous body laid spiraled before him, her legs parted against the giant roo as evident by their crash. Looking down, Marcus saw that his cock rested comfortably over her mons and stretched up against her tight, flat belly. Looking further up still, the curvy creature was sporting a busty set of perky white breasts that looked tantalizing to the roo. Her form looked magnificent, and her pink hair flowed... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWait... Jess?\u201d Marcus said, suddenly realizing the pink dyed hair. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWha-? Who?\u201d responded Jessica, as she stirred from her dizziness. She attempted to raise her body up with her arms, but immediately felt light headed as she struggled to lift her torso. She appeared to not be used to her new size just yet, and she lacked some motor control as she had difficulty lifting just her head to attempt to see Marcus. Unfortunately, her bosom also made it all the more difficult to see the roo as her breasts obstructed her view. Did her tits grow bigger relative to the rest of her body? When she finally managed to peer over her massive bust, Jessica finally got to see all of Marcus. He actually seemed to be smaller than her, which was good as that was intended for the plan to progress. In fact, if she had to guess, Marcus looked to be a little over half her size, his muscular and well toned body dwarfed by the size of her thighs alone, which were spread out before him. However, looking down below the roo\u2019s boyish hips, Jessica saw something that was much larger than she would have imagined possible on a male. His cock was monstrously big compared to the rest of his body, appearing to be more of a third appendage than anything else as it laid over Jessica\u2019s sex. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMa-Marcus? Marcus, listen to me, you-\u201d she began before Marcus suddenly jumped over her hips with his powerful legs and landed over her stomach. To Jessica\u2019s surprise, the impact of the roo didn\u2019t much bother as he appeared to be light compared to her. However, Marcus\u2019s junk now laid further on top of her, with his thick and lengthy mast landing directly between her plump breasts. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cJess? Did the pipsqueaks down below send you? Hm. How thoughtful of them...\u201d He said, appearing to trail off in his thoughts as he crossed his arms. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMarcus... look, I need you to stop what you\u2019re doing, okay? Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve just done? You\u2019ve destroyed the city!\u201d Jess yelled out to the kangaroo, attempting to veer her eyes away from his massive member. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. This is what the pipsqueaks below want, Jess! That\u2019s why David and Tyler have been growing me so much,\u201d Marcus said joyously, swinging his tail side to side in an excited manner. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not just them that want this. The rest of the city wants this as well. They\u2019ve made me their new god!\u201d He exclaimed, flexing himself to show off his new muscular body to the vixen. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMarcus, that\u2019s not true. People have been evacuating the city since you started rampaging about. Entire areas have been decimated and people have likely lost their lives! Don\u2019t you care about that?\u201d Jessica said remorsefully, hoping to get through to him by emotion. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to care if I\u2019m this big. Why do you think I\u2019ve been growing so much? They\u2019ve been firing at me with these weird ray guns and tanks, appeasing me.\u201d Marcus said, turning back to look at Jessica with dreamy looking eyes. \u201cAnd now I see they want to appease me with more offerings... well, I accept eagerly!\u201d He said cryptically. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Confused by that last message, Jessica was about to respond when Marcus made a motion with his body that allowed him to hop back to his original position between the vixen\u2019s legs. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve done this, huh, Jess?\u201d Marcus said, grabbing hold of the Vixen\u2019s legs with both arms, spreading them to either side of the kangaroo\u2019s body. \u201cI bet it must look kinda weird to see me like this, but I gotta ask...\u201d he said, motioning down to his already rock-hard cock over below him with a nod, \u201cHave you handled something THIS big before?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMarcus gave his lips a quick lick as he backed away and used one of his paws to grab his massive prick and slapped the top of Jessica\u2019s mons with it as if to demonstrate his meaning. Precum already started to leak on top of the white vixen\u2019s lower abdomen as Marcus continued to show off his size. Jessica herself remained motionless as the kangaroo continued to touch, rub, and grab about her, not knowing exactly what to do. At some level, she felt she needed to fight back against Marcus in order to stop this. But somewhere deep inside of her, she also did not want this to stop. The smell of the kangaroo\u2019s musk permeated in the air, and it drove her insane with excitement. Perhaps she can distract him like this without losing too much integrity and allowing the others to rewire the tank... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile Jess was having this internal debate with herself, Marcus began aligning his gargantuan shaft with Jess\u2019s tight and tender folds. He rubbed against her clit to test her response, and sure enough the vixen\u2019s larger body gave an earthquake sized shiver. Giving a devious smile, the mischievous roo began grinding his cock against the vixen\u2019s sex to start the juices flowing. Within no time, Jessica was moaning in delight as the kangaroo was dry humping her, similarly grunting as pre-cum was spurting out from his cock in large quantities all over the fox. Soon, Jessica\u2019s mons were slick with the mixed juices of the kangaroo and herself, and the need inside of her was burning with an intensity that only could be quelled with a tool as magnificent as Marcus. Spreading her legs further, Jessica began to rub and pinch one of her nipples from her large breasts, while the other hand reached down to spread her labia. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJessica couldn\u2019t believe what she was doing. She felt completely lost in her lusts, as her mind and body were giving in to her basic needs rather than formulating an actual plan to stall Marcus. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t think of anything clearly enough to help her out in this situation, but she knew she could at least distract him for a while like this. Fuck it, she though. \u201cJust take me, Marcus. Let me feel you... let me feel the touch of a god...\u201d she panted out.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMarcus immediately stirred from those magic words and his body reacted vigorously as he realigned himself again to Jess\u2019s slick folds. Pushing his hips forward moderately, Marcus was met with resistance as even their fluids seemed to barely help in allowing him to enter Jess. Grabbing just below the tip of his crown, Marcus once again guided his prick to Jess\u2019s soft entrance, teased it up and down her opening, and pushed until the resistance finally gave in and he managed to slip by.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJess could feel the mass of Marcus\u2019s masculine flesh throbbing greatly with arousal, the large organ longing to be sheathed within the welcoming depths of the giantess vixen. Giving in to his body\u2019s demands, Marcus made his advance forward, making sure to enjoy each tug and pull he felt as Jess moaned in ecstasy at being stretched and filled. Eventually, he managed to hilt himself within the fox, surprising himself a bit as he didn't manage to make this happen with his make-shift hole from earlier. The vixen herself, though, looked like she was in high heaven with her tongue lolling out. Her once tight abdomen distended slightly as Marcus\u2019s member settled comfortably inside of her where it ended below her belly button. Every throb of his member sent shivers up her spine as her walls quaked with the stretching he was giving her. It was all so surprising just how large he was and how that she managed to take all of him, yet his body was so much smaller than hers.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nOf course, not allowing Jess to get used to this feeling too soon, Marcus began to slowly retreat from her warm entrance until he was about half way out and proceeded to stuff himself back in at a moderate pace. The regular thrusts of Marcus soon sent shockwaves of pleasure shooting through her body, making her legs almost instinctively close around the much smaller roo to make sure he wasn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. Thrilled that he seemed to be satisfying the vixen greatly, Marcus took hold of her succulent hips once more with his hands and began to piston his huge cock deep inside of her over and over again. Jessica cried out in delight due to the new motions, his cock coaxing more and more fluids to help it move easily into the lovely fox. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWorking in tandem with Marcus\u2019s exertions, his seed swollen balls were already at work making fresh batches of sperm for his next inevitable release, each one similarly stimulated from being slapped against Jessica\u2019s magnificent buttocks. Marcus couldn\u2019t believe that the pipsqueaks down below not only wanted to worship him like a god, but they also wanted him to have a goddess in which he could share his ambition, his passion, and his lusts with. The thought of it all intensified the swelling pressure building inside of him, but he didn\u2019t want to finish this too quickly. \u201cHey Jess,\u201d Marcus grunted, slowing down his bucking hips for a bit, \u201cFlip on your side, let\u2019s try something new.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJessica, despite still being wary of her own body, did as he said and managed to flip her entire body on her side after Marcus pulled himself away from her. Mounting her bottom leg, Marcus hugged his muscular arms around the other leg and managed to lift it up such that it was leaning up against him while it slunk down over his shoulder. She felt very heavy, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop him from continuing their heated session. Realigning himself once more, Marcus drove his length once again within the vixen and began pounding away with renewed vigor.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJessica moaned in pleasure as she was impaled again and again against the kangaroo. However, she soon noticed that something felt different in this new position as Marcus continued his exertions. She felt fuller than when she was on her back, and she could swear that Marcus seemed to be reaching a bit deeper than before. Looking back to Marcus past her heavy breasts, she could make out the clear outline of Marcus\u2019s cock extend and retract from inside of her just above her belly button. She was lost in awe at the revelation. Did her growth change her body in more ways than she thought? She definitely didn\u2019t remember being able to take things that deep before. And was Marcus getting bigger inside of her? Or was he just getting bigger in general? If the last proved true, this could spell trouble for her if the others don\u2019t rewire the tank soon... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFuck, Jess, you\u2019re amazing! I\u2019m not going to last much longer if you keep squeezing me so tightly... tell me babe, where do you want it?\u201d Marcus grunted with his eyes closed, apparently focused on keeping his rhythm going. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJessica didn\u2019t anticipate this as she was brought back to reality from all the pleasure she was feeling. At his size, Marcus could easily flood the rest of the city, even if he came all over her. But if she held on, she could at least save the others by keeping Marcus\u2019s outburst within her. But would she comprise her own body for this? She was glad at least she was on birth control, but she never did it raw with Marcus before, and she wasn\u2019t entirely sure if she would be all in for it... <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m getting c-close, Jess. Where d-do you want it?\u201d Marcus stuttered, slowing his thrusting almost to a stop. Jess could feel the pent-up pressure in his prick as it throbbed, clearly waiting on her command on where to release himself. Thoughts raced through her mind as she frantically tried to figure out what to do. Then, she decided. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cM-Marcus,\u201d she gasped in deep breaths, tensing her body for what was about to happen, \u201cI want you to finish...\u201d </span></div></div>",

His powerful physique looked all the more imposing at over a thousand foot tall, casting a shadow over the tiny buildings beneath him. David was enjoying himself at his new size, pulling a couple of poses as he smiled widely, flexing powerful muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shut the fuck up, David.\u201d huffed a tiny Tyler, his arms wrapped around a massive horn as he held onto the size-ray for dear life. \u201cIt was supposed to be me all gigantic.\u201d He felt a little sick from all the swaying, as the dragon\u2019s posing brought his head bobbing from left to right. <br>\r\n\u201cMight makes right, little bro.\u201d David purred, enjoying the shocked look on Marcus\u2019 face as he slowly advanced on the roo, heavy footpaws splintering the ruined earth beneath him and leaving wide craters. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m already used to being the biggest guy around, you\u2019d probably just go nuts like Marcus here and shove your cock where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right! Why don\u2019t I go get Fang, presuming that the massive murderous macropod hasn\u2019t squished him, and prove your little theory wrong? I bet he\u2019d love to tower over you two.\u201d snapped Tyler, looking at the fizzling size-ray, annoyed that he hadn\u2019t managed to fix it properly. Worse still, he was beginning to get a little sick at this altitude, but there wasn\u2019t really anywhere safe to sit down and repair the infernal contraption while there were two titans trashing the city... at least David seemed to be relatively calm about the whole thing, if a bit of a showboater, as per usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t even suggest bringing him into this.\u201d muttered David, thinking of all the ways <i>that</i> could go wrong. \u201cAnyway! Marcus, your time is up \u2013 I\u2019m gonna kick your ass for ruining my neighbourhood!\u201d Tyler squealed as his bigger blue brother launched himself at the roo, who was still caught with his proverbial pants around his ankles in the haze of his afterglow. With a startled cry, the sheer weight of the dragon pushed him deep into the ground, bedrock audibly cracking under the combined weight of the colossi. Marcus didn\u2019t stand a chance \u2013 with their sizes roughly equal, the defined musculature David had spent so long working on gave him the definite advantage, easily allowing him to pin the roo\u2019s massive, flailing paws beneath his bulk.<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, you squirm too much, might turn me on, big boy.\u201d purred the dragon, giddy with power as he easily dominated the giant. To think he had been worried about becoming paste on his paws just minutes ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross, David.\u201d spat Tyler, taking advantage of the relative stillness to wedge himself up against his brother\u2019s huge horn, fiddling with the size ray using dextrous claws. His tinkering had given him a basic idea of how the device worked, though it was still too advanced for his liking. Aligning electronic components and blowing debris off focusing crystals, Tyler snapped the casing back on and watched the ray gun flicker into activity.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can\u2019t a big guy enjoy himself? You best watch out, or I might decide to have a little fun with you, pipsqueak. Gotta say, I'm finding this is a lot more enjoyable than before.\u201d Replied David, a wide toothy grin across his face as he watched the marsupial squirm uncomfortably beneath him, limbs digging into the debris all around him.<br>\r\n\u201cYou best hope you fix that goddamn thing soon.\u201d snarled Marcus, frothing with rage at having been thwarted so easily. \u201cBecause I\u2019m still growing, and it won\u2019t be long until the tables are turned once again... and I won\u2019t take it slow, little man. I\u2019m gonna <i>griiiiind</i> you into the dust. It\u2019ll feel good against my cock like the rest of you tinies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roo grunted with pain as David wrenched his arm uncomfortably, pushing him back into the ground. The giant roo strained against him, his growing mass proving ever more difficult to pin to the ruined earth...<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, Tyler, hurry the fuck up... or hey, maybe you could give me another shot of the hyoogeness!\u201d laughed the giant dragon. He turned his head as he heard a blast of energy sizzling behind him, as the balance of power altered once again...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The titanic marsupial snarled in rage as he squirmed and writhed beneath David. The cerulean dragon kept one of Marcus's arms curled painfully tight behind his back, while straddling the roo and using one of his knees to hold the other arm down. Marcus's face was groind into the earth below, snarling lips, nose and chin tearing into the cement and an unfortunate cluster of strip malls as David used his free arm to press the kangaroo's head down into the ground. Despite Marcus's continued growth, leaving him roughly 1200 feet tall to David's 1000, the dragon still kept the roo firmly held in place thanks to his superior musculature and positioning (not to mention a bit of grappling knowledge from a year of wrestling in high school). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately despite David's pinning of the monstrous marsupial, Marcus's flailing legs and tail still continued to decimate the city as they kicked and smashed futilely out behind him in hopes of forcing David to release him. Worse still for Marcus was when he started to notice his legs and tail weren't reaching any new buildings as they continued their 'tantrum'... and a few moments later it dawned on him that they werent stretching outwards anymore, quite the opposite in fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA panicked yelp anger and worry escaped his lips as Marcus redoubled his efforts to squirm his way free of his captor, but with his diminishing size and strength, it only became easier for David to hold onto him. His runt of a brother must have gotten the damn ray gun fixed! Within moments he was no longer even the same size as the dragon holding him down, and his shrinking only seemed to be increasing in speed as he felt David's meaty paws expanding and thickening in their grip around his forearm and the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n900 feet dwindled down to 800... then 600... soon Marcus wasn't even half of David's size and still shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! we got him!\" David roared triumphantly, as he felt his captor dwindling down to child size, and soon even smaller, beneath him. The massive drake released Marcus's arm from his grip, relying on the paw on his head and knee on his arm to hold him in place as he gave a celebratory smack onto the roo's ass to taunt him. \"Looks like you're gonna be a 'puny mortal' like the rest of us soon again, eh, squirt?\" David teased, causing the purple dragon on his head to roll his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was not one to give up without a fight, however. Using the opportunity of David's distraction, he jerked his pinned arm forward, able to quickly squeeze it out from beneath David's knee thanks to its diminished size. Doing the same with his head he pulled himself out from under the towering titan of a dragon, who now was a good 4 times his size (and growing). Using the powerful legs his species was known for, he leapt to his feet and took off at a dead run down the street. Each stride covered less and less distance, as the 200 foot and still shrinking Marcus frantically ran to try to escape the towering titan his rival had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid, however, simply blinked in confusion as he watched the kangaroo slip free and run off. Despite his brother Tyler's desperate yells for him to give chase, David, however, simply shrugged, and with a thunderous quake that shook through the city, crashed back onto his ass in the ruins of where Marcus had been tearing up the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why bother? hes gonna shrink back to normal, right? Not like he can cause any more trouble. We can go get him later. After all this nonsense I'm pooped!\" David rumbled, glancing upwards as if trying to see his brother atop his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why bother?! he destroyed half of downtown! god knows how many people he hurt or killed! There's people drowning in his jizz over there!\" Tyler yelled out frantically. David felt something ever so slightly shifting through his hair, and soon saw a small purple speck sliding down between his eyes to step out onto his muzzle. Turning back to face the enormous wall of his brother's face, and the two gigantic eyes now staring down crosseyed at him, Tyler continued. \"Marcus tried to kill us, and DID kill a bunch of other people! he stole my size ray, and could've done much worse if he wanted! He could've taken over the town, or even the country at that size! hell nothing short of a nuke probably would have hurt him, or you for that matter at this size!\" the little purple 'bug' ranted atop David's muzzle. If David didn't know better, he'd swear Tyler sounded almost jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now both of them had lost sight of the shrinking roo, who had disapeared around the corner of a set of buildings, now easily small enough to hide behind them. Not that David seemed worried. David simply shrugged, maw opening in a loud yawn that rumbled through the air around him. to be frank, he kind of enjoyed being so big. Able to feel the ground beneath him shaking and cracking with even his slightest movement. feeling concrete and pavement torn apart under his touch as if nothing more than sand. He could almost understand how Marcus could have gone so power mad. It was intoxicating. Before he could ruminate too much on it though, Tyler chimed in while raising the size ray to aim between David's eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get you back down to size, and try to get out of here before anyone pins this on us!\" The purple dragon called out to his over-sized sibling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blinked a bit, before...</span></div></div>",

This is beyond stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a very nice thing to say to the guy literally holding your life in his hands\" he teased before jostling the purple drake causing him to lose track of the ray gun and nearly making his stomach flip over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile a 50 foot kangaroo was frantically darting around the remaining structures and debris of his romp, desperate to stay hidden from a pursuit that wasn't coming. \"Those little shits! That uppity wind bag thinks he can treat me like that?! ME?!\" Marcus seethed, his ego staying quite inflated unlike his size. \"I swear if they try and pull this shit again...,\" but the roo's ranting trailed off when he was overcome by a familiar feeling. With a warmth and an audible stretch a wicked smile came over Marcus as he realized his fury had somehow reinvigorated his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack downtown the massive blue dragon was still amusing himself by playfully tormenting his flea of a brother. Tyler was less than thrilled with his situation though, his brother may not be a monster like Marcus was but he was well on his was with this behavior, and the rising testament to his enjoyment jutting from his crotch was something he could do without. Both brother's were shortly distracted however by the thud's of an approaching Marcus, and eventually the roo himself as he stood at the opposite end of main street, like an outlaw just waiting to mow down the heroic sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not had enough I see, huh little guy?\" David taunted the 100 foot Marcus as he placed his little brother back atop his snout for safe keeping. \"Someone should have beat some sense into you a long time ago, but I guess I'll just have to do it.\" In a burst of speed that betrayed his size the dragon had pinned his opponent, only a tenth his size, under his knee like it was nothing. Marcus however didn't seem the least bit concerned as he just let himself be overcome with pent up rage before, once more with an audible stretch accompanied by the cacophonous crunch of reshaping bones, he began to expand rapidly. His body radiated heat while he doubled in size, and despite the fact he still dwarfed his now 200 foot teammate, the dragon couldn't help but back off at the powerful display. The fact someone as hotheaded as Marcus had found a way to tie his growth to his anger instinctively petrified David. Sure he'd already caused a litany of destruction and terror, but the imagined threat of what was very possibly to come had the potential to make that into child's play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you understand your place again,\" Marcus sneered, knowing that despite the fact he was a fifth the dragon's size he currently held all the power. \"Now because I'm such a benevolent god I'll give you a choice, you can suck it now,\" he crudely pointed to a rising erection, fueled by domination, \"Or if you'd prefer I can grow and grind you to dust, as promised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash of remembrance David recalled the ray and found his tension somewhat abated \"Nice bluff pipsqueak, but all it'll take to send you packing is one last shot from the size gun, Tyler give it to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DIPSHIT!\" he yelled at his colossal brother from his perch, \"If you weren't such a greedy moron that'd be an option, but you made me lose it again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...uhh...\" David stammered, the wind entirely let out of his sails in one fell swoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like that's not happening, is it boys? Well then let's get down to business, David get you ass over here,\" Marcus barked, \"and don't take to long, you <i>really</i> don't wanna piss me off. Unless of course you'd rather try and handle my cock when it's twice your size!\"</span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath as he savoured the feeling... but noticed something odd. As Marcus opened his eyes to view the prize that was his city, his new plaything, he saw that it was growing around him... or perhaps he was shrinking.<br>\r\n\u201cAw, fuck.\u201d rumbled the giant roo, feeling distinctly nauseous as he withered back down to a more appropriate size. \u201cTyler, David, you better not be thinking about picking that ray back up...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the aforementioned purple drake was already clutching the silvery ray in his claws, dashing madly away from the giant with his bigger brother in tow. Though he was shrinking, he still had 80 foot in height to lord over the two, who rapidly disappeared behind a neighbourhood house. <br>\r\n\u201cCOME OUT TO PLAY, FUCKERS!\u201d snarled the roo, barging through the house in a storm of dust and debris, spotting the blue and purple specks against the green of the lawn before they were obscured by the battle scars. Now at sixty feet tall, Marcus was beginning to lose the advantage of his lofty viewpoint, but powerful paws bounded in the direction of the brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, next time you get a fucking size ray, can you just keep it to yourself?\u201d snarled David, tackling Tyler out of the way of a massive furred footpaw as it slammed into the dirt beside them. The roo growled like a chainsaw, his booming voice heard all over the neighbourhood. \u201cIf you want to be a big guy, just get some stilts, or a hot air balloon, maybe do some crunches, just something that doesn\u2019t threaten our lives!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot the time, David!\u201d snapped Tyler, pointing a clawed finger at the incoming marsupial, who had spotted the pair scampering beneath his titanic toes. With a loud thud, Marcus\u2019 heavy paws slapped down either side of the brothers, and he looked down at the pair from over a set of imposing organs dangling over their heads. <br>\r\n\u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll hit me with that growth ray again. NOW!\u201d roared Marcus, reaching a hand down to trap Tyler and David. The two dragons ducked and weaved between the rapidly diminishing paws, as Marcus shrank down to the much more manageable size of thirty feet. His large tail whipped out as the drakes ran behind him, lashing at Tyler and tripping him face-first into the dirt, size ray spilling from his arms and landing softly on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler!\u201d cried David, bracing himself as he interposed himself between the looming roo and his brother lying prone on the ground.  Marcus lingered at an imposing ten feet, launching himself bodily at the sizeable dragon and slamming him out of the way with his sheer bulk. With a groan, the dragon picked himself up and nursed an injured arm, charging after Marcus as he bent down to scoop up the size ray, face lighting up with a wicked grin as he began to turn it on himself. Matched for height with the cobalt dragon bearing down on him, delight turned to shock as a muscular arm reached out to grab at the silvery device, beginning a tug of war between the two football players. Neither quite able to overpower the other, the two were deadlocked until out of the blue, Tyler leapt screaming at the size ray, grasping it clumsily and dragging it to the ground with him with a sickening crunch. All three anthros stared at the broken ray as a blast of red energy illuminated the devastated lawn, craterous kangaroo pawprints marking Marcus\u2019 passing and bits of house decorating the lawn. As the red beam washed over the assembled crowd...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

David reached out a muscular paw and pinned the marsupial\u2019s arms behind his back, wrestling him to the ground.<br>\r\n\u201cYou leave him alone, you fucking monster!\u201d snarled David, tacking Marcus, who had returned to his previous, moderately impressive height of 6\u2019 6\u2019\u2019. His musculature, and most notably his once-imposing cock and balls were back to normal, leaving the meaty blue dragon quite capable of wrestling the roo to the ground as he looked up to his smaller brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, looked up? Dug into the purple dragon\u2019s bruised and battered hide were shards of metal and crystal, the latter glowing ominously as the sunlight glinted off it. Tyler seemed relatively calm despite the lacerations and foreign objects wedged into him, as he stretched out his arms and took a deep breath in, closing his eyes peacefully.<br>\r\n\u201cOooooooohh... yesssss!\u201d hissed Tyler, as the struggling pair on the ground watched the scrawny dragon grow from five foot to ten, from ten foot to twenty, from twenty to fourty... his rapidly expanding paws bumped into the pair, who scrabbled to their feet and took a few hasty steps backwards. Tyler\u2019s face was the very picture of pleasure, a wide toothy grin spreading from ear to ear. His cock, normally impressive for his insignificant size, was positively monolithic at his new lofty bearing, quickly becoming erect and casting a shadow over the two fellow football players. It wasn\u2019t just the enjoyable tingling of growing, but also the knowledge of sheer domination that turned Tyler on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, yes... yes!\u201d purred Tyler, eagerly looking at all the new toys he had to play with \u2013 in particular, Marcus and David. As he crested 80 feet, the dragon snatched up the two between his claws, looking at the pair nestled in his palm with eager anticipation.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, guys, I think Marcus had it all wrong.\u201d Grumbled Tyler, his deep, booming voice shocking the two jocks \u2013 they never expected scrawny little Tyler to sound so savage and intimidating! \u201cAll these buildings to play with, all these cars to crush... well, that\u2019s maybe a little cruel for my liking when I have the only toys i want to play with right here. Two muscle-headed jackasses who thought there was nothing funnier than teasing and torturing a shrimp like me... well, the tables have turned, but don\u2019t you worry, my runty little friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, I\u2019ll go easy on you. You\u2019re my brother, after all. My brother who would never make fun of me, who would gladly repay the cash he owes me, who would never pin me to the ground and make me scream Uncle...\u201d Tyler\u2019s massive frame impacted against the ground with a large, rumbling THOOOM as dust kicked up and his lashing tail cracked a few trees. Now soaring to a mighty 200 feet and still growing, Tyler brought the pair to crotch height, almost lost amongst the titan\u2019s paws. Plucking David gingerly from his palm with dextrous claws, he poked and prodded him under his weighty sac, enjoying the tiny figure wriggling against the sensitive, leathery skin far too much. <br>\r\n\u201cDavid, relax! I mean, I thought you were the well hung one? Surely little Tyler's balls aren\u2019t so imposing?\u201d laughed Tyler with a wicked sneer, bringing Marcus closer to that awe-inspiring cock with claws clamped tightly around his prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, on the other hand... this was supposed to be <i>my</i> show. <i>My</i> neighbourhood. <i>My</i> gargantuan rampage. You\u2019re not getting off so lightly!\u201d With a delicate hook of his claws, Tyler pushed the wriggling roo into the slit of his cock, Marcus\u2019 flailing sending a shiver of delight down the titan\u2019s spine. \u201cYou can sit there until you\u2019ve learned your lesson, small fry... but wait, there\u2019s more!\u201d As Marcus and David attempted to extricate themselves from their unfortunate situations, the scent of Tyler\u2019s heady musk lingering in the air and clouding their senses, they felt the increasing bulk of the rapidly growing dragon pin them further and further against the purple mass. Worse still for Marcus, he felt Tyler\u2019s colossal hand wrap around his intimidatingly-sized meat, the pressure crushing the air out of him as he flailed wildly, trying to get out as the giant moaned his pleasure and ran his paws delicately down his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the heavy balls trapping David moved with Tyler\u2019s intense stroking, the blue dragon managed to pop free and dart out from underneath. He ran along the length of Tyler\u2019s thickening legs, only stopping to turn his head and glance back at his brother\u2019s madness. Five hundred feet tall, the dragon was spilling over into yards and crushing houses unintentionally beneath his massive weight, barely even noticing the wood and concrete crack against him. Each twitch of his paws scraped wild gouges in the earth, sending dirt flying into the air as he pleasured himself greedily, surveying the tiny town beneath him as he kept growing and growing. Breathless with sheer pleasure, Tyler came close to the edge of his orgasm as he pummelled his mighty draconic rod, and Marcus along with it. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed David picking up a glimmering crystal from the ground, and through eyes rolling back in pleasure he noticed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pausing for a moment more, as if still in disbelief, he finally managed to exclaim, \"Fang!? <i>That</i> asshole!? Since when did you hang out with him!?\" David chuckled slightly and answered his younger brother in a softer,  more naive tone, \"Well, I thought that he'd....you know.....be less of a prick if I hanged out with him.\" Before Tyler could even reply to his brother, the two drakes were bombarded with a booming set of chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning their necks upward, they finally saw the mammoth Fang's head atop the black furred mountain. Smiling broadly at t he power coursing through him, Fang's chuckles started turning into booming evil laughs. Quickly eyeing David's house in front of him, the wolf-god was delighted to see the two drakes standing far below him. Raising his left arm proudly, the titanic wolf flexed his now-gigantic bicep. He chuckled again as it rose and pulsed with pure power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally deciding to speak, Fang's booming voice filled the air, \"Well well well.....if it isn't my good pal David.\" David sweated slightly when he heard this, and Tyler gripped the gun sheepishly. The titanic wolf continued as the drakes trembled, \"I just wanted to thank you for giving me what I've always wanted.\" The brothers turned to each other, somewhat confused. The wolf answered their silent question wickedly, \"Power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexing again, his muscles pulsed once more with more size and power than before, he was flexing even harder this time. His familiar chuckles continued once more, \"Ohhhh man,\" he shuddered with pride and pleasure, \"You have NO idea how good this feels...\" David turned to Tyler with a worried look on his face, but the younger drake refused to use the gun yet, fearful of the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling brave enough, Fang decided to take his first step, and as he raised his titanic foot, it soon came slamming down, shaking the neighborhood violently and shattering the nearby windows. An evil grin crept on his face, \"Look at me boys, jusssssst LOOK AT ME!\" His chuckles, as if part of a cycle, turned again into booming laughs. \"I! AM! A! GOD!\" The two brothers covered their ears in pain as Fang exclaimed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his laughter died down, and he faced Tyler with his sinister grin. The purple drake shuddered violently as Fang fixated his stare on him. \"But there's one thing missing.\" Both of them gulped, praying for a miracle. \"I want more.\" He said hungrily. It didn't take him long since his \"ascendance\" to realize just how it happened, and the gun was still presently in Tyler's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Tyler....be a good little boy, and give me what I want. If not....well.....\" He chuckled evilly as he pumped his body all at once, striking fear in the young boy's heart. \"I can always find someone who will.\" Fang was cocky, arrogant, and most of all, aggressive, and him being a mountain of pure muscular power didn't help to alleviate those qualities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of thoughts rushed through Tyler's head. Yet, much to David's utter terror, Tyler had already raised his arm, closed his eyes, and, sobbing as he did it, fired the gun directly at t he towering wolf. He prayed dramatically in his mind. Prayed and prayed over and over that the gun would shrink down this menace....</span></div></div>",

He grunted audibly as the sudden, strange tingling sensation filled him and breifly left him breathless. His eyes went wide as he felt a strange sensation remaniscent of standing in a fast moving elevator. He watched with a rapt expression of amazement as the floor seemed to stretch downwards beneath him, feeling his fingers spreading out wider and larger along the handle of the size ray. An involuntary grin spread over his lips as he raised his head and saw the door infront of him seemed to lower down along with everything else in the room, his tail starting to twitch and sway rapidly behind him as it fully dawned on him what was happening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis formerly miniscule 5 foot tal form was already stretching up past 5'6\u201d, then even further until he crested the 6 foot mark. He was the size of an average person now, and still growing! He noticed his clothes were growing with him, and debated with himself whether that was a good thing or not. On one hand... if it worked like he had hoped, he wasn't exactly going to be able to walk down to a normal clothes store to buy clothes for himself anymore... but on the other hand, he was almost disappointed that he couldn't live out one of his inner fantasies of outgrowing his own clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething suddenly dawned on him and he turned on his heel, and dashed his way back towards the bedrooms. Unable to help but giggle gleefully as he heard his previously all but inaudible footsteps making, if faint, audible thumps along the floor with each of his quick steps... and each one was louder than the last. By the time he reached his destination he had swollen almost to the 7 foot mark and found himself looking almost eye to eye with his target... the size chart that David insisted that they both keep. He looked down and almost burst out laughing at the sight of his own height mark he had made last month, the mark now barely level with the bottom of his chest, and still was stretching downwards, and when he rose his head back up to look straight ahead he blinked momentarily in confusion, before lowering it down a  bit to catch sight of David's current height mark<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was taller than his brother now. This time he did laugh, but instead of the usual soft murmur of a giggle, his voice came out as a deeper, almost rumbling growl of laughter, that surprised even him... and only made him laugh all the more. He watched as David's height mark began to sink lower and lower infront of him, soon Tyler's chin was taller than the doorframe he was staring at, and still he continued to grow. It was only when he felt a sudden, faint but growing pressure on his head did he realize he was now taller than the ceiling. His horns slowly digging into the drywall of the ceiling above him as he continued to inch higher and higher, having to start bending downwards as he outgrew the 8 foot tall ceilings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god... im taller than the ceiling, and still growing!\u201d he said aloud to noone in particular, then blinked and reached up to grab his throat. Was that his voice? It sounded so much deeper now! That fact only making him grin wider as he kept having to stoop lower and lower as he continued to grow, almost 5 minutes passing since he had shot himself with the gun before the effect finally began to wane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was practically down on his knees at this point to keep his head from just bursting through the ceiling above him. His shirt, pants and shoes all had expanded with him and each now would make David look almost as small wearing them as Davids clothes used to make Tyler look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10 foot, widely grinning purple dragon licked his lips hungrily as he looked down the hallway towards the living room, getting himself down on all fours to crawl back into the living room without banging his head again, and then picked up His sandals from beside the door. Carefully, he raised one of them up to hold it beside his now massive sneaker clad paw, and burst out laughing at the pitful size comparison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn! Talk about big feet\u201d he laughed to himself, before blinking when he saw David's boots. He quickly snatched one of them up and pushed it up against the bottom of his own foot, grinning as he saw his foot sticking out several inches longer than David's thick work boot did. \u201cMmm... Oh yes. Now who's the shrimp David?\u201d He rumbled aloud to himself, licking hungrily over his lips... before his eyes trailed back to the size ray still held in one of his paws. </span></div></div>",

Say, can I come next time?\u201d  He growled playfully and rose up into a kneeling position, his horns nearly grazing the ceiling, \u201cI think I got the right stuff, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared with disbelief at his towering brother, stammering incoherently for a few moments.  Tyler smirked and inched forward, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, you don\u2019t wanna bring your little brother to football with you?  Afraid that I might embarrass you in front of all your little friends?\u201d  He snickered, unable to help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid finally managed to speak, shaking his head, \u201cWhat the hell happened to you!?  How did you get so big!?\u201d  He could not stop staring at that behemoth of a drake that had been his little brother.  Sure, Tyler didn\u2019t possess the proportions that David had, but sheer height made him look even more imposing, in some way, despite still maintaining a relatively lean figure.  David couldn\u2019t believe it.  And beneath his disbelief was a curiosity, and jealousy at his brother\u2019s growth.  If Tyler could get so big, surely there must be a way for David to take some height for himself!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave his brother a smug look, before wagging his finger back and forth, \u201cTsk tsk, brother, I don\u2019t share my secrets with pipsqueaks like you!\u201d  He chuckled deeply at his brother\u2019s aggravated look, \u201cAnd don\u2019t start threatening me, because I think you and I both know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled deeply and slammed his palms to the floor, letting all of his weight crash to the carpet and shake the floor beneath David\u2019s feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026that I could probably kick your ass, now.  So run along and have your shower.\u201d  He smirked and winked, \u201cAnd maybe later I\u2019ll crank one out, since it sounded like you wanted to watch.\u201d  He gestured to his bulging groin, before grinning toothily, \u201cOooh, maybe we can shower together?  I\u2019d love to see if you\u2019re still the\u2026what do you call yourself?  The \u2018shower room monster\u2019?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question made David blush deep blue beneath his skin, but he simply growled and stamped a foot against the carpet, not about to be pushed aside, taunted and humiliated by his little brother.  He cracked his knuckles, \u201cYou\u2019re not so tough!  You\u2019re a damn beanpole, I\u2019m still the one with the muscle in this family!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was a bit surprised by this.  He took a moment to size up his brother, his eyes sweeping that muscular form, sweat-stained t-shirt and all.  Sure, his brother did have proportionally more power, but that didn\u2019t mean that he could contest a drake with a nearly 3 foot height advantage!  And by David\u2019s own admission, he was tired from playing all afternoon, and that would make him an easier target.  Tyler chuckled softly and crawled forward, giving his brother a rough shove, enough to slam him against the wall, \u201cYou wanna challenge me, pipsqueak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grinned toothily and leaned in close, before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler jerked forward, a deep snarl welling up in his throat despite the wide grin on his muzzle. The sound normally would have made David laugh if the old Tyler had made it at his normal size, but now it was deep, rumbling, and sounded genuinely threatening. His paws clasped together with David's as the blue dragon moved to meet his brother, interlocking fingers and shoving strength against strength. David's thick forearms and biceps bulged as he shoved his arms as hard as he could against Tyler's. His arms already were sore and burning from the effort, having long since been worn out from practice today, that already he was being forced back. This only seemed to further amuse and encourage Tyler, as he started to shove forward more and more, still down on his knees and slowly scooting forward as David had to take step after step backwards from the advancing purple dragon. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\u201cWhats the matter David, lil bro too much for you?\u201d he growled teasingly, licking hungrily over his lips as he reveled in the thought of him overpowering his brother. He was already heavily aroused by the situation, which David could clearly see from the bulge shoving against the front of his now larger brother's pants. He groaned out audibly as he struggled to match Tyler's strength, still continuing to slowly scoot backwards and loose more and more ground.  If he wasn't exhausted from working out today, he might have put up a good fight, and maybe even actually beaten Tyler despite his superior size, but with his exhaustion it was all he could do not to just immediately succumb to Tyler's shoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA direct match-up of strength was out of the question for David, so he had to think fast. He saw Tyler starting to dip forwards in a sudden shove, obviously trying to pin David back against the wall, and he saw his chance. He suddenly jerked his arms back and dipped down to ram his shoulder in against Tyler's thighs instead of trying to shove back, and that plus Tyler's forward momentum and new unwieldy weight sent him tumbling forward and smack his face on the wall, leaving a visible dent in it. Snarling from the sudden pain interrupting his 'triumph', Tyler turned his head back towards his brother just in time to see David leaping onto his back and using his weight to shove Tyler down to the ground. His knees dug into the small of Tyler's back, and he grabbed at one of Tyler's arms to twist it around behind his back, growling down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had been in this position so many times before. David holding him down to the ground, one arm curled behind his back, twisted up high enough that if he squirmed it just pulled the muscle of his arm and shoulder socket painfully. Granted, Now David was struggling to hold one of Tyler's arms with both of his, whereas before David easily could have held Tyler with one. Regardless of the specifics, Tyler was trapped. He was much, much bigger than he had once been, and significantly larger than David, but even that wasn't enough to lift the heavy, muscular dragon up off of his back just from the size increase's added strength alone. He was trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod damn it, David let me up right now!\u201d He snarled out, thrashing around and making David struggle to keep a hold on Tyler. He was still proportionately much weaker than David was, but his overall size made him strong enough to put up a challenge, not to mention his size made it unwieldy and difficult to keep him to the floor. \u201cI'm warning you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's enough of that you overgrown runt!\u201d He growled out as he twisted the arm a bit higher, causing Tyler to snarl out in discomfort and pain, his other arm reaching back to try to grab at David, though he was careful to keep himself out of reach. \u201cwhat happened to kicking my ass Tyler?\u201d He snarled out, unable to help himself but feel invigorated at putting someone almost 3 foot taller than him in his place, especially after Tyler had talked so much shit to him. \u201cNow, you calm the hell down, and tell me how you got so god damn big, got it? Then maybe ill let you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was far from calming down at this point. If anything he was just getting more riled up from his failure and the taunting. Tail lashing about behind him and body jerking back and forth, struggling to roll David of his back. Then when David asked about it, it seemed to hit him. The size ray! He glanced across the floor and saw it just a few feet away. Thankfully David had been far too busy trying to get his overgrown brother under control to notice the strange looking device. Quickly Tyler reached out to snatch the device up, and point it at himself, snarling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna see how I got so big?!\u201d He snarled out angrily... though unable to hide his expectant glee at what was to come next. Already imagining what David's face would look like. He used his thumb to shove the dial to the side to turn up the setting and held it up infront of his face, David blinking in surprise at the strange looking device. Tyler was done playing games, he was gonna put David in his place once and for all. If the 2x setting made him 10 foot...then turning it up to 5x would make him 50 foot tall...! there's no way David would be able to do anything to him then! \u201cWell fine then David, why don't you see firsthand!\u201d he practically roared out as he pulled the trigger, sending a bright beam of red light shooting from the barrel of the gun and smacking Tyler right in the face... rapidly sending that tingling energy through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Tyler didn't seem to realize was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The impact of the size rays blast, mixed with the unbalancing weight and grasp of his brother sent Tyler stumbling backwards, where a dull THUD vibrated through the house at his impact. David let Tyler go and rolled to the side just in time to not have Tyler land on him, and was quick to crawl atop the purple dragon, paws grasping at his shoulders to hold his enlarged brother down, using his weight to keep the 10 foot purple dragon pinned. Or at least. That's what he had been intending to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dull groan escaped Tyler's muzzle. As his body vibrated from the energy surging through every fiber of his being.  His body twitched as if involuntary electric shocks were surging through him... and it only took David a few seconds to realize Tyler's shoulders had become too wide for him to reach both of them at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Shit\u201d David Whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds Tyler's footpaws were shoved against the front wall of the house, while his head was smacking against the wall leading to the kitchen. His expanding thigh shoved the couch up against the entertainment center, knocking it over and causing the TV to crash down to the ground, shattering. His tail smashed against the far wall, tearing it open and flopping its expanding bulk into David's room, where its growing mass shoved his furniture further and further away. The kitchne wall broke down against Tyler's expanding head and shoulders, as the front wall smashed apart, leaving his expanding legs stretching out into the front lawn. And his growth was only speeding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloth covered expanse of Tyler's chest beneath David stretched wider and wider with each passing second, him able to actually feel the strands of fabric thickening beneath him as he rose higher into the air with Tyler's chest. The sounds of destruction rang through the air as by the simple act of enlarging Tyler's body was demolishing the house. The support structure started to wobble, and was finally destroyed when Tyler's arm swept over to better brace himself against the ground (thankfully smashing part of the roof away lest it collapse atop David), as they both found themselves exposed to the sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 foot was long gone now. 20 foot had disappeared beneath 30... then 50... by then the house was in ruins around Tyler, and still he was only growing faster. His legs stretched across the street and his arms smashed through the neighbors homes as they fought for more room, stretching out in all directions as the massive and growing purple dragon groaned in almost lustful bliss. David's Truck was smacked aside and sent rolling across lawns as Tyler's calf expanded past it and overtook its parking spot. The purple dragons feet had already crashed into the house across the street and still he grew larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat deep, rumbling voice, oh so familiar and at the same time filled with so much more raw power than David was used too rumbled through the air with increasing volume and bass. David could feel the 'ground' beneath him rumble with each sound Tyler made as his growing body stretched across the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finally slowed to a stop and the air seemed to still. A deep, thunderous chuckle welled up in Tyler's chest, causing David's perch to vibrate and shake, nearly unbalancing him, as the ground beneath him began to incline slightly. Tyler propped his torso up with his arms, grinning down at the miniscule speck of blue across the now enormous 500 foot purple dragon's chest. Tyler's teeth alone were bigger than David was. Hell, one of Tyler's barely defined pectorals was bigger than their whole house had been, and the Purple dragons shirt could cover half the block...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler couldn't believe what he was seeing and feeling. The entire neighborhood was spread out before him like a doll city. Hell, it was even smaller than that. He could fit an entire house in his hand, cars were barely bigger than pills to him... and David was little more than an ant sitting atop his now enormous Green Lantern t shirt. Were David's attention not focused on the enormous head of his overgrown brother, he'd see the massive train-shaming boner straining the front of Tyler's jeanshorts, as the sheer powerrush of his immense size aroused Tyler more than he had ever been before. He could actually FEEL the ground vibrate with every slight shift of his weight, feel the earth crunch and shift beneath his lightest touch, feel how the air seemed to vibrate with the deep bass of his voice... and see how terrified his now miniscule bug of a brother looked sitting atop his massive chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice thundered out with a thick, venomous glee. His tone mixed with a raw, insatiable powerlust that showed both his arousal both sexually and psychologically at the situation. Tone alone displaying his gratifying enjoyment of seeing his formerly big brother so miniscule before him, along with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow... About kicking your ass... LITTLE brother...\u201d He boomed, licking hungrily over his massive lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was gone. And in his place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTylerzilla had been born. </span></div></div>",

He was unsure whether Tyler was simply teasing him or was serious about trying to get him back for all the years of making fun of his short height, but he didn't want to stick around and find out. <br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds of listening to Tyler's booming laughter David snapped to his senses and scrambled to his feet, instantly starting to run to the side of his giant brothers body, having to jump over every wrinkle in that huge shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down and smirked, \u201cThat's right bug, start running. I'll even give you a head start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words only made David run faster, he would occasionally trip on the fabric beneath him in his haste to find some way out of this situation. Soon enough he reached the side of Tyler\u2019s body and started sliding down the shirt, gripping on loosely to slow his descent until he had to resort to climbing down the steep edge before dropping a relatively safe distance to the ground.<br>\r\nOnce he was back on the concrete he took one more look up at his giant brother and then continued his escape, running down the street and ducking into an alleyway between two buildings where he assumed Tyler wouldn't be able to see or reach him, giving him time to stop and catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit! What the hell is going on?! That can't be Tyler. It can't!\u201d David forcefully mumbled aloud to himself, still struggling to accept that any of this was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTIMES UP!\u201d Tyler's voice boomed across the area moments before the ground started to shake violently as he shifted and began rising to his feet, every simple movement ended up crushing cars, trees, and severely damaging buildings.<br>\r\nTyler looked around, taking in his new higher view of the city that lay around him, his head rising higher than most of the buildings.<br>\r\nWith another deep laugh he took a step forward, causing deep cracks in the concrete, \u201cFE-FI-FO-FUM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tremors had eased David took a look out of the alley and up into the sky, watching his brother move around like some sort of living mountain, he knew he wouldn't be safe here for much longer, even if Tyler didn't find him the devastation he was causing just by moving around could bring down the buildings around him, so he did the only thing he could, run.<br>\r\nDavid sped away as fast as his legs would carry him, even though he only had a short rest the adrenalin rush was enough to keep him going, he tried to keep out of sight as much as possible, keeping close to the edge of buildings, ducking into more alleys etc, his only thought was trying to get as far away from his brother, or even the city as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler on the other hand was taking his time, watching all the tiny people who had not yet evacuated the area try to flee, carefully scanning the crowd for any traces of David. He slowly walked around, each footfall thudded against the ground with the force of a small explosion, \u201cWhere are you David? I know you're here somewhere.\u201d</span></div></div>",

His back smacked against the far wall, the size ray clattering across the floor somewhere out of sight, and leaving the Diminutive little purple dragon groaning and rubbing a paw over the top of his head, where it had hit the wall <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw... what the hell...\u201d he groaned softly, legs shifting a bit as he rubbed over the bump now occupying the back of his head. Then blinked. He turned his head a bit and looked down to his paw, where it was shoving up against the side of the couch. The couch that was a good 6 or so feet away. What really made Tyler's eyes go wide was the fact that his sole was pushing against the side of the couch, and without him moving his leg, the couch was scooting further and further back across the floor. Whether it was from the smack to his head, or just sheer disbelief, it took Tyler a few moments to realize what was going on. He was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready he had to be over 8 foot tall, already taller than his already huge brother, and as he watched his leg shoving harder and harder against the couch he watched himself continue to expand. His back slid up along the wall behind him, and his tail started shoving against a small table set against the wall until its expanding bulk knocked the table over and sent the lamp on it crashing to the ground. 8 foot swelled to 9... then 10... 11...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW... what the hell?!\u201d Tyler yelped out in surprise, watching his surroundings visibly, and rapidly shrinking around him. Feeling the wall starting to bend slightly inwards just from his weight leaning against it. Feeling the couch shoved away from his legs with increasing ease just from the space they were trying to take up. He kept looking around in confusion for a few more seconds... before his lips and jaw split open into a wide, toothy grin. \u201cOh FUCK yea!\u201d He practically roared out, arms stretching outwards in excitement, only to have one smash against the far wall, leaving a visible dent in the drywall. This seemed to only further amused and even arouse Tyler, as he watched the living room shrink around him. It wasn't until his head smacked against the ceiling, that he started to rethink what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head just hit the ceiling. The 8 foot tall ceiling. While he was sitting down. That had to make him over 16 foot tall, and if anything he seemed to only be growing faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr... Uh oh... this could be bad\u201d He rumbled, blinking in surprise at the new, and still increasing deepness of his voice. His leg smashed the couch against the wall, his arms knocking pictures and lamps around, his tail shoving against the TV stand and causing it to crash down beside him. 18 foot... 20...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was just getting home from football practice, laughing aloud as he headed down the sidewalk, followed behind by the thick, meat headed wall of wolf that was Fang, and the smaller, more athletically built Kangaroo, Marcus.  The three of them laughed to each other as they chatted, heading for David's house and talking about how they could tease the shrimp today, before they paused mid step. They heard a strange rumbling as David's home started to shake visibly. The roof was warping upwards in an unusual manner, leaving the three of them staring in confusion, quickly replaced by awe and fear, as a massive, purple footpaw smashed through the front of the house, then a second one right beside it. Two lean and lanky (But from their sheer size, massive) arms tore from the sides of the house and then the roof cracked in half and slid dwon to either side of the house as a massive, purple fleshed draconian head tore through the top of the house, coughing out small bits of dust and plaster... David now sitting in the remains of his half destroyed home like some warped scene from Alice in Wonderland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive paw raised up, seeming uncaring as the movement of the arm tore apart more chunks of the house, as he waved that paw infront of his face to clear out some of the dust, before his eyes opened, and he glanced down at David and his two friends, who were staring up at him in horror and disbelief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT... Tyler?!\u201d David yelped out in suprise, staring up at the massive, now 50 foot dragon, who simply grinned widely when he heard his name mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there boys... Know how you always said I was too small to play with you guys?... well\u201d He licked almost hungrily over his lips. The house began to further crumble and fall apart around the now massive 'runt' of a dragon as he began to stand up, footpaws smashing down into the front yard, hard enough to send the three football players stumbling a bit, a dark shadow soon cast over the three of them as Tyler rose up to his full, massive 50 foot height above them. \u201cWell... I'd like to challenge that statement..\u201d He growled out almost ominously, as he stared down at David and his friends. </span></div></div>",

His tail tucked reflexively around one of his legs out of nervousness, suddenly unnerved as he saw the energy building inside the ray. He started to lower it down, having second thoughts, before rather abruptly the energy inside the ray peaked, and a thick blast of red light shot out of the barrel and smashed right into Tyler's chest. He felt like he had just been punched, and was sent stumbling backwards until his back smacked against the far wall, the gun dropping from his paws and clattering down to the ground, a tiny wisp of smoke raising up from the barrel of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt his body beginning to fill with a strange tingling flush, that spread from where the ray had hit him in the chest, and extended out through the rest of his torso and along his extremities. His eyes went wide and his lips curled into a triumphant grin as he felt that sensation running through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, Yes...! here we go!\u201d He growled out happily, staring down at his own body expectantly, ready for his legs to suddenly shred his shorts or his head to abruptly smack against the ceiling... he had no idea if his clothes were going to grow or not, and before he knew it he found himself mentally debating whether he hoped they would or not. Seconds turned into minutes, and Tyler started to snap out of his internal thoughts when he began to realize that tingling sensation was fading... and everything around him looked the same. He wasn't suddenly looking eye to eye with a door frame, his shirt hadn't split down the front or back, he wasn't smashing his way out of his house like some kind of growing Godzilla monster. He felt his earfins and tail wilt in disappointment, and glared down at the gun. \u201cGreat, what a rip off. Got my hopes up for some fancy looking plant fertilizer.\u201d He huffed out poutily, leg cocking back and carelessly kicking the gun across the floor, where it skidded underneath the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh he turned and made his way back to his bedroom, plopping himself down on the bed and starting to thumb through a comic book. He was still pissed about the ray. He had been so excited about it, even if it was such a silly and stupid thought. Really? A ray gun that made someone bigger or smaller? How gullible and desperate was he? He finished flipping through the comic then gave a depressed sigh, glancing over at the clock and seeing it blinking 8:30. David must still be out at the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew it. I'm going to bed, I'm sick of today\u201d he huffed aloud to noone in particular, before starting to undress himself. He threw his tennis shoes across the room near his desk, his shirt and pants ending up thrown into the middle of the room, and his underwear ending up draped across the back of his computer chair. Stark naked, he walked his way into the bathroom and took a quick, steamy shower to help relax him, before plopping himself back down in his bed in a fresh pair of underwear, curling up beneath the blankets and letting himself drift off to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Tyler hadn't been drying his hair with a towel when he walked past his bedroom door, and had seen that he was eye level with his current height-mark, the one that had been there for almost 2 years, at the 5 foot even mark. The little purple dragon, sprawled out underneath the thick heavy comforter, was slowly starting to stretch taller... swelling larger, fractions of inches at a time. It wasn't entirely his fault that he hadn't noticed... it was slow... at least for the moment. And, surprisingly, he wasn't the only thing that was growing. The small blue jean pants that he had been wearing, the loose fitting dark red T shirt he had on earlier, those snug fitting white briefs, and even the thick black tennis shoes that he had been wearing earlier all were ever so slowly starting to swell and increase in size just as Tyler was... ever so slowly expanding tiny percentages larger every minute... and Tyler was going to have quite the surprise to look forward too when he awoke in the morning... for over the course of the night, Tyler had...</span></div></div>",

That job, tonight, was delivering boxes of trading cards back to his shop for their midnight launch. Not so glamorous as his brother David\u2019s big night out, no doubt, but work was work, and he enjoyed the time out on the road by himself listening to the radio and clearing his mind without David pinning him to the ground with inevitable ease - sure, the big lug was just messing around, but that didn\u2019t mean he had to enjoy his humiliations. Tyler let out a sigh \u2013 why was he even thinking about this? He had plenty of time to contemplate it when the big blue brute next put him in a headlock. Right now, it was Tyler time, and he planned to enjoy it as fully as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCranking up the music player attached to the dash, Tyler rocked out for a few miles to some of his favourite bands \u2013 none of that top 40 nonsense David blasted to fit in with the rest of the football team jocks. He swore that they didn\u2019t have a brain cell to share between them \u2013 ah! He was doing it again! Muttering under his breath, he focused on the road quickly slipping by him on the quiet highway, watching the darkening evening horizon as the moon started to peer out from some clouds. He\u2019d have to get back sooner rather than later, but his rumbling stomach demanded he make a pit stop before the last stretch home. Pulling in quietly to a truck stop, the dragon locked up the car and walked on in, observing the scenery. Amidst the concrete grey were parked a few trucks, seemingly from R&amp;D firms judging by their names and logos. Maybe a scientific conference was coming to town? Tyler made a note to check it out \u2013 he had a passing interest in sciences, mainly on the \u201cget buff quick\u201d side of biology. He pushed the creaky diner door open as a little bell chimed his presence, plumping himself down on a stool that was slightly too uncomfortably short. He fumed slightly as the waitress, an attractive young squirrel with a finely brushed tail leaned over the counter to greet him.<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy, lil\u2019 guy, what can I get you?\u201d she said, a warm, friendly, and most importantly genuine smile spread across her face. \u201cI\u2019m Nat and I\u2019ll be your waitress.\u201d<br>\r\nLittle guy? Oh, that burned! Sure, he was a small fellow, but he sure didn\u2019t like to be reminded of it! <br>\r\n\u201cCan I get the steak, please?\u201d Tyler huffed, puffing his chest out in a manner most observers would class adorable. \u201cMedium rare.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight away, hun.\u201d chirped the squirrel, tail whishing behind her as she went back into the kitchen. Still slightly annoyed, Tyler took a good look around the diner, finding it to be mostly empty. A couple of burly truckers sat in a corner, a large, buff otter that reminded Tyler of his brother, and a slimmer horse munching away at a salad. Both wore a white cap emblazoned with the logos he had seen on the trucks outside, so he could guess where they worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waitress placed a steak hot from the grill in front of Tyler, turning to pick up some cutlery, the purple dragon watched her face contort in fear as she pointed behind him. Turning his head quickly, he experienced time slow to a crawl, watching second after second tick by agonizingly as a huge white barrel smashed through the glass of the diner window, tumble onto the floor as its lid cracked off, and disgorge its milky, white payload all over the dragon, his mouth unfortunate enough to be hanging open in sheer disbelief. A moment passed as the barrel rolled awkwardly over the floor, dripping the last few drops from inside, as Tyler took a deep breath to scream his frustration... but what happened next was something unexpected.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slicking the milky, viscous liquid from his eyes, he stood up to shake the worst of it off. As he rose, a peculiar feeling struck him deep in the chest \u2013 a burning warmth, radiating from deep within to every limb in his body, particularly his cock, which began to stand to attention nestled within his waistband. A wave of pleasure struck him down, sending him crashing to his knees as he desperately scrabbled at his belt, too overwhelmed to notice the stares of the other patrons in the bar. Sheer heat started radiating from the dragon, the milky goop splattered all over him beginning to bubble ominously, as the normally weedy dragon felt a surge of godlike energy shake his very frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDexter. Dexter!\u201d hissed the horse eating his salad, jostling the large otter who had, by now, turned away to eat his halibut. \u201cRemember when the supervisor said to use hazmat gear when loading up the truck? This must be why! We have to do something!\u201d Dexter gently pushed his fish to the side, picked all six foot three of his large frame up from the diner\u2019s seat, and turned around. What he saw widened his eyes in surprise \u2013 the diminutive dragon seemed to be in the process of bursting out of his clothes, formerly non-existent muscle slowly defining itself on Tyler\u2019s thickening frame as inch by inch, he grew bigger and stronger. The dragon closed his eyes as bliss filled his body, while unimpressive biceps found sturdy peaks forming, skinny legs started filling out into powerful, broad haunches, and the tell-tale ridges of abdominal muscles began peeking out of a formerly flat stomach. 5\u2019 1\u2019\u2019 slowly, tantalizingly turned to 7\u2019 6\u2019\u2019 as Tyler soaked up the peculiar liquid. Better still, the one feature the dragon had reason to be proud of, the throbbing rod now standing strictly to attention, had grown to proportion, and as the dragon placed a paw gingerly on his nearly foot-long cock, Nat, the waitress, peered out from behind the doorway to the kitchen, not quite sure what to think of the purple dragon and his transformation. While the situation was bizarre, and quite intimidating... she could tell there was definitely something arousing about the growing titan shredding his much-belaboured clothes before her as she felt a flush of passion rush through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, eh, don\u2019t do anything hasty now. That\u2019s a dangerous chemical, you now.\u201d the otter advised sternly, making a cautious advance, hand drifting subtly and slowly to the stun gun on his belt while his equine companion followed behind him tentatively. \u201cLet\u2019s just all be very sensible about this, and nobody has to get in a scuffle...\u201d Opening his eyes and raising from his haunches to new, impressive heights, the dragon allowed himself a toothy smirk as he admired the way his leathery purple skin stretched tightly over the thick new musculature that had formed. He half growled, half purred as he slipped a hand back down to his achingly needy cock, throbbing with desperation, but couldn\u2019t ignore the two furs in baseball caps advancing his way \u2013 he had to act, but what was the best course of action?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dexter followed, clumsily unhooking the stun gun from his belt as he jogged behind his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler, for his part, was making a beeline for the big rig parked outside. He could see the doors wide open, barrel after barrel secured in the back with cables. More interesting, perhaps, was the raccoon lying prone and screaming bloody murder just underneath the truck. Wearing a bandit\u2019s mask and clutching his leg in agony, Tyler deduced that the raccoon was probably the one who cracked open the truck and sent the barrel barrelling into the diner \u2013 or at least, that was what the dropped crowbar suggested to him. As he dashed up to the back of the truck, his heavy footfalls padding across the asphalt caused the raccoon to look up, fearful that someone was coming to arrest him, or worse. Instead, he caught an eyeful of Tyler\u2019s foot-long cock, hard as a rock. The imposing dragon shot him a glance, towering over him as he climbed into the back of the truck.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, bro.\u201d Tyler said with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve done me such a favour.\u201d The purple drake left the raccoon with a look of sheer shock plastered across his masked face as he pulled himself into the truck, looking at white plastic barrel after white plastic barrel. He had hit the motherlode! Who knew how much of the milky goop was in there... <br>\r\nWell, there was one good way to find out. Ripping the lids from a couple of barrels, Tyler plunged his fists into the white liquid, feeling his arms burn slightly as it quickly absorbed through his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, yeaaaaah!\u201d murmured Tyler, running a slender tongue across his teeth as his eyes rolled back, sheer pleasure bubbling through his veins as he felt his musculature expand. If this kept up, he\u2019d be the biggest dragon around... maybe the biggest creature around. Glancing at the myriad barrels in the back of the truck, he had an irreverent thought... maybe he\u2019d outgrow the city. As Tyler grew, masses of purple muscle weighing the truck down, he dumped the barrels over himself to let the milky liquid soak right into his skin. It did the trick, as ecstasy flooded into him and he could not resist his aching, throbbing cock for one second longer. Wrapping both paws around the significant bulk of his tender length, he eagerly pleasured himself as he grew. 7\u2019 6\u2019\u2019 became a distant memory for him as he felt himself squeezing up against the back of the truck, inch after inch swelling into him as he watched his legs dangling out the back of the truck press up against the concrete \u2013 and damn, were they a sight to behold. He had begun the day with unimpressive, gangly legs that barely scraped the ground in a normal person\u2019s seat, and now proudly possessed thick thighs and chiselled calves that would make any bodybuilder blanche with jealousy. A statuesque set of abdominals ran the length of his stomach, solid pectorals took pride of place on his chest, and his arms were thick as tree trunks as the dragon felt his horns pressing into the roof of the trailer. As Tyler hauled himself out the back, sheer pleasure drove him to his sturdy knees as he continued stroking himself eagerly, grinning as the two mooks from inside levelled their tasers at him and fired. The darts pinged uselessly off his taut hide, leaving the pair nonplussed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d rumbled Tyler, giving almost two feet of cock glistening and slick with pre a delicate lick with his long tongue, the divine sensation sending a burst of pleasure along his length. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, guys, I\u2019m not gonna hurt you... just enjoy the show.\u201d The dragon revelled in his sheer size \u2013 David would be a gnat to him when he was done! He couldn\u2019t wait to drink in more of that goop and get even bigger, as ten foot turned into thirteen, and the dragon continued to pump his slick rod with delight plastered across his face. With a squeeze of his tender, oversized sack and a grunt of pleasure, a thick rope of cum jetted from his cock, only to splatter over the otter in his already-white cap. Dexter took a moment to react, another blast of the dragon\u2019s musky jizz coating him before he had the good sense to duck out the way. With a roar of pure pleasure, the dragon let his cock throb, growling his delight as his cum spurted in arcane patterns across the asphalt. In the haze of afterglow, the dragon had a wicked idea...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sitting at a table in the food court polishing off the last of his fries, the lithe and small purple drake casually watched the comings and goings of the other shoppers at the mall.   With so many others all in motion, it was easy to observe without being seen; something made easier by being shorter than 95% of the population, children thankfully excluded.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler Matthews was barely 5'1\u201d tall, and with such a slender frame his mass was equally diminutive. Though decently fast and fairly agile, he hadn't the strength to fight out of a paper bag, or so his older brother David so constantly teased.   David was conversely on the tall side of the spectrum, and at a lofty 7'3 he towered over Tyler by more than two whole feet.   The fact that David was heavily muscled from all his sporting activities and weightlifting only made the side-by-side comparison all the more obvious...and disheartening for Tyler.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0David meant well...generally, Tyler allowed as he turned his head to watch a family haul their children past the cookie stand, taking a slurp from the straw of his soda.    This morning had the barrage of the usual \u201cshort stuff\u201d \u201ctiny\u201d \u201cbaby bro\u201d(emphasis on baby) comments.  It was nothing new, but in their brief morning exchange David made no mention of, and therefore must have completely forgotten that it was Tyler's birthday today.    A major milestone in anyone's life and thus far nobody had even acknowledged it, if they knew it at all. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though he had wished for it to be special, and it wasn't very exciting, neither was it bad since luck seemed to be on his side.  Nearly losing his parking space and already mentally threatening the Cadillac lined up to steal it, the offending vehicle inexplicably turned and kept going, letting his SUV get the prime spot.  Ordering food, too, Tyler saw that they were preparing the wrong meal and started mentally cursing them for it, not looking forward to sending it back.  Fortunately enough, they stopped and corrected their mistake.  The extra ketchup packets were added before he could even ask for them.   He did have a strange kind of headache, though, and the morning insults still occupied his thoughts.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler was used to them, and though defeated in most size categories by his overbuilt brother, there was still one in which he, Tyler, was the bigger of the two.     It made shopping for pants a bit of a chore, and public embarrassment was a real risk, but that little truth deep down gave the purple dragon something to smile about on even the worst of days.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see, Tyler was gifted, nay blessed with an endowment that spelled \u201cHung\u201d with a capital 'H'.  On the impressively tall and broadly built body of his brother, David, it would still be regarded as oversized and garner whistles of appreciation.     On a scrawny purple whelp barely chest high to most high schoolers? It was downright massive, bordering on the obscene in a way that was far from undesirable.  His balls were proportionally huge if not oversized even in comparison to the rest of his endowment; while running was a dangerous activity, they made for very 'productive' nights at home.  You'd think I'd have bigger forearms, Tyler mused,  with as much work as it took to-...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then, through the crowds and motion, Tyler spotted someone he knew, near the junction where the food court opened up into the mall itself.

Today, David was sporting a pair of yellow gym shorts and a white tank-top. \"Hey there shrimp, needed a breath of air runt?\" David's teasing was totally annoying Tyler now, especially because David forgot his birthday. To make matters worse, David slapped Tyler on the rump and nearly broke his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Dude, relax tiny, why are you so uptight today?\" Why you, Tyler thought to himself, if our positions were switched I'd totally knock you out on the spot! The blue dragon left for a second to chat with Fang, a wolf jock that kept bullying Tyler. Tyler took the opportunity to slip away and sat down on the edge of the fountain in the center of the mall. Tyler sighed. I wish that me and David could switch places, or better yet I could switch places with anyone I wanted to at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Tyler let out a big sigh and pulled out a penny and tossed  it into the fountain. He then lied down on the fountain's edge and looked up at the Mall's ceiling. If only I was David Tyler thought to himself while imaging David's beefy torso and his sexy body. Suddenly, Tyler felt a little light. He opened his eyes and saw himself by the fountain. He was some sort of spirit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Tyler then felt some sort of force pull himself away from his body. He was flying across the mall and was heading to what seemed to be a swimsuit store. He then saw David in front of the store and saw a weird white mist exiting David's mouth. Tyler then found himself being sucked into David's mouth and everything went black. Crap, am I dead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Tyler slowly opened his eyes and found himself sitting down and leaning against a window. Weird, wasn't I by the fountain? After he remembered what happened, Tyler sprung up from the floor and looked into the window. Starring back at Tyler was a slightly transparent David in the window. Tyler's jaw dropped, he has really turned into David?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Panicking, Tyler began to rub David's hands together to get a feel for them. After he called down, he thought that he should at least see what his brother's body was like. He then got an idea for exploring his new body. Tyler sauntered into the swimsuit store and looked at all the speedos the store carried. He picked a neon pink speedo and waltzed over to the changing room. Tyler locked the door and turned over to the mirror. Let the show begin Tyler thought to himself with a evil grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Tyler peeled the wife-beater off and began to caress his beefy pecs and abs and his massive biceps. After removing the shorts and green slip-ons, Tyler was now staring at the reflection of David wearing only a pair of boxers. He then began to caress his tree-trunk thighs and then flexing his biceps. Tyler then pulled down his boxers to reveal his new junk and firm rump. Tyler began panting heavily as he ogled David in the buff. His cock sticking up and already oozing pre. He loved this feeling. He then reached for his shorts and pulled out David's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Dirty ideas flowed through Tyler's mind. He then began to take selfies of him rock hard and posing. After taking about 8 pics of himself, Tyler then began to record himself stroking his cock and squeezing one of his meaty navy blue nipples. Tyler threw his head back as he reached his climax, his seed spraying all over the walls and the mirror. Tyler panted and pulled out his new speedo. After slipping into it, Tyler could feel himself drooling at the sight of his sexy brother. He then pulled out David's phone again and started taking photos of him posing in his tight speedo. This is awesome Tyler thought to himself as he groped his two firm butt cheeks. He then pulled on his original attire and paid for the speedo before exiting the store. Hope they don't mind the mess. Tyler, while adjusting his speedo that he was wearing as underwear, pondered over his next move. He could attempt to locate his original body, which he assumes is currently inhabited by David, attempt to see if his wish cam true and he could switch with anybody at will, or use David's body to score a date with somebody.</span></div></div>",

Fang was, legitimately, a freak of nature.   His height, strength, and power were nearly legendary, and in regards to species, unheard of.    He quite literally was the biggest wolf on the planet according to verifiable records.    Standing 7'10\u201d tall, a full head taller than David even, Fang's muscle-laden physique made David look positively lithe.    Like a black-furred mountain of herculean strength, Fang could never hide in a crowd with so much of him towering above it.  Not that he'd ever want to.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fang, as everyone referred to him(even his family, rumor had it), took narcissism to a  whole new level.   Numerous teammates told identical stories the hulking wolf spending, literally, hours in front of the mirror fawning over himself, flexing and posing to his own great delight.   That the wolf had an ego was like saying the sun was \u201ckinda big\u201d.     <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With such an ego, and his total love of attention of all sorts, Fang relished the attention that was afforded him due to his imposing stature and frightening strength.   Smiling or not, the elongated canines Fang possessed perpetually hung over his lower lip, adding a touch of feral to his fastidiously-groomed appearance.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If stereotypes could talk and walk, Fang would be a Jock squared.   He participated, and dominated, every sport he could feel inclined to try, which was generally all of them.  Academically, he was a non-entity, and could very well have been unable to count past the jersey numbers of his teammates.   No teacher would dare fail such a star athlete (and nearly all were afraid of him physically) and so Fang skated through University on an unimaginable free-ride with numerous sports scholarships, with what could have very well been a 3rd grade literacy. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One might think that being small was an advantage when faced with such a gigantic person; with height so far above the canopy of people's heads in a crowd, it would be easy to sip through undetected.     Nothing was farther from the truth.    <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler never knew why Fang targeted him.    Was it hate?  Was it sport?  Did Tyler's 5'1\u201d somehow insult Fang's stature, or did the narcissistic wolf find the constant comparisons to someone so much smaller personally gratifying?     Tyler thought it was the last one, but considering the reasoning behind what Fang did, if there was any, was a pointless exercise.    Nobody could claim wolves were colorblind with how easily Fang could pick out a flash of purple and stalk it like so much prey. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler had already sunk low in his seat, sliding the remains of his burger combo in front of him in some vain attempt at hiding.   Maybe he wouldn't notice me, Tyler thought with hope.   Maybe its my birthday after all and I'll get a free pass from torment?    Fang was standing around his friends (all shorter than him) and let out a booming bark of laughter at some amusing statement.  It was a laugh everyone could hear, and quite a few turned in it's direction before recognizing the source.   <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hopes in the little purple dragon rose when Fang turned partially, his entourage of fawning adorers and jock friends moving with him.    Tyler started glancing around, looking for cover in a path towards the doors; the table dividers equated to so many chest-high walls like from the games he played so well.   A probable route was mapped out mentally, but motion caught his eyes for a split second.   <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fang's head had turned to say something to one of his group, but in that casual motion it had frozen, eyes like searchlights beaming in Tyler's direction.    When Fang's muzzle split into a too-broad grin, Tyler knew he had been spotted.     There was no point in running; you can't outpace a giant, and doing so only made him all the more eager to harass you, as if attempting to avoid the bullying earned you extra rounds.   No, Tyler had learned long before that if you couldn't avoid Fang entirely, you just had to sit through his tormenting.   <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Like the gliding of a steamship the black-furred behemoth began walking in Tyler's direction; everyone moved out of his way like he was a city bus, and being run over by him probably caused the same degree of injury.      Tyler was sulking at this point, arms crossed and lips pouting as he semi-defiantly stared back at the approaching storm that was Fang.    The wolf's tail was visibly wagging behind him as he casually yet undeniably grew closer and closer.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe strange headache returned to pound on Tyler's skull, adding insult to the oncoming injury, and the purple dragon felt anger rise inside him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just go bother someone else, Fang</i>, Tyler thought in a voice that seemed to echo inside his own mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took a second for the purple dragon to blink when  he saw that the massive wolf was no longer walking.    Fang had just stopped abruptly, and his entourage seemed somewhat perplexed as well with the way they hung behind him, not sure where he was going.     The wolf's head rotated after that momentary freeze, scanning around before pausing; once more that grin bloomed on his large muzzle and he was on the move.  But not for Tyler.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Afraid to take his eyes off the black-furred giant, his body swiveled to track Fang's progress further on into the food court, and then around towards the pizza franchise in the back corner.    Behind the counter, Willard, an asthmatic rat who was a regular at Tyler's game shop, looked visibly panicked.<br>\r\nWithin thirty seconds Fang was hanging with his crew in front of the frightened looking rodent, and most certainly torturing him with absurd orders, reneged requests, and all manner of ridicule.    <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler's jaw hung open as he wrapped his mind around the encounter than never happened.   It was unheard of.   Unimaginable.   Fang had just walked passed him like he'd not seen him; he had, of that Tyler was certain, but it was almost as if-...<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t...he'd gone to bother someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It couldn't be.   This was the most amazing...Impossible.   Fantastic, but madness?   All these jumbled doubts ran through he small purple dragon's mind in the blink of an eye.    Tempted to take the opportunity to escape, Tyler hesitated and glanced around.   He couldn't go without making sure, without testing it...if what had happened was real, he'd never forgive himself for not finding out.   Looking around hastily, he spotted a Kodiak bear three tables down eating a burger.   Trying to focus on that 'headache' and feeling it return, he thought as loud as he could at the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're done eating that.  Throw it away.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once more the words seemed to resonate inside his mind, and as he watched, the bear paused to contemplate his partially-eaten double-with-cheese.   Swishing the bite around, the ursine swallowed, rose, and casually tossed the burger away into the adjacent trashcan.    Even before the bear was walking away Tyler was nearly flailing in his seat and biting back a most immasculine giggle.  His paws had to wrap around his draconic muzzle to keep from laughing, and he struggled to calm his racing heart while grinning so hard his face hurt.    Maybe it was his birthday after all...and he had the most amazing present anyone could have ever wished for.   <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tyler had the power to, somehow, influence other people's actions.   He could suggest something mentally and they seemed to obey it, or at least take it into consideration.   Was it just actions or could he change their perceptions and feelings, too?  How far could he make someone go?  Tyler didn't know if it was some new, permanent ability or something that would end when his birthday did, but he did know he wanted to do as much with it as possible. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tWith a new-found confidence and a devilish gleam in his eye, the short dragon swiveled in his seat, wondering how he was going to exploit this first.  He decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThis was way too good to be true, the thought kept rolling around in Tyler's head as he darted up from his seat and began scampering his way across the food court to follow his 'mark'. He didn't know if this was some kind of hallucination, some act of god, or if he was just dreaming, but regardless of which it was, he was going to use it to the fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt wasn't hard to catch up with fang, considering that he was almost 8 foot tall and easily stood out among everyone else. He saw the brawny beast of a wolf looming over a table of rather stacked, curvaceous women. He was obviously trying to put the moves on them, and all but one or two of the half dozen women were too busy staring and drooling at the massive slab of black furred meat in front of them to be listening to any of the cocky, corny pickup lines that Fang was slathering over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know ladies, come over to my place and i'll show you how to have a REAL workout\u201d he would growl out with a smug grin, that left no doubt that he was making a sexual advance against them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTyler had other thing's in mind for Fang, however. With a faint growl of concentration, he gripped against the cell phone kiosk he was hiding behind, jaw clenched as he struggled to bring up that faintly painful sensation he had felt earlier, feeling it come on a bit easier this time now that he knew what he was looking for, so to speak, and focused his attention on Fang as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou have more important things to do, blow off the girls, and tell your friends to scram\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTyler stood there for several seconds, watching Fang simply stare down at the girls as they all chattered between him and themselves. And for a second he began to worry maybe he had just been imagining it, and started to feel stupid. Though that didn't last long as he overheard Fangs deep growling voice \u201cThough I think we'll need to schedule that some other time, ladies, I've got some other stuff I gotta take care of today.\u201d and then turned to the two fellow football players surrounding him and gave a quick growl to them both \u201cAnd you two, scram, squirts. Fangzilla's got personal business to take care of.\u201d The two stared at him for a few moments as if in confusion, considering he had been the one that invited them out to hang with him, but a quick growl and barring of the massive wolf's fangs sent the two nodding and backing off, giving a lingering wave before all but dashing away. Even his fellow teammates didn't screw around with Fang. He was a cocky jerk that was used to getting his way... and it had been a long time since anyone had dared to see what Fang would do if he didn't get his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cheehee\u2026 it works\u201d Tyler said to himself, tail swishing uncontrollably behind him in amusement. He still couldn\u2019t believe this was real, but was far too amused with the thought of what he could do to Fang to let something like disbelief get in his way. He had to stop himself and think, though. If this really was happening, and he really could influence everything Fang did\u2026 what should he have him do? Obviously revenge was the first thing that came to mind but so many different things that he could do to fang kept popping up in his mind that he couldn\u2019t quite figure out which one to go with first. He didn\u2019t have long to think about it, however, as Fang seemed to be deciding something on his own, and started walking off deeper into the mall, forcing Tyler out of his hiding spot to dash after him, quickly having to make up his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFang loved to humiliate Tyler, now it was Fang\u2019s turn to be the one being humiliated, and by his own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou could use some new clothes, time to find a store and try some things on\u2026\u201d Tyler \u2018thought\u2019 to Fang, dashing from hiding spot to hiding spot and watching the wolf\u2019s head jerk slightly in response to the suggestion. Within seconds he saw Fang starting to look around the mall, eyes lingering on various clothing shops as if debating whether to try there or not. Though each time Tyler would quickly pre-empt Fang\u2019s own decision with one of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot that one\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot what you want\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSome other time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut before long, Tyler grinned widely as he found the one that he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. That one\u2026\u201d He would whisper into Fang\u2019s mind, grunting only faintly at the sensation of that dull throbbing in his head when using that newfound \u2018power\u2019 of his. Though he did start to notice that the more he was using it the less that it seemed to effect him, but he couldn\u2019t figure out if it was because what he was pushing was easier or simpler, or if he was actually just getting better at it. Regardless, it was working as he intended, and as stealthily as he could, he followed Fang into the store that had \u2018caught his eye\u2019\u2026 Victoria Secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTyler was terrified at the thought of directly humiliating Fang in front of people, lest he set the wolf off. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Fang had lost his cool and beaten the hell out of multiple people, so instead he decided to try something a bit more\u2026 \u2018subtle\u2019, namely, getting anonymous evidence to post later. As stealthily as he could, he followed the hulking wolf  into the store, thankfully Fangs massive presence made Tyler all but ignorable with everyones\u2019 eyes clearly glued to the massive muscle-bound man walking around a women\u2019s underwear store. With himself partially hidden behind a clothes rack, Tyler pulled out his cell phone and raised the camera up to follow Fang. Now just to implant the right thoughts in his head to get the best pictures\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhich of these is the right size for you?...\u201d He would whisper into Fang\u2019s mind, watching him slowly start browsing his way to the back of the store where the larger sizes for the dragons and saurians were kept. The looming wolf idly thumbing across size tags as if trying to decide which one would fit, while none of the shop clerks seeming to have the courage to ask the wolf if he needed any help. A quiet click, followed by a second one signified Tyler taking pictures of the wolf as he browsed, still doing his best to keep himself quiet and unnoticed. Thankfully between Fang\u2019s audible footsteps and the indiscernible mumbling of those in the shop talking about Fang those tiny clicks went unheard.  Browsing wasn\u2019t going to be enough, however, as he could easily just say he was looking for something for a girlfriend to wear, so Tyler decided to up the ante a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow would you look in those skimpy bikinis?\u201d Came another suggestion, Tyler clenching his jaw to keep the grunt of discomfort from becoming audible as he felt his thought sink into Fang. Again his head seemed to jerk ever so faintly, as if he had suddenly got an idea of his own, as he turned to look at the swimwear racks in the corner, and started making his way in that direction. What Tyler didn\u2019t expect is on his way over to the rack, Fang reached down to grasp opposite hems of his shirt and started to peel it upwards. Those thick, powerfully meaty arms grinding against each other and his chest as they struggled for space when crossed as such, biceps and forearms bulging almost obscenely as inch after inch of hard, thin black fur covered muscle was exposed. Within seconds, Fang\u2019s shirt was off and carelessly draped over one of his shoulders, leaving the behemothian lupine naked from the waist up, exposing that herculean physique of his (To a few audible gasps from the women behind the counter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith his shirt now off, Fang picked up one of the larger bikini tops and held it up infront of his meaty pectorals, holding the cups of the bikini up against his chest as if comparing how much of those thick slabs of muscle could be covered by the thin, stretchy fabric. The straps looked like floss compared to his shoulders, and even if they were stretchy enough to encompass the girth of his shoulders, the sheer width of his torso made it look unlikely that fang would even be able to pull the thing on. Bikinis made to engulf melon sized tits too small to encompass the sheer girth of the muscular wolf\u2019s torso!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTyler found himself, of all things\u2026 becoming aroused. It wasn\u2019t so much the whole bikini aspect of it, as it was just the sight of something normally considered quite large, looking so small compared to Fang. Tyler had always been a small guy, so he had been used as comparison for a lot of things. And though he\u2019d never admit it, and even despite that it was blatantly obvious, he\u2019d always wanted to be bigger. Not just normal sized, but huge, massive like Fang or David, just so that he could be the one making things look small for a change. Call it living vicariously through Fang, call it an attraction to Fang himself that Tyler refused to admit, it was hard to tell. All Tyler knew was that the sight before him was turning him on. He wouldn\u2019t lie, at least not to himself, He\u2019d always found Fang hot. The sheer immense size of him was undeniably so\u2026 but Fang\u2019s personality rubbed Tyler in such a bad way, not to mention the torment directed at him, that that attraction had always been buried beneath his distaste for the wolf, himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd now he felt conflicted\u2026 Of course, Revenge was still fresh in his mind, this was the best opportunity for it he\u2019d ever get. But on the other hand, this was probably the only chance he\u2019d ever get to be able to enjoy that massive body\u2026 and at least have some say over the personality that came with it\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a tremendously difficult decision, one that paralysed Tyler. The wolf had always been a source of lust, but for the first time he was fully conscious of it. He stared as Fang scowled, trying in vain to fit the enormous G-string around his hulking black chest. What would Tyler do with the wolf once he got his hands on him? What could he have the wolf do to him? It was something he had never really considered in detail before, but he formulating some ideas. Would he really enjoy that? His cock seemed to think it would as it strained against his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me Sir, can I help you?\u201d A nervous shop assistant asked the half-naked wolf, interrupting Tyler\u2019s internal dialogue. She was a thin, reasonably tall cat who was doing her best to appear both professional as she looked up at the monstrous wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, do you have anything like this, but bigger?\u201d The wolf asked of his own volition as he practically tossed the bikini top at her. In an impressive display of dexterity, she lashed out and caught the fabric before it hit her in the face. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t, sir. You see, we have a very\u2026 specific clientele\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough.\u201d The wolf snapped. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even bothered checking out back, or anything. I want that, but I can\u2019t fucking fit into it. So are you going to fix this, or are you just going to make excuses and be fucking useless?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scowled at the wolf as his impulses faded. What an ugly, detestable asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat was visibly resisting a tremble. \u201cSir, please calm down. We cater exclusively in women\u2019s wear and lingerie. Our products aren\u2019t designed to be versatile enough\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking women and I want that!\u201d Fang practically shouted as he pointed at the bikini. The cat cowered at his outburst, clearly overwhelmed by such an aggressive, intimidating and apparently deranged customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Drop the attitude and be friendlier to the assistant.\u2019 Tyler concentrated the thought at fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolf eyed the shop assistant angrily for a moment before shifting his massive frame, eying her whole body.  \u201cSo what time is your shift done babe?\u201d he inquired through a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat opened her eyes wide. Tyler palmed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not\u2026 that\u2019s none of your concern sir. I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave please.\u201d The cat said firmly.<br>\r\nFang chuckled. \u201cI know your type. Most chicks dream of getting my attention, but some just don\u2019t know how to handle it once it\u2019s theirs. You\u2019re freaking out because you\u2019re a deer caught in headlights, aren\u2019t you puss? Well, I like that. I like having that sort of power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stared wide eyed. Surely the wolf was parodying himself? He couldn\u2019t have been serious. The cat stood paralysed as the black wolf shifted his frame slightly, flexing the naked torso that towered above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk sir\u2026 if I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang.\u201d The wolf interrupted smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026 Fang\u2026 If I\u2026 I\u2019m Amanda, by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stood frozen. What the hell? The wolf\u2019s brazen and piggish comments didn\u2019t seriously work did they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda composed herself. \u201cIf I tell you when I finish and meet up with you, will you please leave the store immediately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head in disbelief. What was wrong with this woman? Did she have no self-respect at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gave a big bassy chuckle as he shook his head. \u201cNah babe, I still want my lacy two-piece. There\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t have you both is there? \u201c he asked flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s one I can think of.\u201d The cat replied uncertainly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything broad enough to get its way around your broad chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scowled. This wasn\u2019t fun anymore. He wanted to get this over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bikini will fit Fang if he stretches it.\u2019 Tyler thought, concentrating on the bikini top. Would that work? It seemed unlikely that he could bend physics like that. But then again, it seemed unlikely he could control the wolf with his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Try to put the bikini on again. It will fit if you stretch it'. Tyler thought at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was sneering as he played idly with his chest. \u201cBroad?  Nah, broad is something you\u2019d say about an above average, regular person. I\u2019m more titanic.\u201d He said cheekily. He eyed the bikini in the cat\u2019s hand again. \u201cHey, I think I can make it fit if I really want to.\u201d He said as he snatched it from the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d the cat cried out. The wolf ignored her as he turned to face the mirror, wrapping the thin cords around him. \u201cIf you stretch it then you\u2019ll have to pay for it Fang!\u201d Amanda warned, before staring open mouthed at the wolf\u2019s thick back muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrapped the bikini almost all the way around his chest, but his hulking limbs were somewhat muscle-bound, restricting his ability to tie the lace behind him. \u201cCan you do me up please babe?\u201d he rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat looked awestruck by the effort that the bikini was putting in. She stepped forward, and reaching up, tied the strap for the wolf. Fang grunted in approval as he stared at himself in the mirror. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the shit right there. See? You know how to get things done once you\u2019re told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was elated that his wish had worked. So he can do more than just control the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to try these on too.\u201d Fang said as he grabbed the bottom half of the two piece ensemble, and immediately made his way to the dressing room. Tyler smiled. He didn\u2019t have to guide the wolf at all. He really, genuinely wanted to wear the swimsuit as if it were perfectly normal. Fang wasn\u2019t shaking out of it and waking up to his actions at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at the tiny panties in the wolf\u2019s hand. <i>You will fit fang too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant sheepishly followed the wolf towards the booth, clearly restraining a protest. Tyler crept up behind the rows of hanging clothes to get a good look at the wolf as he closed the curtain on the booth. The wolf was huge, his head almost touching the ceiling above him. So his head and neck were clearly visible above the curtain, and Tyler could make out his every action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smiled triumphantly once he had the panties on, and turned to leave the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s heart stopped when the wolf slid the curtain and revealed himself. His eyes were wide as he stared directly at his groin. The panties fit, but they acted in much the same way you would have expected a piece of bailing twine to in the same situation. The elastic rim rode low on the black wolf\u2019s hips, bowing as it wrapped around the front. It hugged only the base of the wolf\u2019s massive and thick sheath, the midpiece only acting to part the wolf\u2019s enormous balls as it dug into his scrotum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was left to the imagination. Not that once could easily imagine something so\u2026 monsterous. Tyler felt a surge of desire again as he took the sight in. Perhaps it was the fuzzy sheath and scrotum that made the wolf\u2019s package appear larger than it really was. But Tyler could never have dreamed an image of the flesh that stood in front of him. Fang always had a noticeable bulge, but this was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat stared at the same thing as Tyler, and was giving a similarly shocked response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d The wolf said proudly, thrusting his hips as he enjoyed the cat\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda shook her head, knocking herself out of her stupor. \u201cYou can\u2019t go out wearing that!\u201d she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed. \u201cAin\u2019t no one who can tell me what to do babe. This is perfect, just what I was looking for. You\u2019ve done well, haven\u2019t you? You should be proud of yourself. I know I am.\u201d He turned to the mirror and flexed his frame, his groin spilling everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d the cat said nervously. \u201cJust go up and pay for it and leave the store please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed, shaking his head slowly. He never took his eyes off his reflection. \u201cNah, the deal was that you\u2019d tell me when you finished before I left, remember babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI finish at 7. When the shop closes. If you want to meet up then wait for me then OUTSIDE.\u201d The cat clearly stipulated. \u201cBut for now, pay and leave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf did just that a few minutes later, once he was absolutely, beyond doubt sure that he approved of his own reflection. The shopkeepers and patrons were all pointedly not looking at fang as he paid for his clothes, the reaction only seeming to reinforce his sense of smug power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left his shirt and shorts behind him as he exited the store, holding his wallet in his hand. Tyler followed suit. Wide eyes were the absolute least of reactions the wolf got as he strutted confidently though and into the crowd. Some pointed; others commented to themselves, others commented to the wolf. None of them were positive. Some women screamed and turned away, others froze in shock.  Ok, Tyler thought. Now this was getting funny again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a thought occurred to him as his gaze trailed the practically naked wolf, flowing from the broad back down the deep spinal ridge to his toned ass and thighs, down the bulging calves and into the thick, powerful paws that spread wide as they bore his titanic mass.  Tyler swallowed. How awesome would it be if the wolf was even bigger? If he grew even wider and burst out of his tight, almost invisible bikini? How would that look? How would the crowd respond to such a sight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s pants were practically bursting at the thought. It seemed like a good idea, but it was just one of many that were racing through his mind. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On some level Tyler he knew that a bigger Fang was not exactly in his interests, but what the hell, once he had his fun, he could just shrink the wolf down again, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grow bigger.</i> The purple thought at the wolf with a maniacal little grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf in front of him abruptly jolted, stumbling forwards as he briefly struggled with his balance. Luckily the crowd had already afforded the practically naked wolf a berth, and so his sudden movement caused little more than a few startled cries and some superfluous flinching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes remained on Fang, who stood in a wide stance, his feet splayed as he panted heavily. His head darted as he studied his body in alarmed confusion, clearly aware that something was happening but not knowing what. His whole body trembled slightly as he moved his hands across his torso, probing it for cues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome in the crowd had stopped to look at the huge naked wolf, but most still moved along, either pointedly looking away or unashamedly staring at him as they were passing a car accident. But one way or another, the wolf\u2018s presence was clearly registering to everyone within eyeshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was growing. Tyler was the first to see it, probably because he knew what he was looking for. Fang panted heavily, sucking in air like he had almost drowned. His enormous board shoulders rose and fell, the hulking slabs of meat already towered a long way overhead, and inched higher with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for others in the crowd to notice the phenomenon. Gasps, cries and murmurs came in a rush as people started to squeeze partners hands and point at the growing wolf. Deep cracks and snaps could be heard coming from Fang\u2019s body, sounding much like wetter versions of snapping branches and twigs. Tyler watched as the wolf\u2019s back steadily rose in front of him, his shoulders pressing further out as his hulking lats broadened as the lifted further from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was rapidly growing in all dimensions. His tremendous height and broad frame had allowed him to stack on a bodybuilder\u2019s physique to begin with. But as the wolf\u2019s skeleton popped and cracked its way into new space, it dragged his muscles with him, the enormous sheets of flesh quickly claiming the extra space as they swelled ever thicker under his pelt. Even his naked paws visibly swelled on the smooth tiled floor, his small nails skiting loudly as they pressed further out across the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf had figured out what was happening relatively early on, and was by now smiling wildly, his tongue lolling down from his open jaw. Under his dark pelt, increasingly defined muscles tensed and relaxed as they kept his growing stature balanced. Each breath he took was deeper than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole exhibition had to that point only lasted perhaps ten seconds, but Tyler had watched it all with held breath. He honestly didn\u2019t know if the sight frightened him or turned him on. Imagination was a powerful tool, but actually physically witnessing it happen was not quite the experience he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone in the crowd screamed. It was enough to make Tyler rip his eyes off the wolf. He had almost forgotten they existed. The whole atmosphere had changed. No one was walking past the Fang anymore. They were either staring at him in shock or making some sort of attempt to back away from him. Everyone, including Tyler himself, gave a startled jump s the wolf let out a loud, happy yelp. A series of shocked and frightened cries followed it as the wolf\u2019s outburst reverberated around the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was enough for Tyler. He didn\u2019t want to scare or horrify people. And he didn\u2019t particularly want to make the wolf happy. He was about to wish the wolf shrank back down when the bikini top loudly snapped off his meaty chest, launching itself into the onlooking crowd. The sight of that got Tyler\u2019s heart racing again. Impulsively, he quickly softened his wish. The wolf was growing too fast, but the second half of his two piece suit was still in one piece, the think G-string dug tightly into his fleshy ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grow a tenth of that speed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Fang\u2019s body responded almost immediately as his increasing size and bulk seemed to come to a stop. A moment passed and the wolf gave a half disappointed, half frustrated growl as he realised that the growth seemed to stop. Stood up straight and arched his back. His vertebrae cracked and popped loudly as he stretched his increased frame for the first time, the action quickly followed by stretching limbs, neck and tail. At the end of his display, Fang gave his head a quick, violent shake before laughing to himself and acknowledging the staring crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler estimated that he must have been eight and a half feet tall, and weighed about half as much again as he did to start with. In other words, the wolf was unnaturally large for just about any species, let alone a canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed arrogantly as he cast his eyes over the crowd, placing his hands on his shoulders as he did so. He turned around to see those watching him from behind, and for one quick moment Tyler\u2019s hear froze as the wolf stared at him, before quickly moving his gaze on. Tyler blushed. The wolf\u2019s shaft stood higher, thicker and longer than ever, and several inches of pink flesh had popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler suddenly realised that he had an erection. It wasn\u2019t immediately obvious; it was constrained underneath the fabric of his underwear and pants. But it wasn\u2019t exactly unnoticeable either. He quickly leant forwards a bit and cast an embarrassed look around the crowd. Luckily, no one was even close to removing their attention from Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like what you all see?\u201d The wolf boomed in a voice that sounded several tones lower than it should have. He spotted someone in the crowd who lifted a phone up at him, obviously recording the event. The wolf sneered and took a slow but long step towards them, causing a low thud as he planted his enormous paw. \u201cAre you filming Fang? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? I could have given you some of this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpontaneously, the mammoth wolf struck a series of poses, bulging his biceps, then chest and finally squatted down in some sort of dynamic pose. More people in the crowd started taking their phones out and pointed the back of them at the wolf. Fang chucked to himself as he stood up, took a deep breath, and lunged forwards, and unleashed a long, almost deafening howl into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd freaked out, and began to immediately disperse in a rather disorganised fashion. Fang stood up straight again and admired the aftermath before strutting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gulped as he resumed trailing him. Fang might not have noticed it, but he was still definitely growing. While the increase itself was hidden within the wolf\u2019s movements, it was slowly leaving behind more wolf. Fang was at least another three inches taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes were level to the wolf\u2019s lumbar region, and lowering further with each passing moment. The purple drake couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how the wolf\u2019s long hairy tail swished chest height to him. He kept his eyes on the g-string as it dug into the steely muscles of the wolf\u2019s ass. Were it not for the long rivet it made in Fang\u2019s form, the thin distressed elastic may have been completely invisible under his fur pelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler kept his distance as the wolf strutted deeper into the mall, smirking arrogantly at the gawking crowd he glided through. If anything, Tyler was having difficulty keeping up. Fang wasn\u2019t walking particularly fast, but his strides were long, and Tyler\u2019s own gait was somewhat hampered by his efforts to conceal his swollen manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang?!\u201d a voice called out in surprise. The wolf\u2019s ears pricked up, and he stopped to look down at the bear that addressed him. Tyler didn\u2019t know his name. To him, most of the jocks blended together. \u201cFang, what are\u2026 Fuck\u2026\u201d The bear continued, his face pale and incredulous as he looked at the gigantic, naked beast before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled. \u201cI thought I told you to scram, I\u2019ve got stuff to do Rick.\u201d He said as he turned to continue on.<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Fang, What\u2019s going on here?!\u201d the bear insisted, and started trailing the wolf. Fang simply ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave a devious sneer. He didn\u2019t really have anything against Rick, hell he only just learned his name. But this was an opportunity to hurt Fang\u2019s standing in his group.  After all, revenge was still his motivating factor in all of this\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Be aggressive. Act like a super jerk.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang slowed down ominously and slowly turned to face the bear following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem you fat fuck?\u201d Fang spat at him. \u201cI told you to FUCK OFF!\u201d he roared the final words in a voice so loud and booming that it caused the bear to almost lose his balance as cowered backwards. \u201cIf you\u2019re done stuffing your fucking face with greasy shit, then how about you go practice throwing a fucking ball? I have no idea why you haven\u2019t been cut yet you useless, fat lazy-assed piece of talentless shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf took an aggressive step forwards Rick, rolling his paws into fists as he loomed over the cowering bear. Tyler\u2019s eyes widened. He had lost track of the wolf\u2019s growth. Where only a minute ago his tail swished as high as his chest, it now stood stiffly erect at his eye level. His eyes glanced quickly up the length of the wolf\u2019s body. He had to have been approaching nine and a half feet. And as the wolf stood threateningly still over the bear, Tyler could see his ears slowly rising even higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough, Tyler decided. <i>Stop growing.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Judging by the various gasps and murmurings around him, he wasn\u2019t the only one to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh.. Fang, Please\u2026\u201d The bear pleaded up at him with panicked confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gave a guttural growl. \u201cDon\u2019t FUCKING DISOBEY ME!\u201d He shouted with full fury. He leant his massive frame backwards, utilising his immense bulk to kick the large bear. Tyler cried out in shock as Rick was sent sliding across the floor with brutal force. His eyes were wide as he looked back at Fang. The wolf stood staring at the sprawled bear, his brow deeply scowled but his lips curled upwards. Several inches of manhood crested his sheath again as he admired his own strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt sick. That was his fault. He told the wolf to be aggressive. He didn\u2019t mean violent. He just wanted him to be a jerk to isolate himself from his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Calm down</i> Tyler thought at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang didn\u2019t give any immediate feedback that he had taken the command. His stance didn\u2019t soften, his face didn\u2019t change. Actually\u2026<br>\r\nTyler stared with wide eyes as he noticed his ears were still rising higher. The wolf was still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop growing!</i> The thought he gave the wolf was almost panicked. <i>Shrink back down to your original size!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang licked his lips as the bear groggily moved his frame with no real objective. With a satisfied sniff, The wolf abruptly turned around and continued on his way, the crowd literally climbing over themselves to get out of his way. His paws pounded the floor beneath him, his footsteps louder than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler started to panic. The wolf wasn\u2019t shrinking. And as he watched the wolf sharply veer to punch in a shopfront window, it was clear that he wasn\u2019t calming down either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad the magic stopped? Did he run out of wishes? The thoughts ran rapidly in his mind. This was bad. This was very bad.<br>\r\nHe ran up to the broken window. He looked at all the fragmented pieces. <i>Please, let this window be fixed!</i> He thought desperately to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo is amazement, and some surprised cries around him, the various pieces of the window shot up into place, and with a strange, grainy noise, formed one complete, unbroken sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed with joy. Others loudly asked what the hell. But he still had it. He turned to look at the wolf, which was already a surprising distance away. He struggled to regain the lost ground as the wolf\u2019s pace had picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shrink back to your original size</i> Tyler thought at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf responded by stomping on a bench, splintering it in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it! Why wouldn\u2019t it work? Why couldn\u2019t he undo what he\u2019s started?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it hit him. He couldn\u2019t undo it. He wished the wolf to grow bigger. So any wish to make him stop or shrink would contradict that. They were being overridden. Or at least, that\u2019s what he thought was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, he couldn\u2019t tell the wolf to be aggressive AND calm down. He went over the wishes frantically in his head. How could he control the situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grow slower. Grow a billion times slower\u2026</i> he thought, but quickly remembered that he had already specified a much faster rate of growth in an earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang entered a handyman store. He had to duck underneath the entrance, and remained stooped as his head brushed the roof. Tyler watched from the outside fang squeezed through an isle, his broad frame knocking just about everything off the shelves on either side. This only lasted a few steps before the wolf loudly growled and simply pushed the shelves over, the violent movement spilt everything off the shelves. The noise was deafening as just about every item in the store hit the floor at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople screamed. Some ran out, others were caught under the falling shelves. Tyler cried out in horror. This was all his fault, he had to find a way to stop it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang continued deeper into the store, kicking and knocking over anything that stood in his way. Eventually he found what he was looking for, and turned right back out of the store. The wolf looked straight at Tyler. The drake immediately panicked. What the hell was he doing standing in the middle of the shopfront? Of course Fang would see him once he turned around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the wolf\u2019s eyes drifted over him like oil on water. Tyler stood frozen as the wolf approached him and then passed right by him, close enough for the wolf\u2019s thigh to brush his shoulder. His black furry hips passed above his head, his enormous low swinging testicles were now eyelevel. His huge, naked body had a powerful masculine scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart pounded. That was a hell of a lot of wolf. He turned around after the wolf passed him, the hairy black tail swatting him in the face as it swayed down from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Tyler remembered his first wish. \u2018Go and bother someone else\u2019. The wolf saw him, but he couldn\u2019t react to him. Tyler took as step back as he looked up at the enormous black ass that had stopped just in front of him. The G-string still fit, he noticed as it hugged impossibly onto the wolf. Just as he had wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang unravelled the tape measure he had \u2018retrieved\u2019 from the hardware store behind him.  He carefully bent his enormous frame over and placed the end under one of his enlarged toes, and carefully stood up again, unravelling the tape as he did so. He held the top of the tape measure level to the top of his head. He waited patiently. Slowly a grin grew up his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the tape continued to come out. It made a thin metallic scrunching noise as it slowly spilled more and more inches of yellow tape as Fang held it steady. A stirring in the wolf\u2019s loins above Tyler caught his gaze. Again, Fang\u2019s cock beached his sheath, but this time it seemed to have more purpose. It shot up several inches in a few seconds as the wolf gave a guttural, approving growl. His whole sheath seemed to thicken and retract as his enormous penis continued to outgrow its confines. Underneath, his pair of grapefruit sized testicles churned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir! You have to leave!\u201d A nervous but forthright voice called up to the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s head snapped to the voice\u2019s owner, a rather tall and stocky horse in a security uniform. Tyler suddenly realised that there were three other uniformed men standing in front of them. But as imposing as they might have seemed, combined they were now less than half the size of Fang, whose tape measured read ten foot ten and counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fact not lost on the goliath wolf, which sneered and growled down at them. \u201cNo I fucking don\u2019t, are you gonna try and make me bitch?!\u201d he barked. Tyler could practically feel waves of hostility flow from the wolf in front of him, as the fur on his tail and back seemed to stand upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards stared nervously up at the wolf, their eyes darting briefly at his swelling cock that roughly eye level to them. The horse pulled out a taser and took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, you have to leave immediately.\u201d He called up at the wolf, his voice was pleading as much as instructing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang gave a loud chuckle as he bore his teeth. In one quick movement, he stepped forward and swung his arm down on the horse, his fist catching the beefy equine on the side of his torso. The guard did manage to discharge the taser into the wolf\u2019s chest before he was sent flying from the bone-breaking contact, but his finger was only on the trigger for a fraction of a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grunted out in pain as he ripped the dangling wire from his chest. The other three guards pulled out Tasers of their own and wasted no time in firing them, each hitting the wolf in rapid succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRAHHGH!\u201d The wolf cried out in a violent, booming voice as his muscles tensed and he fell to his knees. Tyler cried out and backed away from the confrontation, but could do nothing but watch as the wolf slowly grabbed one of the cords that was electrocuting him, crying out in anger and pain as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ripped the taser from his body. Then another. He was moving freely by the time he yanked the third one out of him. He roared in fury as he picked himself up from his knees again. One of the guards ran away. The wolf stepped forwards and grabbed one that stayed. With ridiculous ease, he launched the guard through a nearby shopfront window, the contact so forceful the thick pane of glass didn\u2019t seem to slow him down as he disappeared inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last guard cried out and started to run away, but Fang barked after him and quickly chased him. The guard weaved his way through various abandoned stalls, but fang\u2019s huge eleven foot frame simply charged through them, his thick and powerful foot paws decimating the largely chipboard and glass structures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was on top of the guard in seconds. He cried out in panic, but his desperate flailing was powerless to stop the wolf, who pinned him on his back. Fang panted heavily on the guard as he stared at him with wild eyes. A large sneer furrowed his muzzle, revealing all of his two-inch long canines, and a lot of gum to boot. A single paw was enough to encapsulate the guard\u2019s chest, and as the guard struggled to breathe from the pressure the wolf effortlessly bore down on his chest, Fang chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat fucking hurt bitch!\u201d He sneered at the guard, his tone more condescending than angry now he had the upper hand. Just above the area where the guard\u2019s feet helplessly flailed, the black wolf\u2019s cock was engorging again. \u201cDo you know what I do to bitches that hurt me?\u201d he asked malevolently.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler ran towards Fang as he pinned the guard, the short slender drake trying to move both swiftly and deftly to avoid the loose fibreboard and glass that littered the floor.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe guard, a six and a half foot equine bodybuilder, cried out in terror as he flayed his limbs as much as he could under the wolf's paw. He looked nothing more than a child against the hulking naked black beast that pinned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang paused a moment as he let his question land. Tyler could see the wolfs arm thicken even further, as an engorged vein grew down his bicep, its definition pressing through his shiny black pelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Fangs legs, his cock spilled rapidly out of his massive black sheath, the tip of the slick pink flesh racing steadily towards the ground as it thickened. A wicked smile split the wolfs long muzzle, his enormous teeth barred as his golden eyes glared wide and furious. He leaned in close to the terrified guard, his long tongue licking his lips slowly as he savoured the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuck them.\" He rumbled softly into the horses ear, his voice low and booming. The horse whimpered in response as he absorbed the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Fangs enormous body sprang to life in a violent flurry of movement. The wolf grabbed the horse with both hands and roughly lifted him in the air, flipped him around, and slammed him hard into the glossy tiles again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse barely had time to whinny before the breath was knocked out of him, his body going limp from the impact. An intense panic rose from Tyler's stomach as he saw the wolf roughly push the guard down with one hand, while ripping his pants off with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud tearing sound echoed through the mall as the wolf tore the fabric free savagely, the guards belt snapping with a loud bang. After several rough grabs, Fang had cleared all the layers of clothes, leaving the guards bare chester rump exposed below his flowing black tail. Growling, the hulking wolf then pulled the horses hips up onto his knees while continuing to press his chest into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No!' Tyler cried out as Fang lifted his leg over the dazed horse, his thick cock swaying wildly as the wolf positioned himself. Time seemed to slow as he watched fang grip the base of his cock with his free hand, his huge swaying sack churning with anticipation as he prepared to breed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler knew he had to save the innocent guard. He didn't know if it was because he knew that he would be safe since Fang couldn't bother him, or because it was something more gratuitous, but Tyler focused and made his next wish almost impulsively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish I was in that guards place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Tyler had finished the thought, he felt the world around him tear. An overwhelming force knocked the wind out of him; bearing down on him from above him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Tyler to gather his bearings, but he soon placed himself under the wolf's paw, his naked ass lifted compromisingly in the air, just like the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed as Fang paused; while he was ready to have his way with the horse, he was suddenly paralysed now that it was the tiny purple drake under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler trembled as he felt the wolfs breath blast powerfully down onto the back of his neck, the hot and humid gusts sent shivers across his purple scales. Tyler was pinned down so forcefully that he couldn't move his head at all, but he could feel the heat radiating from wolfs monstrous cock hovering just inches from his naked ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs terrified as the tiny drake was, the thought excited him; he was absolutely nothing underneath the giant slab of wolf, and the idea of him being dominated so absolutely turned him on even as he whimpered softly in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt the blood rush to his own manhood, enlarging his already semi-engorged cock as it dangled beneath his feet. His whole loin tingled with the excitement of a forbidden lust, anticipating that huge pillar of wolf entering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, Tyler felt the wolf's paw grow even larger against his back, his fingers buckling and spreading wider as they extended slightly further. He could hear the soft wet sounds of wolfs bones and joints adjusting as he expanded slowly above him; growing more powerful with every passing moment. Tyler moaned softly at the thought. He was so aroused by the situation, and he felt so dirty because of it. What was wrong with him he wondered? But in that moment, he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was with more disappointment than relief when he sensed the wolf shift his weight away from him, and he saw the paw that had been guiding the wolfs thick cock come crashing down on the floor in front of his face with a loud thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the paw that held him down lifted, coming to rest on the floor on other side of his head. Tyler gasped for air as the pressure lifted abruptly, his lungs burning and his ribs aching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling meekly, he turned himself around and stared up at the wolf above him, his heart skipping as he beheld the sheer magnitude of the wolf  that enveloped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang squatted over the tiny purple drake; two hands the size of his torso were planted either side of his head. From them, powerful arms sprouted six feet into the air, each a foot thick of pure muscle that ripped through his shiny pelt as they strained with the weight of his gargantuan chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfs torso was the size of a double doored refrigerator, slabbed with thick chunks of steely muscles that rippled underneath his shiny black coat. Shoulders the size of soccer balls connected to Pictorials the size of watermelons protruded from his cavernous chest. From behind, wide thick lats flared out like a giant cobras hood, while from the front, enormous mounds of abdominal muscles flowed down his slightly tapering torso. Fang's Broad hips squatted low to the ground, suspended by thighs as thick as tree trunks. The enormous muscles strained and bulged under the effort of suspending what must have easily been over a ton of wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the wolfs groin that commanded Tyler's attention. The three foot long, half foot thick pillar protruded obscenely from the wolfs retracted sheath towards the tiny purple drake, its flared head stopping only inches short of his exposed purple scales. It swayed and bobbed softly as it hung, its slick pink flesh covered in a mess of thick veins that flared with each beat of the wolfs powerful heart. A long, thick rope of clear pre hung from its head, trailing with each movement as it pooled steadily on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of cantaloupe sized testicles hung low and heavy beneath the cock, churning wildly within the fuzzy black sack as it swung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swore softly under his laboured breath as he watched the wolf's chest expand and contract with each hefty breath. He was overwhelmed by both the sight and smell of Fang, who's musk hung thick in the air around him. Tyler's own cock rose its full 8 inches into the air, the normally impressive black tool ridiculously dwarfed in front of Fang's monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed dryly as he looked up into the wolf's eyes, which stared back at him in anger and confusion. They shared a tense moment of silence before the wolf's eyes abruptly slid up, his face contorting into a smiling sneer as he grunted softly. With a loud smothered crack, Fang's chest burst wider, his ribs opening and lengthening underneath his pelt. The fibers of his pecs tensed as they inflated in bursts, stretching nipples the size of Tyler's palm wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth surged down the wolf's torso in a series of wet pops, the deep trenches that split his abs lengthening and pulling the thick mounds of muscles further apart. Fangs cock twitched as his balls swelled bigger, inching closer to the ground, before jerking wildly as the pink veined flesh burst thicker at the base, the growth flowing up the shaft in a wave as the head surged inches forwards, closing the gap between it and the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler moaned uneasily as he watched the wolf's cock crash into his own as if it were a lioness pouncing on its helpless prey. Fangs giant cock expelled a large glob of pre as it hit, flinging a thick rope across the drakes chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scrambled backwards, conflicted between intense fear and arousal. His eyes locked onto the wolfs as he picked himself up ungracefully, stumbling backwards. Despite the wolf's crouched stance, Fang's enormous head still hung a good two feet above the drake by the time he had settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stared wide eyed at each other a moment before they both jolted, the sound of the malls alarms abruptly piercing through the cavernous mall around them. The wolf scowled as his ears shot down flat in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a curt humph that reverberated powerfully across the mall, Fang leant back and picked a started to stand. Tyler watched the wolf's hands leave the ground as his head ascended higher and higher above him. Fang's ripped black torso steadily straightened as his gargantuanly thick thighs bulged and strained as they lifted the wolfs abdomen and then pelvis above the drakes eyeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a surprised yelp, Tyler jumped abruptly to the side in order to avoid the wolfs three and a half foot cock as it swung heavily in front of and then above his head, flinging a thick clear rope as it rose. Fang's hocked feet, each the height of one of Tyler's legs, shuffled with two powerful thuds as the wolf finally stood fully erect, his flat ears fully upright some twelve and a half feet above the ground.</span></div></div>",

With a demonic growl, the wolf slowly turned around and faced a band of onlookers that had milled to witness him some thirty meters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf stood a moment, his stance wide as he stared the crowd down. Tyler stared dumbly from behind the wolfs towering black legs. Abruptly, his eyes widened and his hands slapped down to his groin, vainly attempting to cover his erection as he realised that the only pair of clothing between the two of them was his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost members of the crowd were filming them on their phones, faces amazed and weary of the gigantic wolf that looked over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfs body emitted countless dull pops and cracks as his thick form continued to expand unabated. Tyler could see one of Fangs shoulder blades jutt further out as his shoulders thickened. His taught furry skin slid subtly across the small of his back, his pelt stretching from his lats inflating in a short burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfs head jumped several inches higher as each of his vertebrae lengthened in a cascade down his back. His thighs inched wider, and the slabs of muscles on his buttocks thickened above Tyler's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake licked his lips as he swallowed dryly. The situation aroused him ridiculously; his engorged manhood itched for attention as it strained against his hands. \"Fang!\" Tyler called up to the wolfs back, resting a small purple hand resting on the side of an enormous black thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The wolf grunted impatiently without taking his attention from the onlookers, his booming voice echoing ominously through the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler licked his lips, completely at a loss for a follow up. He had lost control of the situation, and he didn't want to make any more wishes unless he had to; they were proving to be unmitigated disasters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop.\" He asked helplessly of the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf chuckled disdainfully, the curt laughter crackling over the sound of the alarm like distant thunder. \"No.\" He said simply as he shook his head slowly. He took a deep breath, savouring the sensations. \"I'm still growing.\" He said softly, turning his head to stare down at Tyler from behind him, his fierce golden eyes almost shimmering with intensity. \"And It's fucking awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Tyler felt Fangs thy thicken under his hand, the bones beneath the mounds of muscle groaned and cracked, surging inches higher as his feet grew longer. The wolfs tail shuddered as his ass lifted upwards, now so far above the little drake that it was almost out of his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang grunted in approval as he turned his attention back to the milling crowd. His hackles rising. \"What the fuck are you all looking at?!\" He barked at them, his voice as deep and powerful as a lions roar. \"You want a piece of this?!\" He demanded, gripping the base of his cock with a loud slap. He shook the rod at them threateningly, and many in the crowd took a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf sneered. \"That's what I fucking thought!\" He taunted before looking at the ceiling with a snarl. \"And shut this fucking noise off!!\" He roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler flinched behind the wolf as his booming voice reverberated through him \"Fang, you have to stop this! The police will come soon!\" He pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf cracked his neck as his muzzle lengthened. \"Good. Just let em try it.\" He said defiantly but calmly. \"I don't know what just happened Tyler. But you totally cock blocked me.\" He growled. \"I need to fuck something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed, aroused by the idea but fearful of the way Fang was looking at the crowd. \"Well then, why don't you go to the bathroom and... You know, rub one out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scoffed. \"Where's the fun in that?\" He asked dismissively as he abruptly advanced towards the crowd, the floor shaking as his massive paw planted on the tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, wait!\" Tyler called desperately to the wolf as the crowd started to panic.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler cringed as his mouth opened, but he blurted out the words above the shouts of the crowd. \"Why don't go I into the bathroom with you, then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's steps stopped, the pause as terrifying as anything else he could do. His head slowly turns, an amused grin rising to his face. \"You?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me,\" The diminutive dragon responded, his entire body trembling. \"Let them go, and I'll go with you. You can do whatever you want with me,\" He muttered through clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gave a boisterous laugh, his body turning towards the miniature dragon. \"You think you can handle all of this, runt?\" Tyler's breaths stopped when Fang turns, his three-foot-something shaft perked with anticipation and wet with pre. He shoved it forward, letting the thick length push up against the dragon. The force behind the shove knocks Tyler off of his feet for a moment, the dragon suspended by the steel pillar of Fang's erection. The wolf bellowed out, a louder laugh escaping Fang's twisted mouth. \"You can't handle an inch of this beast! What makes you think you can take all of me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's hand scrambled for something to hold onto, and his arms make contact against the wolf's shaft. He clung tight, his hands and both of his arms rubbing up against the wolf's length. The feeling was enough to make the wolf shudder, but not stop. Tyler's heart raced as he holds on, barely keeping himself from being thrown back. He'd gotten the wolf's attention now, but he didn't know how long he'll hold it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph. Not bad, runt. Gives me a few ideas.\" He chuckled before a couple of thick fingers grasp around the dragon's hands, pulling him up. \"But I'll need more than just a shrimp like you.\" He tossed Tyler aside, the dragon tumbling in front of him. \"Why waste my time with you when everybody's going to be my plaything?\" He roared with laughter, his announcement sending a few people scrambling. Everybody darted away, people tripping and fumbling against each other in their efforts to escape. The wolf allowed them run for the moment. There's no need to rush, not when he can enjoy every footstep, looming a little higher, getting a little thicker and strong with each moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes turned back to the small purple figure on the ground. Tyler strained to his feet, a little battered but intact. He planted himself in place, the world around him shaking. It's hard standing his ground against the wolf, and it got even harder as the giant got closer. But he has to fix this, no matter how bad it gets. He knew how bad Fang can be. He knew better than anybody. Even before all of this, Fang was atrocious. He'd never stay around the wolf if he could help it. He'd dish out plenty of verbal abuse, and more than a little physical abuse with it. Even in the best of times, Fang was a bastard. But right now, Fang was a hundred times worse, and if he kept growing, things would keep going downhill. He couldn't let Fang leave, and he can't be allowed into the crowd. He had to stop Fang. This is all his fault. He shouldn't have gotten so reckless with his wishes. He shouldn't have given this kind of power to Fang. He has to save everybody. So now, he has to do whatever he's able to. Even if it means...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck me. Don't even think of screwing with anybody else. Just fuck me, you bastard.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's expression froze for the briefest of moments. But his eyes stop wandering, and they return to the dragon. He laughed as he picks the dragon up again, bringing him up to eye level. \"Still around? You really want this, don't you? Didn't know you were such a fag. But... Ah, I see.\" Fang laughs as his hand reaches down, a couple of thick fingers clenching around Tyler's rock-hard length. The dragon yelped, his face flush with embarrassment and anger. His mind had been busy, but his body refuses to relent, enjoying Fang's physical form more than he'll admit. \"Like seeing all of me, don't you, fag? Least you have enough taste for that.\" He grinned as he moves his other arm, starting to push it into a flex. \"I'll give you what you want. I'll show you what a man like me is capable of,\" He said, his shaft jerking up larger, a thickening glob of pre appearing on the tip of his length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon murmurs as he watched the flex, that massive mound peaking a little higher with each passing second. Tyler holds his breath as he Fang posed for him, lats shifted out to show. \"Like that, slut? You want to get close, don't you?\" He's pulled tight into both arms, put into a crushing bear-hug. He yelped and struggled to breathe, but Fang laughed it off. \"What, can't handle it? I'm barely trying here!\" He held the dragon in one hand before tossing Tyler into the air, the dragon gasping and flailing for grip, his arms only managing to make contact with Fang's neck before he falls. His body lands and thuds against the wolf, arms dangling from his neck. Even his neck was built, too think for Tyler to get a good handhold on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, want to get your hands all over, huh? Go ahead, shrimp.\" The wolf grins and pushes a massive hand on Tyler's body, before pushing him down and along. Tyler cringes as he's forced against Fang's body. Both thick pecs bump against him, nudging his head around. His knees bump against each of the wolf's individual eight packs, each surging a little thicker than the last as he goes. His feet kick and dangle before they make contact with his shaft, the wetness spreading against his body. \"Fuck, feels good... Guess a fag like you knows how to please a man like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he's thrown flat onto the ground. He gasps for breath, only to see the wolf's silhouette standing right over him. \"Like that? Your little stiffie there says you do.\" The dragon mumbles, before his eyes widen. A fuzzy foot pushes down against his shaft, pressed in place by a leg growing thicker than Tyler's torso. The rough fur brushes up just enough to drive him closer, forcing him closer and closer to the edge. \"Just wait until I really start fucking you. Bet you'll blow before I even get started.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarm fills Tyler's mind as the wolf manhandles him. The wolf was always rough with him before, more than happy to shove him around or gives him a smack once in a while. Sure, he had avoided any serious injuries, but that was because David kept Fang from going overboard. But now, Fang could use him however he wants. And with that monster? That tool that's quickly approaching four feet of length? On a wolf that's already approaching 14 feet, and will soon be three times his size? Fang's not the gentle type, and there's no way he could take it all. Fuck, Fang's about to pound him in the middle of the mall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallows as his eyes glance down, pausing at the wolf's pecs. Those massive mounds keep tensing and twitching. He's not sure if Fang's growing or just showing off, but each of those tenses leaves him a little bigger. And even his growing stream of pre starts to drip against him. \"W-wait. What about the bathroom. Fang, we can't-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doing what I want,\" He growled, a mad twinkle in his eye. \"Let them watch. They all want to see what real sex is like. They want to see a real fuck looks like. And I'm gonna give them a show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way around it. He had to make a wish. He had to figure out some way of taking that monster. His mind runs faster and faster, his pounding headache making it difficult to make a plan. Could he wish he could handle Fang's shaft? Did his wishes even work on himself? Maybe he could wish for a small change for Fang, something that would actually work. What determines if a wish works or not? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stray thought catches through Tyler's mind. One of his commands stopped - Fang's no longer trying to 'bother somebody else'. He'd gotten the wolf's attention before his desperate wish, even if Fang was focused on other people. But why? Was there a time limit on his power? Maybe Fang was 'done' bothering other people, so the wish wore off? Or could it be something else? Did it have something to do with what the dragon wanted? Or something that Fang wanted? He should've figured his power out before he used it like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis panicking mind kept going at a mile a minute, barely keeping focus as Fang moves again, his shaft casting a shadow over the dragon. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler practically squealed a the thought of it!   It was like any childhood fantasy of getting their own puppy dog, but this one was for some decidedly adult reasons.    While he'd never thought himself into bondage, the immediate image of fang on a leash caused enough swelling in the purple drake's pants to make him wonder if it wasn't worth a try.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang, released from the most recent urgings, blinked and looked around, then down.     He hid his shock well, and gruffly racked the bikini top.    His ears lay flat he cast wary looks around, pulling his t-shirt back on over his broad shoulders and thick biceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler steadied himself and did his best to clear his mind, which wasn't easy given all the fantasies that needed to be pushed aside.    Closing his eyes, he breathed deep, and focused once more on that sensation in the back of his mind.   Every time it grew easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Fang paused, lowering the hem of his t-shirt back into place.  His jaw went slack and his eyes crossed slightly.  Tyler realized he was undertaking something way, waaay bigger than he had anticipated as he felt out the intangible reaches of Fang's consciousness.    Before, he had simply been nudging and pushing, suggesting things to people.  On Fang he had leaned pretty hard in suggesting the bikini-wearing, but that was still just pushing and pulling. He was now going to take something completely away.   How do you remove just one part, though?  It really didn't matter; Tyler was going to remove all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler trusted the instincts the power gave him on how to use it, and he clenched his eyes as he focused.    Having decided to strip that noggin like a used Chevrolet, he applied pressure from all sides, and all directions.   Harder.  Harder still.    He found himself holding his breath, pushing and compressing and flexing those mental muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's eyelid twitched and he gurgled a little in the back of his throat.   Tyler's awareness left the store and clothes behind, his senses deadening as all his focus was directed to Fang's consciousness.  He started to feel success...it was like mental fibers were snapping, the cohesion starting to break down and-...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant afterwards Tyler's eyes flared open, he felt, tasted, heard, saw, and smelled every possible experience that came from the collapse of Fang's mind.  It was like trying to push a tree back into the ground, and while giving a great deal of resistance, there came a moment where it just got sucked into the ground.  Fang's mind was crushed flat into the bottom of his figurative skull.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gasped and let out a breath, feeling abruptly drained.   He realized only too late that it had taken nearly all of his power to do it!   Looking with his mind's eye to that part of the brain the power came from, he found only crumbs.  It was gone!   Used up?   Would it come back?   At least the headache was gone, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's jaw snapped shut and his eyes realigned, the dopey expression fading from his face with the click of those teeth. His ears perked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler quickly forgot his lament as a smile grew on his face.  Crouched behind the rack of the tank-tops, the diminutive purple dragon let his tail twitch in his excitement.    He wanted to see if it had worked.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's muzzle split open into a simple grin, his pink canine tongue lolling out the side of his mouth as he started panting.    There was no more characteristic or perfect face of the dumb and happy pet.   It had worked!    Tyler practically jumped with glee as his mind returned to taking advantage of the situation, of all the things he could do, both to Fang and to get Fang to do to him.  Tyler's attention was focused more when the giant muscled wolf stopped his panting.  His nose was flaring, the huge canine taking in sniffs from the air.     With these breaths his head very slowly turned towards and focused directly on Tyler's hiding place.   The dragon's eye-ridges rose in surprise.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's eyes focused where his nose was directing him, and narrowed as they saw the nearly-hidden sheen of purple flesh.      When his lips pulled back to reveal a smile, Tyler felt a chill shoot down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had made a mistake.   A huge, horrifying mistake.   Tyler wanted to wither on the spot and his legs were paralyzed, but still he was unable to look away from what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was a jerk.   This was a known universal fact, probably discovered by Einstein and calculated by God with how unquestionably true it was.    There were aspects of Fang's personality, too, that one might have assumed to be more animal and feral in nature.    There was a truth to that as well.   Something about that wolf harkened back to more ancient times; the predatory way he walked, the oversized fangs, and even his massive size, all seemed so...caveman.    His lack of intelligence only added to the image, and the ferocity with which Fang pursued sports was certainly more energetic than most other competitors.   Not to mention the way he haunted those few unlucky souls that were perpetually his target of ridicule.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this, Fang was still a product of civilization.    He wore clothes, he followed the rules (mostly), and even when it came to his opponents on the sports field or the 'wimps' he shoved around in the hallway, it wasn't very violent.   He didn't get physical beyond a shove or trip, and on the rare occasion that a teacher or parent intervened, he went about his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's smile used to frighten Tyler.    Never again.    No, the look that had occasionally haunted Tyler's nightmares would no longer scare this dragon, because on the face of nearly eight feet of black-furred wolf Tyler saw something infinitely worse.    The glare, the show of teeth, hungry gleam that were on the wolf's muzzle now were purely and simply animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had liked to describe Fang as predatory, but now he well and truly was.   In his foolishness Tyler sought to strip down everything he hated in Fang, to take the wolf down to his barest sense.   Unfortunately, Tyler had forgotten that Fang's purest essence was a beast.   A true predator.   An animal that wouldn't hesitate to kill if it felt threatened, or challenged...or hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if knowing what went through the mind of the little dragon, Fang's tongue slipped past his teeth and licked across his lips.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler wanted to run, he really did, but his legs refused to function.    Fang the beast, free of inhibitions or morality, placed a giant hand-paw on the rack of bikinis and slid the entire stand sideways.    Tyler whimpered, barely managing to back up as the wolf stepped forward, and shoved another clothes-display aside like it were on wheels.     A tiny protest from the store clerk was completely ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had the good sense to start moving by the time the rack of tank-tops was shoved aside.   He had barely made it two feet.     It was as if the beast were waiting for its quarry to run, to savor the chase, and with a single bound, a constriction tightened around the 5'1\u201d dragon's chest.   It was a pair of arms that belonged to 7'10\u201d of wolf, arms that bulged with fur-swathed strength.   Arms that bodily lifted the dragon off the ground, foot-paws left to dangle around Fang's knees.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was trembling, yelping meekly as a drop of drool fell to his shoulder.   The feral-looking muzzle had lowered to the side of his, jaws open, tongue lolling.    With a building rumble in the heavily muscled chest, Fang lowered his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pink tongue slurped from collar to neck and all the way up the side of the dragon's head.    The wolf smacked his lips, and Fang let out a happy growl.    His whiskers tickled at Tyler's chin as he started licking in long, slow  strokes up at the dragon's neck, and then shoulder.    Fang even pressed his cool nose in and started to nibble, playfully it seemed, at the exposed flesh through Tyler's t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm....can you please leave the store?\u201d  The timid employee squeaked, raising a finger and then dropping it as the titanic wolf growled loudly, and went back to licking his 'prey'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was dumbstruck, and after a long moment restarting his brain managed to decide...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The faint buzzing of a flickering street lamp echoed through the otherwise silent street, nothing but the rare revving of a passing car's engine marring the otherwise silence of the street. Tyler found himself walking home by himself, after a long night at the shop, doing the year's taxes. Such last minute accounting was what put him in his current predicament of walking home at 3 in the morning. What he didn't know, is that he wasn't as alone as he thought this morning... a shadowy figure was stalking him, darting from alleyway to alleyway, tailing after Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly an arm wrapped around Tyler's head, forearm shoving against his muzzle and keeping him from yelling out for help, as the looming figure tugged Tyler backwards, the two of them disappearing into the shadows of a nearby alleyway. Muffled yelps and groans tried to escape Tyler's lips, but the arm around his muzzle kept him from letting out anything more than a barely audible whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow lets just make this nice and simple, Kay shorty?\u201d A gruff, harsh voice growled out from behind him. Tyler was able to turn his head a bit and get a glimpse at the scruffy, slightly bloated face of the burly Bulldog that was holding him hostage. \u201cYour just gonna gimme your wallet and then your gonna go on your way... no heroics and noone has to get hurt.\u201d he snarled out, giving a harder squeeze to Tyler's head as if for emphasis of what disobedience could mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn't even think about it, natural defensive instincts kick in, his jaw opened and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAUUURG\u201d The man yelled, as rows of sharp, draconic teeth sunk into his arm. Out of reflex he released his diminutive captive, as he stumbled back, clutching his arm in pain. What he didn't notice was the small flecks of a strange dark green liquid pouring into the wounds that sent a mildly burning tingle flooding down his arm and into the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler groaned and rubbed at his head, trying to get his bearings after being manhandled and then thrown to the ground. His head turned around to glance back at his attacker, as if suddenly realizing his terrifying predicament... only to blink a bit when, where that looming canine had been moments ago, instead was just a pile of fabric... no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nclothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, he started to move forward, slowly reaching out a paw and pushing at the shirt with his fingers, only to yelp in surprise as he felt something moving inside. The collar of the shirt pulled backwards and a tiny, naked bulldog, rather burly in both muscle and fat, rolled his way ungracefully out of the shirt and down next to one of the large black leather shoes he had been wearing... the former beastly assailant... now barely 6 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler just stared. Watching the now miniscule doll sized canine stumbling around on the edge of clothes that formerly had barely fit him, but now were more like fumigation tarps in size to him. The bulldog's face raised up, and after a brief moment of staring up at the now towering purple dragon hovering over him he gave a yipe of surprise and fell backwards onto his ass, scooting back up against the side of one of his shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cw... what the hell did you do to me?! What did you bite me with?!\u201d he yelped out in a now rather high pitched and squeaky voice. What did he mean bit him... Tyler blinked a bit as he reflexively raised his fingers up to his mouth, thumb brushing along one of his frontal fangs, feeling a strange wetness too it, some liquid a noticeable consistency thicker than saliva, and pulled his fingers back to look at the thin green liquid atop his finger. Was that... venom? This had to be some kind of dream... People don't just suddenly shrink down to half a foot in height, much less from some suddenly manifesting venom from someone like him... did they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... the more he thought about it... the more the 'why' started to push into the back of his head, being overpowered by more proactive thoughts. What if it was true... what if he really could make people smaller by biting them... what should he do with such an ability. And, more importantly, as he looked down to the shrunken bulldog, he asked himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do with his unintentional first victim </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Why bother with this little shit, he had way more important targets to think about. The now, at least to the mugger, massive purple dragon grinned toothily down at him. He could do something terrible to the little guy... well, worse than what he already had done, but part of him thought maybe this, by itself, was enough to teach the guy a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you have fun down there... good luck on your next mugging\u201d Tyler rumbled out tauntingly, winking down at the terrified, shrunken bulldog who immediately began barking and yelping at Tyler, alternating between pleads and demands to turn him back and help him. Both of  which Tyler completely ignored as he casually started walking his way back towards his home, humming happily to himself all the while. The tiny, helpless mugger left in a pile of his own clothes in the middle of a dark alleyway, left to fend for himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Tyler got to the front door he was practically shaking with excitement. Sure, it was kind of crazy that he had somehow shrunk someone by biting them, but the sheer thought of what he had done was overpowering any worries or concerns as to how or why it had happened. On his way home he had been trying to figure out exactly how it had happened, and had started to notice a tiny pressure along his upper gums, that after a bit of practice (And a lot of silly faces) he figured out how to flex a tiny set of muscles along his lips that would squeeze what he could only assume were some kind of 'venom sacs', which caused them to excrete a thin, runny green liquid across two of his frontal fangs. He had to be careful the first time he figured it out, as he almost swallowed some of the venom, and he had no idea if that would work as well as biting someone. The last thing he needed was to be smaller! A series of spitting and couching up saliva later, he was confident he hadn't swallowed any of it, and had continued his planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he pushed the front door open, he heard a soft groan come from the couch in response to the noise, and leaned over a bit to see David stretched out across the couch like he often did, a beer bottle held in one paw. He was drunk. A not all together unusual occurrence, but an annoying one to say the least. David could get pretty smashed when he drank, and while he had never been known to be an 'angry' drunk, his oblivious nature seemed to only magnify significantly. Tyler would be on the ground with his arms twisted behind his back, David pushing a knee down into Tyler's chest before he would realize he was hurting Tyler and would move away. His 'playful banter' about Tyler's size would escalate into borderline insulation despite, to David, still being just playful ribbing. Though worst of all, at times, seemed to be how it robbed David of nearly all of his modesty, ending up in the dragon turning almost Fang level narcissistic about his size. Tyler would find the drunken athlete of a dragon standing in front of a mirror, licking over one of his own biceps or telling himself how hot he was, while wearing nothing but his underwear or sometimes even fully nude... and once or twice Tyler had even walked in on David outright jerking off to himself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm?..\u201d David groaned tiredly, lazily raising his head up, eyes somewhat droopy from his inebriation as he waved clumsily to Tyler. \u201cThere's my brotherly brotherbro! Heeeeeey\u201d He slurred out, grinning toothily over at Tyler, before taking another swig of his beer. He started to try to sit up, but then quickly fell back down onto his back again, seeming too dizzy to move around that quickly at the moment.  \u201cWass goin aaaaaun bro?\u201d he would murmur out, again raising the beer to his lips to drink from it, only to find it empty and cause him to pout in dissapointment. \u201cBrooooo I need another beer\u201d he would practically whine out, which normally Tyler would find either incredibly annoying, or highly funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Fine.\u201d Tyler grumbled, knowing it was far easier to just comply with the drunken dragon, rather than provoke him in any manner. Though, as he started making his way to the kitchen, an idea started forming in his head, and a wide grin spread across his lips. This seemed as good of an opportunity as any to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler practically leapt over the couch on his way as he rushed towards the kitchen. He heard David drunkenly rumble out his thanks, as well as adding some muttering about big men and their attendants or something along those lines, Tyler wasn't even really paying attention. He started to dig through the refrigerator, grabbing a couple of beers and setting them out on the counter top, snapping the top off one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a minute or two, he was still getting used to that faint, barely noticeable 'puffyness' underneath his gums, where he could just barely feel the new venom sacks he had recently become aware of. It took a bit of practice (not to mention several rather stupid looking faces again) before he figured out how to flex the right muscles in his jawline to squeeze those venom sacks and start excreting that thin, slightly sweet scented venom out of their sac without swallowing it. Carefully, Tyler raised up the beer and let several drops of the venom drip down into the thickly scented alcoholic liquid, before snapping the top back onto it, and repeating the process with the other one... couldn't hurt to have a backup right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his tainted beers in hand, Tyler quickly dashed his way back into the living room where David was still sprawled out across the couch, tiredly flipping through the channels with his eyes slid half closed and his head seeming to be constantly in a minor state of motion. It would slowly dip down then suddenly jerk back up, only to drift to one side then snap back place again... Damn, how much had he already had to drink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere ya go, bro\u201d Tyler offered, handing one of the beers to David, who quickly snatched it up and, after effortlessly popping the top off of it, started rapidly guzzling down its entire contents. Loud, rhythmic 'gulpgulpgulp' seeming to echo through the room as Tyler watched David's throat and adam's apple bulge and flex with each mouthful, within seconds emptying the entire beer bottle where it was then carelessly thrown to the side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cman... that tasted kinda weird. Or maybe I just had too many\u201d he groaned softly, idly rubbing at his head with his palm, eyes sliding closed as he felt a new wave of dizzyness spread across him... \u201coooh man I think I'm redefining tipsy...\u201d he groaned out  tiredly... seemingly totally oblivious to what had Tyler's eyes spread wide. He watched as Davids looming, muscular form began to pull in on itself, his taunt, skintight shirt starting to loosen and hang limp on him, waist no longer filling his work out shorts to the brim, instead leaving them hanging limply across his diminishing tush.  Quicker and quicker David pulled inwards, arms sliding upwards and no longer long enough to reach the ground with him laying on his front. His legs, which normally hung off the armrest of the couch were now pulling past it and tugging inwards in mirror of his head...  and barely half a minute after David had finished guzzling down the beer, Tyler could no longer see his formerly towering brother... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, Tyler started to step forward, slowly reaching a paw out to poke at David's shirt, only to reflexively recoil when he saw a small bulge shift around underneath the fabric. Standing there and watching with rapt attention as the bulge stumbled and shifted its way towards the collar of his shirt, and out of it stepped a miniscule, doll sized version of his brother. Stark naked, obviously half aroused (Which was no surprise to Tyler, knowing full well that David got easily 'aroused' when drunk) and barely 8 inches tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhoa... that felt weird...\u201d David murmured drunkenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler struggling not to burst out laughing at the formerly deep, rumbling tone of David's voice reduced to a laughably high pitched squeak. David stood with his bare tush facing Tyler, staring at the back of the couch, his head slowly raising to look over the cushioned expanse of the backrest curiously, alcohol-addled brain struggling to make sense of what he was seeing, before he heard a deep and (to him) Rumblingly loud voice growl out \u201coh David... over here...\u201d Which caused him to turn around and find himself staring at a massive billboard sized grinning, purple fleshed muzzle staring down at him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey 'bro'...

For the fifth time in three hours, there was no answer .\u201cFilthy piece of SHIT!\u201d Tyler spat as he stuffed his phone angrily into his pocket. Well, this is just great then isn\u2019t it, he thought bitterly to himself. The new Trimester was starting, so he wasn\u2019t going to risk pissing off the wrong professors by skipping the first class. But the damned rat who was meant to fill in while Tyler was at classes was avoiding him. Tyler ran through the next day in his head. Two in the afternoon. His store would be closed until he got there at two in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed in resigned frustration. Well, weekdays weren\u2019t exactly the busiest, particularly mornings. But that was no excuse. His store was doing alright, on turnover it was turning a small prophet, but the bank overdraft was squeezing him. He couldn\u2019t afford to have the store sit locked during perfectly good business hours. And this wasn\u2019t the first time the rat had just wandered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have to get a more reliable assistant, he thought to himself as he cut through the parks and side streets that offered the most direct route home. There was no public transport to speak of, and a car was the rejected half of the car/discretionary spending dichotomy. So he would always have to hike the fifty minute walk to and from his shop, regardless of the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, the weather was looking ominous. It was much darker than it should have been in at that time in the evening, the scattered street lamps already the primary source of light as impenetrable sheets of dark clouds raced overhead. It wasn\u2019t raining, but the constant distant rumbling and occasional flicker of lightening reminded him that things can change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm air was mostly still, save for the occasional small, sharp local bursts that swept a layer of dust and leaves several feet across the street. There was an energy in the atmosphere, and everything about it suggested that Tyler was walking through the calm before the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake picked up the pace, distantly adjusting his shirt as if to confirm that it was the only thing between him and the elements. He was still a good mile from home, so if it did start raining, there was going to be no escaping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car slowly passed Tyler as he walked down the sidewalk of the seemingly endless residential estates.

It happened in an instant \u2013 one moment he was walking as normal, the next he was instinctively trying to pick himself up off the street, the roars of the world around him merely a muffled echo that sounded as if he was hearing from afar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween these moments his mind had only registered a handful of vivid tableaus. Here was a brilliant flash of white registering on his peripheral, followed by the thousand pieces of the white weatherboard house as it burst out in every direction, an enormous fountain of dirt erupting from where its foundations once lay. Then there was the scene of falling debris raining down from everywhere as he lay stunned on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler finally found his feet, but swayed uneasily as he witnessed the tail end of the devastation. Chunks of wood and metal rained down around him as the thick plume of dust slowed and settled, starting to swallow the scene as it descended. Traces of a far wall slowly buckled and collapsed outwardly onto the house next to it. And then there was nothing left of the structure at all, leaving only a settling pile of debris where it once stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tyler took several uneasy steps backwards as seemingly the last of the debris plonked on the ground around him. It was a miracle that nothing had hit him, he realised as his senses began to return. The scene felt surreal, like a dream. He didn\u2019t believe he was actually standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a thought formed in his mind \u201cWhat if someone was in there?\u201d His instinct was to run from the scene, but the thought of possible survivors dragged him in, as unlikely as it would have first appeared. He coughed and squinted his eyes as the dust enveloped the space around him. The streetlights seemed unable to penetrate through the cloud as he stumbled towards the rubble in near darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?!\u201d he shouted ahead of him. Or at least he thought he did. He barely even heard his muffled voice through the ringing in his ears. He fumbled through the wreckage with near zero visibility, realising that it was a largely helpless, and very probably stupid undertaking to attempt.<br>\r\nHe was about to leave the scene when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tyler coughed through the thick dust as he crawled towards the foot, and began digging it out of the lose debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon became apparent that whoever owned the foot was either dead or unconscious. It remained limp and unresponsive as Tyler went through the gruelling cycle of trying to pull the person free, before removing some more debris, to trying to pull them free again. Minutes felt like hours and the purple drake frantically worked through the hazy darkness. He was not strong or fit, but that all seemed irrelevant now. His fatigue went unnoticed as his heart pounded harder than it ever had. There was only one aim, one goal to achieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Tyler\u2019s efforts yielded results, as the body loosened itself under whatever was pinning it down, allowing Tyler to pull the body out from under the remaining rubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rabbit. A very small male rabbit wearing dusty boxers and a loose, slightly bloodied tank top. A kid? Tyler asked himself as he picked the body up. No, not a kid. Just a very short rabbit, a good few inches shorter than himself, and light enough for Tyler to lay over his shoulder as he hurriedly carried him out to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay the dusty white rabbit down on the sidewalk once he had reached it. He channelled all his first aid training he was taught in high school gym class all those years ago. Check his breathing. The rabbit wasn\u2019t breathing. Hold his wrist like this to check a pulse\u2026 Tyler moved his hand into several positions. Shit, he couldn\u2019t feel a pulse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, shit, ok\u2026\u201d Tyler tried to calm himself down. He could do this, he had to do this. he just had to focus and remember what to do next. The rabbit was still warm, so that must have been a good sign. But who knew how long the rabbit was out for? It felt like Tyler was digging him out for ages. If he wasn\u2019t breathing all that time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocus. What was he meant to do first? Mouth to mouth or chest compressions? He stood paralysed for a precious moment as he tried to remember. \u201cFuck it!\u201d he shouted to himself. Just do one, then the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went through three cycles of chest compressions and mouth to mouth before the rabbit spluttered weakly back to life.<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank God\u2026\u201d Tyler gasped as the rabbit animated in his hands. Was he conscious? His eyes stayed closed as he coughed in spasms. The dust couldn\u2019t have been helping, but Tyler had no way of controlling that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d he said to the rabbit as he slapped him gently on the side of the face. \u201cHey, are you awake man?\u201d he asked. The rabbit fluttered his eyes open, but it took a moment before he focused on anything. Tyler smiled as he looked at him. \u201cuh, hey man\u2026\u201d the purple drake said, giving him an awkward little wave. \u201cUhm\u2026 How are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit panted heavily as he desperately sucked in air. Tyler suddenly realised he was doing the same. He was absolutely exhausted, only now becoming aware that his dry mouth felt full of dirt. The rabbit tried to speak but only groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok dude, you\u2019re goanna be alright now, just take your time\u201d Tyler reassured the rabbit, shaking with relief and elation. A realisation settled in on him. Hey, he just saved this guy\u2019s life. He was a hero. They would probably give him a medal. This was probably goanna be a big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit took a moment longer to recover, his breath settling as his own daze cleared.</span></div></div>",

I was just walking past your house and it sort of\u2026 exploded. I pulled you out of the rubble just now.\u201d Tyler explained, before adding \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a pulse or anything.\u201d He knew it was an unnecessary and immodest addition, but he couldn\u2019t help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit didn\u2019t seem to respond as he expected though. His brow simply furrowed in confusion as he tried to take that in. \u201cThe house exploded?\u201d he asked uncomprehendingly. Tyler nodded and gestured to the pile of rubble that was barely visible in the streetlight through the dispersing dust. Tyler was suddenly aware of the figures standing visible in the distance around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Tyler guessed that you would expect some onlookers to come out if they heard a house explode. \u201cHey, can someone call an ambulance for this guy?\u201d He called out to the onlookers in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d the rabbit said suddenly sitting up, grabbing Tyler\u2019s knee. \u201cNo, don\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t afford to go to hospital. I\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t call anyone\u201d he pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was seriously taken aback. \u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s your health man, You weren\u2019t breathing or anything, and you\u2019re bleeding a bit, and your lungs would be caked in dust,  there\u2019s be little bits of plaster and glass and god knows what else in your lungs\u2026\u201d tyler trailed off. That last bit probably applied to him too, he thought dimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine, please tell them to stop.\u201d The rabbit pleaded. Tyler sighed, and instructed the crowd not to bother.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late, we called a long time ago\u2026 the police will be here too I imagine.\u201d A woman called from the haze. Tyler couldn\u2019t tell if she meant to shout that threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit looked panicked. Tyler couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cCome on man, this isn\u2019t the worst thing to happen to you today. Come on\u2026\u201d He sat up prone on his knees, offering a hand to the white Rabbit. \u201cLets get out of this damned dust, there\u2019s plenty of clean air down the road.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit groggily got to his feet and lent heavily on the purple Drake as they made their way past the strewn debris that littered the street. The rabbit was truly short, his head only reaching Tyler\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSo man, I still don\u2019t know your name.\u201d Tyler prompted as they made their way towards two of the onlookers. They were a middle aged avian couple of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRob.\u201d The rabbit coughed. \u201cMy name is Rob, sorry I\u2019ve forgotten yours.\u201d The rabbit apologised, before sheepishly muttering \u201csorry, I\u2019m bad with names.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler.\u201d The purple drake repeated. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve got a lot to take in, and my name wouldn\u2019t rank very highly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female bird asked if they wanted water or a blanket. Rob nodded and she disappeared inside. Tyler realised that he was actually very thirsty. And hungry. And tired. And Dirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had another moment trade dialogue with each other. Rob was 19, and just got in from overseas a few days ago to start at college. He was still catching up on the time zone and was sleeping when his house exploded. His face lit up when Tyler mentioned that he was attending the same campus. That ignited another round of discussion until they were interrupted by the approaching sirens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a very small, very serious circus quickly set itself up around the street in the moments that followed. Representatives from the Police, ambulance, fire brigade, council, news casts, and onlookers from neighbouring suburbs swarmed the street, and the processions from that evening quickly degenerated into a sensory blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolice Interviewed Tyler, at times very aggressively. He was walking home from his shop. Yes, he had ID and could verify his shop and house address. No, he didn\u2019t see what started the explosion. No, he didn\u2019t have a clear view of it. He found Rob under debris when he pulled him out. No, he didn\u2019t see anything suspicious in the debris. No, neither he nor Rob had any opportunity to tamper with anything after the explosion. Because Rob was unconscious and not breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt a bit cheated. He thought he was a hero, but the way the police were grilling every aspect of his story made him shake in intimidation. Then the ambulance treated him. There was nothing wrong with him, but they hooked him up to some sort of breathing machine for a time anyway. The street was flashing red and blue from the fire engines that blocked the narrow suburban street as firemen illuminated the lot with floodlights as they carefully searched the debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point there was a camera in his face. He recoiled but the camera just got closer. Someone was asking him a question. He didn\u2019t hear it. His eyes darted between the lens and the light that blinded him.. \u201cum\u2026\u2019 he began as his mind tried to ground himself. \u201cThere was some sort of an explosion, and the house exploded\u201d he offered dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say about reports of a missile launch? Was this a terrorist attack?\u201d a reporter desperately demanded from the darkness. \u201c\u2026what?\u201d Tyler asked dumbfounded. \u201cSeveral eyewitnesses claim a missile struck the house, can you confirm this?\u201d The reporter asked so quickly he could hardly parse the words, let alone sentence. Tyler stood a moment with his mouth open . \u201cuh\u2026 no, there was\u2026 I just saw an explosion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the police stepped in between them and it was over. He was ushered behind a van. Someone offered him a hot chocolate. Where was Rob? He hadn\u2019t seen the rabbit since the first flashing light arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night seemed to last forever, but eventually the crowd finally started to thin. By midnight there was only a single fire truck and a handful of patrol cars. A handful of figures still searched through the rubble or idle doing who knows what, but for the most part the circus had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Rob appeared, being guided out of a neighbouring house by two rather tall German Shepards.  They walked him over to a rather fat looking beaver that was leaning on his patrol car. \u201cOk, so he\u2019s been briefed.\u201d The beaver was informed by one of the dogs accompanying Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you understand that you\u2019ll be reporting in regularly? And the consequences of failing to comply?\u201d the fat beacer asked the rabbit sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob could only manage a weak nod. He looked exhausted \u2013 both physically and psychologically. He pointedly avoided eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have anywhere else to stay at in the mean time?\u201d  The beaver asked rather formally. Rob shook his head. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can take you to a hotel if you have the funds to pay it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob\u2019s eyes darted to where his house used to be. \u201cNo, sir. I think it\u2019s all gone now with everything else.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any bank accounts you can draw money from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shook his head again. \u201cNot in this country sir, not yet.\u201d Not once did he look at any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what the fuck do we do with him now then?\u201d The beaver demanded impatiently to the two shepherds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them half shrugged. \u201cWell, we can move some people around and clear out one of the lockups for him if he\u2019s happy to spend the night at the station\u2026\u201d he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Tyler interjected. All three of them turned to the purple drake simultaneously, but the angle of light obscured their expressions.  \u201cHe can stay at my place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause. \u201cYou\u2019re statements say you don\u2019t know each other\u2026\u201d one of the dogs began. \u201cFor safety reasons of both parties, we would only recommend his stays with close friends or family\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey rabbit, is that alright with you? \u201c The beaver interrupted impatiently.  \u201cAre you happy to stay with the dragon over there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked nervously up at Tyler.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThen that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d The beaver huffed as he turned back to his patrol car. \u201cCome on Mic, it\u2019s time to go home. Its late enough as it is.\u201d One of the dogs walked around and got in the passenger side door. The car rolling before the door closed, not a single hesitation as it turned and sped away from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining German Shepard walked Rob over to Tyler. \u201cI assume you guys must be pretty shaken up right now, it\u2019s been a big night hasn\u2019t it? Did you want me to give you a lift?\u201d He was addressing Tyler, Rob was only implied. <br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes flicked between Rob and the cop. \u201cI suppose\u2026 that would be awesome, if you wouldn\u2019t mind actually\u2026 I live just down\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know where you live.\u201d the dog interrupted, but not aggressively. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s getting late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said a single word on the drive the drive back to Tyler\u2019s house. They had nothing to say to each other. Rob had been interviewed for hours, Tyler already had everything worthwhile on record, and the dog already knew more than he would ever need to about both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the most awkward five minutes of his life, the silence only punctuated by the dog telling them to take care as they exited the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was playing some shooter on the Xbox as they walked inside. The yahoo frat boy style arcade shooter was the only computer game he would touch, but he would play it often enough in his downtime to make up for his narrow pallet.<br>\r\nDavid called out to them as he watched them enter the house. \u201cOh fuck Tyler, if you had have called me to let me know you were bringing a party home, I could have prepared something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up David, it\u2019s been a long night.\u201d Then a thought occurred. \u201cHave you seen anything on the TV?\u201d he asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNup, haven\u2019t been watching it. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind, Just curious\u201d Tyler trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but seriously Tyler.\u201d David pushed. \u201cWho is that guy?\u201d he asked, flicking his head at the rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Rob. He\u2019ll be staying with us here in the study tonight. Oh, and Rob, this is my brother David. I probably should have told you about him.\u201d Tyler apologised, but between spotting his unconscious foot and walking into the house, he couldn\u2019t think of where he could have squeezed it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you two hipsters getting a little old for the slumber parties?\u201d he asked with a raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said shut up David, don\u2019t be rude to guests, not tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow morning then.\u201d David agreed, turning his attention back to the xbox. \u201cBut tell your friend that I can smell him from here, and that he should have a shower before he comes around next time. But don\u2019t be rude about it or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIgnore him, he\u2019s not actually this hostile, he\u2019s just showing off.\u201d Tyler assured the rabbit loudly enough for his brother to hear. Without dividing his attention from his game, David grinned. \u201cSounds like a challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler led Rob upstairs. \u201cYou must have been in that house for hours man\u2026 with the cops, I mean. What took you so long to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The rabbit began hesitantly. \u201cWhen I told them I was a foreign student, that I wasn\u2019t a citizen, they seemed to just assume I was a terrorist.\u201d He began calmly, though he was clearly suppressing how upset he was. \u201cAnd then they demanded to see my passport, but that\u2019s obviously buried in the rubble or spread out over the street, like everything else I own\u2026 owned now I guess. I thought that would be obvious, but it wasn\u2019t obvious, they demanded my passport over and over again\u2026 they said they would arrest me and not let me go, that I \u2026\u201d his voice was growing more hysterical as he spoke, until he finally ended up choking on his own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok man\u2026\u201d Tyler said, patting him awkwardly on the back. How should one console a virtual stranger? \u201cWe\u2019re here now; they\u2019ve let you go\u2026 It\u2019s all working out.\u201d Should he be saying that? It sounded kind of patronising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob nodded, taking a few moments to compose himself before rubbing his dusty eyes with his dusty forearm. \u201cYeah\u2026 sorry\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cI have to report in to them every day, and seek immediate consular assistance. Hopefully they find my passport in the rubble or something. They said they would let me know if they found anything. I don\u2019t even have any proper clothes, or my wallet. I only had one unpacked suitcase and that\u2019s all gone now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly pulled himself from his thoughts and laughed. \u201cSo yeah, thanks for letting me come over and everything, it\u2019s very kind and greatly appreciated.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had to consciously help his smile form. AND I saved your life, he thought almost angrily. I pulled you from the house and made your heart beat. Why is this not a thing? \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. David\u2019s an ass, but he\u2019s right. We both need a shower. And you\u2019re going to need something else to change into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler went looking in his room for some clothes he could lend Rob. He smiled wryly to himself as he searched his wardrobe. Everything was going to be too big, which was a rather unique conundrum for him. \u201cI hate to say it man, but I think the only things I have that will fit you will be some of my old teenage stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine Tyler\u2026\u201d Rob assured him. \u201cAnything is better than showing up tomorrow in this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler cursed under his breath. I\u2019ve got some bad news for you\u2026\u201d he said as he pulled out a box of old clothes. \u201cI was a bit of a nerd in high school\u2026 actually, I didn\u2019t need to qualify that. But still, my dress sense was slightly louder about it. You\u2019re welcome to everything in this box, but I\u2019d better apologise in advance for your eventual selection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler showed Rob to the empty study, and organised a mattress and blankets while the rabbit showered. And then Ron went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was still far too worked up to call it a night just then. He went back downstairs after his shower. David had returned, leaving him free with the TV. He turned straight to the news, and perhaps unsurprisingly, they were talking about the exploding house thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recognised the shots of the rubble as the presenters talked over the images, and some of the local \u2018onlookers\u2019 which they interviewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he gasped when he saw some of the viewer footage. There were at least three shaky phone recordings of a projectile flying through the sky. It kind of looked like a rocket. But it looked like it was travelling far too fast, and breaking up as it moved along. Was the house struck by a meteor? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the videos showed the impact of course, the streak was just filemd flying over suburbia, not landing in it. But there were so many angles, showing recognisable chunks of the city, with the same dark, ominous clouds in the evening sky as there were this morning. He was convinced they were genuine. So the explosion was caused by a projectile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he was on TV. He didn\u2019t recognise himself straight away. The camera was shaking, the light was hard against his purple scales\u2026 but it was him. There were a number of voices , but a sole female rose above the crowd. \u201cWhat did you see sir?\u201d it demanded. Tyler stood frozen dumbly for a few seconds before\u2026 grunting? That was a grunt. A confused grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler buried his head in his hands as his face flushed red in embarrassment. Oh God, he couldn\u2019t watch this. \u201cThere was some sort of an explosion, and the house exploded\u201d, he heard his own voice coming from the television. Well\u2026 that was a quote for the ages, he thought to himself. Mercifully, the footage then cut to some more dark footage of the rubble and the news cast moved on. But Tyler remained head in hand, completely mortified. No, this wasn\u2019t a moment he\u2019d be sharing with his grandkids about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s got to be asked now\u2026\u201d one of the news reporters began as they cut back into their studio. There were four of them, sitting on a panel. \u201cAn undocumented foreign student moves into suburbia, and two days later his house blows up. So we really have to be asking ourselves what we are opening our doors up to when we allow, when we share our city these kinds of people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Tyler demanded his TV with exasperation. The newscaster continued \u201cI mean, sure, we have to wait until all the facts are out, we can\u2019t be getting ahead of ourselves here. But does anyone honestly believe something like this would have happened if a local student lived there? Has an event like this ever been recorded for local students?\u201d He paused to allow the rest of the panel to either shrug or shake their heads. \u201cNo? This is how they can come into here\u2026you know, fairly easily. Student visas are a real weakness for us.  We need to be looking more critically at this area, or else the events of tonight will probably become increasingly common.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned the TV off.  He hated politics at the best of times, but that was fucking ridiculous. They had no idea what they were talking about, but they were being paid to talk about it until the early morning hours, so they had to say something. His own little first-hand experience with news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let the frustration of the world\u2019s troubles flow off him as he settled into bed. He reflected on the surprising twist in his day. He still felt hard done by, if this were a movie he\u2019s have his picture in the paper holding a medal for his bravery and heroism. Perhaps it\u2019s just a sign of the times. Or perhaps it was always just a fanciful portrayal of reality from TV and movies. Whatever the reason, eventually drifted off into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until Morning when things started to get weird.</span></div></div>",

The rabbit gave a half embarrassed smile in response. \u201cYeah, well I thought it had a kind of retro look about it going on\u2026 so I figured why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt was slightly too small for Rob, but it wasn\u2019t too bad a fit. The rabbit didn\u2019t have much definition to show off, but he didn\u2019t have an ounce of fat on him so his tight shirt didn\u2019t look too out of place. Well, apart from the subject matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shorts were a different story, however. The rabbit\u2019s thighs\u2026 actually, his whole feet come to think about it, were actually quite thick and powerful proportionately. The short\u2019s legs were stretched thin, their ends riding up a bit higher than they were designed, making them look even smaller on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit man, we\u2019ve got to get you some better clothes. Do you know Hardson\u2019s Street?\u201d the purple drake asked. The rabbit shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know any street names here yet sorry, but I imagine I can either ask around or Google it. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n It\u2019s the main road that leads north of campus, past the science faculty Building. There\u2019s a charity shop up about fifteen minutes up there that should sell some clothes fairly cheaply. Here\u2026\u2019 Tyler said as he fished a 20 out of his wallet. \u201cThis should get you a small stack of stuff which you won\u2019t mind getting caught dead in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob didn\u2019t take the money. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t take that, I\u2019ve already taken too much.\u201d Tyler rolled his eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make a game of this man, I imagine you\u2019re gonna need some of it to eat lunch or something as well, right?\u201d The rabbit didn\u2019t respond. \u201cSo trust me dude, you need this more than me.\u201d Tyler practically threw the money at him. \u201ccoffee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re making one\u201d the rabbit replied nervously. \u201cum\u2026\u201d he began as Tyler poured a cup. \u201cIs David around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed. \u201cIf I don\u2019t seem him, I don\u2019t care. He usually starts exercising pretty early in the morning. Why? He hasn\u2019t scared you has he? That\u2019s what he wants to do, don\u2019t give into him. Remember, he might live here, but this is my house.\u201d He handed the coffee to Rob. \u201cYou know how to make toast?\u201d he asked with a smile on his face, nodding to the table top. \u201cHelp yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026\u201d Rob murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you have to see the consular today?\u201d Tyler intended to ask casually, but he realised it was probably a very heady question once he asked it. The rabbit nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try and make an appointment after class. I think, Well, I get the impression I should be going there first thing this morning, but I figure, what\u2019s the point of being in the country if I don\u2019t go to class anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded in approval. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good attitude man. Look, to be honest the first week is always fairly useless. They just go over the course guide and give you a rough outline of dates and shit. It\u2019s completely pointless, but some of those Professors can be\u2026 quite precious. It\u2019s just good politics to show up on the first week. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve been trying to tell David for years, but he\u2019s got his own view of the world I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake handed Rob a coffee. He held it carefully and sipped it, a confused look  appearing on his face. He then took a mouthful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Tyler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no\u2026 well, not really. Is\u2026 cold coffee a cultural thing, or is it meant to be hot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler eyed the steam that rose from the cup in confusion, unable to bridge the logical disconnect. \u201cSorry, are you saying your coffee isn\u2019t hot enough?\u201d Was Rob a smartass?Is that what was happening here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit looked around nervously. \u201cno, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just\u2026 I wasn\u2019t expecting it is all. It\u2019s just, back home, we serve our coffee hot. I\u2019ll get used to this. It\u2019s very nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you trolling bro?\u201d Tyler asked confused, a playful smile appearing on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m, I\u2019m not trolling. Forget I mentioned anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler wanted to unravel this before he let it go. \u201cWell, how hot do you want coffee? water only boils so hot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not boiled. It\u2019s room temperature.\u201d The rabbit looked as confused as Tyler did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026. No, its  very hot. I can see that it\u2019s very hot.\u201d Tyler said slowly and sceptically, still not entirely convinced that the rabbit was being genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he dumped his finger into it and kept it there. \u201cNo, It\u2019s only Luke warm, see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes widened in shock as he reflexively slapped at the rabbit\u2019s hand. \u201cFuck, don\u2019t do that you idiot!\u201d he shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d The rabbit asked defensively confused at the drake\u2019s response. He complied with the dragon\u2019s request nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause You\u2019ll burn your finger!\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cso it IS hot?\u201d Rob asked flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cits scolding! Look at the steam!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201care you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m positive!\u201d Tyler practically shouted. \u201cCan you seriously not feel the heat there at all?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell\u2026\u201d the rabbit said hesitantly, looking incredibly self-aware and nervous as he held the hot cup in his hand. \u201cits hard to say, but no? I mean, it feels as hot as the table\u2026 and that\u2019s not hot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Dude, that\u2019s fucked up!\u201d Tyler cried out. \u201cAre you feeling alright man?\u201d he held out a hand to gesture that he wanted to feel the rabbit\u2019s forehead. He completed the action when the rabbit didn\u2019t resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201choly FUCK!\u201d Tyler gasped. \u201cMan, you\u2019re temperature is cold!\u201d he said stunned, ripping his hand form the rabbit\u2019s head. He quickly felt up the rabbits arm. \u201cRob, this is serious, you feel like you\u2019re dead. You aren\u2019t even room temperature, I can feel my fingers going cold when I touch you.\u201d He looked at the rabbit with mortified amazement. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go to the hospital right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob probed his own body with his fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t feel cold\u2026\u201d he said to himself sceptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you feel ANY temperature, hot or cold?\u201d Tyler asked. Rob considered a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d <br>\r\nTyler opened the freezer and collected a handful of ice cubes. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded as he presented them to the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob picked one out and clasped it between his hands for a moment, before concluding \u201cNo, this doesn\u2019t feel cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler threw the rest of the ice he was holding into the sink. \u201cLook at my fingers man!\u201d The ice had left visible red marks in Tyler\u2019s purple shaking fingers. \u201cDo you see that ice burn? And you\u2019re telling me you can\u2019t feel anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo man, I promise I\u2019m not lying!\u201d the rabbit said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you!\u201d Tyler pressed. \u201cWhich is why you have to go to hospital right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Rob said instinctively. \u201cNo, I mean\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cI mean, I feel fine. Great even , I don\u2019t feel like\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feel like a fucking corpse dude!\u201d Tyler interjected.  \u201cOne that has been sitting in a fridge for a few hours at that. I\u2019m beginning to think I\u2019ve revived a fucking zombie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a zombie!\u201d Rob protested. \u201cI can feel my heart beating quite fast right now actually. Please calm down, I feel fine. Honestly, I feel better than fine. I slept well, and I even feel energetic for this time of the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler eyed him sceptically. \u201cThe ice isn\u2019t melting in your hand at all is it?\u201d he asked flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stole a surprised glance at the ice cube in his hand. He forgot he was holding that. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any freezer burn either, do I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re too fucking cold for the ice to burn you!\u201d Tyler explained slowly but forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob placed the ice on the table. \u201cDo I look frozen solid to you?\u201d He asked Tyler. \u201cOr cold or otherwise lethargic? Trust me, I\u2019m Fine Tyler. Don\u2019t worry about me. I feel fine. Please calm down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I\u2019ve got my eye on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful for that\u2026\u201d the rabbit smiled in appreciation. \u201cDid you want any toast?\u201d He offered Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah thanks, I had some earlier.\u201d Tyler said as he sat back down. \u201cSo what time did your classes start?\u201d he asked the rabbit as he went about making his breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNine thirty.\u201d He replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I start at ten, so I can walk you there and show you around some if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit smiled as he dropped the bread into the toaster. \u201cOh, yeah actually that\u2019d be grea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was cut off as the toaster violently shorted out . The loud \u201cbang\u201d was accompanied by a brilliant yellow flash of fire and a bolt of pure white electricity that shot straight up the rabbits hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoar!\u201d the rabbit cried out in surprise as the toaster started smoking. He had flinched, but it seemed more from surprise than an electric shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201choly FUCK man!\u201d Tyler cried out startled, jumping to his feet again. \u201cAre you alight?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit rubbed his hand distantly. \u201cYeah\u2026 yeah, totally fine. It shocked me, but it didn\u2019t feel anything like I thought it would\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be the most unluckiest rabbit alive\u201d Tyler muttered, shaking his head in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit visibly contemplated this, before smiling. \u201cOr the luckiest!\u201d he said cheerfully, before his expression dropped again. \u201cBut seriously, I\u2019m sorry I just broke your toaster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything man, it\u2019s just an old piece of shit by the looks of it. Hell, you could probably sue us over that.\u201d Mmm, Tyler chastised himself. Probably didn\u2019t need to point that out, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, well I could use the money.\u201d The rabbit joked, cheering up again. \u201cAnd when you think about it, bread and jelly is just as nutritious a breakfast anyway. And a lot fresher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of breakfast past without incident. Tyler managed to keep the conversation going, and while it never really picked up, there wasn\u2019t any awkward silences either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lead them through he lounge as they left for school. \u201cFucking David.\u201d He scowled as he saw that David had left the TV on since earlier in the morning. \u201cHow long do you think that\u2019s been on for? He doesn\u2019t care; he doesn\u2019t ever worry too much about paying for the bills.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019ll turn it off\u2026\u201d Rob said as he walked over to the screen. \u201cNo dude, its OK. There\u2019s a remote\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe rabbit shorted out the TV. It exploded with a loud bang, the burst of energy seeming to find its way through the surround sound system, leading to an incredibly loud combined explosion sound. The screen flashed white then died as another, more savage bolt of electricity shot up the rabbit\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both stood still in wide eyed silence as the smell of burning electricity permeated through the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026\u201d Tyler began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Rob finished. \u201cThat didn\u2019t hurt at all, or anything.\u201d He lowered his gaze. \u201cI fucking broke your TV.\u201d He said angrily to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t worry about that man, we\u2019ll just have to be careful with you next time. Maybe you have some static charge built up or some shit that is giving you shocks and screwing with your temperature.\u201d Tyler offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Rob politely accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them believed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome one then, I suppose\u2026\u201d Tyler said to get things rolling again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe smiled as they filed out of the room. \u201cYou know you\u2019re welcome to come back here again tonight if things don\u2019t sort themselves out man.\u201d Tyler reassured the rabbit. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate. Though I might have to keep you away from the electrical equipment. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthanks\u2026\u201d the rabbit murmured sheepishly again. He was probably getting tired of saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the rabbit as he led him out the door. Rob was a very small individual, there was no denying that. But he didn\u2019t seem quite as small as he had when Tyler first lead him out of the dust last night. And while he didn\u2019t have anything on his bones coming close to what you would consider to be definition, he wasn\u2019t exactly as thin as a rake either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the feeling you\u2019re gonna have a good day man.\u201d Tyler said, patting the rabbit on the back before abruptly recoiling. Damn, he shivered. The rabbit was so cold to touch. Don\u2019t do that again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That evening, Tyler was chilling out on the couch with his brother, collectively watching nothing on TV after a long day.  They were interrupted by a knock on the door. Tyler had zoned out by this stage, the thought that the rabbit could be returning was simply not on his mind as he let his brother answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, what the fuck is this?\u201d David asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tyler asked confused, suddenly realising that the person David was contemptuously eyeing through the doorway was probably Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fucking hell David!\u201d Tyler exclaimed as he jumped to his feet and quickly made his way to the door. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking sick the way you treat\u2026 some\u2026\u201d Tyler trailed off as he saw the rabbit, gaping as the scene registered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Rob, the short familiar white rabbit, and he was still wearing the small yellow Pok\u00e9mon shirt and tight shorts that he had left the house in this morning. But these similarities aside, there was still a gaping disconnect between the rabbit who left the house to the rabbit who stood before him then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was bigger. Significantly so. He was almost eye level to Tyler now\u2026 six inches taller? He\u2019s have to be at least that, the purple drake thought to himself amazed. At Rob\u2019s height, six inches was a hell of a lot. He looked\u2026 almost like a completely different rabbit now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pok\u00e9mon shirt clung tightly to his torso, the faded yellow fabric being stretched so far that the fur on the rabbit\u2019s chest was somewhat visible through it. His left sleeve had ripped several inches up the fabric, apparently unable to contain the bunny\u2019s somewhat thicker arm. The other sleeve was in one piece, but was drawn so taught that it forced the rabbit\u2019s arm onto a slightly unnatural angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit\u2019s chest seemed to bow the front of the shit upwards, exposing several solid inches of white fur between the shirt and the pants, the bunny\u2019s navel featuring in the centre of the hard, slat exposed stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the pants that were really straining. They were tight before, but now they were on a different level altogether. The fabric in the legs was completely at their limit, and while they were both still barely in one piece, it was only through some severe contortion of the rabbit\u2019s powerful thighs. The shorts had ridden almost all the way up his legs, exposing far more fur than modesty would usually aim for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the bottom of the pants pulled up, the elastic was being pulled down, barely hugging the rabbit\u2019s hips. The elastic bowed further forward as it wrapped around the rabbit\u2019s front, his groin pulling the fabric so tight that there was absolutely nothing left to the imagination. Tyler could even make out each individual testicle through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not necessarily because the rabbit\u2019s crotch was huge \u2013 it wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t small either, mind. But the fabric stretching was caused mainly by the fabric being stretched out to accommodate the rabbit\u2019s thighs, rather than his crotch filling it to the brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd overall, while the rabbit had earlier today looked rather thin and lanky, right now he looked\u2026 almost fit.<br>\r\n\u201cuh\u2026 hi.\u201d The rabbit said awkwardly, breaking the silence that had stretched on perhaps a little too long. He gave a feeble wave with his hand as if to make light of the situation, but the movement just tore the fabric on the other sleeve. David stared at the shirt wide eyed as he watched the fabric violently ricochet up the rabbits arm, before slowly <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontinuing to rip another inch or two before it settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Tyler said hesitantly. \u201cHey, Rob... Please come in\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

This was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Tyler roared in his brothers face, before quickly checking his voice. This wasn\u2019t a conversation he wanted Rob overhearing. \u201cNo, as a matter of fact he\u2019s not David. But so what if he was? Would you have a problem with that?\u201d Tyler countered indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cfucking yes!\u201d David exclaimed exaggeratedly, making it look painful to have express the obvious. \u201cI\u2019m not having you go all bent on me Tyler!

One!\u201d The blue drake peeled one of his finders down. \u201cHow come I\u2019ve never seen you bring a chick home to fuck? You\u2019re always here every fucking night, so don\u2019t give me any bullshit that you go around making booty calls.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s face must have flushed red. Partly from embarrassment, and partly from anger at David bringing up such a sensitive topic so aggressively. \u201cDavid, why do you fucking think? Look at me, do you seriously think I get a tenth of the opportunities you do? It\u2019s a different world for me. What\u2019s wrong with you? Me not getting much action doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m gay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTWO!\u201d David pointedly moved on. \u201cWhy the fuck did you just eyeball him for half an hour if there\u2019s nothing going on?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause he fucking grew David!\u201d Tyler spat. David cocked his head dangerously. Tyler needed to expand on that one. \u201cLook, you saw him last night didn\u2019t you? He came up to here on me!\u201d Tyler gestured to the top of his shoulder. \u201cYou saw him last night! He\u2019s grown like 6 fucking inches in a day! How can you not notice that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit!\u2019 David angrily dismissed. Tyler angrily clasped at the side of his own head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean bullshit? Try to fucking remember! You must have noticed how small he was, it kind of stood out as a feature! He doesn\u2019t look anything like he did now! Are you blind?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree.\u201d David ploughing through his brother\u2019s protests, pulling his last remaining finger down, leaving his hand in a fist. \u201cYou tell me Tyler, what kind of person dresses like\u2026 like that?!\u201d he sat, pointing in the general direction of Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, your worldliness continues to amaze me\u201d Tyler said sarcastically. \u201cHe\u2019s dressed up like that because of the same fucking reason. He was far too small to fit into any of my clothes this morning, so I gave him some of my teenage rags. You must recognise them, I wore them for fucking years!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head in resigned irritation. \u201cSo basically Tyler, I\u2019m given a choice between believing that your friend grew 6 inches in one day, or the whole situation being exactly what it looks like. Tell me, which one do you think I\u2019m gonna go with? Which one would you if the situation was reversed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t give a fuck if you were gay!\u201d Tyler said without hesitation. It was true, but entirely the wrong answer in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grimaced as he shook his head angrily. \u201cWell I do, Tyler.\u201d He picked his enormous bulk up violently as he turned to leave the kitchen. \u201cI guess\u2026\u201d he said almost remorsefully. \u201cI guess we\u2019ve both learnt something about each other tonight then.\u201d He held a hated gaze before turning and stomping out of the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler almost thought that David was going to punch the rabbit as he passed him on the way to the stairwell, but the cobalt drake simply snarled his teeth, avoiding eye contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long awkward pause as they waited for David to finish stoping up the stairs, down the hallway and eventually slam his door shut. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Tyler, I shouldn\u2019t have come here\u2026\u201d Rob started, but the purple drake waved him dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo man, I\u2019m fucking embarrassed about that. Look, I\u2019m really sorry, Ok? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into him. It\u2019s cool for you to stay here as long as you like, do you understand?\u201d he asked the rabbit sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \u201cYeah, thanks for that. Hopefully I don\u2019t stay in your way for too much longer, I think things will sort themselves out quickly now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded, but his attention soon trailed to the whole rabbit spilling out of his clothes issue.  \u201cLook, Rob, can I just be blunt and come out with it? You\u2019ve grown, like, a lot. Suddenly. Today.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve noticed that too\u2026\u201d he said with an embarrassed smile. \u201cIt\u2019s been happening all day, at first I thought the clothes were shrinking, or something. But then the world sort of changed around me, and I felt different. I didn\u2019t realise how much taller I was until I saw you just before though. It\u2019s kind of crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyeah, it is.\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cSo how is this happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged, the movement sliding his tight shirt further up his torso, but the tension kept it up as his elbows returned downwards. \u201cHonestly man, I don\u2019t know. It seems to have been happening gradually through the day, for the most part.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the most part?\u201d Tyler pressed the qualifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit nodded. \u201cyeah, but you know how I was shorting out your toaster and stuff this morning?\u201d he asked sheepishly. No, Tyler thought. The television was much more expensive. You should have listed that as your example, not the toaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit continued. \u201cWell, that kind of kept happening throughout the day. I manage to electrocute myself on the security door, a computer and just a few moments ago on a parked car as I walked past it crossing the road. That was a big one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Tyler asked. The rabbit shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cno, not at all. In fact, it feels kind of\u2026 really good. But that\u2019s when I seem to have a bit of a growth spurt, when I get electrocuted. It\u2019s like\u2026 it\u2019s like a surge of energy that makes me bigger, I guess.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you still cold?\u201d Tyler asked sceptically. The rabbit was making extraordinary claims, but he was certainly backing it up with extraordinary evidence. Rob shrugged. \u201cYou tell me\u2026\u201d he asked, offering his hand. Tyler gasped as he touched it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSeriously.\u201d Tyler said. It feels like my hand is going to stick to you if I keep touching you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, I guess you\u2019d better stop.\u201d The Rabbit laughed as he pulled his hand away. Tyler didn\u2019t quite share the moment. \u201cSeriously man, how are you not frozen solid? I bet I could freeze water on your fur. You radiate cold from several inches away. You\u2019re growing and freezing. This isn\u2019t normal. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s even physically possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged. Again, the shirt rode up his torso without falling back down. \u201cWell man, I still feel perfectly fine.\u201d He said. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m just happy with how today went. My first day of college went alright, The consular was able to electronically identify me, and I can stay in the country while a new passport is sent over, and the cops said that they just wanted me to check in every week now. The only thing I didn\u2019t get a chance to do was grab some clothes, but I\u2019ll do that tomorrow morning. It\u2019s funny how things can go completely to shit and then still work out in the end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded distantly. Though he wasn\u2019t convinced he actually agreed. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good; I guess\u2026\u201d he said noncommittally. \u201cDo you have any classes again? Tomorrow?\u201d he casually asked, to get the conversation off the topic if nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shook his head. \u201cNah, I I\u2019ve got tomorrow and Fridays off completely, so I\u2019ll have to find something else to keep me entertained.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler perked up. \u201cI\u2019ve got classes in the evening dude. How would you like to work a shift at my store while I\u2019m studying?\u201d he asked hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cstore?\u201d Rob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head apologetically. \u201cSorry, you wouldn\u2019t know anything about my store. I have a store. I try and have it open all week. I have two high school kids who do most of the work on the weekend, but college makes it difficult for me to keep the store open during the week. I have this other guy who is meant to fill in, but he\u2019s useless and well, How would you like to help out tomorrow? I can pay you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shared an impressed grin with Tyler. \u201cReally? You own a store? Do you own a building and everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Tyler said, a little deflated. \u201cCalm down there. No, I\u2019m not a land baron, I pay rent. I\u2019m not wealthy, I just fund a little shop on an enormous bank overdraft, so I\u2019ve gotta keep the doors open somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit was nodding. \u201cOh of course I\u2019ll help you out whenever I can. And you can\u2019t be serious about the pay can you? After letting me stay here, eating and breaking things for free?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged. \u201cWell, we can work something out later I guess, the main thing is that you\u2019re interested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit held out a hand, and Tyler went to shake it. Immediately he recoiled. So very cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob didn\u2019t take offense. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ll feel a lot better once I\u2019m giving SOMETHING back in this little setup here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, cool then.\u201d Tyler smiled. Well, I\u2019ll walk you to the shop tomorrow morning, and you can stick around while I show you how things are done, and then leave you to it in the afternoon. Sound like a plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit nodded in response.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nTyler clapped his hands together. \u201cWell, you look like you could do with another shower and a rest anyway man, I\u2019ll leave you alone, make yourself at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit nodded in gratitude as he started walking up the stairs. The movement brought him to within several inches of the hallway lamp, which was apparently enough to make it short through the rabbit. The globe loudly burst as a think white bolt of electricity struck the rabbit mid stride. \u201cungh!\u201d Rob groaned in pleasant surprise after the jolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn\u2019t actually see the rabbit grow, but his shorts told the story. The overstretched fabric finally burst long the seam of the outside of the right leg. It sounded more like a bursting balloon than ripping fabric. The loud separation of the garment left pretty much the entire outside of the rabbit\u2019s thigh exposed,  as well as a the lower outer quadrant of the rabbit\u2019s right ass cheek, which seemed to increase volume as it burst out. The thin stretch of the elastic line was the only the thing keeping the pants in one piece and on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, um\u2026 \u201c the rabbit said embarrassed, stepping away from the lamp and  covering his upper thigh. \u201cSorry again\u2026 I\u2019m still breaking your lights and your clothes hey\u2026 I\u2019ll be a lot more careful\u2026\u201d he said as he scurried off down the hallway and into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was left shaking his head in disbelief. That was the image he spent most of the night worrying about as he lay in bed.What happened if things started to get out of control there? There seemed to be ample opportunities for that to happen. It was all frivolous to worry over, but Tyler wouldn\u2019t be himself if he didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler woke up the next morning with a knock on the door. Well, that immediately ruled out David. He quickly dressed in some underwear before he opened the door. \u201cWhat do you need Rob?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit was leaning in from the side of the doorway so that only his head, a shoulder and a stabilising hand were visible. Judging by the steam emanating off his body and water on his fur, he was fresh out of a shower. Wait. On second glance, that was ice, not water. And frost, not steam. \u201cHey Tyler, sorry to wake you. But\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat. The. Fuck.\u201d Tyler interrupted as he stayed fixated on the rabbit\u2019s frozen fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked at the gaping dragon patiently. \u201cI know, it\u2019s a bit odd isn\u2019t it\u2026 but you were right, water can freeze on me now I guess.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked into the rabbit\u2019s brown eyes. It was an upwards angle. The rabbit was leaning into the doorway, but he was still looking up at eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown again, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Tyler asked cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that too, I guess.\u201d Rob said as if an aside. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling taller, and now you look smaller, so I guess I did. You\u2019re like a barometer for this. I don\u2019t realise to what degree until I see you.\u201d He said, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo um, anyway\u2026\u201d the rabbit continued. \u201c I\u2019m sorry, but would I be able to borrow some of your clothes? I just have this towel and the stuff you gave me yesterday, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d fit on my anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake was speechless.<br>\r\n\u201cPlus ah, they\u2019re all dirty and\u2026 ripped now, so I don\u2019t really have anything at all to wear\u2026.\u201d The rabbit trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tyler said nodding. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll\u2026 what did you want to wear?\u201d he asked distractedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you have to spare, I\u2019ll be happy with anything. Don\u2019t waste your good stuff on me, I\u2019ll be happy with anything that keeps me decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler wandered over to his closet and fumbled through his collection, gathering a reasonably nice shirt, some shorts, and\u2026 was he meant to give him his underwear? Would that be weird? Would it be rude not to? In the end he buried a pair into the pile and handed them off to the rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Thanks man, that\u2019s greatly appreciated, I\u2019ll leave you alone now.\u201d He said, closing the door. Tyler shrugged. Nothing about that exchange was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started making his own preparations for the day when the rabbit knocked on the door again. \u201cl\u2019m super sorry about this\u2026\u2019Rob began as Tyler opened the door. The rabbit was wearing nothing but the shorts, holding the shirt folded in his hands. Now he was standing properly in full view, Tyler could see that he must have been a good four inches taller than him. His eyes widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026you wouldn\u2019t happen to have anything a little\u2026 bigger would you?\u201d the rabbit asked handing the shirt back to him.<br>\r\nTyler looked at the shirt in his hands. \u201cBigger?\u201d he inquired dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it fits all right, but it\u2019s a bit tight. I hate to be fussy, but I\u2019m just thinking back to yesterday when I ripped your clothes because they were a bit small. I figure I\u2019d be less of an ass being a bit fussy now, than later handing you a busted shirt. At the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took the shirt from the rabbit, before looking up at him again. \u201cWell, how much bigger are you planning on getting today?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged. The movement drove Tyler to realise that there was a bit more definition on his frame again. Still nothing to show off, but there was definitely something new there. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d The rabbit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked back at his eyes in confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re not what?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not planning on getting bigger today.\u201d He replied. His voice was deeper, Tyler realised. He thought back to the little rabbit he had rescued two days earlier. Rob looked and sounded nothing like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re going to grow anyway, aren\u2019t you.\u201d Tyler pointed out, rather than ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit gave a sheepish grin. \u201cI suppose so. I\u2019m just\u2026 I guess I\u2019m building a contingency.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cSorry Rob, I don\u2019t have any bigger shirts. I just have the one size. I haven't grown in years.\u201d He said, handing the shirt back to the rabbit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob took it appreciably. \u201cI understand, say no more. Thanks again. I\u2019ll try and be careful with it then.\u201d He said, and closed the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler joined him in the kitchen shortly later. \u201cHave you had anything yet?\u201d He asked Ron, who was sitting at an empty table. The rabbit shook his head. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve been afraid to get to close to the fridge\u2026 in case I break it. I imagine fridges are expensive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded. \u201cYes, they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u2019 Rob started awkwardly. \u201cWhen did you plan on leaving this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Tyler began carefully, \u201c\u2026I was having a think about\u2026 this\u2026 last night. It\u2019s just that\u2026 well, there\u2019s a lot of equipment at my store. The cash register, the computer, the security system, the audio system, not to mention any of the lighting or cheating\u2026 doesn\u2019t that sound like a bit of a mind field for you at the moment? I mean, you\u2019re afraid of opening a fridge at this point\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob\u2019s face dropped. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want my help today?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s\u2026 look, it\u2019s just that some of that equipment is very expensive, too expensive for me to easily be able to replace really. And it has all my records and business data\u2026 It just sounds like too much of a risk just to keep the store open in those hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, \u201c the rabbit lowered his face, his ears folded backwards. \u201cSorry Tyler. I was looking forward to helping out a bit. Let me know if you think of anything else I could do, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed an pulled up a chair for himself at the table. \u201cLook, this is very weird, isn\u2019t it? I mean, the coldness, the electrocutions and all the growing. Why are you acting so casual about it? Aren\u2019t you concerned at all with what might be going on with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged, looking back up at Tyler. \u201cI don\u2019t try and worry about this sort of stuff, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake shook his head softly. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand that I guess. How you can be so unconcerned with your health. Is it because you want to be bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit considered a moment. \u201cNo, not really I guess. I mean, I don\u2019t mind being bigger, it\u2019s kind of cool I guess. But I never really worried about being small either. It wasn\u2019t really something I could change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit smiled distantly. \u201cHa, now I\u2019m actually kind of nervous about what my friends and family are going to say when they see me next. I think it will be a bit embarrassing when they first see me, I guess I\u2019ll have some explaining to do. It\u2019s a bit of a change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut won\u2019t you worry about your size at some point?\u201d Tyler pressed. \u201cI mean, surely there as point where you start to\u2026 worry about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d The rabbit shrugged, averting his gaze to his fidgeting hands resting on tabletop. \u201cI don\u2019t know. This is kind of new for me, I don\u2019t really know what to expect. But there\u2019s no point in worrying about it until it gets to that point, is there? I mean, that\u2019s not going to change anything is it? The whole thing might sort of just go away, like it just sort of came.  Things tend to sort themselves out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if it doesn\u2019t go away?\u201d Tyler insisted. \u201cWhat if it just keeps getting worse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit smiled, rolling his eyes playfully. \u201cFour days ago I wasn\u2019t in this country. I could have worried about not passing thought customs, about losing my luggage, or missing my flight. But then three days ago I didn\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore. But I could have worried about not being able to find accommodation. Then two days ago I didn\u2019t have to worry about that at all. But I could have worried about my first day of College, about whether or not I\u2019d fit in well with anyone, and then later about whether I'd be thrown in jail for being a terrorist... that was a bit one. But yesterday things went well, and I don\u2019t have to worry about that now either. I could worry about\u2026 this\u201d the rabbit gestured to himself \u201c\u2026today if I wanted to, but why bother when tomorrow this could all be over, and I\u2019ll just have a fresh bunch of other stuff to worry about. Does that make sense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded as he considered this perspective. \u201cYes, it makes a lot of sense, actually.\u201d Tyler admitted. \u201cBut surely, if you looked at life like that, then nothing matters. I mean, this would have to be considered a health issue wouldn\u2019t it? Not being able to make friends, or getting turned around at customs\u2026 they would all suck, but they\u2019re really just setbacks. This\u2026 well, who knows, you could die.\u201d Tyler finished dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged again. \u201cI could die from a falling piano today walking down a street. But I\u2019m not going to worry about it. I suppose the only thing I really worry about\u2026 is not finding the time to just enjoy life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed. \u201cI guess I wish I could be more like you then, in a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Rob asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? If you were more like me, you wouldn\u2019t have a cool store. You\u2019d be a completely different person. There\u2019s nothing wrong with what you are. It\u2019s kind of nice to have you worry enough for the both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d Tyler seized the moment. \u201cWill you indulge me this morning, instead of manning the store tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d The rabbit said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want introduce you to a professor I know at college\u2026 let him have a look over you and just see what he thinks.\u201d<br>\r\nRob\u2019s face and ears dropped. \u201cWhat, like have him study me?\u201d He asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, if he\u2019s interested. But that would be completely up to you man, if you aren\u2019t comfortable with that then you don\u2019t have to go along with it. But I would be interested in finding out what he has to say about all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit looked away. \u201cWould that make you feel more at ease with me?\u201d The rabbit asked. Tyler didn\u2019t have to be a body language expert to realise that the rabbit was incredibly uncomfortable with the prospect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would make me feel better to have another thought on this, yes.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit turned back to Tyler. \u201cBut don\u2019t you have to go and work in your store this morning?\u201d the rabbit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was the plan, but to be honest\u2026\u201d Tyler put on a cheesy smile. \u201cSomething bigger has come up.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr. Peter Dell was a somewhat tall for a skink, standing just shy of eye level to Tyler. How was also quite young for a professor, spending his life to date in the academic system gradually progressing through the ranks. His field was biology, a minor of Tyler\u2019s, and the purple drake enjoyed a reasonably comfortable relationship with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came as a relief to Tyler when he found the professor shuffling some papers in his office that morning. Leaving Rob in the hallway, the drake knocked softly on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Tyler.\u201d The professor said as he recognised one of his former students. \u201cWhat\u2019s brought you back here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d the drake started awkwardly, \u201cit\u2019s somewhat extracurricular, but I was hoping I could get your guidance on something that has come up, if you aren\u2019t too busy?\u201d Tyler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, my day is pretty full starting in about half an hour. I\u2019ve got some preparations to do, so unless it\u2019s a quick one, would you mind coming back Thursday afternoon? I can put some consultation time aside if you\u2019d like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. There was no way he was waiting until Thursday. \u201cNo, it should only take a second, if that\u2019s alright\u201d. Tyler lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, fire away!\u201d the skink said, gesturing him in as he placed his hands down on his paperwork, affording the purple drake his full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler approached his desk. \u201cI have this rabbit friend who\u2019s recently had this odd medical condition, as I was just wondering if you had any ideas about what it could be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink furrowed his brows. \u201cTyler, I\u2019m not a medical practitioner, I\u2019m not in the business of diagnosis\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Peter.\u201d Tyler interrupted carefully. \u201cI\u2019m not after a diagnosis, I was just wondering if you knew of the term for his phenomena.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhenomina?!\u201d the skink said in mock impression. \u201cWell, that\u2019s much more appropriate than \u2018medical condition\u2019. Go ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yesterday I noticed his body temperature had dropped dramatically\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake him to the hospital.\u201d The skink said suddenly alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave an uneasy smile. \u201cNo, it gets worse than that. Later last night, his temperature was clearly below room temperature. And this morning when he was showering, the water froze into ice in his fur. It\u2019s like his body is generating cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink cocked his head as he tried to read the Drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I know it sounds unusual, but I brought him in today to show you\u2026 if you wouldn\u2019t mind taking a look for yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink sat a moment puzzled. \u201cTyler, I just told you I\u2019m full on today, why do you think I\u2019d be up for\u2026 whatever this is?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts not a trick, or a joke, or a scam.\u201d Tryler reassured him. \u201cRob!\u201d he called out of the office. Instantly, the white rabbit poked his head through the doorway, his long ears facing to attention. \u201cPeter, this is my friend Rob\u2026\u201d Tyler said as the rabbit walked into the room. Rob fidgeted nervously before offering his hand to the skink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked carefully between the rabbit and the drake before accepting the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d he recoiled in shock from the rabbit\u2019s brief grip. He stared in disbelief a moment longer before finally laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, that was clever. How did you do that?\u201d he asked the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not really doing anything, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, this is real.\u201d Tyler said seriously. \u201cTouch him anywhere on his body, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s just as cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter shook his head in disgust. \u201cTyler, I\u2019m not about to start touching students. Fun is fun, but that\u2019s clearly crossing a big line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell can you at least touch his forehead?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cOr take his temperature? You know me Peter, when have I ever tried to pull a prank on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink shifted his attention between the drake and the rabbit. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d he trailed off before scoffing. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to fall for this, but you\u2019re being serious aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tyler said absolutely. \u201cJust feel his forehead.\u201d Tyler insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob bent down and leant towards the skink, offering his forehead. His brow was furrowed and his nose twitched nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Peter leant forwards and placed the back of his hand on the rabbit\u2019s forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh!\u201d he cried out in surprise and disgust as his hand pulled away. Then as if to confirm, he touched it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t even hold my hand on it, it\u2019s so cold!\u201d he said to himself in amazement. Suddenly he grabbed the rabbit\u2019s shoulder, and then his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s cold all over.\u201d Tyler said, as if answering the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026 amazing!\u201d the skink said numbly. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything so cold in my life, how are you not frozen solid?\u201d The skink asked the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shrugged nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk so that\u2019s one of the odd things\u2026\u201d Tyler began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink raised his eyebrows \u201cThere\u2019s more!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell\u2026\u201d Tyler paused to articulate. Electricity wasn\u2019t really his field. \u201cIf Rob makes contact with an active electrical device, he seems to short them out, and he attracts the electric current, so he gets electrocuted.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Rob began quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t have to actually touch it anymore; it\u2019s just if I get close to it\u2026\u201d he corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink eyed the pair. \u201cI think I understand you. But people get electrocuted on everyday appliances all the time, so how can you discern that he isn\u2019t just unlucky or reckless?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob gave Tyler a nervous look before slowly moving his hand towards a small desk lamp that sat on the professor\u2019s desk. The three followed his hand in silence as it inched towards the bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG! The light flashed out when the rabbit\u2019s hand was about six inches away from it, sending a short bolt of white electricity up the rabbit\u2019s arm. Tyler was expecting it, but the explosion still caused him to jump. The skink was outright startled, flinching quite comically. The rabbit didn\u2019t move at all, save for a dopey little grin forming on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s repeatable, Peter.\u201d Tyler said. \u201cHe\u2019s broken a fair few appliances at home now, and some on campus. All within a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t that hurt?\u201d The skink asked Rob in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d the professor said raising his eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s two things I\u2019m at a loss to explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe third is a big one\u2026\u201d Tyler began, enjoying the look of expectation he managed to provoke from the professor.<br>\r\n\u201cLess than two days ago, he was this tall.\u201d Tyler said, placing a flat hand against his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor looked between the drake\u2019s hand and the top of the rabbit\u2019s head. \u201cThat would be about a foot the difference.\u201d He estimated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyeah, probably about that.\u201d Tyler agreed, looking up at the rabbit, which blushed a bit in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor was shaking his head. \u201cWell, I suppose growth would be considered a normal biological phenomena. And it\u2019s not unusual for an individual to have a spurt in their late teens or even early twenties, so this one does have a rational explanation based on current understandings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he grew a foot in less than two days.\u201d Tyler insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, sir.\" Rob added. \"I've been growing for over a day now. It was about this time yesterday that I started noticing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor studied the rabbit for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m still not really convinced; you haven\u2019t presented me with anything other than testimony backed up on speculation. It\u2019s far more likely that you are both mistaken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Peter.\u201d Tyler tried to reason. \u201cYou\u2019ve felt how cold he is, and seen how he\u2026 shorts out things and gets electrocuted. Why is this so hard to accept?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s not how it works, Tyler. I have seen two phenomena I can\u2019t readily explain. And you have presented a third one to me which I can. While your claim is certainly extraordinary, I see nothing to back it up. Rob is unquestioningly a very tall rabbit. If I recall correctly, the mean lapin height is four and a half feet, and anything up to four foot eleven is considered average. Your friend here looks about five foot five, maybe six. That\u2019s easily within two standard deviations. That puts him somewhere in the high single digit percentile, exceptional but not extraordinary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was getting frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s not his size that's unusual, it\u2019s how he\u2019s suddenly got there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink was shaking his head. \u201cFor your accounts to be accurate, Rob would have needed to almost double his bodyweight in a twenty four hour period. Where did all that mass come from? Clearly, it\u2019s impossible on many levels though many fields. It would fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe.  If you think your friend is still growing at that pace, well then that suddenly becomes a hypothesis with predictive properties. It\u2019s a claim we can test. But I would be remiss to simply accept it and offer any insight based on your claims.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am still growing, sir.\u201d The rabbit mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d The skink rested a hand on his jaw as he considered the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be willing to participate in some informal experiments? Nothing too invasive, just some tests to try and measure some of these phenomena which have been demonstrated and discussed. We can get a better understanding on what is exactly happening here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shuffled nervously as he eyed Tyler uneasily. The purple drake nodded his head in encouragement.</span></div></div>",

Peter had cancelled his classes for the morning in order to prepare and conduct the voluntary experiments, leaving the students to wait until he was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit was clearly out of his element. His elongated incisors softly chewed his bottom lip as his ears lay back and sharply flat. His brown eyes were wide and restless, looking everywhere but at Tyler. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The rabbit finally answered. \u201cIsn't it respectful?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really...\u201d Tyler replied cautiously. \u201cIt sounds a bit\u2026 weird, to be honest. It's fine, I guess, but over here, you\u2019d usually refer to their position and their last name if you wanted to be respectful. Like \u2018Doctor Del\u2019. And you wouldn\u2019t say it every sentence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d the rabbit murmured.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologise.\" Tyler insisted. \"I just thought you might want some advice, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit fidgeted on his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re nervous aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tyler broke the silence. \u201cWhat happened with not worrying too much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged, looking at the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t like being the centre of attention. Or being inspected, or studied or judged. I\u2019ll be fine, It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m not used to it, and I don\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt slightly guilty. He knew the rabbit was only here because he wanted him to be. Was he taking advantage of the situation? The rabbit probably felt pressured to go along with Tyler. Was he really in a position to refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Tyler offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d The rabbit said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another long, awkward pause before the rabbit loudly exhaled. \u201cBut I guess it won\u2019t hurt to know more about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door across the hall opened. \u201cOk guys.\u201d the professor gestured them into the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab was small, and mostly filled by various apparatus, some less readily identifiable than the others. It would have looked intimidating enough without the three cameras positioned to view the centre of the room from different angles, all sporting active red LED\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit looked outright panicked. \u201cAre you going to write an article about me and publish this publically?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink shook his head emphatically. \u201cOh, hell no! Do you know what it would take for me to get approval for a study like that? It would take weeks of formal planning and paperwork to get ethics approval for a start, and then there's funding and resources... those articles you read in journals take years to go from planning to published. This is purely informal, for the three of us better understand you. It would cost me my career if I passed any of this on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what\u2019s with all the cameras?\u201d Tyler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink stared at him a moment, puzzled. \u201cBecause we\u2019re conducting experiments... this is how you do them properly. Informal doesn\u2019t mean sloppy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit steeled himself. \u201cWhat do you want me to do to start with?\u201d he asked, clearly wanting to get things over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease take a step on the scales over here and we will get a starting measurement, if you wouldn't mind.\u201d the skink gestured towards what looked to be a simple bathroom scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit obliged. The scale shorted out as his first foot landed on it. Rob grunted in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink drew a line through something on his clipboard. \u201cOk, are you still alright Rob?\u201d he asked. The rabbit nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStep back please\u201d he said to the rabbit as he collected the dead scale, replacing it with one that looked far more expensive. He crudely placed an upturned white plastic bucket on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I would like to get digital measurements as a preference. This bucket should offer enough electrical resistance to keep you from shorting it out.Would you mind stepping up on the bucket please Rob?\u201d The skink asked, offering his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit didn\u2019t take it, easily managing the step up on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, stand still please.\u201d The professor instructed as he read the scales. \u201cFifty eight kilograms, four hundred and tirty-sev\u2026 eight grams.\u201d He said into a recording device before taking more notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit raised his eyebrows in surprise, his ears shooting up and forwards. \u201cI was thirty one kilograms last time I weighed myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe won't record that measurement.\u201d The skink replied. \u201cOr even this one, until it settles. Are you standing still?\u201d he asked the rabbit without looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The rabbit mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink stared at the scales patiently. \u201cTyler, would you mind switching with Rob?\u201d he asked after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Why?\" the drake asked. Rob stepped down as Tyler approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust for a point of comparison.\u201d The skink said as he helped the purple drake up onto the bucket. \u201cStand as still as you can.\u201d He instructed as he patiently studied the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now could Rob please get back on?\u201d he asked after about thirty seconds. The two swapped positions again as the skink studied the scales for another good minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, you can get off now, thank you\u201d. The professor instructed as he started writing down notes. \u201cWell, that didn\u2019t go as expected at all.\u201d He said to himself. The students waited for an elaboration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a very accurate set of scales.\u201d The skink began as he wrote. \u201cThere was a bit of noise\u2026 in the measurements. You expect that because no one can stand perfectly still. But I did notice an increasing pattern with Rob which wasn\u2019t present for Tyler. I recorded his weight increasing by a gram roughly every five seconds. Which is consistent with your growth hypothesis.\u201d He said, finally looking up from his notes. \u201cA gram every five seconds is significant; that would work out to about seventeen kilograms a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler converted that in his mind. \u201cthat would be\u2026 what, about forty ponds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink nodded.  \u201cWhich would actually be somewhat consistent with your original \u2018slightly less than two days\u2019 estimate...\" he said, pointing at Tyler. \"..if we WERE to record Rob\u2019s original thirty one kilogram starting value. But it's far too slow for your twenty four hour timeframe.\u201d He said, pointing at Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit scowled slightly as he looked away. \u201cThat\u2019s because I also get bigger when I\u2019m electrocuted. It\u2019s not always gradual.\u201d He mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou never mentioned that before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was surprised, thinking back on the original conversation. \u201cSorry, I thought we did.\u201d Tyler apologised. \u201cHe claims his growth is spurred by electricity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s also something we can test for then.\u201d The professor said as he wrote down more notes. \u201cBut right now, let\u2019s finish out initial measurements. Would you mind standing up against the chart on that wall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink measured the rabbit\u2019s height \u2013 five foot six and a half, and using a rather large thermometer, estimated his body temperature to be at approximately minus fifty three degrees Celsius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlood pressure and heart rate otherwise normal\u201d the skink checked off his list. \u201cRight then, there are two additional tests I would like to perform, so long as you are willing, Rob.\u201d The skink said as he went to wheel a large heavy rectangular device to the centre of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked at it with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an industrial heater.\u201d The skink reassured him. \u201cI would like to test if your body temperature in different environments. And now that we have established a potential pattern of increasing weight, I would like to do it with you standing on scales.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit reluctantly stood back up onto the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFifty eight kilograms, eight hundred and fifty one grams That appears to be an expected extrapolation.\u201d the professor said formally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stay still.\u201d He instructed the rabbit as he switched the heater on, quickly heating the small room. \u201cIf either of you feel faint or otherwise queer due to the room temperature, then speak out. I want to raise it significantly for a short period of time, but I don\u2019t want you guys having any health issues.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel temperature.\u201d The rabbit stated flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor turned the switch off a few minutes later. Tyler was beginning to find the heat unbearable. \u201cFifty degrees Celsius. The skink noted. \u201cHow are you coping with this, Rob?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel temperature.\u201d the rabbit repeated impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink quickly took down some more notes. \u201cOk then, the starting weight at this temperature is fifty eight kilograms, nine hundred and eleven grams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was sweating profusely. The professor timed out ten minutes before he took the rabbit\u2019s temperature again. \u201cStill minus fifty three degrees. He said. He then looked at the scale again. \u201cfifty nine kilograms, eighty three grams.\u201d He noted, before activating the lab\u2019s ventilation system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room erupted as unseen but clearly sizeable large fans suddenly sucked the hot, stale air up and out of the room. \u201cOh, thank god.\u201d Tyler said with relief as he felt cooler air flow against his sweaty skin and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're almost done, just one more test to go.\u201d The skink said as he wandered out back. \u201cI may be a few minutes, I didn\u2019t prepare this one.\u201d He left the two students alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler wandered up to the Rob nervously, the rabbit still poised on the white bucket. \u201cUm, wow. Forty pounds a day? That\u2019s really\u2026 that\u2019s fucking fast man, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span></div></div>",

This whole setup\u2026 I was happy to just let it ride, But you caught me up in all this bullshit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was intimidated by the rabbit. His voice was suprisingly loud and deep, and he was frame was comparatively imposing. \u201cRob, come on!\u201d Tyler protested as he took half a step backwards. \u201cI never made you do anything, I\u2019ve just asked and you\u2019ve agreed! I\u2019ve said all along we can eave when you want to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit gave a sharp laugh. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s all been through passive aggressive bullshit and you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob held his gaze for a tense moment, before he finally shifted it back to the floor. A very silent pause followed, before the rabbit sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so angry. I don\u2019t usually get angry\u2026 so I don\u2019t know how to handle it well, ok? I'm just stressed. I'm not used to that either.\u201d His eyes were everywhere but Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was relieved that Rob had called down, but he wasn\u2019t willing to let it slide. \u201cI haven\u2019t been passive aggressive.\u201d Tyler calmly asserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit paused for thought. \u201cThat\u2019s not the word for it. I\u2019m sorry. But I have been compelled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, were you afraid I\u2019m going to kick you out of the house if you didn\u2019t come along?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shook his head slowly. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t compelled through fear; I was compelled through my own feeling of obligation. I\u2019d happily help out in your store Tyler, or do any other menial task or favour. But I didn\u2019t want to do this. I didn\u2019t realise how much until I was in here though, so it\u2019s my fault for not just saying no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t we just go now?\u201d Tyler asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause then it\u2019s all for nothing isn\u2019t it? One last thing, and you can get what you wanted. If we leave now then I\u2019ve still gone through this and neither of us are happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then\u2026\u201d Peter abruptly ended the confrontation as entered the room, completely oblivious to the tension in the atmosphere. Rob raised an eyebrow as he noticed he held what looked to be some kind of cattle prod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRob, I would like to end this session by testing your claim that electrical shocks cause growth. I have a device that will allow me to safely give you a high voltage, low current electrical shock. Would you mind standing back on the bucket?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d The rabbit signed in resignation as he made his way back onto the scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cfifty nine kilograms, one hundred and sixty seven grams.\u201d The professor noted. \u201cAlright,\u201d the skink fiddled with the prod.  \u201cI\u2019m going to start this on a relatively low voltage, about two thousand. As a quick point of comparison, an everyday static electric charge can be hundreds of thousands of volts. At low amperage, this will be completely safe.  Are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit nodded. The professor gently placed the end of the prod onto his thigh. Rob\u2019s eyes closed in anticipation, his ears pointing down and slightly to the side as he bit his bottom lip. And then gave a weak grunt before the professor removed the prod to study the scale and quietly started to take notes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWas that it?\u201d the rabbit asked slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the first one. I\u2019d like to try several such shocks in increasing voltages. So long as you are willing and don\u2019t feel an unreasonable level of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t hurt at all. I\u2019ve told you, getting shocked doesn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d The rabbit said irritably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d still rather approach this cautiously\u2026\u201d the skink said as he fiddled with the prod. He held it against the rabbits thigh a second time. \u201cTen thousand volts. are you ready?\u201d he asked the rabbit, who tensed up and nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lead to the same result, the rabbit barely acknowledging the shock while the professor recorded the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor looked up at Tyler once he had finished writing. \u201cThis is kind of awkward for one person to execute, would you mind administering the shocks while I study the measurements and take notes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was taken aback. \u201cI don\u2019t want to shock him!\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just do it so we can get this over with!\u201d Rob snapped at the purple drake. His sudden outburst was enough to jolt Tyler into compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler placed the prod on the rabbit somewhat reluctantly after the professor gave him a brief crash course. The skink aquatted in front of the scales, resting his clipboard on his knees ready to take notes as nessesary. \u201cOk, when you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler flicked the switch. The next moment was chaos. The prod made a lout popping sound, before emitting a bright white, continuous bolt of energy directly into the rabbit. Tyler instantly panicked as he fumbled uselessly at the switch. It wasn\u2019t turning off. The electricity was flowing freely into the Rob\u2019s body for a good few seconds before the purple Drake gathered the sense to throw it away across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Tyler saw the rabbit grow. His eyes were immediately drawn to the halo of white fur that abruptly spilled out between the rabbit\u2019s parting shirt and shorts. The shirt slid a good three quarters of an inch up his elongating torso, exposing the rabbit\u2019s navel to the daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other elements to the spurt which he witnessed through his periphery. The rabbit\u2019s tail rose a good inch higher as his lengthening feet spurred his torso further up into the air. His fur expanded from nothing as it slid over new muscles. He saw the slack in the rabbit\u2019s pants dissipate as his hips and thighs widened, affording his growing package more definition as the elastic audibly withdrew slightly down the rabbit\u2019s pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth lasted only as long as the shock, but it was a powerful set of movement. Tyler stepped back out of reflex, staring up at the rabbit in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob smiled nervously as he stretched his enlarged body, his spine and shoulders loudly popping as he did so. \u201cHey, can we take that thing home?\u201d he nervously joke. It fell flat on the two speechless withesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c..ok, that\u2019s enough.\u201d the skink said, before checking the scales one last time. \u201cSixty four kilograms, two hundred and twenty grams.\u201d He said without emotion. \u201ctwenty one grams.\u201d He distantly corrected himself a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit got down off the scales with a slightly louder thud than before. Tyler stared at the rabbit with wide eyes. He was obviously taller. Five foot nine? It would have to be about that. And while the rabbit was still reasonably lean, there were more contours visible through his stretching shirt. Tyler's eyes opened in surprise when he saw that the rabbit was sporting the beginning of an erection through his tight shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit noticed Tyler examining him, and turned away. \u201cIt\u2019s the electric shock\u2026 \u201c he mumbled meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was immediately embarrassed himself, and the two spent a good moment poiniantly not noticing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink was looking at his clip board, but he was no longer writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so here is my initial hypothesis. The subject\u2019s body is absorbing energy from the environment, and converting that energy into mass. The subject appears to take in heat energy from his environment, which is why he appears cold to touch. Using the measured temperature of minus fifty three degrees as a base, I increased the temperature difference between subject and environment by roughly forty seven percent. Growth accelerated by the same percentage, increasing from one gram every five seconds, to one gram every three point five seconds. This showed a strong correlation between growth and room temperature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink turned the page on his clipboard. \u201cIt also appears that his body is also converting electricity into mass. A significant increase was recorded when an unrecorded amount entered the subject\u2019s body. Normally, electricity would flow through an earthed object into the ground. However, it would appear that the subject is his own grounding force, which would explain how he is shorting out electric equipment, and report no pain from shocks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skink looked up form his notes. \u201cFurther research is necessary. I would like to study samples such as blood, fur and saliva, as well as test how the subject responds to other forms of energy, such as kinetic and noise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor looked up at Rob. \u201cWould I be able to book you in for some additional tests tomorrow after I have analysed the data here, and given the results more thought?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked to Tyler, his brown eyes stoic but his ears still suggested that he was tense and irritable. </span></div></div>",

Why, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything, does it? I mean, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy, hopefully it satisfies you. But unless it\u2019s knowledge that I can put to use, ignorance is bliss. I mean, why worry about something you can\u2019t change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid any of that worry you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob didn\u2019t appear to acknowledge the question straight away. The two made their way outside into the mid-afternoon sun. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it was so fast.\u201d The rabbit replied so long after the original question it was almost without context. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t realise I was that cold. My weight just kept creeping up... I guess it\u2019s brought it to the front of my mind. It\u2019s going to take some effort to push it all back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler pulled up once he realised that they weren\u2019t heading in any particular direction. \u201cSo what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked around as if he was surprised by his surroundings. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He said. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll hang around for a bit, try and find something to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you like to meet some of my friends then?\u201d Tyler offered. \u201cI know some guys that live on-campus; we can wander over to the dorms and see what they're doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob\u2019s eyes picked up. \u201cUm\u2026 well, yeah I guess. Don\u2019t you have to get back to your store though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head as he grimaced. \u201cI have classes soon. Today\u2019s lost. May as well make the most of it.\u201d He said as he lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I ever thank ya for bein\u2019 Born?\u201d Tyler jumped as a thick black paw landed roughly on his shoulder. He instinctively recognised the owner of the gruff voice. Tyler half turned, was half forcibly spun to face the hulking black wolf behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want Fang?\u201d Tyler asked flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanna thank ya for bein\u2019 born Bro!\u201d He squeezed Tyler as he squatted his nearly 8 foot frame eye level. \u201cI was just thinkin\u2019 to myself in the gym about how hard your brother tries to catch up to me\u2026 but can\u2019t get nowhere. And I was thinkin\u2019 about what it would be like if he was born by himself. If he got all ya dad\u2019s sperm. But instead you took some, and they were wasted on you, weren\u2019t they? That\u2019s what\u2019cha are, a waste of sperm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Fang.\u201d Tyler said patiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's smile became more toothy. \u201cDoes he hate ya for takin' some of those sperm off him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small purple drake closed his eyes and inhaled slowly. He was going to get sucked into this. \u201cWe aren\u2019t twins Fang. And even if we were, that\u2019s not how reproduction works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolf sneered. \u201cHeh, well I admit I prefer the more hands on way of learnin\u2019 about shit.\u201d Fang stood back up, reaching his muscle-bound hands out to grasp and buck at an ass that wasn\u2019t there. \u201cI gotta tell ya, I\u2019m quite an expert, so ya\u2019d better be careful when ya try and school me on the subject. All ya little books won\u2019t get ya dick wet boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s attention shifted to the rabbit, addressing him with a condescending wink. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you before hunny bunny. That goes for you too! If yer hangin\u2019 out with little T-tard, I\u2019d bet yer the only fuckin\u2019 rabbit around who\u2019s not gettin\u2019 any!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked confused, his ears splayed to the side a-symmetrically.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cYa want a tip?\u201d The wolf continued. \u201cGet some meat before ya slip yaself into somethin\u2019 so tight. Yain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to show off boy! Who dya think you\u2019re foolin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all Fang?\u201d Tyler interrupted as patiently as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah bro! Just tell Dave when ya get home, tell him yer sorry ya held him back from reaching ol\u2019 Fang\u2019s level.\u201d Fang took a step back to flex his frame, before leaving in a triumphant strut, his long black tail wagging happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it he\u2019s not one of your friends?\u201d the rabbit asked after the wolf had gotten out of earshot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scoffed. \u201cNo, but he is one of Davids. He\u2019s one of the big names on the football team, so you'll get to know him. Though if you\u2019re lucky, it won\u2019t be on a personal level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what, was he serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was serious about being an ass, if that\u2019s what you mean. He\u2019s been here years, and still thinks he\u2019s in High School. I\u2019m on his radar because of my brother. Which is unfortunate because he\u2019s a cunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe does seem pathetic. Does he seriously think that about sperm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one\u2019s the stupid.\u201d Tyler replied more confidently than he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty big though.\u201d The rabbit mused as they resumed their journey to the dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, you\u2019ve gotta give him that. Otherwise he\u2019s left with nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lead Rob through the campus hall before knocking on a door. It was opened by a rather fit looking Otter.  His loud board shorts and unbuttoned shirt, combined with his unkempt goatee suggested that he wasn\u2019t overly bothered by the day. A large, fat brown bear sat on the bed across the tiny room, a raised eyebrow the only sign of life on his face as he looked up from his laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler! How\u2019s it hanging man? Haven\u2019t seen you in weeks!\u201d  the Otter cried, embracing the purple drake. \u201cCome in guys, have a midday beer. It\u2019s the perfect day to chill!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed them a cold drink before they had even finished entering the room. Say what you will about the size of the dorms, a fresh beer was never more than a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gestured to the rabbit. \u201cLet me introduce you guys to Rob. He\u2019s a noob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter smiled at the rabbit warmly. \u201cHey man, my name\u2019s Toby\u201d he said, holding out a webbed hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Rob mumbled, conscious of his body temperature. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 spilt coke all over me and I\u2019m sticky.\u201d He pretended to rub his hand on his thigh to validate his lame excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the otter was offended, he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cRobert the Rabbit.\u201d he quipped with a playful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shook his head. \u201cNo, not Robert, or Robby. Just Rob. That\u2019s how it\u2019s spelt on my birth certificate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter looked surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s unusual. I approve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish my name was just Bub\u2026\u201d the bear muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it short for?\u201d the Rabbit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarnaby.\u201d The Drake and Otter said delightedly in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe hates it.\u201d Toby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019d have to if he would rather be called Bub.\u201d Tyler sneere at the bear. Bub stared back at him, his expression pointedly unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Rob into Magic?\u201d the otter asked, flashing the rabbit a deck of Magic the Gathering Cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, no\u2026\u201d the rabbit began, his interest piqued. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually played before, but I've been interested in trying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a nerd then bro?\" The otter asked approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged, then nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve played some pen and paper RPG\u2019s before, and dabbled with Warhammer. But those things are too expensive to get too deep into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby laughed. \u201cWell then man, you\u2019ve hit the fucking mother load now haven\u2019t you? I trust Tyler has let you in on his little friends-with-benefits discount ring?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t call it that.\u201d Tyler laughing in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d the rabbit said as he looked between the otter and the dragon. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe sells us stuff at wholesale.\u201d The bear said without much emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sell them stuff at what I claim to be wholesale.\u201d The purple dragon corrected factually, taking a mouthful of beer before his face could betray any emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when it\u2019s your birthday...\" the Otter continued \"...you know you're getting something cool. Its pretty cheap when you think about it, but it\u2019s till pretty awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyes narrowed. \u201cFuck you, cheap my ass! This year I\u2019m getting you a nice sweater because of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sell this sort of stuff?\u201d The rabbit asked Tyler in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you about my shop.\u201d Tyler pointed out in amused confusion. \u201cYou were going to work there this afternoon, how can you not remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d The rabbit protested. \u201cI know you had a store. You didn\u2019t tell me you sold cool stuff! I just assumed you sold shoes or some shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter laughed out loud. Even the bear lifted a slight smirk as he visibly exhaled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHOES?!\u201d Tyler demanded. \u201cYou thought I sold SHOES? Fuck you too, Rob. You\u2019re getting underwear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit chuckled, a genuine smile breaking out on his face. For the first time, Rob looked relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, should I gather a party together for a game? Toby asked as he finished laughing, holding up the cards. \u201cI know Bubs hasn\u2019t got anything on...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve got classes soon, so I can\u2019t stick around. Sucks to be me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter wrinkled his face up in disgust. \u201cYou fucking suck dude. What about you then, Rob?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit looked between Tyler and his friends a moment, before he started nodding. \u201cYeah, that sounds pretty cool actually. As long as you go easy on me to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as going easy in magic.\u201d The bear pointed out almost factually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler picked himself up. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you later tonight I suppose\u201d he said to Rob, before turning to the other two. \u201cAnd I guess I\u2019ll see you guys around sometime soon as well. Do me a favour though, Rob. Beat the bear. Even if it takes you all night, just beat the fucking bear.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing people notice about David is his sheer size. As a dragon, this kind of size was just natural among their species, but the blue drake was loaded with muscle from top to bottom. At the seven foot mark, David towered over most average sized anthros, including his younger brother Tyler, who barely even broke the five foot mark. David's body was colored a deep, almost ocean blue, unlike the brighter Purple coloration of his brother, Tyler.  Growing up, David acted like the regular big brother; teasing and wrestling with his brother, making fun of him and taking his stuff, though all in all it was all friendly, they still liked each other. David just sometimes would go a bit 'overboard' when it came to the taunting, or the wrestling, and never seemed to really notice it. <br>\r\n\tDavid\u2019s frame is akin to that of a well muscled athlete, perhaps even a tad more. At over 7 foot in height, his body had plenty of room to pack on the meat, and probably the only person on the football team bigger than David, was Fang. Thick forearms and meaty claws, only surpassed by his bulging biceps and broad shoulders which didn\u2019t do much in keeping his neck out of view, but the giant slabs of meat that were his pecs did that job for anyone that was shorter than the blue drake. His legs were the equivalent of small tree trunks in thickness, and the thing between his legs was no slacker either. At this size, David was mostly the desire for girls and envy of guys, including his brother. It was obvious that David took care of his body and this was the culmination of it.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\tPersonality wise, David was not the brightest tool in the shed. He was not stupid by any means, but common sense was really not the dragon\u2019s forte and sometimes very gullible; mostly falling for simple tricks, but most wouldn\u2019t even want to do this considering his sheer size. He had one of those abrasive senses of humor, where he would playfully rib and make fun of people, and would often take it just a bit too far, but would never seem to notice unless someone spelled it out for him. Most often this took place with his brother, Tyler. Tyler didn't HATE his brother, but David could be a jerk sometimes, without even meaning too, and it was a secret fantasy of Tyler's, one he never let David in on, that Tyler were the big one and David was the one always at the mercy of others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut despite all this, David was very close to his brother. He was terrible at showing it sometimes, but he loved Tyler, and to quote David \u201cNonne screws around with Tyler but me\u201d, as David constantly reaffirmed that he was the only one allowed to pick on the little purple dragon, and would, if rarely, even come to blows with someone being rough with, or making fun of Tyler a bit too hard. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On his way home from football practice, David was somewhat tired, sweaty and his outfit of his football gear caked with dirt. With a grumble, the memories of practice had flooded back as he walked through the streets trying to get home as soon as possible. His coach had decided to run them into the ground for a game coming up within the next few weeks, and while David was not new to physical practice, it left him without any energy and all he wanted to do was go home, take a shower and do something to whittle the night away. The blue drake was normally active a lot, as his body was proof of this, but for some reason, David felt completely drained of his energy while practice had come and gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a hand on his stomach, he wondered if he had eaten something that made him like this. The drake shook his head as he continued on home, in need of food and a shower. Now then, what the hell was he going to do when he got home after getting cleaned up? Go out and hang around, or just stay home and waste time on the computer doing what most college students did and just go to town? Both of these thoughts were equally tempting as the dragon began crossing the street, completely unaware of the street light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake was soon called to attention as a blaring sound cut into his ears. Turning around he cried out as a truck carrying a tank of something cut through a block and was speeding right towards him. In a burst of adrenaline, the giant drake managed to jump out of the way. Whatever the truck was carrying fell off.  An open container, filled with an odd green substance washed over the drake\u2019s body as the truck just sped down as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odd, green substance had fallen on him and around the area. Upon closer inspection, it seemed as if the substance began disappearing by the naked eye. This substance, when exposed to any living organism, tends to seep into whatever it touched, causing many problems, one of which includes growth. For the moment, David stared around, wondering what the hell just happened. Scratching his head, he noticed that something was different about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I feel so full of energy?\u201d David said to himself. He didn\u2019t know what the hell that stuff was made o, but it made him feel great! It felt like he could take on multiple games and still be ready enough for a grueling workout! The dragon darted past the street in which the accident happened and began running home, a new spring in his step. Now then, David was not the brightest light bulb in the box. Most would wonder if this stuff was dangerous, but not even the mere thought of this was in David\u2019s head.  Right now as the drake was heading home, he would be in for a big surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce David arrived home, he darted past Tyler who had been playing a video game, and into the shower, stripping himself of his clothing. The drake opened the shower head which was a good two feet taller than him. The shower stall had to be adjusted for his height and added in at the tallest point so he wouldn\u2019t lord over it. Opening the shower head, David began singing in the  shower, garnering the attention of his brother who merely shrugged it off as nothing. As the blue drake kept showering, something began happening. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David let the water wash over his entire body for a moment, enjoying the warmth as it soaked him from head to toe. He reached over to the shelf for his favorite brand of shower gel designed to relax his muscles after his long hard soccer practice. The big dragon squeezed the gel into his palm and started soaping up his large muscular body, rubbing his hands over his thick pecs and abs, massaging it deep into himself while letting out a relaxed sigh and closing his eyes.<br>\r\nHowever unknown to the dragon, as he continued to wash down his body something else was also happening, his whole body was slowly beginning to dwindle in size, only an inch every minute or two but he was definitely getting smaller.<br>\r\nDavid was too focused on rubbing his hands over himself and relaxing in the waters warmth to notice it at first but after a while he thought that the water taps seemed higher than they used to be, he shrugged it off, thinking he was just imagining things and continued with his shower, resuming his earlier singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later he finally turned off the water, once again noticing the taps were higher than before, but like earlier he just shrugged it off thinking he must be imagining things, \u201cMan, I've got to start taking it easy during practice, I think I'm starting to hallucinate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon exited the shower stall and grabbed a towel to dry himself off, he wiped the water away from himself from head to toe and wrapped the towel around his waist. Previously the lower end of the towel would reach just above his knees but now it seemed to stretch below them, \u201cugh, did Tyler mess up the laundry again? I swear that guy can't do anything right\u201d he mumbles to himself as he exits the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile David walks down the hallway towards his bedroom his side bumps into Tyler who was walking in the opposite direction to the now vacant bathroom, \u201cHey, watch where you're...\u201d David stops mid sentence. He blinks in confusion as he looks at his brother who now appeared to be the the same size as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT...Tyler???\u201d David stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid?\u201d Tyler replies, \u201cWhat happened to you? Why are you so small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blinks again, and looks down at his own body, then back up and around the room before returning his gaze to his brother. At first David thought that Tyler had somehow grown to match his height, but the quick look around the hallway made him realize the truth of the situation, he had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, oh my god....\u201d was all David could get out, his heart started beating faster and his body started to shake a little as the panic began to set in, \u201cI... I don't.... This can't...\u201d his mind was racing, trying to make some sense of it all but was unable to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply continued to stare in confusion, getting worried about what was happening, \u201cDavid? Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother didn't reply, instead he turned and ran straight into his bedroom, slamming and locking the door behind him. Once inside he ran straight up to his full length body mirror and stared at himself. His body looked exactly like it always had, a well muscled body that would put most men to shame, but now it was so much smaller than before, if just a moment ago he was staring his brother in the face it must mean he's roughly 5ft tall now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can't be happening. This can't be real...\u201d he thought while making his way over to take a seat on the edge of his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud banging snapped David back to attention though as Tyler knocked on the door, \u201cDavid? What's going on? Talk to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't know what to do, he was scared and confused, but eventually he decided to...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't anything David would have ever picked out for himself, but he had to admit that it was rather striking. It resembled a celtic knot, with a heart at the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's supposed to bring you strength and love,\" Tyler said, clearly feeling a little sheepish. \"At least, that's what they told me at the antique shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid clapped him on the shoulder to reassure him. \"It's great,\" he said. \"Really cool and unusual. I love it!\" He might be laying it on a little thick, but if it made his brother feel better, it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone always assumed that because they were brothers, they would always be at each other's throats. There was some fighting, of course, and he did often tease his smaller brother, but when it came down to it, he just wanted to look out for his brother. They didn't always understand each other - Tyler was a bookworm, while David practically lived in the gym - but he loved his brother, no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rewarded his efforts with a small smile. \"Glad you like it,\" he said. \"I think I'm going to go wash up and turn in for the night...see you in the morning.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" David said before heading to his own room, plopping down in the chair at his computer and clicking open his internet browser. He immediately surfed to his usual 'adult' art sites and began browsing through his favorite categories. Macro was one of his biggest turn-ons...maybe it was because he was so much bigger than his brother, but for some reason, the thought of being so much bigger and powerful than everyone just did it for him. As luck would have it, there was a slew of new art since yesterday and as he began to browse through the files, his dragon rod began to stand at attention. Within moments his pants were down and his fist was in motion, and moments later he gave a soft grunt as the orgasm took him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was reaching for a tissue to clean himself up when he felt the charm on his necklace grow warm, the sensation quickly spreading through his whole body...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt a bit odd after a few moments, as if the usual sensation of afterglow had been magnified.  David pushed away from his computer, sliding back on his office chair and glancing down at himself, his cheeks flushed and his breathing a bit erratic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David stared he felt \u2013 and saw \u2013 the odd sensation of his boxers becoming slowly looser upon his meaty thighs, as if he were slowly becoming small enough to fit a bit less snugly into the tight briefs.  His eyes widened at the sight, and after few moments of staring dumbfounded at himself he leaped up out of his office chair.  David immediately went to his mirror to confirm that he was still fully himself, and that he\u2019d just been having some sort of odd, pleasure-induced hallucination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what he saw in the mirror was worse than what he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him was a smaller version of himself.  Not only could he tell that he\u2019d lost six inches \u2013 bringing him down to 6\u20199\u201d in the process \u2013 but he also appeared to have lost some muscle mass!  He brought his arms up and flexed, a soft whimper in his throat when he saw that his arms had lost some of their thickness.  He turned to the side and flexed his calf muscles, already noticing that he\u2019d lost muscle mass all over.  And if David wasn\u2019t already freaking out enough, it was when he put a hand to his half-hard cock that he felt the curious, frightening sensation of having shrank slightly \u201cdownstairs\u201d as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as David opened his mouth to bellow in terror at the inexplicable change to his body, he heard his brother\u2019s voice calling out from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, get in here!\u201d  The smaller drake called out, a strong urgency in his voice.  And something else in his tone, a depth that had never been there before.  David ran from his room and into the hall, his briefs hanging loose around his hips and rump.  Though he was still tall and muscular, he\u2019d lost enough thickness and enough size to really feel a bit small in his own clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned around on his office chair when he heard David burst into the room, the smaller drake immediately standing up again.  He appeared to have been doing the same thing as David \u2013 finishing a little self-pleasuring for the night \u2013 with his underwear pulled halfway down his thighs.  David growled softly, \u201cSheesh Tyler could you pull those up, I don\u2019t need that staring me in the face\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler whimpered softly and shook his head, bouncing a bit urgently on the balls of his feet, \u201cI can\u2019t get them back on, I\u2019ve\u2026I\u2019ve grown or something!  Look!\u201d  He tried to pull up his briefs, only for the waistband to start stretching to its limit, the sound of stitches popping filling the air.  Tyler gestured to himself, \u201cI\u2019m like, six inches taller than I used to be, and check this out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes widened when Tyler lifted his arms and flexed, seeing exactly what Tyler was freaking out about.  In direct opposition to David\u2019s changes, Tyler seemed to have gained both height and mass, the once-scrawny purple drake sporting a respectable amount of muscle mass and tone, though he was still a far cry from David\u2019s Herculean physique.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler dropped his arms, staring at David for a moment before asking cautiously, \u201cBro did you uh\u2026did you get shorter or something?  And you look kinda\u2026thinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled softly and nodded, his tail lashing back and forth with agitation, \u201cI lost 6 inches and some muscle mass!  Seems I know exactly where it went.\u201d  He eyed Tyler with a firm glare, as if accusing him of stealing his size from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler held his hands up defensively, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on!

Did you do anything peculiar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snorted and shook his head, not understanding where Tyler was going with his line of thought, \u201cAll I did was crank one out, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you wearing that amulet when you did it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I was wearing the amulet, I told you I liked it, isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d  David growled, thinking that Tyler was trying to get off subject rather than solve their problem, \u201cBut what does that have to do with anything!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rolled his eyes and stepped forward, reaching up to take a hold of his brother\u2019s amulet and tug on it, \u201cThis is your problem!  This thing must be some kind of, I dunno, magical object!  I guess having an orgasm with it on made you lose your size\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you gained it?  So what are we gonna do about it, Tyler?\u201d  David growled, still not pleased with his brother\u2019s theorizing.  He stepped forward and cracked his knuckles, feeling angry enough to lash out at his brother for this offense, even though it wasn\u2019t entirely his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler immediately backed off, laughing weakly, \u201cLook look it\u2019s okay!  It should be a simple fix.  Just calm down.  All we have to do is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLet me go... er. You know. Do my thing, with the necklace on. Maybe it'll give the size back to you, alright?\u201d Tyler offered in a soft, sympathetic tone... It was a struggle however, as Tyler, even without him having been having some 'fun' with himself, was painfully erect from the sheer thought of his increased height and mass. He was still pretty short, but he wasn't a runt anymore, and he had some real, if lean, mass on him now! Visible pectorals, and when he flexed his arm, there was a small visible mound of muscle that would well up across it. Somewhere, deep down, he didn't want to fix this... in fact. He wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, thankfully, his worry for David was overpowering that desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201calright... just... make it fast, alright?\u201d He murmured softly, hesitantly pulling the necklace off his head and handing it to Tyler. After a few seconds he blushed again when he realized what he had said, and quickly turned  his back so he didn't have to look at his still naked, and still erect brother. He slowly made his way out into the hallway, pulling Tyler's door closed behind him as he did, and glanced over at the height chart marked into his door frame, glancing back between his height mark, which was now noticeably above his head, and then down to where Tyler's was... significantly closer than he would have ever liked it. What if this was permanent? What if he was going to be stuck this big forever? He wasn't really THAT much shorter, I mean 6'9\u201d was still pretty damn tall, and was at least average for dragon size. Muscle mass could, with work, be gotten back... but the height, if that was gone forever, was he going to be stuck being that much shorter? All he could do was sit there, and hope this worked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce David left the room and slid the door closed, Tyler quickly ran his way back over to his full length mirror, unable to contain his excitement anymore. He pushed his briefs, still pooled around his thighs, back down to his feet and stood there in front of the mirror, nude, once more. But now, he was taller. Visibly taller. To someone that's over 7 foot tall, 6 inches of height isn't nearly as much as it might be to someone thats barely 5 foot tall. So while it had been noticable to David about the height he lost, it was notably more significant to Tyler. Everything in his room looked a bit smaller. His head came up higher in the mirror than he was used too, his body was even a bit wider, taking up more of the mirror than he was used too. Slowly Tyler started to raise up one of his arms, watching his chest shift slightly, as that faintly visible, new, pectoral muscle tensed a bit from the movement. His arm curled inwards and he couldn't help but let out a soft moan as he curled his arm inwards, seeing a visible, if tiny, swell of muscle raise up on his arm. To anyone else it would be pitiful at best... but to someone like Tyler who had never had even that, and suddenly had definition to his arm, it was amazing. Then his eyes trailed downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had always had one redeeming quality to him, His cock. He was short, he was scrawny and had no fat or muscle mass to speak of and was tiny in every visible regard, till he took his pants off. Fully erect, at his shrimpy 5 foot height, he was a bit over 8 inches in length from the base of his shaft out to the head of his circumscribed endowment. 8 inches was a fairly impressive size on a normal sized person, but with it and two large hen egg sized balls attached to his tiny frame, it made it look huge. But now, thanks to his added 6 inches of height increasing his body size proportionally... and what he could only assume was more than just muscle and height given too him, he was even bigger down there than he had been before. Where before his dick had been a bit over 8 inches in length, now it was well over 9! so thick and heavy that it took both of his paws to properly wield it, and even then some of it stuck out from his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all so much. His paws started sliding up and down that thick slab of meat, stroking faster and faster across it, the still rather small purple dragon letting out a soft groan of pleasure. He watched himself jerk off in the mirror, something that he normally never did. But seeing himself, if still scrawny, so noticeably taller, more muscular and more hung, was driving him wild. His imagination was drifting around, imagining himself as big as David was normally, towering over everyone else... then even bigger, till he loomed over even that jerk, Fang. All of them standing beneath him as he shoved his way through them, pushing Fang, David, and the rest of the football team around as easily as they did to him. Both the football players and cheerleaders flocking to him, worshiping his massive body. Licking, rubbing, squeezing and groping over every inch of his massive frame, as they poured on praise and verbal worship across him... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyes slid closed as a low groan escaped his lips, stiffled as he bit down on his lips to keep it from being too loud. His hips jerked and cock flared, as a thick glob of sticky white seed splashed across the front of the mirror, followed by a second, then a third. Over and over he began painting the front of his mirror in his spunk. And as he did he felt a tingling warmth spread through him, like it had before when he had first changed, and only further increased the stimulation of his orgasm... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nby the time it finally began to ebb, Tyler was groaning and panting for breath. Struggling to keep from gasping thanks to the intensity of his orgasm. He was so far out of it, he could barely even think straight. That had probably been the most intense orgasm he had ever felt. His lips were curled back in a rather dopey grin as, out of reflex more than anything else he started to reach down for his briefs to pull them back up over himself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he tried to pull his briefs back up his legs, immediately he could tell something was different... he could barely get them up past his knees before the elastic in the leg holes became too tight to stretch anymore. His thighs were simply too thick to pull the undergarments back up his legs. As Tyler's head lowered down to look at his underwear as if to see what the problem was, his eyes went wide as he saw what happened... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was pacing back and forth the entire time in front of his door, continually glancing over at the height chart where he saw their changed sizes, unable to stop thinking about how much smaller he had become, and how much larger Tyler had... he had been so proud, for so long, of how big he was, that the thought of being smaller than he had always been was one he couldn't even properly wrap his mind around. All he could think about was the thought, the hope, that Tyler could... or even would, fix this. Because somewhere deep in the back of David's mind... he was scared Tyler wouldn't WANT to fix this... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe had been doing his best to keep his paws off his still throbbing erection, and that needy lust the necklace had induced in him, despite his recent relief, was starting to ebb, letting his cock soften a bit and, without that extra girth holding them up, letting his underwear sag slightly. Then, the heat returned. He felt it spreading from his groin, almost instantly forcing him hard again, and then pushing out along the rest of his body. This time he was acutely aware of what was happening, and got to actually watch as the effect hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs seemed to be the first effected, seeming to thin out slightly, not jutting out as far in front of him and the crevice between them narrowing slightly and becoming shallower... his arms lost a bit of their girth, and his abs seemed to recede ever so slightly into his stomach, becoming less cut and defined.  The most unusual was the feeling in his groin, as he felt about an inch of his cock seem to 'suck' inwards as his dick lost that much of its length, and a proportional amount of girth... his nuts seeming to suck inwards slightly as well. Then came the height. He could actually watch as that new line for his height ever so slowly raised higher and higher up in his vision as inch after inch of his height was pulled out of him, having to reflexively reach down to grab the waistband of his briefs to hold them up, as he lost another half foot of his height...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't worked... he had just shrunk again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis formerly towering 7'3\u201d height had been reduced down an entire foot, down to only 6'3, while Tyler would have, at least if it held true from last time, gained that foot... he'd be almost as tall as David was now, and from how much muscle mass David seemed to have lost, Tyler might actually outweigh him slightly now... and with a hard blush spreading across his face, a breif thought floated across David's mind... Tyler had always had one redeeming quality about him... he was, especially for his size, rather well hung... and David couldn't help but think that, if Tyler got the lost couple inches of his dick along with everything else... he was probably notably bigger than David was down there as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds turned into minutes, and David stood there staring at Tyler's door, waiting for him to come out... where was he?... he wasn't... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible thought struck David, and quickly he dashed over to Tyler's door, all but shoving it open to burst inside, hoping that what he thought was happening wasn't happening... then let out a loud sigh of relief when he saw Tyler, standing in front of his full length mirror, stark naked, checking himself out. For a second there, David had been terrified Tyler was going to take even more from him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after that initial shock and relief of the 'worst case scenario' David had thought up, he found himself staring at his naked brother... the formerly lean, lanky shorty of a dragon standing there, one arm raised up to flex the now noticeable and meaty bicep he possessed, and the other gripping his massive prick which, thanks to his increased height, and the added girth he had taken from David, was now well over a foot long... he was more hung now than David had been when he was full sized!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could see the thick stream of pre drooling down Tyler's shaft, watching Tyler check himself out in the mirror, obviously enthralled with the sight of his new form... and could only guess it was taking all the self control Tyler had not to start jacking off again right there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit... it didn't work, Tyler...\u201d he murmured, grunting a bit when he heard how much higher pitched his voice had become. Though his words seemed to rather abruptly snap Tyler out of his narcissistic trance, arms lowering down to his sides and suddenly turning around to face David, seeming unashamed of his new massive build and nudity. A somewhat Timid, apologetic smile spread across Tyler's face as he looked up the last 3 inches that still separated His and his brother's height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cer... yea... I noticed. Now what?\u201d he murmured, obviously still incredibly horny, from the way that there were literal drops of pre dripping down the front of his shaft and onto the floor below, and how Tyler was constantly licking his lips to wet them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwe just..\u201d David muttered, finding himself blushing harder and having to constantly avert his gaze from his now rather beefy, and well hung brothers \u201clook... its late... the place is closed anyway... we just need to go to bed... and we'll go back to that antique store first thing in the morning and get this figured out, ok?... just... \u201che paused again, blushing harder, and seemingly totally oblivious of his own raging boner \u201ckeep that thing under control until tomorrow...  Or I might not even be big enough to drive...\u201d</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll take it back in the morning.  This muscle-head kind of body isn\u2019t for me\u2026\u201d  He chuckled and lifted his arms, flexing playfully for his brother to see, \u201cThough it\u2019s really close to GROWING on me.\u201d  The purple drake couldn\u2019t help himself as his soft snickering filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let out a soft growl and gave the smaller drake a firm shove, sending Tyler stumbling back against his bed, but not quite as far as either them expected he would, \u201cVery funny, just keep your hand off your dick and we\u2019ll be alright\u2026\u201d He said with a hint of anxiety, as if he wasn\u2019t sure that his brother would be able to control himself.  He patted his brother on the shoulder after Tyler straightened up, \u201cLook, I know this is probably kinda fun for you, but you have to remember that it\u2019s MY life you\u2019re changing, as well.  Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was almost moved by the calm, serious tone that came from his brother\u2019s lips.  He could sense the worry, the anxiety that almost seemed to plague David the longer he thought about losing more of his size.  That of course, made it even harder for Tyler to keep a straight face; the plan he had in mind was as good as executed, as far as he was concerned.  He just had to get David to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!  Sheesh\u2026Just like I said, I don\u2019t need your body to succeed at what I\u2019m doing.\u201d  He smirked and plopped down onto his bed, his half-hard cock bouncing against his briefs, \u201cGet out of here, will ya?  I\u2019m tired of our dicks staring at each other.\u201d  He snickered softly and gestured to David\u2019s half-hard shaft.  In their panic \u2013 or excitement, in Tyler\u2019s case \u2013 both drakes had forgotten their modesty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, heh, good night\u2026\u201d  David couldn\u2019t bring himself to admit it, as he turned his back on his brother and walked out of his room, but Tyler\u2019s cock was clearly larger than his, by an inch or more!  He walked briskly down the hallway and back into his room, hardly able to keep thoughts of losing more of his height off of his mind.  He pulled his briefs up and collapsed on his bed, panting softly as he stared at the ceiling.  His mind raced.  Would Tyler keep his promise?  Sure he would\u2026he could count on his little brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if there was no way to reverse that magic?  Couldn\u2019t be\u2026There just HAD to be a way to reverse it!  All they had to do was take it to the shop and ask the shopkeeper what was up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed heavily and rolled over onto his side, staring at the wall for over half an hour before his frantic mind finally calmed enough for him to fall asleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had figured that David would spend some time dwelling on his new size.  He could clearly read in his brother\u2019s face just how worried he\u2019d been, just before he left Tyler\u2019s bedroom.  The purple drake lay back on his bed and idly stroked his throbbing erection, simply enjoying the feeling of his new, big body\u2026and dreaming of more.  And he\u2019d get more, that much was sure.  All he had to do was wait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so of lightly teasing his throbbing, precum-leaking shaft with his claws, Tyler could take no more.  He panted heavily as he gripped that thick shaft with both hands, slowly and firmly stroking with increasing vigor.  David was surely asleep by now, or at least drowsy enough to not realize his change until it was too late.  With a pleasured snarl Tyler pounded away at his cock, the image of his body swelling in size and musculature firmly ingrained into his mind.  But even more arousing was the thought of his \u201cbig brother\u201d losing his size.  Oh how sweet and satisfying it would be to see his brother having to look UP at him!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s fists slammed firmly against his cock over and over, slapping wetly against his precum-slicked groin.  That first orgasm came quickly, the drake\u2019s load shooting in a high arc over him before splattering against his chest.  By the time the first spurt even landed he was already swelling, muscles plumping up and hardening all over his body, his bone structure lengthening and growing to accommodate another six inches in height.  And that was only the first.  This night would not be wasted\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s snarling and grunting filled the air as he pleasured himself through the night, his voice growing ever deeper and louder.  Each orgasm led straight into the next, and the simple though of his brother shriveling away to NOTHING kept him going\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome morning, just how big does Tyler end up being, and how small is David? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He went to sleep in nothing but a pair of now loose fitting boxer shorts, but as soon as he sat up he could tell that something was terribly wrong. Before his underwear was simply uncomfortably loose, now however he could almost get lost in them. A feeling of terror ran through Davids body as he realised what must have happened while he was asleep, he had shrunk even further, and not just a little, he was much smaller than he was last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grasped the waistband of his underwear with both hands and hops out of bed, panicking as he noticed just how much larger his room seems to be now.  David dashed over to his mirror, nearly tripping on the fabric of his huge underwear. Once there loosed his grip on the waistband out of shock of what he saw, he's absolutely tiny, barely 3ft tall at best, his once large muscles had faded away, leaving him looking almost like some sort of slim weak child. He raised a hand to touch and even pinch at his chest to make sure he wasn't still asleep and having some sort of nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll David could do was stare in disbelief for several moments until something else dawned on him, if he'd shrunk so small then Tyler must have... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god...\u201d was all he could say as he scrambled to lift up his underwear again and run out of the room, having to reach up now even reach the handle on his door. The scared dragon dashed down the hallway to his brothers room, and without even thinking he throws the door open and runs inside, stopping instantly at the sight of what was in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was laying atop his bed, stark naked, now so big that his legs hung off the far edge, he was so huge now, much bigger than David had even been at his normal height, and since David hand shrunk it only served to make Tyler look even more enormous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now big purple dragon was obviously having a good dream, a few gentle groans escaped his lips even while he slumbered, his huge raging morning wood jutted out proudly from his hips, dripping with precum, big enough to put even the most well endowed porn star to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTYLER!!!\u201d David shouted up at his brother, \u201cWHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grunted as he heard his brothers voice and started to wake up, he turned his head to the side to where he heard the higher pitched voice come from, and when he saw David standing there holding his comically huge underwear he couldn't help but grin widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's giant form sat up, the bed creaking and cracking more beneath him, he stretched his arms to the sides and stood up to his full imposing height of 9'3\u201d tall, looming mightily over his now tiny brother, \u201cWell well well, what do we have here? Is something wrong my 'little' big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?! What does it look like?! I thought I could trust you?\u201d replied David, looking high up at Tyler, having to peer over that enormous still aroused cock hanging above his head. The smaller dragon now barely knee high to bigger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk covered Tylers face and he chuckled deeply at the sight of his once larger brother now so small and weak in front of him, the scene only serving to fuel his arousal even more, he felt so powerful now, so strong, so big. \u201cWell before I went to sleep last night a thought occurred to me. All these years you've got to experience just how good it feels to be the big guy, so now it's only right that I get my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler was speaking he lifted an arm and flexed the giant bicep before bringing his hands to his thick broad chest, he runs his fingers down the thick slabs of muscle, down further over the hills and valleys of his abs, and finally down even further until one of his hands wraps around that large piece of dragon meat between his legs, giving it a squeeze, obviously showing off in front of David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler takes in a deep breath, puffing out his chest as he does so, \u201cBut you know what....?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tell me what you know about this so we can get it fixed\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed, shaking his head in disapproval. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even thought about this at all have you? I suppose that doesn\u2019t surprise me, you\u2019ve never been one to think. But I can\u2019t imagine anyone being so\u2026 apathetic as to not think about it, given how this effects you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tyler leant down on his knees, allowing him to arch his back up straight and get closer to his little blue brother. The action was controlled, but still managed to shake the room quite violently as his weight pressed down through his knees. The change in pose brought his throbbing ebony cock just inches away from his brother\u2019s head. While it was completely unintentional, the purple dragon didn\u2019t make any corrective moves, and just smiled as his brother unintentionally glanced at his erection before taking a reactive step backwards. Tyler realised then that it was literally the source of his power. There was nothing wrong with his brother beholding the tool of his own distruction. In fact, it was probably the least he deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s use some reasoning here and go over what has happened.\u201d Tyler began. \u201c I gave you the amulet, and then I started taking your height. You give, I take.  So logically..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t GIVE you anything Tyler, you fucking stole it from me!\u201d David burst out. His enormous brother just snorted with amusement in response, before shifting his gaze to his own pulsing erection. Tyler was not acting like himself at all. As furious as David was, he was still dumbstruck at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo logically\u2026\u201d The purple dragon continued in his thick baritone voice, \u201cthe amulet has set up some sort of relationship between the two of us. The only real catalyst for this could be the act of giving, or more probably wearing it. Correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged impatiently.  \u201cI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know anything about this bullshit. Get your hand off your dick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler ignored him, instead tilting his head slightly as he stared distantly at his erection. He gently handled it\u2019s veiny surface as if it were an ancient fragile artefact.  \u201cWell, I did put it on when I was looking at it in the store. To try it out, make sure it wasn\u2019t too heavy and such. That could have been how it was\u2026 activated to me? Then you put it on after I gave it to you, activating it to you and connecting us. That seems to be the only catalyst. At least as far as I can tell, this whole thing seems a bit\u2026 extra-normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what?!\u201d David yelled impatiently. What does that matter; it doesn\u2019t help us solve it. I don\u2019t care how it works, we just need to reverse it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed in exasperation, but he didn\u2019t take his eyes off his cock. He used his free hand to cup one of his enormous churning testicles, which behind the dark tight scrotum, must have been the size of a grapefruit. \u201cI have given you all the dots and numbered them, but you still can\u2019t draw the picture for yourself. David, please try to think. For once, its actually important for you to do so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t patronise me, and for fucks sake, don\u2019t fondle yourself in front of me. You KNOW what you fucking around will do to me. Stop it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler did not. \u201cYou still aren\u2019t thinking. What would happen if you were to repeat my steps\u2026 if you were to pass it on, and give it to someone else, then\u2026\u201d Tyler shifted his gaze to David and raised an eye ridge expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid met his brother\u2019s eyes for a moment before he was distracted as falling glob of pre dripped from his brother\u2019s cock just a foot or so away from him. David looked directly at his brother\u2019s glans, which was now leaking seminal fluid in the same way a hungry dog would salivate. He swallowed hard, unable to avoid thinking about how that hungry penis was salivating for him and his height, and how his imposing brother seemed only too eager to feed him to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d David began as he shook his head to get the image out,\u201c\u2026I might be able to take their height too.\u201d David realised as he was saying it. \u201cIt could be like a chain, where everyone steals height off the next person\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, yeah. Now you are getting it.\u201d Tyler said as he went from gently handling his dick to firmly squeezing it. It was so think his enlarged thumb wasn\u2019t able to meet any of his fingers on the other side. In response his penis seemed to spasm as the purple dragon kegeled, spurting out some more pre in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I gave it back to you, remember? That didn\u2019t do a damned thing! It didn\u2019t work!\u201d David suddenly realised.<br>\r\nTyler shrugged. \u201cIf it is a chain, then I\u2019m already a part of it. Perhaps it can\u2019t close in on loop like that. Honestly David, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really care either. This is entirely your problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it could also be solved by you just keeping your hands off your dick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chuckled, closing his eyes as he gently used his thumb to rub his pre across his flaring glans. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen David. I\u2019m a very sexual beast now. My cock is always hard, always ready and wanting. It can\u2019t be sated. It doesn\u2019t matter if I cum and cum and cum all day, I have no cool down. You don\u2019t know how hard it was for me to take my hands off myself last night so we could have this little talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the purple dragon got up to sit back on his bed, lying his enormous frame down on the mattress while keeping his splayed feet planted on the ground over the edge of the bed that was too short to house him. From David\u2019s low perspective, he couldn\u2019t see much past the globs of pre that trailed down Tyler\u2019s rock hard ebony cock, which towered above his full churning testicles, themselves parted by the long purple tail that spilled over the bed across most of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler\u2026\u201d David began, almost pleading as he watched two hands appear around Tyler\u2019s throbbing erection, one firmly griping the base while the other massaged the head with it\u2019s palm, smearing the resulting faucet of pre liberally across its dark surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve shown you a lot of mercy really.\u201d Tyler said through heavy breaths as he gently handled himself.  \u201cIt would be selfish of you to expect me to deny myself, just on your belhalf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gasped in shock\u2026 just on his behalf? Just on his behalf?! He worked his mouth in silence as he struggled to articulate his anger, to contain his growing panic. \u201cYou\u2026 you can\u2019t do this Tyler! Look at what you\u2019re doing to me! What\u2019s wrong with you?! \u201c The tiny blue dragon eventually managed to shout. Despite his effort, the terror in his high and weak voice was unavoidable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTylers only response was to start slowly pumping his glistening manhood with both hands, the continuous flow of pre flinging out wildly as his musky scent permeated the room. David stood skocked as he watched Tyler\u2019s thrusts quickly accelerated, as the bed mounting some serious protests in return with each thud of the dragon\u2019s hands. Though David couldn\u2019t see the rest of Tyler, he could hear his brother\u2019s deep breaths turn into soft moans as the purple dragon started thrusting his pelvis in opposition to his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTlyer! Stop!\u201d David shouted, kicking his brother at the top of his elevated saurian ankle, which was almost at hip level. Although David had lashed out wit all his fury, the only response from the gigantic purple foot was a small flinch, the thick toes and pads remaining firmly anchored on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cah\u2026 hyou\u2019d better\u2026 get moving David.\u201d Tyler rumbled from beyond the thick squelching cock that towered above, violently jerking as it took the punishment the blurring purple fingers pumping its length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I.. ungh\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t want to stick around for the rest of the show if I were you. We both know how it ends\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid realised that he had to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTake it, come on. Get out of here and get some muscle on you, so I can take it for myself!\u201d snarled Tyler, slinging the amulet at the tiny blue dragon beneath him with a free hand, before sending it back to stroke the looming ebony member. David snatched the amulet out of the air with scrabbling claws, almost letting his oversized boxers fall to the ground before he caught them.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you check in my bottom drawer.\u201d said the purple giant breathlessly as he slowly pumped his solid mass of cock, slick pre aiding him in his effort. \u201cMight still have some kid clothes in there.\u201d As his behemoth brother softly moaned his pleasure, David ripped through the drawers to find something, anything that would fit his feeble form. A worried turn of the head now and then showed Tyler becoming progressively more aroused the further he got into his self-pleasure, moans turning to growls and sensitive stroking becoming violent pumping along the meaty member. After what seemed far too long for David, he found an old set of clothes \u2013 a t-shirt that hung off him like a blanket with his 3\u2019 physique and a pair of shorts that he securely belted around his waist. Scampering off before Tyler could do anything to stop him, he slipped out the door, stubby arms barely able to reach the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he needed a plan, that much was for sure. If he just wandered aimlessly, he\u2019d shrivel into nothingness before Tyler \u2013 that monster he once called brother \u2013 even started thinking about breakfast. He\u2019d have to be clever about it, so as his paws pattered along the concrete, he thought. Some good candidates for passing on the curse sprang to mind \u2013 everybody in his football team was pretty big, which would give him plenty of height to work with \u2013 hell, it might even placate his oversized sibling enough to let him return to his original lofty bearing. It was a strange thought \u2013 Tyler would probably loom over him for the rest of his life now. Unless... plans coalesced in the dragon\u2019s mind as he scurried to the university in search of big guys. Maybe he\u2019d be able to overtake Tyler yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid burst through the glass doors of the college sports bar, huffing and panting as curious eyes regarded him as an oddity. He stomped along, out of breath, in the hopes that at least one of the guys would be here, but as he did...<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, young man, but you don\u2019t look like one of our students.\u201d A bartender was looming over him, a sleek black jackal who looked all professional in his staff uniform. He was about average height for a canid, but to David\u2019s reduced proportions, this only served to make him ominously tall as he stared down a black-furred snout.<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you, buddy, I have my ID. This is... discrimination against midgets!\u201d he snapped, digging in the pockets of Tyler\u2019s baggy sweatpants for his wallet, and with tiny hands produced an ID card that still resembled him... somewhat.<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re David Matthews? That can\u2019t be, I\u2019ve seen him play and he\u2019s huge... no offense, sir.\u201d said the Jackal, suppressing a snort of laughter.<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK YOU, IT\u2019S NOT FUNNY!\u201d snarled the dragon, snatching his ID card and storming off further into the bar as he heard the jackal snicker behind him, looking a strange mixture of bewildered and amused. Over the sounds of conversation and activity he heard a voice very familiar to him \u2013 one he knew well from practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...David?\u201d called Fang, peering from over two attractive looking female students who were eagerly ogling his substantial frame. At 7\u2019 10\u2019\u2019 of pure muscle, the big black wolf was a perfect candidate for David\u2019s plans. Better still, he was... predictable. Like a dog and a bone, David knew if he offered him the chance to \u201cget bigger\u201d, he\u2019d probably leap at it. He\u2019d have to choose his words carefully, though...<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d said the little blue dragon with an exaggerated sigh. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d recognise me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe fuck happened? You\u2019re tiny?\u201d Fang smirked, clearly amused by the whole situation. His next biggest rival standing before him at the much reduced height of three feet \u2013 how could that fail to put a smile on his face?<br>\r\n\u201cTwo words \u2013 magic amulet.\u201d David said, producing the aforementioned artefact and letting it dangle from its chain for the wolf to see. \u201cTyler fucking tricked me, he... he\u2019s fucking huge now.\u201d That did the trick. The wolf\u2019s ears pricked back with unmistakable interest, a malicious glint in his eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cYa don\u2019t say?\u201d Fang said with a growl, casting a glance at his admirers. \u201cCome on, ladies, get outta here, me and David gotta have a private chat. C\u2019mon! Scoot!\u201d The girls were clearly annoyed at being turfed out by the diminuitive drake\u2019s presence, but they weren\u2019t about to argue with Fang and the arms that were almost as thick around as they were. David plopped himself down on a seat as Fang finished shooing off the ladies, resting his large bulk back down on his leather seat.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, little guy.\u201d smirked Fang, steely eyes nearly penetrating into David\u2019s skull and sending ominous tingles down his spine.\u201dYou wanna tell me about this... magic bullshit? Seems to have worked, whatever it is.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-yeah, sure.\u201d stammered David, all too aware of the sheer mass the wolf had. He didn\u2019t quite appreciate it so much when he was only half-a-foot or so shorter, but now... only Tyler put him to shame. The wolf was simply <i>big</i>. Each group of muscles were solidly defined works of art \u2013 Fang spent a lot of time sculpting his body, and it showed. Each little movement he made was reflected in the flexing and tensing of huge slabs of meat, and the sheer size of the wolf was proving intimidating.<br>\r\n\u201cWe-well.\u201d stuttered the dragon. \u201cTyler brought me this amulet home from the antiques store, and I put it on. I thought nothing of it and went on with my routine, you know, work out a little, watch some TV. When I woke up in the morning, I was this size, and I found Tyler lying asleep on his bed, nine foot tall and... er... hung out to here.\u201d Stretching his arms out wide, the dragon watched as a smirk played across the wolf\u2019s broad muzzle. \u201cI stole the amulet and confronted him, he said that the last one to wear the amulet grows whenever they... well, jerk off, and it steals the size of whoever wore it before them, like a chain. I was first, so when Tyler put it on, he stole it from me. And now that I\u2019ve stolen it from him...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cso what, now you\u2019re gonna take it all back again?\u201d the black wolf asked with an eyebrow raised sceptically, his gaze shifting between David and the intricate necklace. \u201cSo you just have to put that thing on, and what\u2026 jerk yourself off, and you get bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what he said. So if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you come to campus to do that?\u201d Fang cut him off curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the blue dragon off guard. David knew that while Fang was not academically minded, he wasn\u2019t a complete moron. And he had clearley underestimated the cocky wolf.  While Fang was clearly engaged with the concept, he was still considering it with scepticism.  \u201cWhat?\u201d David asked dumbly after an awkward pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf leered at him. \u201cWhy did you come in here in this condition to rub a few out, when you could have just stayed at home? I know you David, you\u2019re too proud to be seen in public like that, and even if you weren\u2019t you wouldn\u2019t come to come to a public place to jerk off. You\u2019re not <i>that</i> big of an exhibitionist. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo David quickly thought on his feet. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m here  because,  so that Tyler couldn\u2019t get me. I mean, he can\u2019t find me. He thinks I\u2019m in my room. If I take back too much he\u2019d try and stop me. Now he can\u2019t. Dude, I told you. Tyler\u2019s like 9 feet tall now. What hope would I have if he wanted to take it back? He\u2019s so big he could even kick your ass now. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it. Fang\u2019s uncertainty vanished in an instant, eying David with malicious intent, teeth barred and muzzle wrinkled in fury. The wolf\u2019s his ears folded backwards as if preparing to attack. \u201cOh really now?\u201d he growled slowly and deeply, sending shivers up David\u2019s spine. \u201cWell, we can\u2019t have that now, can we?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though David was goading the black wolf to take the amulet form him, he was still startled by the speed of fang\u2019s large paw as he struck out, stripping the amulet from him, the force knocking his tiny body  almost to the point of losing balance. \u201cwha! Fang, no, I need that man!\u201d David started as he regained his orientation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang eyed the amulet as he held it up in front of his face, a greedy smirk slowly forming down his long muzzle. \u201cCalm down man, you know me. I\u2019ll give it back bro.\u201d  he chuckled distantly.  He held the amulet to his eye level, a distance easily higher than David could jump, even with the enormous wolf sitting. \u201cI\u2019ll give it back, Just as soon as we sort out this Tyler issue. \u201c He showed David a frighteningly viscious grin. \u201cI promise\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the black wolf put the amulet on around his neck. It wasn\u2019t a fluid motion, as the wolfs massive head didn\u2019t leave that much slack along the chain, but it was swift enough. David didn\u2019t act angry or upset like he tried to do, but he did manage to suppress his elation and relief that Fang had finally taken the bait. His heart was racing with both relief and anticipation \u2013 now he could see if it worked. He really, really needed it to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it fang, just be quick about it will you? It\u2019s embarrassing for me to be this small, I need to get back.\u201d David pretended to plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis had better work man\u201d Fang growled as he sat up. The huge wolf rose\u2026 and rose above David. The blue dragon gasped \u2013 he had still been underestimating the sheer size of the wolf. He caught sight of the canine\u2019s package that must have been a full foot above his eye line, the tell-tale bulge of an early erection already showing through his shorts. David felt a warm feeling inside him as he beheld the wolf. What the hell?  He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I find out this is some kind of trick\u2026 well I won\u2019t be happy\u201d Fang rumbled as he turned away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm feeling inside David intensified, and he suddenly recognised it with grim familiarity as it spread out from his groin. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting here then Fang!\u201d he quickly shouted out at the wolf\u2019s broad back. Fang only grunted in acknowledgement as he walked out, the blue dragon probably fading from his mind with each passing step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was panicking as he felt his already lose clothes slowly slide against his thinking scales as he started to wither again. He looked around in a panic, but thankfully there was no one around to witness him. He could only whimper as he saw the surrounding furniture loom higher and higher around him, the experience seeming more acute to him at his current height than it did the night before. He could feel his bones creak as his chest seemed to close in on itself, his muscles withering away on his shrinking frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the clothes on him get heavier as they continued to scrunch up against him, his hands creeping into his sleeves as his belt was finally granted enough slack to fall to the floor around his ankles, his underwear following shortly afterwards.  By the time his body had stabilised at its new size, he was whimpering in fear. For the first time in his adult or adolescent life, he was crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he had \u2018only\u2019 lost another six inches, but everything around him loomed that much higher than it did before. The chairs seemed to have nearly twice as much volume as before, and the pot plants loomed above him like small trees. This was all wrong. After a moment, he pulled his pants back up. His belt didn\u2019t have the buckles to fit on him anymore, so he had to grasp the excess elastic in a fist to keep it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around wide-eyed as he considered what to do next. If it worked and Fang found out, then he would immediately be baying for his blood. The thought of that wolf coming after him made nightmares look serine. He had to consider the possibility that Fang could black out with rage and kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, if David was going to take height from Fang, then he had to make sure that the wolf knew enough to be able to pass the curse on so he would be able to keep feeding him. Tyler would be 9 and a half feet tall now. Even if he had all of Fang\u2019s height right now, he would still only be a match for Tyler.  And each time his brother came, he added a foot difference against him. Plus, he really didn\u2019t want to postpone recovering his size after that frightening experience.<br>\r\nAfter considering his options, David decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lacking a better mode of transport, he grabbed his sweats, hauling them up with shaking claws, and retreated to safer ground. There was one person he knew who would be able to protect him from the inevitable while he had time to grow, and that person was one with a vested interest in seeing Fang lose some of his much vaunted height. Yes, he would go back to Tyler \u2013 all nine and a half foot of the purple giant would surely be able to keep him safe from Fang, especially if he were to shrink a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his shorter legs, it didn\u2019t take long to scamper back home. One of the benefits of living near the university, and one which he was now grateful for. David had to jump to reach the door handle, spitting curses as he did. He wasn\u2019t quite able to reach the handle, until he felt that particular warmth spreading through him again... \u201cGODDAMMIT TYLER!\u201d snarled the dragon, fighting his way through the sensation to reach Tyler\u2019s window. \u201cDon\u2019t you even think about... about...\u201d Wait, this was different. This felt... good. Instead of withering and shrivelling away, his puny frame began to swell, bone lengthening to accommodate new musculature. David found that the sweatpants he was wearing were beginning to sit on his hips once more, though they had the additional problem of this stiffening cock to deal with. Fang must have activated the curse... fuck, did Tyler feel this good every time he jacked off? He was beginning to realise how the normally timid Tyler could have gone so... well, crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid forced himself through the warm, mind-numbing magical haze, sneaking a peek through Tyler\u2019s open window. It seemed his beast of a brother was a little tuckered out as he lay back, gently fingering and rubbing his colossal cock \u2013 he obviously hadn\u2019t gotten used to his new... er, endowments yet. So much the better. Leaving the huge lump of muscle to recline on his audibly straining bed, David scrambled in through his own window, hauling himself in with Fang\u2019s stolen strength. He may have only been three foot, but he sure felt vigorous. The thought occurred to him \u2013 he should really leave that thing closed, who knows who could sneak in and pilfer from him? For years he had lived with being his very own home security system, and now at 3\u2019 tall he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to fend off a prowler. Well, it was time to change that! David didn\u2019t even give his computer time to boot up before his sweatpants were down and his nimble hands were busy servicing his... whoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t his. David smiled widely as he took a glance at the pillar of black meat before him. This... this was definitely Fang\u2019s. Thicker and longer than what he had come to expect after Tyler\u2019s interference, he eagerly dived into caressing the cock with his spindly hands. He made full use of his new, generous proportions as he viciously manhandled his member, tongue lolling over a wicked toothy grin. He could think of nothing more than stealing every inch of Fang\u2019s sheer mass, all of the sculpted muscle he had worked so hard to obtain flooding him with power... that was, if Tyler didn\u2019t steal it first. As his screen showed him his desktop, he went straight for his stash of dirty images... Orgasm after orgasm passed, occasionally interrupted as Tyler sprang into action to steal some of his newfound height. David, lost in the throes of passion, still had enough presence of mind to suspect that his brother was pacing himself to stop him dwindling away to nothing \u2013 which meant, of course, he hadn\u2019t found out about the trade. David smiled a predatory grin as he just kept pumping away at himself, lost in the world of the macro art that he loved so much. Yeah, he was gonna get as big as these guys. Bigger than Tyler. He\u2019d show that scrawny little shi-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBang. Bang. Bang. Someone was hammering on the front door. David decided to ignore it in favour of one last spurt, breathing heavily as the warm glow of the curse took him and he grew yet even more, noticing the tell-tale signs of musculature beginning to form once more. Bathed in the beatific bliss of afterglow, he managed to drag his naked form to peer around the doorway when he heard Tyler\u2019s booming footsteps rumble down the hallway, catching a glimpse of his bobbing, impossibly long cock and sculpted butt as his tail whipped happily behind him. As all ten and a half foot of Tyler began to slowly open the door, the two brothers were shocked to see Fang standing out front. Normally, 7\u201910 of sheer statuesque muscle was enough to shock, but at his new height, the pair couldn\u2019t help but be...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Were it not for the erections, it felt like a scene that belonged in one of those classic cartoons. Tyler, the purple dragon, was so ridiculously huge when he approached the door that his head scraped hard against the ceiling, even though he was stooping on such an angle that he had to stick his tail out for counterbalance. He opened the door with more force than he probably intended, and even though it stayed firmly on its hinges and in one piece, the hardwood crackled from the punishment. Then, in an unavoidably exaggerated fashion, the purple dragon knelt and leant out of the relatively modest opening to find no one there. He stood in confusion for a moment, before finally looking down on the midget of a wolf that was looking up at him. <br>\r\nTyler paused a moment as the scene registered in his mind, before spontaneously bursting out with laughter so sharp and intense it sent large globules of saliva flying from his oversized maw. David flinched at his brother\u2019s outburst \u2013 he was not expecting the sheer volume and depth of Tyler\u2019s voice. And even had David been completely deaf, he would have felt it through both the floor he was standing on and the doorframe he was hiding behind. It felt like a subwoofer and sounded like a lion.<br>\r\nTyler was so massive, so powerful. The dragon\u2019s hulking mass was animating vigorously with every laugh. Every muscle and vein in his hulking and ripped frame was twitching and sliding under his skin of light purple scales, which hugged his form so tightly it looked as if it was in danger of tearing. <br>\r\nThis was the scene that loomed above the shrivelled black wolf as he reflexively turned away from the spit that Tyler showered on him. But Fang stood steadfast, draining the fluid from his face with a single purposeful wipe of his paw. He returned his gaze back to Tyler.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Greg\u2026 look at you!\u201d Tyler finally managed calm down enough to cry.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, this just keeps getting better.\u201d<br>\r\nThe wolf stood stoically for a moment. \u201cFang.\u201d The demand was so furiously blunt it almost made up for the high and feeble voice it was said in.<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s face hung with genuine amusement a moment longer before his smug sinister grin returned. Slowly he knelt on one knee and leant towards the tiny black wolf. \u201cGreg\u201d. He snickered.<br>\r\nFang hadn\u2019t budged from his position. His face was locked in a focused rage, his demeanour so uncompromised by the world around him that he looked as if he stood taller than his full height. \u201cWhere is David?\u201d he asked with such calm that the blue dragon was almost tempted to hide back in his room.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s David?\u201d Tyler repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know where David is, Greg.\u201d His smile broadened as he leaned in closer. \u201cBut I think I can tell where he\u2019s been\u201d.<br>\r\nThe purple dragon\u2019s body was too big. His demeanour was too arrogant. His pose was too close. He didn\u2019t even have the time to flinch as the tiny black wolf spontaneously burst towards him, his small frame was in the air in an instant, and with one frighteningly swift motion he lashed out with his right paw against Tyler\u2019s right eye. The purple dragon closed it just as the wolf made contact, gashing several inches across his face. <br>\r\n\tTyler roared as he fell on his rock hard ass, the sudden collision shaking the house so badly that several items came crashing to the floor. \u201cMY EYE!\u201d The dragon bellowed in shocked agony. Fang had landed and eyed the purple monstrosity as it recoiled and flailed. Tyler was blinded in that moment, and the black wolf had the luxury of choosing his moment undisturbed. That moment came as Tyler threw his head back, grasping at his wounded eye with both of his claws.<br>\r\nIt had only lasted a few moments, but for David the scene seemed to play in slow motion. Acting on instinct, David was charging down the hallway towards them before he registered a single thought. <br>\r\nThe wolf jumped almost vertically at Tyler\u2019s exposed throat, sinking his teeth into the soft flesh with deadly accuracy. Tyler opened his mouth in surprise but could only gargle a sickly whine in response. The tiny black wolf used the purchase in his muzzle to pivot his upside down body, his hands clasped the sides of the Dragons jaw while his feet fraught fiercely and found purchase against Tyler\u2019s massive meaty chest. He was poised to rip the purple throat out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David charged in, swiping out with his 6 and a half foot frame, knocking limbs from his brother. The impact wasn\u2019t enough for the wolf to lose his bite, however, and he pivoted back from the contact, leaving the wolf hanging.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat is, until Tyler carefully wrapped his thick claws around the wolf\u2019s torso. Fang frantically fought off the advancing fingers by lashing out with his hands and feet, but the sum of his efforts simply helped guide the drakes grip. The purple dragon chuckled as his massive fingers enveloped the wolf with both hands and began to squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s angry snarls were quickly cut off as Tyler\u2019s grip intensified. He didn\u2019t try to pull the wolf off him, he simply waited for Fang to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you chose to do?\u201d he asked as he continued to chuckle, his voice only slightly interfered by Fang\u2019s bite.  \u201cYou summed up the situation, and decided that it would be a good idea to poke me in the eye and kiss my neck?\u201d He asked in mocking incredulity. \u201cGreg, seriously, I don\u2019t think you really get this at all my friend.\u201d Fang held on a moment longer before Tyler felt his grip lessen enough for him to painlessly pull him from his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler held the wolf out in front of him, his vice like grip unwavering. Fang was writing furiously, his libs grasping and thrashing at the impervious fingers that imprisoned him. Tyler languished in the sound desperate gasping and choking as the wolf struggled to breathe. \u201cCan you feel that Fang?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cNot the squeezing. I can see you can feel that alright. I mean, can you feel the helplessness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, that\u2019s enough! You\u2019ve made your point.\u201d David commanded. But his purple brother didn\u2019t even seem to register his existence as he continued to study the wolf that writhed in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you feel the futility of your own struggle? The realisation that you are utterly at the whim of someone else? That nothing is within your power to stop them doing whatever the fuck they want to you, for whatever reason they chose?\u201d The wolf was growing more desperate in the giant\u2019s humongous claws, throwing his head wildly as he snapped at the thick purple fingers in vain, unable to find a workable angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d Tyler continued. \u201cJust because they are bigger than you? Their form has more physical matter. How arbitrary is that? It isn\u2019t fair is it? It\u2019s not a good system, if you ask me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGod damn it Tyler!\u201d David bellowed at his brother. \u201cLet him go you asshole!\u201d  he demanded, punching him square in shoulder. The blue dragon recoiled at the impact \u2013 his muscles were so hard and dense, it didn\u2019t feel too dissimilar to pinching a stone through leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler remained impervious to his brother, maintaining his intent focus entirely on the wolf.  \u201cAt first, it makes you angry. It hardens your resolve. It makes you want to fight back, doesn\u2019t it? And so you do. With all your fury and desperation, you fight back. But sooner or later, it clicks. What is the point of fighting when you can\u2019t change anything? They are bigger, you are smaller. That\u2019s the end of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s throws were beginning to weaken. Tyler shouted at his brother to let go. He climbed onto his brothers thick arm and pounded for him to stop, to even just get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the purple dragon remained unmoved. \u201cAnd so eventually do what you have to do. You simply accept it. Give in to the helplessness. It\u2019s the only way you can go on. You realise that it\u2019s just your place in the world. Your place to be helpless.\u201d Tyler smiled distantly. Fang was shaking as he fought for air. His throws had slowed down, his twitching struggles were little more than token. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, please let him go\u201d.  David pleaded as he stared at the black wolf helplessly. He realised in despair that he couldn\u2019t stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tyler leaned in closer to Fang as he sneered viciously. \u201cYou know what Greg? I\u2019m not actually squeezing you that hard. Hell, I\u2019ve recently been squeezing myself harder than this. This is nothing. What do you think man? Do you think I should really go for it?\u201d Tyler raised his voice as an unbridled anger rose through him. \u201cDo you want to know what it\u2019s like to be completely, utterly, pathetically fucking helpless..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tyler abruptly released his grip, letting the wolf fall to the floor. Fang collapsed in a heap as he gasped desperately for air, his entire body trembling from the abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit Tyler\u201d David cried as he rubbed a hand up his forehead in disbelief. \u201cYou fucking asshole. I thought you were gonna kill him\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake scoffed contemptuously. \u201cOf course you did. That was half the point. I\u2019m not an idiot David. Why would I kill him? He\u2019s a part of this now, isn\u2019t he? Look at all the size he has left to take, and think about all the extra size he will farm for me. Do you think I\u2019m done here David? He\u2019s clearly worth more to me alive than dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler wiped all expression from his face as he dropped his voice to a low, sinister rumble. \u201cBut I could have if I wanted to, couldn\u2019t have I? And he couldn\u2019t stop me. And you couldn\u2019t stop me. So that was my lesson.  I just needed to point out what I can do, and what you cannot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake was speechless. \u201cTyler\u2026 listen to yourself. You\u2019re insane, can\u2019t you hear that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just doing what you\u2019ve always done. Using my size to get what I want. To get my own way.\u201d <br>\r\nDavid furrowed his face in repudiation.  \u201cWhat?! I never\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid!\u201d Fang spat from behind him. The blue dragon spun around at the sound of the wolf\u2019s squeaky voice. \u201cTell me what the fuck is going on here.\u201d He growled in between breaths. \u201cWhat have you done to me.\u201d It was not a question.<br>\r\n\u201cNot me man!\u201d David began defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s all Tyler\u2019s fault, he\u2019s stealing our height, I\u2019m still shorter too, but just look at him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTYLER\u2026\u201d The wolf spat the name \u201c\u2026Is NOT the one who lied to me about this fucking necklace. TYLER is NOT the one I warned HAD BETTER NOT BE TRICKING ME!\u201d He shouted, his rage reading through his feeble voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid did feel responsible for putting him here, but he was nonetheless taking exception to the wolf\u2019s attitude. He narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhoa man, just calm down alright? You\u2019re not in the position to be making threats here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler leaned forwards as he watched the exchange, smiling eagerly as he clasped his hands together in delight.<br>\r\nFang arched his spine, pushing his shoulders back as he made the most of his 34 inches. \u201cTell me now David or I swear one of us won\u2019t last much longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid paused as he considered how he should handle the threat. </span></div></div>",

Well, it kind of does, I guess, but I lied about the specifics. If you pass the amulet on, then you will take their height whenever you\u2026 well, jack off.

So you will get your height back man, you\u2019ve just gotta find someone else to take it from first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not jacking off again. I\u2019ve already done that once and it shrunk me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah man, I know, the same thing happened to me. That was when we first noticed something was up. But trust me, that\u2019s only because you\u2019re at the end of the chain. Once you have someone to take it from, it will work. That\u2019s how I grew back. You saw how small I was this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust you?!\u201d The wolf snarled. \u201cYou lied to me before and, you\u2019re lying to me again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang, I swear, I\u2019m not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d Tyler\u2019s booming voice interjected. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he told you before, but that\u2019s how it works. I figured it out this morning. I\u2019m as smart as I am sexy, and I\u2019m pretty fucking sexy right now.\u201d Tyler started to flex his muscles to make a point, but its effect was somewhat lost due to him being unused to making such actions.<br>\r\nFang shifted his gaze between the two drakes as he considered the situation. \u201cSo how\u2026 ok, when does the chain end? \u201c he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u201d Tyler grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything for sure yet, this just started last night\u201d David corrected, though he knew he was trying to convince himself as much as Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf eyed Tyler sceptically. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t end? You just keep sucking up the size? You just keep growing, syphoning off the rest of us while we scramble around, trying to keep up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d Tyler said happily as he clapped his hands. Both actions could easily be felt though vibrations.<br>\r\nFang snarled. \u201cWell then, Fuck that!  I will NOT be you\u2019re little patsy. I\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed. \u201cFang, you won\u2019t be doing it to service me. What do you think David is going to do when he withers away as I just keep cumming? Take one for the team? Nobly sacrifice himself so no one else has to feel the burden? Or will he panic and do whatever necessary, like he did this morning when he greedily took all he could off you? You won\u2019t be doing anything as a favour to me. You\u2019ll be doing it for your own survival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grabbed the base of his half-mast cock with one hand. The action caused it to respond immediately, veins flaring as the shaft visibly swelled bigger and longer with each beat of his powerful heart. \u201cYou\u2019d better get into the game here Fang\u2026\u201d He suddenly flashed a cheesy grin. \u201cBecause I will be cumming for my found of flesh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward pause followed as Tyler\u2019s erection continued to grow. He casually fondled hardening cock. \u201cDo neither of you get that? Cumming for my pound of flesh? I thought it was pretty clever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood, his jaw working in silence as he searched for the words.  \u201cIsn\u2019t the saying you demand your pound of flesh? Not coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rose an eye ridge. \u201cSince when were you an authority on literature? Besides, I adapted it to the situation\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but that kind of ruined the original reference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cpuns are clever wordplays, they aren\u2019t recitals by rote\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cpuns aren\u2019t clever or funny!\u201d\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP!!\u201d the wolf tried to bellow, but his voice just came out as a high pitched piercing shout, causing the brothers to recoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, kiss my foot you little shit!\u201d Tyler snickered as he lifted a leg up and out, kickingtowards the wolf and catching him before he could get out of the way. His massive saurian foot pushed Fang across the room and into the far wall, where it stayed, wedging the wolf in place. Fang was caught under a purple foot that, together with its outstretched, was taller than he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf struggled against his new prison, causing Tyler to respond by applying more force. \u201cCome now Greg, remember what I said about embracing the helplessness?\u201d He fondles turned into strokes as he worked his pounding cock, sneering at the wolf between his toes. \u201cFocus on doing things you can control, like finding me enough size to sustain yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rose his hands as he tried to placate his enlarged brother. \u201cTyler, let him go. We\u2019ll go and pass the curse on, just calm down, alright buddy? Let Fang go, and hold off from your dick for now, and we\u2019ll be on our way. Deal?\u201d David was not used to playing the diplomat, but at this point he was just desperate to but time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201c Tyler pretended to consider. \u201cYes to your first request, no to your second. Here I was going easy on you bro. Holding back most of the morning to give you time. But you\u2019ve done better than I thought you would. How tall are you now? It\u2019s hard for me to judge, everything just keeps looking smaller to me. But you\u2019d have to be back to your old height right?\u201d His cock was responding favourably to its attention, pre liberally leaking in a continuous flow, causing loud wet squelches as the purple drake worked his shaft slowly but with force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head emphatically. \u201cNo, nowhere near it. I\u2019m not ready for you to go again\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave an insincere look of surprise. \u201cWell, there you go. I disagree with your analysis, though.\u201d The drake gave one final look at wolf still struggling beneath his toes, before he let him go, moaning as he lifted his head back and closed his eyes, stroking his cock with increasing purpose. Pre was spilling, not leaking from his glans as it flowed down his glistening cock, the building excess ether spilling onto the floor or being flung elsewhere by his claws as the glided over his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, look at all this excess I\u2019ve built up holding back for you\u201d Tyler mumbled between breaths. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t waste too much more time guys; I won\u2019t be as thoughtful now that I know you can handle the challenge\u201d. With that, the purple dragon wiggled to change his position, arching his knees so he could fit himself in a lying position. Once he had settled, his hands kicked up several gears as he began in earnest. \u201coh\u2026 yeah\u201d he sighed to himself. He moaned softly as his slick black cock became little more than a blur as the drake stroked even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was so engrossed in the horrifying display that he was startled to realise that Fang had already left the scene. He turned one parting glance back at his brother as his desperation caused him to considered pleading with his brother to stop. But he knew it was futile. The way his brother was moaning, the way his hulking mass twitched in spasm and his balls heaved as they churned. How his furrowed brow pleaded and his hands pistoned his angry and leaking cock. He was helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid ran outside and caught the small wolf about forty yards down the street, having abandoned his cumbersome clothes as his naked body walked with purpose. While his stride was short, his small feet moved swiftly, propelling him forward with surprising swiftness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang, wait up man!\u201d David cried out as he ran to catch up. The wolf ignored him, leaving David to make the distance on his own. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked when he had caught up. Fang\u2019s muzzle formed into a vicious scowl as he growled\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fang, what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d David found it a little difficult to keep up to the wolf \u2013 despite his longer legs, Fang was determined and downright simmering with rage.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going back to that fucking store your dumbass brother got your bullshit magical amulet from, and I\u2019m going to tear the owner\u2019s fucking head off if he doesn\u2019t tell us how to fix this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think t-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then you best hope that I stay this size, because if everything goes back to normal, I\u2019ll make damn sure I remember exactly what the two of you did to me. How big was Tyler before, 5 foot? Nothing on 7\u2019 10\u2019\u2019. I\u2019ll fucking kill him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFang, stop it. It\u2019s just that amulet, it\u2019s made him crazy. It\u2019s probably part of the curse, I know I felt-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf stopped dead in his tracks, his piercing stare burning a hole right through the back of David\u2019s skull. Despite the significant size difference between the two, the blue dragon couldn\u2019t help but feel intimidated by the sheer rage contorting the wolf\u2019s features.<br>\r\n\u201cWHEN YOU STOLE MY BODY? IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY?\u201d The wolf snarled and growled, baring his teeth as he sprayed the larger dragon with spittle in his fury. \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re enjoying it, you son of a bitch, because either way you won\u2019t be enjoying it for long. Either we get this fixed, or your fuckhead brother will take it all for himself.\u201d Fang was almost steaming at the idea of Tyler getting even bigger, the thought of his intensely powerful body, of the mass of muscle that by rights was his... grrr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed as the wolf turned back down the road with an angry swish of his tail, stomping down the sidewalk as hard as a short, frustrated canid could, but as David started to follow him, he was brought to his knees with a gasp as that particular sensation of warmth started tingling through him again. <br>\r\n\u201cShit, no... Fang, wait up!\u201d The wolf shot a brief glance back at the dragon, a satisfied grimace spreading across his muzzle. <br>\r\n\u201cServes you right, dickhead. Glad to see you know how it fucking well feels.\u201d David struggled through the shrinking as his lightly defined musculature began to fade quickly back into flatness, his blue scaleless skin losing a little of its lustre. He concentrated on nothing but putting one foot in front of the other, fighting through the feeling despite the warmth spreading through him and the growing (yet shrinking) erection that came with it. Fang\u2019s grin wavered as he saw David\u2019s hand almost reflexively reach for his cock... <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, asshole.\u201d snarled the wolf, bounding up to him and jabbing his stomach with an accusatory claw. \u201cWe got a job to do, and we\u2019re not achieving it by sitting around here playing with ourselves, you got that?\u201d David looked down on the wolf, defiant despite his diminutive stature, no doubt due to the sheer adrenaline and rage coursing through his system. One thing came to mind as he and Fang stared a glance...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A hot flash of rage shot up David. Tyler may be immovable, but he sure as hell could do something to fix Fang\u2019s attitude. Quick as a flash, the blue drake caught the wolf off guard with an open palm slap to the side of his head. The blow knocked the small wolf with such force it lifted him airborne, projecting him a few feet to land face-first onto the concrete sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quickly advanced towards the stunned wolf. \u2018You stupid fucking bitch!\u2019 he shouted as he planted his foot on the wolf\u2019s back, pinning him down. \u2018Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m trying to help you?! You have as much skin in this game as I do, but you keep barking orders and threats which make me think I don't a shit about what happens to you. Tyler was right man, you gotta realise that you\u2019re not in control here anymore, so show me some fucking respect!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf scuffled under David\u2019s foot. \u2018Fuck you David!\u2019 he snarled, \u2018 Get your fucking foot off me!\u2019 The wolf scrambled his limbs and torso, skating in random directions under David\u2019s foot. The blue dragon scowled and directed more of his bodyweight onto the wolf. \u2018Wrong answer!\u2019 he barked as Fang continued to flail about, though he was no longer able to gather any momentum from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt probably took all of 30 seconds before Fang stopped writing. It has become apparent much earlier that the blue drake\u2019s foot was not going to budge, its splayed toes pinning down the majority of the wolf\u2019s deflated back. But Fang had stubbornly fought on for a time to make a statement if nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid waited a moment after the wolf finished, able to feel his rapid heartbeat and deep, strained breath though the foot that held him. \u2018So are you going to start co-operating now?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018No.\u2019 the wolf finally panted between breaths. It wasn\u2019t a fearful or wavering no. It was a steadfast, absolute refusal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid leaned on the wolf even more as he anticipated Fang trying to fight free a second time, but no such struggle eventuated. \u2018So\u2026 well then, what are you going to do now then?\u2019 David asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Nothing.\u2019 The wolf spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled. \u2018So you\u2019re just gonna lay there?\u2019 he goaded. \u2018You\u2019re just gonna give up and do nothing?\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m waiting.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018what for?!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Tyler to shrink your stupid ass, moron! If you want to waste time here, then fine. Fuck you.\u2019 The wolf spat from under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was incensed. \u2018I\u2019m not wasting time, you are! I\u2019m trying to work with you here, but you won\u2019t listen! Tyler\u2019s a ticking clock for both of us, but you\u2019re too fucking petty to see the big picture!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Tyler is YOUR problem!\u2019 The wolf shouted.  \u2018If you want to be his little bitch and please him, then fine. Fuck you. He can\u2019t do shit to me.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt a surge of testosterone shoot up from his groin, still somewhat aroused from the recent bout of shrinking. \u2018If I\u2019m his bitch, then you are mine, shit for brains!\u2019 He grabbed his bulge to emphasise his point, not seeming to care that the wolf had his back to it. \u2018I can take from you whenever I want. And I can tell you now I have all the motivation in the fucking world to do it. You want to end this? well, there\u2019s two ways that can happen. And if you want the happy ending, then YOU FUCKING NEED ME!\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I don\u2019t need shit!\u2019 The wolf erupted. \u2018If you wanna play it like this, then just get your fucking foot off me and fuck off!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only so much insubordination David was willing to take from the small, naked black wolf under his foot. He suddenly realised that he hated Fang. And always had. Sure, they were a part of the alpha pack on campus. He would share a joke or story about what he got up to with some girl that night, or share a drink or twenty at a party. But that was just because they were teammates, tribal members. Were it not for that, David would not be able to tolerate being around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was just too arrogant, too smug and snarly. He was nasty. Nasty to everyone he knew. His peers, his mentors, his girlfriends. He happily hurt anyone in his life to get a little rush. If he wasn\u2019t a physical monster, he would be just some sociopathic lone wolf no one would approach. And right now, he was no physical monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You know what your problem, Fang?\u2019 David sneered. \u2018What you are doing right here. It\u2019s the reason why you will never get anywhere. You believe that you don\u2019t need to work with anyone else. Ever. You can always do it all on your own. You won\u2019t go pro because you\u2019d rather showboat than play your role. In Fang\u2019s world, getting noticed is more important than winning. Why play your part and risk not being the star?  Why wait your turn in the gym when you can make a statement by just tossing people off?  Hell, even your own fucking name isn\u2019t flashy enough for you!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf chuckled mirthlessly at David\u2019s rant. \u2018I\u2019m still waiting\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, I\u2019m not Fang.\u2019 David\u2019s heart pounded as he looked around him. It was nearing midday on a week day, no one was around on the street, but anyone could turn a corner to look out a window. It was still open public. This wasn\u2019t the place, but it was definitely the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shoved his hands down his pants, fumbling nervously as he fished his half-swolen cock out from his loose pants. The wolf sprang back to life as they fell down his feet and onto his back. \u2018FUCKING STOP THAT!\u2019 He shouted as he writhed on the ground again, managing to pivot forwards a few inches before David reaffirmed his weight. His loins ached as his erection quickly matured in his hands. Was he really going to do this?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2018Yeah\u2026\u2019 David answered as he stroked his cock. He wasn\u2019t a shadow on his former size, but the sight and feel of the struggling wolf beneath his toes, as well as the rather open setting, gave the blue drake an odd sense of power he hadn\u2019t really felt before. He lessened his grip on the wolf just a tad, for no other reason to let him scuttle a few inches, before pressing him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018you\u2019re my little bitch now Fang.\u2019 He said as he worked his shaft. He wasn\u2019t anything like Tyler, it was a one handed effort. He cupped and fondled his balls with his off hand. They still felt surprisingly large, considering everything that had happened. \u2018It\u2019s disappointing that it came to this, I was trying so hard to work with you.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019LL FUCKING KILL YOU!\u2019 The wolf shouted with rage as he struggled free of the blue foot for a split second, managing to flip on his back before David pinned him down again. David skipped a stroke as he realised Fang was staring up at him now.  It wasn\u2019t desirable; in fact it just made everything even weirder. But it was just too much of a rush for him to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Will you? Or, will you just keep shrinking? Because\u2026\u201d David breathed deep as he closed his eyes, feeling his orgasm build. \u201cI will take it. I want it!\u201d Many things about this seemed\u2026 wrong to the blue Dragon, but there was no going back now. He grunted his last breaths as the wolf scrambled hopelessly up his ankle, before releasing his load with a half moan, half roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came in three bursts, each one flying several feet onto the median strip in front of him. \u2018Hello!\u2019 he gasped in surprise as he felt another rush shoot up from his cock, letting him know he was immediately ready to go again. As he looked down with a lustful grin, he made contact with Fang\u2019s intense gaze, his golden yellow eyes like molten metal as they stared up at him in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sneered down at the wolf, scoffing as he felt the familiar warm glow spread over him. \u2018So, it\u2019s your call man. We can either work together, doing as I say, or\u2026\u2019 the cobalt drake shivered as his body tingled in the glow of growth. He firmly gripped the base of his cock, the contact invoking an involuntary kegel, which in turn caused his glans to spark in needy pleasure as a drop of pre leaked onto the already glazed surface. \u2018Or..\u2019 The drake concentrated. Fuck, it was hard to resist another go just then. \u2018\u2026we can just keep doing this until you disappear.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt wonderful as his body filled up again, muscle flowing from nowhere onto his frame as his bones and chest expanded again. He could feel his cock pushing further out in his hands, his grip widening as his veiny ebony rod expanded in each moment. He felt his balls pull down on his groin with more force as they expanded and slid down his thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the best feeling of all was the feeling of his foot overwhelming the black wolf. Fang shrank even as the blue foot that pinned him swelled even bigger. David let his increasing pounds flow down onto the wolf as he sucked in the wolf\u2019 body, sneering as he felt the friction on the ball of his saurian foot and his toes build and pinch as they snaked over the wolfs body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang yelped in pain as his shrinking pelt got caught under the foot, his fur in effect being pulled as he shrivelled away on the sidewalk. David didn\u2019t have to move as his middle toe crept up Fang\u2019s torso, then his neck, and then pushed against his tiny jaw by the time it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only another 6 inches. But those same inches taken from Fang made a difference greater than the numbers would have made him realise. Had Fang been standing, he would have been two foot four. Barely a third of David\u2019s height. <br>\r\nIn fact, David\u2019s foot wasn\u2019t just pressing down on Fang\u2018s torso anymore \u2013 it was virtually enveloping it. The blue drake smiled down on the wolf, grabbing his throbbing cock with both hands. Yes, he thought. Now it was big enough for both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018So tell me Fang\u2026 are you ready to get in the game now?\u2019</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNever!\u201d the wolf countered with absolute conviction. \u201cI will never play your game! I will never be your bitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood a moment in silent frustration. What was wrong with this wolf? Why was he making this so much more difficult than it needed to be? \u201cOh for fucks sake man, what\u2019s your problem? How can I make this any clearer for you?!\u201d David shouted down at the wolf as he leant down on him, this time around the combination of more weight and less resistance was enough to stop the wolf breathing. Fang gripped David\u2019s thick middle toe as it pressed down on his throat, trying unsuccessfully to alleviate some of the pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was so angry he just pressed down more. \u201cStop struggling! You can\u2019t fight me!\u201d he barked down at the choking wolf. Fang desperately writhed and kicked pathetically under his foot, his frantic movements reinforced David\u2019s feeling of power. Oh man \u2013 was this turning him on? The furious urges that stemmed down his rock hard erection seemed to suggest it was. But then, maybe it was still just the afterglow of his recent growth spurt? That seemed more palatable.<br>\r\nDavid took some of the pressure off Fang then, though he kept his middle toe hovering over the wolf\u2019s neck. Fang shook as he coughed and gasped for air. His shudders grew steadily stronger until David realised he was laughing. \u201cWhat\u2019s so fucking funny about this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou. You\u2019re funny. I\u2019m laughing at you David.\u201d The wolf smiled as he looked up past David\u2019s erection and into his eyes. \u201dYou can\u2019t make it any clearer. I understand. I\u2019m not an idiot. I just don\u2019t care.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026\u201d David started, but words didn\u2019t come. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cNo one is more obsessed by their size as you are, and now you say you just don\u2019t care? Even though you\u2019re life is at stake?!\u201d<br>\r\nFang laughed harder. \u201cOh, don\u2019t get me wrong David. I\u2019m not enjoying this. At all. I want my body back, and more to boot. But it\u2019s not something you can use to control me. Make any threats you want, and follow through with them. I won\u2019t be moved. I will never be your bitch.\u201d The wolf stared up at him with an opened-mouth smile, as if his very defiance was the ultimate victory.<br>\r\nDavid snarled. Saying nothing, he loudly slapped an hand on his cock, the shudder sending waves of pleasure up him as it demanded more. A globule of pre flung from it\u2019s head and fell next to the wolf\u2019s head. Fang closed his mouth as he moved violently to avoid it, even though it was never any real danger of hitting him. Yeah, that knocked the smile from his face, David thought, fighting the urge to stroke himself outright. He smiled smugly and rose an eyeridge at the wolf, quietly calling his bluff. <br>\r\nThe wolf looked back at him with intense stoicism. \u201cDo it.\u201d he snarled. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d David\u2019s expression changed to outright surprise in an instant. <br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s face broke out in a joyless smile. \u201cI said, go on then, do it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re loving this. Absolutely loving this. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a bit of a jack out on the street, in the middle of the day, forcing a buddy to look on as you keep them under your foot. Go on, threat yourself big fella. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it, you perverted fuckwit.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck man?!\u201d David asked contemptuously. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhats wrong with me? Well, I guess you did a good job of saying that a few moments ago. I\u2019m a big, bad selfish wolf, without the big. But what about yourself there David? Do you want to know what\u2019s wrong with you? Besides dragging me into your demented little fetishes, I mean\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid opened his mouth but the wolf cut him off. \u201cThe problem with you David\u2026 \u201c He began, his smile turning genuine. \u201c\u2026is that you\u2019re a little bitch. You\u2019ve always been a little bitch, I\u2019ve seen it in you since the moment we met. You like to lift your weights, and pull the chicks, and break the lines. You play the part of the campus hero so well that no one else can see it. But I can. I can see you\u2019re just a bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit rich coming from my toe\u2019s don\u2019t you think? \u201c David accused the wolf. \u201cIf I\u2019m a bitch, what does that make you?\u201d<br>\r\nThe wolf didn\u2019t break his smile. \u201cThat question proves my point. It shows what a little bitch you are. You can\u2019t even begin to look into the mindset of a real man, can you? When your brother put this curse on you, you shat yourself. You fell over yourself to pass the buck on, all too eagre to do your brother\u2019s bidding. You played your natural role, his bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do when you were three feet tall David? Huh? What did you do? You wimped out of that house with your tail between your legs, desperate to do anything but face your problem. Tyler was right there in front of you and you ran away.\u201d The wolf barred his teeth in a vicious little grin as he lowered his voice. \u201cI bet you cried when no one was looking. Did you do that David? I bet you did. I bet you cried like a little bitch.\u201d<br>\r\nDavid stood in indignation, his mouth open but not working. Wow, the thought. That really hit the target. Although it infuriated him to realise it, he was speechless.<br>\r\n\u201cBut David\u2026\u201d the wolf continued. \u201c\u2026ask yourself what did your little ol\u2019 buddy Fang do when he was three feet tall? I bet you don\u2019t know why he did it, either. You can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to be fearless, can you David? You probably dream about it in your sleep, along with your other filthy fetishes. But you don\u2019t truly know what it\u2019s like to be a real man.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m twenty times the fucking man than you right now!\u201d he snorted down at the wolf.<br>\r\nFang gave a contemptuous scoff. \u201cYou aren\u2019t one twentieth the man I am David, and you know it. You can\u2019t control me, because I am fearless. I would rather die fighting, than live a single day as another man\u2019s bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo by all means David, don\u2019t let me stop you. God for another few rounds. Go get your size back. But It won\u2019t make me your bitch. It won\u2019t make me grovel or beg or do your bidding. I might not be able to stop you, but I won\u2019t stop fighting. Even if I can\u2019t win. Tyler was wrong. And you just don\u2019t get it. I am not helpless. Neither of you have any power over me. And you never, ever will.<br>\r\nDavid felt another warm tingle envelop his body. \u201coh FUCK Tyler!\u201d He said to no one, looking around pointlessly as he felt himself beginning to wither away again. Fang let out an evil laugh as he felt the huge blue foot slowly withdraw from the territory it claimed on his chest. David snarled and pressed his foot down hard on the wolf in retaliation. The action shut him up as he struggled to breathe again, but David took no joy in the action as he could feel the pounds he commanded slowly leak away.<br>\r\nHe could see and feel the world grow bigger around him, his clothes gave increasing slack, his chest visibly deflating under his neck. He could feel his cock shrivel in his hand, it\u2019s slick shaft sliding inwards beneath his palm, his grip closing in as it emptied. His balls crawled back up his thigh as their mass became less noticeable. Damn, the feeling made him feel so wretchedly weak, but it still turned him on. He was stroking himself by the time he has finished shrinking. He bit his bottom lip as he unsuccessfully fought half-heartedly against his actions. He was horny, and wanted his size back as soon as possible.<br>\r\nI can see you\u2019re starting to panic again.\u201d The wolf laughed up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d David shouted back down. \u201cI won\u2019t stop until you agree to work with me, to do as I say!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d The wolf answered curtly. David growled in response, scowling down at Fang as he pumped his shaft harder. There was a lot going through his mind at the moment. Frustration, stress, fear, and desire were the highlights. He scowled as he considered his confusion. Was he really going to go through with this again?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Was he going to go through with it? Probably, but this time it was different. He didn\u2019t have the feeling of power this time around. He wasn\u2019t doing it to prove a point or dominate the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, there was strong desperation motivating his strokes. He was desperate to fight his brother and stay a reasonable size. He was desperate to sate his raging desires. He was desperate for the wolf to just give up and do what he needed him to do. He pulled on his cock harder and faster as pre started flowing. He closed his eyes; he didn\u2019t want to watch the Fang watching him. He moaned. He needed this, but he wasn\u2019t necessarily enjoying it as much as he should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, David\u201d The wolf taunted up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re enjoying that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d The drake shouted angrily behind clenched eyes. He pressed down firmly on the wolf to shut him up, but was unable to exert quite enough pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, seriously dude. You look all panicky and bitch like.\u201d Fang wheezed up as he struggled hard for breath. \u201cYou were far more into it last time. What\u2019s the matter man? You\u2019re getting stage fright playing in front of an audience? It\u2019s only me, your little buddy Fang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said shut up!\u201d Fang was definitely ruining what little mood there was, but fortunately the drake\u2019s cock wasn\u2019t going to let this opportunity slip. It stayed painfully hard and spurted pre, gliding his hand faster and harder. It wasn\u2019t long before David could feel the distant build-up of another orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey David, you jack off like a little bitch. Look at that hand move, it\u2019s got no rhythm.\u201d David grunted as he approached the point of no return. \u201cSeriously, if that\u2019s how you treat yourself, then I can\u2019t see how you could have ever made one of those skanks you chase cum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d David cried as he came again, hard. It felt as if the head of his dick exploded open in pleasure as he spurted two, three, four waves of cum forwards with excessive force, bucking his pelvis with each spurt. He watched through a mental haze as his ropes easily beating his previous mark. That was odd, he thought as his orgasm faded. He was standing in the same spot, and was the same height. It was as if every orgasm was harder than his last. No wonder his brother was getting so carried away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you came like a man, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d The wolf started up in mock admiration. \u201cI bet this isn\u2019t the first time another guy has said that to you though, hey buddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you Fang.\u201d David said between breaths without much energy, enjoying his release. It lasted only a moment longer, however, as the head of his cock suddenly tingled back to life, another wave of desire shooting up his loins. The blue drake gripped his cock on instinct, exhaling loudly as his mouth suddenly seemed to dry up. How the hell did Tyler manage to fight this as long as he had been?<br>\r\nHis desires grew even more acute as the warm tingly sensation enveloped him. He felt himself rise higher as his joints elongated and thickened, his muscles flowing onto them underneath his cobalt skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view from fang\u2019s perspective would have been frightening to any other, as the cobalt drake seemed to slowly almost double in height, and sextuple in mass. The giant blue saurian foot pressed down on him with renewed force, expanding out onto his chest in every direction, roughly pinching and pulling on his thinning pelt as it slowly conquered him. Looking up, he could see the dark silhouette of the dragon as it stood in the midday glare, his cock spilling further out as a hand worked it from head to sheath. The blue dragon moaned, his voice deepening as his throat and lungs claimed more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolf grabbed hold of David\u2019s middle toe as it slid down onto the wolf\u2019s neck and jaw again, but his grasp was useless as it failed to even change the angle it expanded in, the toe rolling onto his head and pressing it down with force, wedging the wolf\u2019s head on his side between hard concrete and expanding flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could do little else but hear the cracks and pops of cartilage, and the rush and tears of flesh as it layered on top of , filling the toe above his ear. He could feel the increasing pressure building on his weakening body, as breathlessness slowly turned into flushing pressure. He could feel the shockwaves of every stroke the drake made as the foot gently rocked against his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched the wolf\u2019s head disappear under his toe. The sight and touch drove him wild, and he was already well underway in his effort for another orgasm by the time the growth stopped. Damn, he wanted more. He needed it. He worked his increased cock with both hands, spilling a large spurt of pre onto the ground below him. He should stop. Should he? He didn\u2019t seem to be stopping. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Fang\u201d he called out, his voice shaking with every thrust of his cock. \u201cAre you ready to give in yet?\u201d There was no response. The wolf simply knocked on top of the giant toe that rested on him. \u201cohhh\u2026\u201d David moaned at the sight. His cock spurt more pre as he took another leap towards orgasm. He teetered on the edge of committing to finishing it, before reluctantly shifting his weight off the wolf, pivoting its angle so Fang could peer out between the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gasped for air as he looked up at the blue Drake still stroked his cock with both hands, but it was a more controlled action than a fit of passion. Pre seemed to be flowing somewhat freely from his head, but the cock stretched far enough from the wolf that he was in no danger of catching some spillage. \u201cGoing again already big guy?\u201d he called up in a voice so shrill it surprised even him. \u201cShame on me underestimating how pathetic you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll just be easier to finish you off now.\u201d David said between his own breaths. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to co-operate, then it will be easier for me to just move on. I\u2019ve wasted enough time with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree\u201d. Fang called back. \u201cThis has all just been one massive waste of time. But continuing will waste even more won\u2019t it? So you\u2019re still acting moronic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon raised an eyeridge. \u201cIt almost sounds as if you\u2019re finally giving up there Fang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I give up when I have all the leverage?\u201d he laughed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head in disappointment. His two-fisted strokes got a bit harder, the slick wet squelches of every stroke followed a little closer together. \u201cYou\u2019re less than two feet and shrinking, wedged under my foot. Fine, you\u2019re being ridiculously stubborn, I\u2019ll give you that. But how can you possibly claim to have leverage?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a bitch.\u201d The wolf sneered. \u201cYou just want to survive. Well, we\u2019ll see how long that lasts once you\u2019ve taken everything I have, but your brother doesn\u2019t keeps coming for more. Where does that leave you on the end of your broken little chain? Hey David? Are you a man like me? Are you ready to die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid considered the situation. He wanted to cum again so badly. He was back to six and a half feet, the same size he was when the wolf first knocked on his door. After all this time, that\u2019s all he had achieved. And he was so close to seven feet again. So close to his original height. But he needed the Fang, and some part of him knew that he was over-doing it. Besides, he didn\u2019t actually want to wither the wolf away to nothing, he didn\u2019t actually want to kill him. Or did he? It was hard to tell at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what should I do then Fang?\u201d he asked he pumped his shaft. \u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting your fucking foot off me and your hands off your dick is a start. That\u2019s is leading both of us nowhere. I\u2019m not going to give in. Which is a problem for you, since you need me to survive. You NEED me, David. You know you do. I\u2019m a real man who wants to fight. You\u2019re a bitch who needs protection. So that\u2019s where we are. I\u2019m the man and you\u2019re the bitch. Bitches need real men to protect them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed as he felt himself near the edge. It would be easier, oh so much easier to just let himself cum again. A few more heavy strokes and he was there. But maybe there was something in what the wolf was saying. From the confusion in his mind, he made a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hesitation reigned in the dragon\u2019s mind, as he stood paralyzed with indecision, one large foot planted on the wolf\u2019s skinny chest. Slowly, sadly, he lifted it up, allowing Fang to pick himself off the ground and dust himself off.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d said David. \u201cI\u2019m just reacting, helpless. I\u2019ve got to act. I\u2019ve got to-\u201c David\u2019s sentence was cut off abruptly as the wolf slammed a tiny balled fist into his free-hanging nuts, growling with fury as he did. Cupping his paws around his mishandled manhood for protection, David allowed himself a few hissed profanities as he screwed his eyes shut in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna jack off, don\u2019t do it over me, got it?\u201d snarled Fang, smirking at the wounded drake. \u201cBut you made the right choice, so good work, dickhead. Walk with me, we\u2019re wasting time.\u201d Clutching his damaged pride, David tottered behind the tiny wolf, keeping pace with his unimpressive stride even while awkwardly nursing his tender sack. He felt... distinctly unaroused, come to think of it, which was a damn sight better for business than being lost in a haze of cloudy lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to think about this. Every time that... fucking cockroach Tyler cracks one off, he steals your hard work. Now, you\u2019re kind of dumb, David, so really that\u2019s all you got, and he\u2019s taking it. He\u2019s taking everything. It\u2019s an insult to everything you\u2019ve done, and everything you stand for, and you need to use that to motivate you sufficiently. I do it every time I look at you, after all. It\u2019s been working well, I\u2019d say. Every time I think about how shitty my muscles look on a bitch like you, I just about turn and rip your fucking throat out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was right. The wolf was a sociopath, no matter how big he was, and no amount of size-snatching was going to change that \u2013 if he wanted his help, he was just going to have to suck it up and be the bigger man, which was easy at his height... and he did want his help. What the wolf said had a certain element of truth to it \u2013 he was panicking, reacting blindly to the tyrant Tyler had become and trying to restore some semblance of normality, whereas Fang was rolling with the punches no matter how small he got. He got the feeling that if they worked together, despite their mutual distrust, they could possibly get somewhere. More importantly, they might be able to get Tyler back to normal and reclaim their size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to get downtown, though the two questants noticed they were getting a lot of attention striding through the city pretty much naked. David covered his embarrassment with a paw, watching Fang beat a path in front of him with a singular focus. The black wolf wasted no time in finding the antique shop, ripping the door open with barely concealed fury as the bell above delicately announced his arrival. David was familiar with the place \u2013 Tyler knew the owner or something because he liked to pick up props for his store amongst all the old-world curios on display. Old and unusual was the order of the day here \u2013 maps and books from a bygone era joined oddly-carved ivory sculptures and delicate wooden boxes inlaid with various glossy stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey fucko, you sold my friend\u2019s brother a defective amulet, and you\u2019re gonna tell us how to fix it.\u201d David turned away from the decor for a moment to witness Fang berating the employee behind the till, a fox with a perpetual grin and an old purple suit.<br>\r\n\u201cDefective? How can that be?\u201d asked the fox as David approached the counter, amulet in hand. \u201cI mean, amulets don\u2019t really have a function beyond looking nice around one\u2019s neck.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be coy with me, you shrimpy motherfucker, I\u2019ll-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cFang!\u201d scolded David, stepping in to make sure the angry little ball of hate didn\u2019t launch himself at the fox. \u201cYeah, my brother bought this amulet for me, long story short he is a huge-ass tank of muscles and crazy, how do we fix it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one, you size-snatching blue streak of shit!\u201d snarled Fang, clearly displeased at having been cut off by the dragon. David rolled his eyes and sighed as the wolf continued to spew forth a vitriolic tirade, extending his hand and the amulet for the shopkeeper to inspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, I remember. The little purple dragon, who might not be so little any more, if you\u2019re right.\u201d David noticed after a moment that the fox was looking without touching, perhaps wary - or better yet knowledgeable \u2013 of the curse. \u201cI know what you\u2019re here for, but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a catch...\u201d The fox\u2019s toothy grin only seemed to get wider as Fang and David shared a worried glance...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was an awkward pause as the three waited for each other to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat?\u201d Fang demanded flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox raised his brow in an unusual gesture, almost surprised weren\u2019t satisfied with his answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a rather unusual piece this one. \u201c He started, pointing at the amulet. \u201cIt\u2019s very old and very\u2026  niche. You aren\u2019t going to have much luck with finding any related artefacts, or much information on how it works, let along break its magic. I didn\u2019t even think it still worked, actually. It didn\u2019t when I tried it out. I should have charged a lot more than I did. Time makes fools of us all I suppose.\u201d The fox said, his eyes fading into the distance as he considered lost opportunities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fucking arsehole, look at me!\u201d the wolf snarled. The fix did so with a start. \u201cWe\u2019ve come here to fucking stop this shit, and we\u2019re staying until we either do or you fucking bleed to death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, calm down.\u201d The fox pleaded helplessly as if the wolf was a crying baby.\u201dI\u2019m not responsible for this. I didn\u2019t give you the amulet or make it. I just sold it. What my customers do with my treasures is outside my control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looked at David, nodding his head towards the fox. It was clear that he wanted the Drake to rough him up, but David deliberately misinterpreted the gesture as if the wolf wanted him to have a turn at reasoning with the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on man, you must be able to tell us something.\u201d The Dragon asked firmly but politely. \u201cIt looks Celtic, surley you can tell us a bit about Celtic magic and how to stop it?\u201d David was suddenly self-aware. He was talking about Celtic magic? Jeez, he sounded like his little brother. Or how his brother used to sound like, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Celtic.\u201d The fox said shaking his head emphatically. \u201cIt looks nothing like a Celtic artefact. What\u2019s wrong with you? No, It\u2019s actually a tribal artefact from a tropical\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo backstory, we only care about the point!\u201d the wolf shouted, waving his arms threateningly. David couldn\u2019t help by smile. He looked so ridiculous and so\u2026 well; his angry gestures made him look more adorable than threatening. <br>\r\nThe fox furrowed his brow in confusion. \u201cWell, you\u2019re the ones who came in here demanding information on it. Fine, if you want a more brief explanation. I\u2019m not an expert though, this really is a very specific type of magic from a relatively small civilization that was wiped out a long time ago, so the subject matter is rather understudies, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPOINT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox stared at the wolf a moment, his mouth open in mid-sentence, before shaking his head apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s chain magic. The tribe, or group of tribes, like many primitives, practiced human sacrifice. But not in a conventional way. You see, they would make artefacts like this to absorb, or combine, certain attributes from other people. Body, mind, spirit, courage\u2026 though it\u2019s not clear whether they absorbed these properties from other members of the tribe or those who were enemies. It used to be thought that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up and tell us something useful!\u201d the wolf interrupted again. \u201cWe know this, we\u2019ve seen this! All you\u2019ve done is add some shitty dead tribe into the mix. We don\u2019t care about a fucking tribe or their enemies! Tell us something we don\u2019t know for fucks sake! Something we can use!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shrugged his shoulders in reply. \u201cWell, then I\u2019m sorry not to be of much help. Because that\u2019s about all I know. That\u2019s about all there is to know nowadays. The rest is probably lost forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOT good enough! David, it\u2019s time to fuck this asshole up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne minute Fang, then I\u2019ll agree with you. \u201c David said, waving his hands as he tried to calm the wolf down. It didn\u2019t work. Fang\u2019s face darkened into a with hot fury at David\u2019s refusal. He clenched his fists, and every muscle of his weak naked body tensed and shook . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid addressed the fox before the wolf burst out at him. \u201cCome on man. You\u2019ve gotta know more than what you\u2019re telling us. Don\u2019t make us force it out of you.  What can we do to stop this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storekeeper raised a finger to his mouth as he stared at the ceiling in contemplation. If the fox felt threatened by either of them, he didn\u2019t seem to show it. He was only five foot five, middle aged with no real muscle to speak of. David couldn\u2019t tell if it was because he thought they were bluffing, or if he quietly somehow backed himself, or if he was just too eccentric to realise fully the world around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d the fox began. \u201cYou could try passing the curse back onto the original curse giver. Then you could close the system, and just cycle the height through the three of you. I can\u2019t see how that wouldn\u2019t work.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was shaking his head before the fox had finished, but Fang didn\u2019t see him. The wolf\u2019s ears shot up as realisation hit him \u201cFuck, yes! Why didn\u2019t we think of this earlier David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did!\u201d The blue dragon answered. \u201cOf course I did, it was the first thing I did last night, it\u2019s the most obvious thing to do. It didn\u2019t work. Is that seriously the best you\u2019ve got?\u201d David said angrily at the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work?\u201d he fox asked dumbly. Were there three of you on the chain at that time?\u201d he asked, shifting his gaze between the drake and the wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but why the fuck would that matter?\u201d David demanded. It was dawning on him that the fox probably didn\u2019t have a fucking clue about any of this, and that his guesses were  no  better than anyone elses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can\u2019t loop a two rung chain on itself. Think about it. It can\u2019t be done. You need at least three rungs to do that. I\u2019m fairly confident that doing that will work. Maybe. I mean what have you got to lose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had a moment to consider this. If that worked, was there any way it wouldn\u2019t just turn into a three way masturbation marathon as they tried to outdo each other? He felt a small glimmer of arousal in his cock then. He would so like to rub one out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAVID!\u201d the wolf commanded. The blue drake snapped out of his reverence. Fang was right. The fox watched in confusion as the six foot drake casually vaulted over the counter, grabbing hold of the fox and spinning him around with ease. David roughly and professionally pinned his arms behind his back and slammed his chest on the counter. \u201cOof!!\u201d the fox grunted as the air was knocked out of him. Oddly enough, the fox didn\u2019t seem to struggle at any point.  \u201cSorry dude\u2026 we gotta get something one way or another here\u201d David said, trying to sound harsh but fair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf stood on the counter and gathered the amulet. \u201cNow then\u2026\u201d He sneered contemptuously at David. \u201d\u2026it\u2019s better late than never. Next time, if you do what I say, when I say it, we\u2019ll get through the day twice as fast.\u201d David\u2019s eyes narrowed. Why was he letting these things slide? David gasped as he felt the warm tingly feeling spark in his body. Holy fuck, he thought. Tyler was settling in to a marathon session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned his attention on the shopkeeper. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough time to keep fucking around here. You have two choices. You can either help us out and give us something for our troubles\u2026\u201d the wolf said, waving his hand in a broad gesture of all the crap that cluttered his store.\u201d \u201cor\u2026\u201d he said and paused, holding the amulet up in his hand to the shopkeeper. \u201c\u2026 we can see how much more use you are when you have some more personal motivation.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David was shrinking again, the fox he restrained slowly expanded in his hands. David\u2019s enlarging shirt drifted down further over his pelvis, brushing faintly against his twitching cock. The fox stretched his neck to catch a glimpse of the drake holding him. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cOh, you\u2019re just shrinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burning desire returned to David\u2019s loins as the warmth faded, leaving him five and a half feet tall, about the same as the fox he was leaning against. His heart was racing as he felt his cock continuing to swell. \u2018Try not to think about it, and it will pass like it did before\u2019 he told himself. But that just made him think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! he realised he wasn\u2019t wearing any pants. There was nothing resisting it. He jumped as he felt his reaching cock lightly brush the fox he has holding. He took a quick step back. Damn it, why did the fox have to be a dude? Oh, what he wouldn\u2019t give for a minutes privacy just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t have anything to compliment the curse.\u201d The fox said to Fang, bringing David back into the room. Did you want something to treat your symptoms? \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we fucking well do.\u201d The wolf replied through barred teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, specifics of the curse aside, all magic shares the same base properties and rules. I have a trinket that might be able to counter it.\u201d He said, before turning around again to David. \u201cIf you let me go, I can just fish it out of the case over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon stood frozen. The fox\u2019s body was the only thing covering his erection. Why now? Why did he have to let go right fucking now? He eyed Fang as he desperately tried to come up with an excuse not to let him go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf seemed to mistake the cause of David\u2019s hesitancy as waiting for instructions. \u201cFor fucks sake David, use your own discretion and let him GET THE FUCKING TRINKET!\u201d he shouted. The drake sighed, rolling his eyes as he stepped back from the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang saw David\u2019s embarrassment immediately after the shopkeeper scurried away. His gaze shifted between David\u2019s crotch and face, before he closed his eyes, shaking his head as he took a single deep breath. No words. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Fucking shrinking man. I\u2019ll get over it in a minute.\u201d David murmured, hoping to assure himself as much as the wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever!\u201d Fang burst curtly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a shitload more than that this morning. We both know you\u2019re an embarrassment, this is just another thing to expect.\u201d David felt flush between anger and sheer embarrassment, but words failed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d The fox said happily as he walked back behind the counter, studding a solid golden bracelet. \u201cOh.\u201d He said, stopping dead in mid stride as he saw David\u2019s fully pitched tent. There shared an awkward moment, before suddenly it as if nothing was out of the ordinary. \u201cThis is an ancient Cambodian bracelet which has been proven to counter magic links. I tested it myself, it works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf held his tiny arm out, is fingers impatiently demanding possession. The fox politely obliged.<br>\r\n\u201cSo this bracelet will negate the curse?\u201d Fang asked sceptically as he turned the Bracelet in his hands. It was far, far too big for the shrunken wolf to wear as intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 not negate. I never said that. You can\u2019t negate magic. That\u2019s like destroying energy. It can\u2019t be done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what the fuck does it do then?\u201d the wolf snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it counters it. Counters. Reverses it, if you will. So for example... let me think of an example\u2026  If someone was using magic to read your mind, then this bracelet will allow you to re-apply that same magic to read theirs. So not only would it protect your mind, it would expose them. Does that make sense?\u201d The fox finished hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could see an evil little smile grow across the wolf\u2019s muzzle as he stared at the bracelet in his hands. David realised it suddenly looked a LOT smaller. Was it shrinking in the wolf\u2019s hands?! <br>\r\n\u201cSo I could take my body back off you\u2026\u201d Fang said as he looked up at the blue drake.  \u201cAnd you can take yours back off Tyler. And then, once that\u2019s sorted, the two of us can claim a little bit of interest. Hey Davey, I think this is what we were after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid suppressed a shiver. So Fang could become the head of the chain? He didn\u2019t believe the wolf\u2019s narrative for one second if that eventuated. No, reversing the chain would be the only way to make this WORSE. That bracelet was evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Fang, we came here to stop this, remember?\u201d David said sternly. \u201cWe aren\u2019t looking for ways to spice things up. And fuck it, even if it works, I\u2019m still in the middle of this chain.\u201d David could see it in the wolf\u2019s eyes, in his smile. There was nothing he could say to make the wolf agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Davey?\u201d Fang asked, almost taunting. \u201cAre you afraid that I might not return your consideration?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Fang. There\u2019s got to be something else.\u201d David firmly insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can still sell it to you even if you\u2019re friend isn\u2019t interested.\u201d The fox helpfully suggested to Fang. \u201cI assume you aren\u2019t a couple, am I right? No joint bank account?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tell you what\u2026\u201d Fang said with a smirk. \u201cLet\u2019s just put a pin in this idea for now. We\u2019ll leave the bracelet on the counter and come back to it if we don\u2019t come up with any better ideas. Hows about that Davey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon nodded silently, holding an untrusting eye on the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d the fox trailed off as he searched his mind. Please, David pleaded to himself. Please come up with something better. \u201cI have some things that can amplify magic effects, but I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be interested much in them... Oh, I do also have some more\u2026 \u2018contemporary\u2019 potions. Though personally, I think that kind of crap is as woo-woo as healing crystals.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d the fox suddenly burst out. \u201cActually, we do have some crystals. Yes, I completely forgot about the crystals. They\u2019d be right up your alley. The gentleman who ordered them never picked them up. I\u2019ve been holding them for weeks now. I suppose it\u2019s fair for me to offer them to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just described the ctystals as woo-woo.\u201d The wolf said flatly, though he hadn\u2019t completely wiped the smile form his face. \u201cYou like, literally, just said that crystals were woo-woo. Describing them as woo-woo was how you remembered you had crystals at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d the fox waved dismissively. \u201cHealing crystals are woo-woo. Charged crystals are real.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know about Charged crystals? They\u2019re basically magic batteries, holding raw energy. How that energy is to be used is completely up to you. You can grow yourselves back, or shrink your brother. Or even try and break the curse, though that would probably be dangerous. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey can be used for anything?\u201d the wolf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The fox responded absolutely. \u201cTo some degree at least.\u201d He then qualified.  \u201cThey only have a finite charge, so you would need a lot of them to destroy the universe. But theoretically their applications are infinite, provided you can focus the energy in the right way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you even use them to heal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fox blinked. \u201cWell\u2026 ha, you sly little dog, you got me there. I suppose you could, but as I said, you\u2019d need to focus them right. \u2018Healing Crystals\u2019 are a different thing altogether; they are just green quartz which are meant to emit good energy. Completely different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI call bullshit\u201d. The wolf said, rubbing his paws together. \u201cCome on David, looks like this bracelet\u2019s on. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHang on Fang, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d David almost shouted. \u201cHe just said we could use the crystals to change size. We can control Tyler and stay strong ourselves. That\u2019s what we want. Hey\u2026 um\u2026\u201d David suddenly realised he had no idea what the fox\u2019s name was. \u201cStorekeep, how would we use these crystals to change size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shrugged pointedly. \u201cDo I look like a geocrystologist to you? I just sell mystiques, I don\u2019t manufacture them. You might be able to find something on the internet though. I know crystals are often arranged in laser-like devices that scale-orient, it\u2019s fairly common actually. Well, common for the magic world, at least. I strongly recommend you start there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox gazed at the distance between the wolf and the drake. \u201cBut I don\u2019t recommend you do that, mind. It\u2019s very dangerous if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. So you aren\u2019t going to come blame me again when it go pear\u2026 if it goes pear shaped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coookay\u2026\u201d Fang trailed off as he looked at the fox with amused concern. \u201cSo we have a bracelet that would totally be beneficial, and some crystals that are useless without some mystical engineering degree. Is there anything else you have in store that we could make use of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shook his head slowly. \u201cNo. I mean yes! Well, I kind of mean yes. You are welcome to browse at your discretion. I have a map which tells you which country you are pointing at on it. Though admittedly it\u2019s lost a bit of its novelty now you can do the same thing on Google. And it\u2019s probably more up to date\u2026 Did you need Australia on a map? I know what you\u2019re thinking. You probably don\u2019t, but it\u2019s still nice to have. No, you probably wouldn\u2019t be interested in the map. Or my scented candles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d The wolf said, winking at the David, a savage little grin plastered on his face. \u201cHow much for the bracelet then Mr.Fox?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d David growled at Fang. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I have to beat you to death, you aren\u2019t taking that Bracelet. Do you understand?!\u201d</span></div></div>",

If those crystals could buy him some time, he\u2019d be able to just come back and get the bracelet later while David wasn\u2019t around \u2013 and possibly get even bigger to boot without having to worry about either of the dragons getting jealous of his size and trying to take it back. Normally he wouldn\u2019t care what they thought, but... best to play it safe for now. He could wait. \u201cLet\u2019s take some of those fuckin\u2019 woo woo crystals... how did I not hear about this shit before? Wasting my time with fuckin\u2019 dietary supplements and gym memberships when all I had to do was jack a few, and shaboom, instant muscle-wolf.\u201d The not-particularly-muscled wolf examined a gem between his claw, letting the light play over its shining surface as David instinctively reached for his wallet, realising that he didn\u2019t actually have any pants on again.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid not many people believe in superstitions like this any more.\u201d replied the fox, almost wistfully. \u201cThe Enlightenment and the Renaissance killed off that sort of thinking... but magic doesn\u2019t need the belief of the scholars in their ivory towers to shine on through the darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, uh, do you take IOUs?\u201d asked David sheepishly, grabbing a handful of crystals and wishing he had pockets to stuff them into. \u201cHey, wait, do you have Tyler\u2019s card on record here? Or, like, his business account? I mean, he must buy shit from here all the time, his shop is loaded with useless old crap... no offense. I\u2019m sure these are pretty good.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, hit that little asshole right where it hurts, the wallet!\u201d snarled Fang with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all he has left when we\u2019re done shrinking him down!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a card number?\u201d asked the fox, bringing up a dusty ledger from beneath the counter and slamming it on the table in front of the pair, slowly turning the worn pages to the most recent entries.<br>\r\n\u201cSure do.\u201d responded David, reciting by rote his younger brother\u2019s credit card number, much to Fang\u2019s amazement. The little wolf cocked a curious eye at David, as if demanding explanation.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? If he didn\u2019t want me buying stuff with his account, he wouldn\u2019t leave his wallet laying in his shorts where I could find it. Besides, he\u2019s loaded, he won\u2019t miss <i>THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS?!</i>\u201d The dragon\u2019s jaw nearly clattered on the ground as he looked at the old-fashioned cash register, three hundred dollars prominently displayed for the price. \u201cWait, Tyler\u2019s paying for it. Never mind, we\u2019ll take the lot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnti-divination box for your magical jewels?\u201d offered the fox, proffering a small wooden chest made from sickly-looking black wood, odd bronze metal bands surrounding it. \u201cYou never know, your brother might be spying on you at any mo-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, whatever, we\u2019ll take it. Add it to the bill.\u201d interjected the dragon with a dismissive wave of his hand. \u201cBeats a paper sack.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShit yeah, now we\u2019re getting somewhere!\u201d Fang growled, cheerfully. David swept the crystals into the box as the fox rang up the price, David smiling inwardly as Tyler\u2019s bank account slowly shrank. The mostly-nude pair left the shop with a nod to the fox, and continued down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d asked David, clutching the box full of crystals in a vague attempt to hide his embarrassment on the busy streets as more than a few figures shot them concerned glances.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodwill. Much as I like the attention, I want to get some fuckin\u2019 clothes. I want <i>you</i> to get some fuckin\u2019 clothes too, you disgusting pervert, all inappropriate boners and jacking off to the studliest wolf in the city.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Fang.\u201d sighed David, rolling his eyes. There was a charity shop not far from the antique store, and so the pair headed that way as they argued.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just mad because it\u2019s true. If it was me in Tyler\u2019s shoes, you\u2019d be lining up to suck me off, you big faggot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right, asshole. I watched you squirming under his feet, and mine too. You enjoyed it! I bet you- oh, fuck.\u201d<br>\r\nFang turned to notice David\u2019s erection standing firmly to attention as he seized up in the doorway of the second hand clothes shop, the shrinking sensation spreading through him once again...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David whipped back out of the shop, pulling his baggy shirt down over his thighs. He squatted by the doorway to remove any definition that might try and pass though the fabric. He started to feel his muscles wear away again, his knees creaked as his shrinking calves and hamstrings retreated form each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust leave me out here a second.\u201d He instructed the wolf. \u201cGet me some pants, I don\u2019t care what.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf scoffed at the Drake. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to masturbate on the sidewalk in front of a charity store now are you?\u201d he sneered, before turning and entering the store. \u201cWait!\u201d David called out, but the wolf didn\u2019t come back. How was he going to pay for the clothes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s attention soon fell on the box of gems in his hand. \u201coh!\u201d he said startled. \u201cohh\u2026\u201d he followed up lustfully. He could feel an energy leaking from the box and flowing slowly down his hand, complimenting the warm shrinking feeling and intensifying his arousal. His shrinking cock seemed to spasm, demanding attention far more forcefully than he had come to expect from this experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his desire, David was caught between two minds about what he should do with his off hand. He wanted to open the box of crystals and let even more energy flow. But he also wanted to grab hold of his cock and not let go until he came. In the end he compromised, pulling his free hand in through the lose sleeve, while he fumbled with the box with his other hand, trying to maintain grip on the box while he fidgeted at the lid with his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started as he made contact with his throbbing erection. He bit his bottom lip. Fuck, that felt good. It also felt small. Far too small. But good. Why the fuck wouldn\u2019t the lid open?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was barley aware of himself as he pumped his shaft. He felt himself lowering to the ground. He felt his skin suck inwards as his bones thinned and shortened all around him. He felt his feet seem to spread further apart as they stayed planted on the expanding concrete. He lost track of time. He didn\u2019t notice that he was shrinking faster for longer. All he noticed was the increased feeling of lust and desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave up trying to open the lid once he stopped shrinking. In fact, he was suddenly very much aware that he was most of the way through an orgasm. Fuck! He thought looking around frantically. He was still alone, on the street. Even if his actions were hidden under a ridiculously large shirt, it still wouldn\u2019t take long for someone to read his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he hadn\u2019t stopped, he realised with uneven breath. His heart was thumping as his body ran on adrenalin.  Why hadn\u2019t he stopped? Because it felt so good. He should finish. He could feel the line approaching. No. He resolved himself. He would stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was still going. One, two, three, four extra strokes. He could feel it. The point of no return. \u201carrgh!\u201d He had to grunt audibly as he willed his hand free. He stopped. His cock angrily protested, spamming as it teetered on the edge of release.  David whined as his cock fought to cum without the final push. For several long seconds it hung there, before finally retreating in a surge of sexual frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, David!\u201d the wolf suddenly burst out of the shop, a flicking concerned look over his shoulder as he threw a pair of sweat pants at David. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta go, now!\u201d The wolf was wearing a large plain yellow t-shirt that draped all the way to his knees, the sleeves reaching his elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grabbed the pants reflexively. \u201cWait, how did you pay for these?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith my feet, let\u2019s go!\u201d The wolf insisted before running off down the street. Damn it, so now they were stealing from a charity shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran for about a minutes before funning out of breath. David put the pants on, but they were still too big, and he had to grip the elastic as he had done so often of late. But it wasn\u2019t just the pants. Even after the latest shrinking session, the wolf was bigger than he should have been. The pavement was wider than it should have been. The crystals had supercharged the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang\u2026\u201d  David started. \u201cI hate to say this\u2026 but I really think you should pass the curse on before we settle down into this project.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d the wolf spat. \u201cI\u2019ve made myself clear. What, do you think I\u2019m losing my nerve or something? Are you starting to have another bitch attack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear me out dude. How long ago did we leave my house? Maybe an hour ago? It couldn\u2019t have been much more. Well, in that time he\u2019s jacked off 4 times. That\u2019s two feet \u2013 well, more now.  I\u2019ve only got another 8 left in me before I absolutely HAVE to\u2026 well, borrow off you again, and you\u2019ve got less than 4.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf cocked a dangerous eyebrow up at David. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything of the sort.\u201d He said flatly. \u201cIf you are that desperate to get some size back, I\u2019ll go back and get that fucking bracelet. Because David, all bets are off if you try and bitch out on me again. Not after you passed on that out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, David wished he was better at diplomacy. \u201cWell, fine, let\u2019s assume I don\u2019t source any from you again\u2026\u201d The wolf\u2019s demeanour did not relax.  \u201c\u2026that\u2019s still only two hours\u2019 worth. Tyler\u2019s clearly going all out now \u2013 he\u2019s just chain jacking. He said he wasn\u2019t going to go easy on us, and the little fucker has been true to his word. As far as he\u2019s aware, we\u2019re out passing the curse on, trying to do the same thing. He wouldn\u2019t be thinking we would be as small as we are now. So I don\u2019t see why he\u2019d slow down, even if he did care at all about what happens to us. That leaves only two hours.\u201d<br>\r\nThe wolf shook his head. \u201cAll the more motivation to put your head down and focus. We\u2019re in the heat of the moment David. Real men thrive under pressure. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArgh. David knew he had a case, he just needed to articulate it in a way that penetrated Fang\u2019s defences. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll take you r point. But let\u2019s be smart about this.\u201d he reasoned, pausing while he sought the words. \u201cFang\u2026 the crystals accelerated my shrinking. I think I lost three inches more than I should have... maybe four. I could feel the energy flow through the box. It\u2019s hard to describe\u2026 but that\u2019s what happened. It was attracted the energy of the curse and flowed into me and on to Tyler. And that\u2019s through the so called Anti-divination box. Imagine how much more energy would have flowed through them if we didn\u2019t get the box and I was just holding them in my hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d probably be more hysterical as we had this exact conversation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would have shrunk a lot more. We can use this to our advantage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree\u201d Fang said. \u201cYou should just hold onto them until you disappear, break the chain and free me of this damned curse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s why they are useless to me. I\u2019m not taking any more of your body, so they are just helping Tyler at this point. But they could help you. If you passed the curse on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid noted Fang\u2019s slight hesitation before he responded. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change anything does it? I\u2019m not passing it on because I don\u2019t want to be a patsy. Who cares if I take six inches or 12, it will all end up in the same place. Which is why you and your brother can go fuck yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head. \u201cFang\u2026 it would be more than 12 inches. I felt the energy from the crystals. What I got was just what leaked through the box. And I could tell it wasn\u2019t much. It was just a trickle. I could feel it, Fang.\u201d<br>\r\nDavid paused, but the wolf didn\u2019t offer a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you held onto the crystals\u2026 you\u2019d easily outpace Tyler or myself.\u201d David pressed.  \u201cIt would buy us enough time to go back to your place and have a proper go at making this ray thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you David. Your only interest in this is to see that you get fed. I\u2019m not your fucking farm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what Fang?\u201d David asked frankly. \u201cI fully admit that. I only want you bigger because it buys me more time too. But in the end we\u2019ll both end up on Tyler one way or the other if we can\u2019t make this laser. That\u2019s the big picture. And it\u2019s not pretty. We have to get this right Fang. We can\u2019t fail. We. Can\u2019t. Fail. Right now, we should do everything in our power to make sure we get this right. And if that means buying ourselves enough time to do it properly, then fuck, Fang, we\u2019ve gotta take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. David couldn\u2019t have expressed it any better than that. He eyed the wolf as they walked. Fang wasn\u2019t saying anything. His face looked consciously stoic as he eyes stayed locked on the path ahead. He was aware that David was trying to read him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen David saw the wolf lick his muzzle. It was as quick as a flash, an unconscious tick. It was his tell. David went in for the kill. \u201cI can tell that you want to do it. You want to get you size back. And you know it makes sense. There\u2019s nothing stopping you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf snarled. \u201cShut the fuck up! I\u2019m thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid backed off. No, pressing him wasn\u2019t helping. The wolf knew it made sense in his mind. He wanted it in his heart. His pride was the only resistance he had left. Any further attempt of goading him into it would just strengthen his resolve. \u201cFang\u2026\u201d David said suddenly wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d Fang burst out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m fucking shrinking again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGimme those.\u201d Snarled Fang,snatching the box from David as he stood paralyzed by lust and magic. \u201cI\u2019m not playing along with your stupid plan, but I don\u2019t need you to get any smaller. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to the university. Since you\u2019re the biggest, for now, you run and steal some lasers and shit from the physics department. I\u2019ll go down to the library and lean on a couple of nerds until they crack open some books for me... fucking hell, David, pay attention!\u201d The wolf slapped David\u2019s hand away from his cock as mindless passion burned through his skull... but it didn\u2019t seem as bad. Not as strong as the last time, when he was holding onto the crystals in their box. It seemed while Fang was holding onto them, the chain couldn\u2019t take advantage of them...<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, man. Sorry.\u201d mumbled David, trying to focus and keep his raging lust under control. \u201cSo I get the lasers and you beat up the nerds?\u201d It was hard to concentrate as he lost yet another six inches from his form, bringing him down to the miserable height of 4\u2019 10\u201d. The sweatpants and shirt Fang had liberated were already far too baggy, hanging off his slight form as muscle and flesh just kept withering away into nothingness.<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t that be the other way around?\u201d he stammered, forcing himself onward through the disturbing shrinking sensation. \u201cI mean, you gotta be big to beat up nerds... no offense, but maybe I should handle that.\u201d Fang didn\u2019t even dignify the remark with a disparaging glance. <br>\r\n\u201cYou saw me take on Tyler. I can take on some more shrimpy nerds, no matter how tall I am. I\u2019m a predator, David, unlike you. Besides, you can use your size to carry more shit than I can. The more lasers the better, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quietly agreed. If Fang wasn\u2019t going to pass the curse on, they needed to act fast, and his plan seemed vaguely sensible. Once the pair hit the campus, Fang tore off to the library in search of \u201cresearch assistants\u201d, while David, sweatpants clutched awkwardly around his midsection, headed towards the school of engineering in search of interesting technological wonders. Normally, the high-tech decor would have interested him \u2013 projects and posters on display for engineering conferences and futuristic devices littering a sleek, almost sci-fi entry hall, but the dragon had a mission. Lasers were physics, right? Maybe chemistry. The two departments were in the same end of the building, or so the signposts said. The sounds of industry echoed through the bright corridors \u2013 welding, bubbling chemicals, what sounded like a baboon being stapled to a weasel... it was all a little overwhelming. A little lost in the strange twisting corridors of the Engineering building, David began to check open doors for interesting projects, or possibly some laser-based goodness. Door after door passed by, with little more than angry researchers, lectures in session, and one unusual room with a fellow duct taped into his labcoat, struggling awkwardly on the floor. Having decided to leave him alone, David came across a particularly interesting door \u2013 on the plaque that announced the contents of the room was inscribed \u201cDr Karl Oppenheimer, Beams, Rays and Laser Department.\u201d Score!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pushed inside the unlocked room, finding it abandoned and absolutely stuffed to the brim with technological treasures \u2013 most importantly, lasers. Focusing lenses, power supplies, one great beam in the centre burning away at sheet metal... well, if he wasn\u2019t here on a mission, he might stop to look. He found a battered hiking pack in the corner of the room and dumped the contents next to a stack of textbooks and journals \u2013 paper scattered everywhere as the dragon shovelled techno-goodies into the pack, along with a couple physics textbooks and some spare tools lying around for good measure. He had to make sure not to overload it \u2013 who knew how many times Tyler would manage to squeeze one off before they fixed the problem? As he hefted the pack onto his back, something caught his attention before he could leave for the library...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFuck!\u201d David swore under his breath as he looked frantically around the lab. The layout was simple, work benches and shelves, there was nowhere decent to hide. He dived under one of the benches as the door opened. A rather old looking male otter entered the room. David curled up as tight as he could, but he was still incredibly exposed. He could see practically the whole room from where he sat frozen. Surely the Otter would spot him without incidentally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d The Otter asked himself as he eyed the mess David had made of the room. He walked over and inspected the damage. David packed himself into as small a space as he could. A task Tyler helped out with as he felt the warmth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter was mumbling to himself as he walked up and down the lab as David shrank under the workbenches. He tried not to move, or make a sound, but that was much easier said than done as the world swelled up around him. His cock stood to attention under his blanket of a top, but his fear was enough to take his mind off whatever desires he might have felt. Four foot four. Anyone could apprehend him if he was caught now, even an ageing apparently blind otter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Otter wandered into an office and called security, allowing David to flee the scene, carrying the now significantly heavier bag in front of his groin as he headed towards the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the library was a sprawling mess of conjoined buildings, David had no problems finding Fang. Apparently everyone had \u201cseen a tiny wolf around here\u201d, and helpfully pointed the midget blue Drake in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was by the printer when David found him. \u201cHow did you go man? How were the nerds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking useless.\u201d Fang said in disgust. \u201cThey laughed at the idea of crystals, and size rays and curses. But they were fascinated at how small I was. Apparently I would make a good \u2018case study\u2019, or some shit. So I took one of their wallets and went looking for myself.\u201d Fang assembled his printouts, stacked them and stapled it. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single book in this place on the subject.\u201d He said, gesturing grandly with his hands. \u201cSo I googled this shit for myself, and I found a useful blog by some douche in Europe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang lead David over to a computer booth, pulling a USB stick from the console and collecting another stack of paper he had apparently assembled earlier.<br>\r\n\u201cThese sheets\u2026\u201d Fang continued, holding up the first stack of paper, \u201c\u2026explain how to assemble the laser. It\u2019s actually pretty easy in terms of components. One laser with power source, two crystals, a strip of gold and casing. That\u2019s it. You attach the crystals to either end of the gold strip, and then shoot the laser into the first crystal, then onto the second, and then the resulting beam is the focused energy we need. The more powerful the laser, and the further the distance between the crystals, the more energy the beam will transmit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis stack\u2026\u201d he said, holding up the second, significantly thicker pile \u201c\u2026explains in detail exactly how fucking hard it is to line the crystals up properly. Did you know they each have twenty sides? Each one refracts light and magic completely differently, but are otherwise completely indistinguishable.  This is what\u2019s gonna fuck us over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did sound\u2026 particular. \u201cWhere are we getting the case from?\u201d David asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the kind of thing you find in a vending machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf held up the USB stick. \u201cHave you heard of 3D printing?\u201d he asked sceptically. Daivid shook his head. \u201cNeither had I. Apparently you can make real plastic moulds from computer generated models, or some shit. Apparently it even comes out assembled.  I didn\u2019t believe it, but those nerds seemed pretty adamant that it was real, and considering I\u2019m less than two foot planning on making a magic laser out of crystals, I can\u2019t be fucked arguing. The Industrial Design faculty supposedly has a printer that students can use, for a fee. So I\u2019ll need you to write down your brother\u2019s credit card number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cFine.\u201d David shrugged as he started to write down the number. \u201cI assume you have a computer model in that stick thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStick thing? Fuck you\u2019re an idiot. But yes. The website came with a schematic complete with dials. Apparently it\u2019s designed specifically for this purpose, so all the guesswork has been done. Well, most of it. I still have to align the crystals right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis all sounds too easy\u2026 you\u2019ve done well Fang.\u201d David said impressed as he handed over Tyler\u2019s credit details. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf snatched the piece of paper with contempt. \u201cA few minutes on the Internet is always fucking easy. You don\u2019t have to be a nerd to find this shit David, you just need a level head.  Now...\u201d Fang pointed at David\u2019s hiking bag. \u201cLets see how you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid handed the bag over. \u201cFuck, this is heavy!\u201d the wolf said optimistically as he carefully emptied the hiking bag on the table. \u201cText books?!\u201d he spat indignantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt\u2026 I mean, in case we needed to do some research.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen were you planning on finding the fucking time?! Look at the space you wasted!\u201d He sifted through the pile of electronics, flattening it out before picking up one of the pen-like lasers. He studied it closely, rolling it around in his hands.  \u201cTwo.\u201d He said, practically tossing it to the side dismissively. He fished another out. \u201cTwo again\u2026\u201d dismissing it in the same manner. He picked up a third, slightly larger one. \u201cThree A.\u201d He concluded, this time placing it carefully in front of him as he fished another out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d David finally asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to find the strongest laser here.\u201d He said as he dismissed another smaller one to the side.  \u201cThat was a one, and I\u2019m assuming this one is too\u2026 yup.\u201d  He picked three larger objects out of the pile and angrily threw them at, rather than into, the discarded pile in frustration. \u201cThese aren\u2019t even optical so they are useless\u2026 fuck me David you\u2019ve brought a backpack full of the weakest assed lasers ever assembled. We\u2019d be better off ripping one out of a fucking DVD player!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sorry for not being able to judge a fucking laser on sight! Why the FUCK did you send me to get them if you\u2019re the fucking expert?\u201d David practically shouted back. His voice wasn\u2019t anywhere near as booming as it once was, but he was still far too loud. If anyone within earshot wasn\u2019t already looking at them, they were now.  \u201cHow do you know all this shit?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree minutes on Wikipedia! And they have their fucking class written on them, so basic numeracy also helps. I don\u2019t need piles of fucking textbooks!\u201d He angrily tore through the remaining pile of electronic paraphernalia. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you thought we would need all this shit for\u2026\u201d Fang trailed off as he eyed a long silver tube he had been overlooking until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully picked it up and studied the laser. It was completely unlike the others, it\u2019s long, relatively thin length seemed to thicken and thin in random steps. Instead of having small wire to plug into a battery, a single thick cord rand down from the back of the laser, ending in a large industrial looking electrical plug. \u201cDavid\u2026 I think this is weapons grade!\u201d he whispered excitedly. \u201cFuck me, we can\u2019t plug this into any normal outlet. But they wouldn\u2019t be packing this if they didn\u2019t have the socket back in the lab somewhere. We can find it once we\u2019ve assembled the rest of the gun!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s heart raced at the thought. If the power of the laser increased the charge\u2026 \u201cThere was an even bigger one burning a line through sheet metal in the lab...\u201d He said quietly to Fang, who returned a disturbing little smile. David suddenly shook his head. \u201cBut no, we can\u2019t go back there. Not for a while, at least. They almost caught me, they called in security. They\u2019d be all over that place now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit then.\u201d Fang said as he surveyed the eyes that they were attracting. \u201cOk\u2026 so here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do next. I\u2019m gonna take this 3A laser with a battery, and the crystals, and get this 3d model made. If that doesn\u2019t work then I\u2019ll find something else, we just need something to hold the components in place really. That can\u2019t be too difficult if worse comes to worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned and poked David on the chest. \u201cYou are going to source a strip of gold. The longer the better. The more pure the better. If you can, try and get it 24 carat. The instructions expressly state 24 carat, but we\u2019ll just have to make do with the best you can find. We\u2019ll meet back at the gym, at the head of the pool. I imagine they will come looking for us once these people pass on what they\u2019ve seen us doing here.  So be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grabbed the wolf\u2019s arm as he turned to leave. \u201cHow the fuck am I meant to find gold?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf violently tore his arm from David\u2019s grip. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know David! I\u2019m sorting out EVERYTHING else here! Try the chemistry storage, or just steal a fucking necklace off some rich bitch! Maybe yourself. Do you have any at home? A bitch like you must have plenty of jeweller y!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s tirade ended abruptly as he looked at the amulet in his hands. \u201cI wonder if this is gold\u2026\u201d he said as he studied it. \u201cThe chain was at least sort of yellowish. This is our Hail Mary. If you can\u2019t find anything then we\u2019ll have to try it with this. I\u2019ll be at the pool as quickly as I can. I\u2019d suggest you do the same, or I might start without you.\u201d Fang was already several feet away from David before he finished talking.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hurry up if you got a lead!\u201d snapped the wolf as he stalked off, focused on his mission. That left David all on his own, with one place to go \u2013 home. He felt nervous at the prospect of confronting Tyler again \u2013 especially when his bigger brother could so easily interrupt his plans with his ludicrous strength and size. There was no other choice, however, unless he wanted to beat people up for their jewellery \u2013 not something that was going to happen at 4\u2019 4\u201d. He scampered off, hoping to find an unsecured bike or something on campus to get his job done fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not, however, find a thing. Running as fast as his paws could take him, he saw his house as he made his approach down the street at high velocity.

The first thing he noticed when he streaked through the doorway was the scent \u2013 the raw, uncut scent of masculinity. Sweaty, jizz-soaked musk lingered in the air, forcing David\u2019s weary features into a disgusted scowl... and he thought Tyler was bad for this sort of shit before! Silently, the dragon padded into the living room, careful not to step on any discarded objects or creak any floorboards as he crept through the hallway. Not that he had to be too careful, though \u2013 as he got a little closer, he heard the deep bass of Tyler\u2019s pleasured rumblings, and the slick sound of skin on sweaty skin as Tyler (presumably) massaged his incredible length. Focusing, David quietly slipped into the living room, and made a beeline straight for the plaque on the coffee table. Long, thin, and most importantly, high purity, the plaque stood out amongst the paper, remote controls and gamepads sitting on the coffee table. He scooped it up, twisting it around in his hands to examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler Matthews, 1st place. Well, he had to be good for something, David guessed... beyond stealing his size and masturbating a lot, that is. A deep resentment bubbled up in his chest as he scowled at the plaque \u2013 he couldn\u2019t believe how awful Tyler was being. That necklace, this curse \u2013 it had turned him into a maniac. Sure, David could have just sat on his ass and sucked up everything Fang had to offer, but he didn\u2019t, right? He was better than that, wasn\u2019t he? He wasn\u2019t so sure \u2013 it had been awfully hard to stop. If Tyler had a large purple oppressor breathing down his neck, then he\u2019d surely be dashing around trying to solve problems too instead of enjoying himself... but he didn\u2019t, and therein lay the rub. Well, no point sitting around philosophizing \u2013 he had to get this back to Fang, but first, he needed to pry the gold off the wooden frame. He could just imagine the little wolf going ballistic when he returned the whole article to him, criticizing his every mistake in his shrill, annoying tone. He didn\u2019t need that, and so he retired to his room to dig out a screwdriver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments work and a successful stealth operation later, and David had a shiny slab of gold to his name. He took a moment to drag some old, old clothes out from under his bed, too \u2013 and most importantly, a belt. He punched a few holes in it with his tools, just to ensure its continued service in the face of utter shrinkage. All the while, he could hear Tyler rampaging downstairs, clearly enjoying himself far too much as he growled and snarled his pleasure, furniture creaking, groaning and clattering as he imposed himself on his room. Sighing in frustration, David began to leave, but couldn\u2019t stop himself from taking just one look through Tyler\u2019s open doorway, allowing himself to peer slightly around the door and into the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, fuck. That wasn\u2019t Tyler. That wasn\u2019t Tyler at all! David suppressed a gasp of shock as he witnessed the behemoth before him, huge, purple, and emanating sex. Every inch of his naked body was taut with bulging muscle, and every one of those muscles was swollen and defined with utter power, flexing and bending as Tyler roughly hammered away at his unimaginable cock. It was... unspeakable! Almost as big as he was, and even on Tyler\u2019s 14 foot frame, it was awe-inspiring. Tyler\u2019s thick, muscular paws were devoted to caressing every inch of that massive member, teasing the head, working the base, stroking the length \u2013 and as David looked around, shocked, he could see exactly how productive Tyler had been. The room was a total write-off, absolutely slathered in cum. The dragon was willing to bet that if he took a step on that ruined carpet it would audibly squelch under his paws! Looking back at the dragon he once called his brother, he could notice the change, even from before. He barely fit in his room, laying back awkwardly and pressing against the walls just to fit inside. He looked different \u2013 rougher. His horns were a little jagged, his teeth had a wicked, pointy sheen to them, and his hide seemed darker, thicker. Most notably was the change in his build \u2013 he was just <i>thick</i>. The titanic Tyler looked almost statuesque, with broad back and powerful musculature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as David watched, he felt his heart stop as he witnessed something...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David watched as Tyler\u2019s breathing became sharper. He emitted a deep desperate whimper as his eyes rolled backwards, looking to the heavens. His mouth opened wide, his ferocious teeth exposed as his lips parted in wild delight, his enormous tongue extended outwards as it curled back on itself. The purple dragon\u2019s chair sized testicles visibly tensed up hard as they injected their contents into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a deafeningly loud, low roar built up in the purple drake\u2019s throat, causing David to duck and cover his ears long before the crescendo reached its zenith. As loud as the deep roar was, the slow but powerful reverberations that permeated though the the floor, walls, ceiling David\u2019s meek body, suggested that an unimaginable amount of energy was spent on frequencies well below audible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake\u2019s toes furled and unfurled drastically as his feet pressed through the far plaster wall as if it wasn\u2019t there. It was only then that David noticed that almost half of the far actually wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t the first time his probing feet had made that penetration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler continued to work his epic cock roughly with his huge, powerful claws as he stretched his body out, the far wall bowing dangerously as he pushed his immeasurable bulk up against it. Unlike the wall at his feet, this wall lead outside, and the brick veneer seemed to be offering slightly better resistance, though a curve like that couldn\u2019t have been healthy.<br>\r\nDavid could trace Tyler\u2019s ejaculation as it rapidly made its way up his incredible shaft. It gathered pace as the ebony rod violently contoured itself, the spasms projecting the load up with incredible and increasing force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took four long seconds after Tyler\u2019s orgasm began for him to finally cum, the increasing logistics beginning to factor into the equation. But there was no doubt as to whether the purple behemoth minded, his elongated orgasm peaking as his seed finally entered the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of his thick, musky essence bursting forth could be heard over the drake\u2019s cry. It thundered into the wall behind his head like a firehose, the constant flow shattering on impact, ricocheting vast quantities of seed fast and far across the room in every direction. David watched in frozen horror as he saw a white torrent fly in his direction before he gathered enough sense to quickly dive out of the way. His movements were too slow to avoid a liberal coating, but quick enough to avoid the bath that flew out of the doorway after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave a loud, hopeless moan as he ejaculated a second wave. David picked himself up from the ground and disgustedly wiped as much of his brother\u2019s hot spunk off him as he could. More seed rained out of the doorway as he heard his brother cum a third time. David couldn\u2019t help himself. He peered around the doorway carefully, catching his Tyler\u2019s balls tense up again as he traced the fourth spurt climb up his brother\u2019s cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth spurt went directly into the ceiling, where the plaster gave a valiant if brief fight before raining down on the drake. The room was a mess of white as thick drops and ropes of seed rained down from the roof and walls, only to be quickly replaced as Tyler came a sixth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still his balls continued their cycle of tensing and releasing, sending jet after jet into the room, the purple drake almost reduced to tears as he continued to work his cock, moaning in an undignified primal delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t know if he should count the ninth or tenth time his brother came. His orgasm didn\u2019t seem to have a clear end, his wild throws blending in seamlessly with the renewed twitches and throbs of desire, the white spurting ejaculate fading into a clear flow of pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was licking the head of his cock playfully with his powerful tongue as his claws massaged and stroked his cock. His whole torso moved in a rhythm as his cock swayed in a kneading motion. It was a loving symphony of movement. Pre leaked out of his urethra at a constant and impressive pace, the fluid conjuring around the purple dragon\u2019s mouth as he worked the head with his whole face, his eyes bareley open, distantly focused on the shaft of meat he was already trying to unlock again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did David begin to feel the warm sensation of impending shrinking. His brother let out a deep approving rumble as he shared the experience, his face and hands not missing a beat as his brow furrowed in pleasure and his mouth broadened into a hungry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could see the dragon grow faster than the room around him. The purple dragon breathed deeply as his mighty heart beat faster. His hips thickened further on the carpet below him while his shoulders broadened against the increasingly impotent wall. His head inched higher as his tail and feet snaked further through the wall into the joining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis testicles swelled disproportionately bigger as they churned rhythmically, expanding to produce and house even more of the dragon\u2019s seed. David could also see his brother\u2019s scales visibly darken as they thickened; audibly popping against each other as they slowly grew shinier. The horns in his head broadened as they elongated, pressing hard into the wall behind him. David could also see a new horn begin to poke out from his thick angular chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole body loudly clicked and popped as it became even thicker still. While his length increased six inches, that didn\u2019t tell half the story. The purple dragon\u2019s mountainous chest heaved further and further out in all directions, hungrily taking the extra space that his broadening shoulders allowed. His tail thickened visibly, his hips expanding in vain as his thickening thighs and cock demanded ever more space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was over. David stared in horror at his brother. In many ways, he was beyond perfect. His unbelievable musculature heaved of his mammoth frame, his thick scaly skin spread taught against his contours, given no opportunity for shortcuts as it clung tightly to bare muscle and bone. If the ancient Gods were real, they would have that body.<br>\r\nBut the way Tyler hungrily licked and stroked his oversized cock, his heavy, needy breaths that struggled against the endless torrent of pre that almost threatened to drown him. The oversized, pulsating testicles that desperately yearned for release after increased release. The way Tyler\u2019s body was coated in his own hot, thick seed, the thick pools making their way slowly towards the edges of his body to flow into the sea below. Tyler was a monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t bother to test his brother\u2019s sentience as his movements quickly intensified with increased need, his rough, powerful tongue lapping up his fluids as it glided over every contour of his angry glans. The blue drake turned around and fled the house, realising that he had already wasted far too much time. His brothers hungry growls followed him out the door, the rumbles so deep and rough they sounded like giant concrete slabs dragging across each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it back to the campus as quickly as he could; knowing that another shrinking spurt was imminent. He caught up with Fang at the end of the pool as organised, the sight of the tiny black wolf sending a wave of relief over him.<br>\r\nHe heaved and panted as he stopped in front of the wolf, handing him the gold plaque.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang took it slowly. \u201cwhat is this?\u201d he asked flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid completely misread the wolf\u2019s tone. \u201cIt\u2019s one of Tyler\u2019s awards for being an exceptional nerd.\u201d He panted. He hadn\u2019t sweated this much before in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s fierce yellow eyes bore into David\u2019s. \u201cI said it needed to be thin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is thin dude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang barred his teeth. \u201cIts thin when I look at it like this\u2026\u201d he began with calm fury as he elevated the plaque to eye level between him and the drake, orienting it plaque parallel to the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s very, usefully thin. But when I look at it like this\u2026\u201d the wolf rotated the plaque to face David, \u201cITS AS THICK AS A FUCKING BRICK! \u201c The wolf shouted with unbridled fury. \u201cHow the FUCK am I meant to fit this into a ray gun David? What the FUCK is wrong with \u2013 oh, FUCK you David! Just fuck you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid angrily snarled as Fang ended his tirade, but the wolf\u2019s attention had already shifted to the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang lay the ray gun on its side, leaving it to face out over one of the steps in the pool\u2019s grandstand. He tore off the upper half of the gun\u2019s case, exposing the internal components. \u201cWe\u2019ll sort this mess out later; let\u2019s just see if this thing fucking works first.\u201d The wolf said as he placed the gold plaque flat on top of the crystals. \u201cThe instructions just said that they needed to be touching the gold. So now they\u2019re touching. Ok, now, I\u2019m going to stand here\u2026\u201d the wolf said as he stepped back from the gun, placing himself in front of the barrel. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to shoot me. Be careful though. Try and use your brain. Don\u2019t touch the gold, and don\u2019t move the gun in a way that would move any of its components. Just leave it flat and still on the step, and pull the fucking trigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy do you get to go first?\u201d he asked indignantly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got quite a fucking mouth on you, and I don\u2019t really feel much like doing you and favours right about now. Why shouldn\u2019t I just step in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf took an angry breath before suddenly smiling. \u201cYou want to go first?\u201d he asked as he approached the gun. \u201cWell then, too bad.\u201d He growled as he leant over the barrel, pulling the trigger himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ray blasted out against Fang, coating him in an old golden color for a moment, his entire form blindingly bright as the ray steadily pulsed into him. David had to look away, closing his eyes as he cursed under his breath for doing this. He obviously didn't want his brother doing what he was doing. He knew the stakes, knew what was going to happen if he didn't find a way to counteract his power hungry... well lets face it, 'eating' of them. But giving that counteracting power to Fang? Who knew what he was going to do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam steadily receded, and David looked back at him, his worried expression steadily moving to a frown as he saw Fang, very much at the same size, and looking furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TOLD you this wasn't going to fucking work! It needs to be -thin-.\" Fang grabbed the gold bar, and just squeezed... blinking as it cracked from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-... God dammit this isn't even real gold! Its gold plated you numbnut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was I supposed to know that it wasn't real gold? Its a trophy! Shit like that normally is right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang simply growled and grabbed his head, looking at himself worried, trying to see what the ray actually had done. \"God you are so fucking worthless David. Do you have any idea what you might have done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, that's why I'm fucking worried. That ray, besides your boneheaded mistake, was made to spec. Meaning it had to have done -something.-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just grimaced, sighing as he nods. \"Look dude I'm sorry-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang just grabbed David by the throat, pushing him back as much as his body could. Both of them were weaker than they had been, and what might have choked David before now simply caught him off guard as Fang overestimated his own strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look you stupid -FUCK-...\" Fang growled as he snapped at him. \"You dragged me into this little game your brother is playing on both of us, and I was hoping I could get out of it with this.  For once I expected something out of you, and it bit me in the ass. Now look at me. Who knows what other fucking magical bullshit you just gave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David you look fi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I do! But don't you think that's weird in and of itself? You saw the ray. It fucking worked! So where is the effect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blinked just then as he felt another one of Tyler's orgasms hit him. His eyes closed as he just sighed out loud. He could feel his body slowly fade off of him, inch by painful inch off of his four foot four frame. He felt himself go down to four feet, his own hands desperately trying to just grab his throbbing member as he grunted in frustration, his body flowing down to three feet five inches before he felt that power recede. With a gasp he opened his eyes... only to see Fang do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fuck... David did you just cum?\" Fang looked at him with incredulous eyes. David shook his head. It was obvious he hadn't, as he still was trying to keep his eager hands at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blinked as he realized that he was looking at Fang the same way he was before he shrank. \"Oh f-fuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang just growled, looking down at his shrunken form. \"You.... -idiot.-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look dude I'm so sorry I totally didn't mean t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang just tackled David, fangs bared as he finally had had enough \"You're liking this aren't you? You -want- your fucking brother to get fucking huge don't you? There is -no other reason- that a man like you can fuck up SO MANY TIMES in one day. You want his dick! Is that it? You want him to fuck us! Because now he's not only stealing size from you, but me! You know what that means right? He's getting fucking -bigger- while we are not even at square one! We've moved backwards you fucking moron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just winced, expecting Fang to throw punches, almost wanting it. He was right, he had fucked up big here. There one chance at coming back at him, and he had only made it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang I-... I know. Just lets get our heads together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No David, I'm done. I'm going to go over to your house right now and rip Tyler's dick off. And if that doesn't work, well you're going to have to deal with the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fang you can still give the amulet to someone else...\"</span></div></div>",

As he walked, he looked with disgust at his diminutive form. He would kill that arrogant dragon for doing this to him. Even as he fumed he felt himself begin to shrink once more. He gasped in surprise. \"That runt just fucking came\", he thought. \"No fucking stamina.\" Standing now at just over 2 feet, Fang quickened his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached Tyler's house, he began to hear something. A low, steady rumble emanating from somewhere ahead of him. He could see Tyler's house, just a few yards away. Suddenly, he felt a familiar sensation in his body, but that wasn't what made him stop dead in his tracks. The low rumble quickly built into a cacafonous deafening roar, and Tyler's hour erupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusk and cum poured from the windows and doors. The walls of the house began to cave in, and a limb made its way suddenly out of the wall facing Fang. It planted itself firmly on the ground, and as Fang watched, mouth agape,the fingers slowly extended even further, growing, swelling, tearing up the ground as they went. The roof of the house slowly began to rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangs viewpoint finally stopped striking, stopping at 1 foot 6. He instinctively took a step back, away from the catastrophic mass rising from the house in front of him. He watched in horror as it continued to rise. Tyler was absolutely massive. What Fang hadn't realized was that Tyler was as big as the house SITTING DOWN. He was gaining more than the size stolen from Fang and David. Much more. As Tyler pulled himself up free of the house, Fang saw what he had become. Tyler's body was rippling with muscle, although not excessively so. His form was lean, long arms and legs ending in powerful clawed hands and feet. His horns and grown long and curved, and his chest was incredibly defined and mighty. Fangs eyes travelled downward, past Tyler's chest, and came to rest on his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something to behold. Even for Tyler's 20 foot height, it was a monster. It was 15 feet long, thicker than a semi truck, and dripping with the remnants of his last load, which was now pouring over the road. It pulsed with size and power, and as Tyler's orgasm faded he looked down, his expression of pure bliss, and he saw Fang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth crept into a grin. His voice slowly rose to a thunderous boom. \"Hey there little guy\", he snarled, \" look how BIG you made me. And I'm going to keep getting bigger.\" His sentence ended with booming laughter, as his powerful hands wrapped around his penis. Fang looked in horror as Tyler's expression immediately became one of concentration, and he began stroking with purpose and lust. After just 6 strokes, Tyler's cock began to swell with cum...</span></div></div>",

Dang turned to see David, now just over a foot tall, sprinting towards him, holding something in his hand. Tyler seemed unaware of his brothers approach. \"Look at him, this is all your fault asshole\", growled Fang, \"you and that fucking pseudo gold trophy.\" \"That's the thing! I managed to find some real gold\", replied David, showing the device to Fang and holding out a large gold chain necklace. \"The hell did you get that\", asked Fang. \"Don't worry about that now\", said David, quickly fumbling with the machine, \"and I brought this too.\" And he held out the amulet for Fang to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them turned and looked up as Tyler moaned loudly, pre was pouring from his fifteen foot log cock onto the street. People were beginning to peel through doors and windows at the scene, some recoiling in disgust or fear, others looking longingly at the enourmous dragon's cock. Tyler had an expression of pure happiness on his face, and his breath was becoming labored and uneven. David looked back at Fang, \"We need to do this fast, quick, put this on and jack off!\" Fang looked at him for a moment, then, \"how am I supp...\" \"JUST DO IT\", David interjected forcefully, pushing the device, now affixed to the amulet, into Fangs hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang fumbled  with the chain, which was nearly the size of his body, lifting it up to put it over his head. \"When this is over, that little runt is going to pay.\"The thought of regaining his previous size made his cock begin to rise.  It was at that moment that Tyler could hold back no longer. With a roar that shook the neighborhood, Tyler came. Each shot of his load was impossibly voluminous. It crashed down on trees, cars, homes, observers, his potent seed covering everything. \"FANG! HURRY!\" Yelled David, already feeling the shrinking sensation pulsing through his body. Fang, the amulet draped on this shoulders, nearly scrapin the ground, began to stroke his dick as hard as he could, it was barely large enough to use his whole hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler roared as his orgasm continued. Then the growth began. Tyler's massive frame shuddered, then began to pulse and swell. Arms and legs lengthening,cock pushing out an inch further with every burst of cum that flowed through it. Watching the growth spurt was strangely erotic to Fang; to see that much power and pleasure was intoxicating. Within thirty seconds, as Tyler's orgasm still kept going, seemingly without end, Fang found himself on the edge. \"Just...a....few...more...strokes.... YES\", Fang exclaimed as he came. \"Fang! No!\" The panic in David's voice shocked Fang out of the pleasure of his orgasm. He looked down. Him and David were both about 6 inches tall. The amulet, being too large, had fallen from his neck and was lying on the ground as his load splattered uselessly ad pathetically next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot!\" Yelled David. Tyler's orgasm was tapering off, he was over 25 feet a tall, his cock stretched 18 feet straight in front of him. He looked down at his \"big\" brother and bully. His voice rattled nearby Windows as he spoke. \"I see you two have brought me a gift\" Tyler boomed. \"I'll take that.\" And with that, he reached down and plucked up the amulet between two of his colossal claws. His lean, scaled body quivered with anticipation. He raised the amulet to eye level, contemplating. Dang and David looked at each other, then back up at the hung behemoth. The entire street was quiet, cum soaked onlookers too terrified to move, fearing that any sound might draw the attention of the macro dragon. After another minute of staring, Tyler smiled slightly, and raised the amulet over his head. Realizing what he was about to do, David ran at his brother and began beating at his toes, yelling, \"No! No Tyler! Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tyler either didn't hear, or didn't care. He opened his maw and released the amulet. It disappeared from view between his mighty teeth. David could see his brother swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tyler arched his back and gave voice to a thunderous, powerful roar. His horns grew more jagged, his skin darkened to a dark violet. His huge penis swelled up with veins, and his huge balls doubled in size, swinging mightily, coming almost down to his knees. One of his hands wrapped around the top of his cock once more, and with one smooth, fluid motion, Tyler brought his hand down his whole length. That was all it took. This orgasm dwarfed his previous one. His newly filled balls sprayed gallon and gallons of cum to the end of the street. Tyler was in heaven, and in the heaves of his orgasm he felt something wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang, who had been backing away the entire time, noticing something unsettling begin to happen. He did not shrink. However, the few dozen pedestrians watching the show, did. They all slowly began shrinking inch by inch. Fang looked up at Tyler, who was paralyzed with overwhelming sexual pleasure. His height slowly began to increase, then accelerated. He grew to 26,27...30 feet. His cock grew even more, nearly catching up to his height at 25 feet. After a full 3 minutes of cumming, and at 40 feet tall, Tyler's orgasm ceased. Realizing what had happened, he grinned once more. \"Yes,\" he said to himself, panting in afterglow, \"I'm so big. I'M so big. I'm fucking huge. My cock is so massive...I need more.\" And involuntarily he seized his cock and jacked off with extreme force. He roared in utter dominance as he felt another orgasm approaching already. People were running, screaming, terrified, but the giant had no plans to stop. The power was intoxicating...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler lifted his hands off his colossal tool and surveyed the scene in front of him. His clawed toes dug into the concrete in the street due to his sheer weight. Everything for 150 feet around him was covered in his seed. He looked down at his 30 foot hard penis. It stood at attention, curved slightly upward, it's shadow falling over the barely visible figures of Fang and David beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head for clarity. This wasn't right, look at the the destruction. His house was in ruins. The street before him was in utter disarray. His cock began to soften in shake at what he had done. David watched his brothers dick shrink down to a diminutive 10 feet, swinging limply between his muscled thighs. Tyler bent down to look at David. \"I'm...I'm so sorry...\", he stammered. \"I don't know why I did thi-...\" His booming voice was cut off by a rumble in his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance of 100 feet, Famg saw Tyler's eyes spark, then watched as the irises began to flow with a dull gray light. He took a step back. Then another. Tyler looked at the people around him, cowering in fear. Fear of him. Fear of his power. He felt a stirring in his groin. His clock filled with blood unbelievably quickly, jutting out to its full 30 foot length.He caresses it with both hands, then spread his legs apart, each foot causing reverberation in the earth. Realizing what was happening, the now shrunken observers began to flee in earnest. Tyler began to stroke, massaging the car-sized head of his giant penis. He moaned at the heightened sensitivity. Stamina was not important now, he could just keep cumming and cumming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd cum he did. Within seconds his load was splattering onto the ground around him, each shot lasting full seconds as the cum travele the immense length of his cock brefore shooting onto the pavement. Tyler could hear the screams of fleeing tinies, and it made his orgasm all the sweeter. Tyler felt his form begin to swell up...and up... And up. He was no longer growing in inches. Tyler grew a full 20 feet during the course of his orgasm, his penis following suit, stretching longer and longer until it was 50 feet long and nearly 20 feet around, still dripping cum. His growth stopped again, and his muscles relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy should he regret this? He had had to be the small one his whole life! No more of that. No more living in the shadow of his big brother David...David....where did that pipsqueak go? Tyler looked down from his high vantage point, seeing now even smaller tinies running from the scene, most of which were now less than three feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid, meanwhile, was hiding behind a nearby house. He peered in the window to look for cover. Inside he saw a couple of people, they looked afraid but they were somehow still regular size. 'Maybe Tyler can only shrink people he sees...' Thought David. He peeked out around the wall of the house, which was his first mistake. Tyler's keen eyes immediately found him, and he ducked back behind the wall. Tyler laughter booked around the corner like thunder. \"There is no hiding from me!\" David then noticed a shadow fall over house. Looking up, he saw his brothers foot bearing down on the house. He rolled out of the way barely avoiding the dragons huge paw. The couple in the house were not so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt his foot break through the house, and thought he heard a faint scream as his foot made contact with the ground. Something else happened too. His claws lengthened, his muscles slightly bulged, and his cock twitched. Whatever he had just done, he liked it. But first things first. With David's hiding spot gone, Tyler has no problem plucking his brother up between his fingers. \"Tyler, you don't have to...AHHH\" Tuler didn't even let his 6 inch tall brother finish. He lifted him above his head and dropped him into his waiting maw. A feral growl left Tyler's throat. That felt SO good. Tyler swallowed. Immediately Tyler's balled swelled with incredible power. They dropped lower, almost coming to his knees, and there they bounced, full of cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did it. Tyler was the alpha male now. He was the biggest, the hottest, the most powerful. That thought alone triggered another orgasm for Tyler. He grew and grew. When he finished cumming, he was over 200 feet tall with a dick the same size. The orgasm did nothing to are his libido. Each blissful cumshot just made him hornier. He needed something to fuck.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler needed to keep growing. Sure he was big, but there were bigger things. Skyscrapers...sports arenas... So many things were sill bigger than him. His eyes dared around for a moment, glowing gray as they took in the scene. He had noticed during his last orgasm that everyone around him had shrunk, not just his now former brother and Fang. He had really enjoyed that. Unfortunately the people that had been here had evacuated the area, and he could only see maybe one or two faces peeking out from hiding spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople...When he had been small, any one of these furs would have cast him aside and scoffed at his puny form. Not anymore...these weren't people. They were size. Each little body held size for him to take. And he needed all the size he could get. Tyler had been absentmindedly stroking his 150 foot long cock up and down with his enormous paw while he pondered this, and his libido was such that he orgasmed again. While the river of cum shot from his penis, his view rising slightly thanks to the lingering observers, his gaze locked in te city skyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to saunter towards the flickering building lights, both hands still running up and down the shaft of his lengthening cock. He came 4 more times on the way, growing 30 additional feet thanks to the occasional passerby. His cock seemed to want to pass him in height, it was now 200 feet to his 230. Jerking off was becoming more difficult, but the sensitivity of his cock was so heightened that it didn't matter that he could only reach halfway down his immense shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally reached the edge of the city. He actually needs to look UP at some of the taller skyscrapers... But not for long. Tyler moaned thunderously as he felt himself about to come again. Thinking about his current situation, he had a thought. A wonderful thought. Tyler smiled to himself, then bent down and lowered his body to his knees. The sheer impact sent the earth shaking intensely. With both hands, Tyler aimed  his impossibly hard, long, and thick cock downward, toward a late cluster of buildings in the heavily populated urban downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurveying the area, Tyler could not see a single soul, presumably because tet were taking cover from the apparent earthquake that had just occurred. All the better.<br>\r\nTyler let loose, his eyes closing involuntarily as he enjoyed the pleasure that washed over him. After a full 4 minutes, his orgasm ended an his eyes opened. As he anticipated, the buildings had been washed away from the force of his cum, and in the vast sea of white, were roughly 800 people, all struggling in the sea, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...\" Said Tyler as he began caressing his cock, preparing. He had not grown after the last orgasm. But now he would make up for that. Upon hearing the thunderous proclamation, every person froze and looked up to see the largest penis attached to the largest dragon they'd every seen. \"GRAAAAAAAA\" Tyler screamed as the orgasm hit him, and he watched all the people. As they all began to shrink. And suddenly Typer felt better than he ever had before. He felt power, pleasure. Domination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms and legs burst out, his height skyrocketed. His penis was in charge now. It grew so much aster than the rest of his body, growing up, up, up into the air as it shot volley after volley of cum per the city, each blast large enough to easily fill a small lake.<br>\r\nUnlike his previously orgasm, this one didn't stop after 4 minutes, or 10... Or 20. Tyler's growth slowed, but didn't stop. He wa over 700 feet tall, with a pulsing cock that reached 800. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was still growing. Even though the insane pleasure of his orgasm, Tyler began to feel a building in his cock....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

David steps around the puddles of cum and climbs on the bed to try and physically stop Tyler but as soon as he touches Tyler's scales he finds himself grabbed in a massive hand and thrown out of the room, hitting his back painfully on the hallway wall. Realizing he can't stop the godlike dragon he goes to his room and begins plan B - if he can't stop Tyler he can at least make sure he lasts a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally apologizing to Fang, David unzips his oversized pants and begins to jack off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang ignores the looks of passers-by as he jogs into the football locker room. Placing the amulet onto a table in the center of the room he turns to leave but has an idea.

None of his clothes will fit him anymore and he steps out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Fang the floor vibrates and he hears thudding footsteps from the Football team returning to the locker room. He quickly runs under a bench as the big sweaty players come back and notice the new addition in the center of the room. They assume it is from their coach and take it in good spirit. One of the guys has an idea for getting them all inside the necklace and swaps the chain for one in his bag. Some of the guys say that it's cheating but eventually they all manage to get the amulet over their heads. Cheering at their success they all step out from the circle and begin to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the bench Fang is already starting to jack off in order to steal their height but he doesn't manage to get to climax before Tyler and David both orgasm back at home and he shrinks down from 12 inches to 6 and then down to nothingness.<br>\r\nBack at the house David has managed to keep his height stable as Tyler grows and realizes that after two orgasms each Fang is no more. At this point he is at a crossroads - try and get the raygun up and running or hope that Fang was successful and jack off again</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wolf\u2019s face contoured into a bizarre expression as the yellow beam hit him in the stomach at close range. His eyes were wide and focused intently on nothing. One side of his muzzle formed a sizeable sneer, while the other grimaced sourly. It almost looked like he had sucked a lemon while someone punched him in the guts. But he held the expression, as well as his pose, and continued to stand in front of the beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d David asked after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf nodded, but continued his vacant stare. His frail chest rose unevenly with his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched the wolf intently, looking for signs of him growing. There were one or two moments where he thought he could see some very, very small changes in his height, but he concluded that he was probably just imagining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty seconds passed in silence before David spoke up again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s working, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel something.\u201d Fang almost coughed his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnergy. Building.\u201d the wolf said quickly and forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that good?\u201d David asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s eyes widened further, and revealed more of his clenched teeth. \u201cHow the fuck\u2026\u201d he paused painfully as he spoke through his clenched jaw. \u201cwould I know\u2026 what it\u2019s meant\u2026 to feel like?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled. \u201cWell I think we can say what it\u2019s meant to LOOK like. It\u2019s meant to LOOK like you\u2019re getting bigger. You aren\u2019t. It\u2019s not working.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf snarled as he shook his head once. \u201cLike you\u2019d\u2026 fucking know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waited in silence after that. David could feel the seconds pass, thinking of his brother back home. There were no prizes for guessing what he was still doing while he wasted time indulging the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang moaned urgently as he let go of the gun. David leaned forwards as the wolf stepped back, looking at his paws as he shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf just shook in silence, growling softly as he panted. He bore his teeth in a painful snarl and closed his eyes, cocking his head towards the sky as he clenched his fists in front of him. David stared wide eyed as a light grey line seemed to draw its way up the wolf\u2019s neck, coming up from his sternum under from his baggy yellow shirt. The line trailed up his throat and jaw, then split up his nose and continued up over his forehead. By the time it was over, the black wolf had a silver streak running up the middle of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf yelped as his pelvis seemed to widen under his shirt. David smiled excitedly at the development, but it was quickly apparent that something wasn\u2019t right at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey line started to thicken. It didn\u2019t spread out across his pelt. The line simply thickened, adding more wolf between what was already there. David could see the space between Fang\u2019s clavicles widen. The same thing was happening up his face, as the wolf\u2019s nose and jaw began to broaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s shoulders inched further apart from each other under his shirt, stretching the fabric taught. David could see the wolf\u2019s flat chest define itself through the fabric, each pectorial sat an alarming and widening distance from the other. A third nostril appeared in the middle of the wolf\u2019s nose as his eyes opened, and Fang cried out in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throat seemed to split in two as his neck widened further in a burst. Fang\u2019s voice took on a horrific quality as his voice box split, the wolf\u2019s cries sounding like they were being made by two people in perfect unison. David recoiled and bit his hand absent-mindedly as he saw a gimpy grey leg drop down from the bottom on the wolf\u2019s shirt, the toes splitting from each other as it swung itself limply to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nightmarish vision, far more horrifying than anything David had seen in a movie. The wolf\u2019s jaw continued to separate, and for a brief time four vicious canines along his unnaturally long and symmetrical muzzle. Then his nose and jaw began to recede down the middle as his face split into two. The wolf\u2019s thickening neck became constrained along the shirt\u2019s collar, and the wolf\u2019s cries soon turned into wet choking noises, a deeply forked tongue flailed wildly in his two muzzles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four legged wolf began to tear the seams of his yellow shirt as a single row of four separate pectorals stretched it beyond breaking point. David could see a new shoulder forming in the middle of the wolf, spawning another gimpy hand that tented the fabric as it grew downwards. The yellow shirt finally tore in half, revealing two black bodies that flailed and joined at the neck, the shirt\u2019s collar still in one piece as it choked the wolf. Four hands scratched desperately at the elastic as the heads began to separate, four wild eyes gaping sharply downwards, trying to see the collar that choked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the collar ripped in half and two separate wolves fell in opposite directions. They scrambled themselves up as they sucked in air desperately. They looked at each other in disbelief. David sat frozen, unaware that he was biting his own hands with so much force that he was drawing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolves eyed each other in silence, and began shaking their heads almost at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe both have full memories and think we are the original, don\u2019t we?\u201d one of them asked as he panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d The other replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d The first wolf shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d The other wolf agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT THE FUCK?!\u201d David loudly erupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth wolves scowled and turned sharply to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to understand?\u201d one asked. \u201cGet over it!\u201d the other finished as soon as the first had finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart pounded harder as the now terrifying warmth started to spread through him. He moaned out helplessly as his form started to recede once more, his shrinking cock hardening under his the shirt that draped around him. His pants slipped off slowly as his the world around him grew. It was a familiar experience, but as he got smaller, the shrinking spurts seemed to become more acute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it stopped, he was three foot four. After all of today\u2019s running around, he was back to where he woke up. The two tiny wolves were starting to look like mere midgets to David, their heads reaching his sternum. He whined as he trembled. Time was running out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth wolfs were sneering contemptuously at the drake. \u201cYep.\u201d The both said at once. \u201cI knew you\u2019d fucking cry.\u201d One of them said to David. \u201cWhat a fucking bitch.\u201d The other said disgustedly. David\u2019s eyes darted from one wolf to the other as they traded insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t fucking think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should just cry in a corner and let me handle this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet this isn\u2019t even gold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just saw something yellow and assumed it was gold didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a fucking moron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fucking think!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYou just fucking cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHIT THE FUCK UP!!\u201d David roared as he clasped his forehead. The stress was too much. His brother, the wolves, the shrinking, the failure, the constant feeling of his own existence slipping helplessly through his fingers. Was he having a breakdown? Was he even still sane? Maybe none of this was happening, surely this was dream. He trembled violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves sneered at him in unison as they picked themselves up and approached the ray gun. One of them grabbed the piece of gold, the other removed a crystal from the case under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fang that held the piece of gold tried to bend it in his fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is gold. I can\u2019t bend it.\u201d The other wolf grunted as he carried the crystal to the pool. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the crystals. David, go with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, Come with me.\u201d The gold holding fang said at the exact same time. Neither Fang seemed particularly concerned by the eerie unison of their identical instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid bit his lip.</span></div></div>",

He scrambled back up, and tried to quickly fold the long cuffs up, but the pants were far too lose and kept slipping down everywhere. He let out an angry growl as he kicked them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf hadn\u2019t waited for him, and he had a long way to run and catch up. His lose shirt almost dragged on the ground with each step. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo get some real gold.\u201d Fang replied flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid followed the wolf in silence as they walked across the campus. He felt the stares from those they passed. He heard their startled comments. The two of them were biological freaks, way smaller than any midget, with normal proportions. They were the fauna equivalents of bonsai trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if the wolf felt any stigma with his form, he wasn\u2019t showing it. His brisk gait was like the Fang of old, full of confidence and purpose. He didn\u2019t seem to care if anyone saw his tiny, naked body. He had his own goal to achieve, and the wold could do as they please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid wished that he could have the same attitude. He was embarrassed at his state, and was constantly fearful that someone would recognise him. \u201cSo, um\u2026 \u201c David began nervously. \u201cDo you know what went wrong back there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Fang replied flatly. \u201cThe ray will do different things if you align the crystals differently or use different metals to connect them. I\u2019m confident I got it right. That means you must have fucked up with the metal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rolled his eyes. \u201cWell where was I meant to get Gold from? That plate looked gold, how was I meant to know better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf sneered to himself. \u201cI suggested the chemistry lockup. I bet you didn\u2019t even try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell how was I meant to get in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shrugged. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll find that out soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in silence the rest of the way. They walked across paths until they got to the science buildings, and then up stairs and down hallways until they reached the chemistry faculty. All the way they passed gawking onlookers. David pointedly kept his gaze on the path ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis must be it.\u201d The wolf finally said as he eyed a wall in the hallway. Windows started half way up the wall, peering into what must have been a laboratory. Neither could confirm this, however, as the windows started well above their eye levels. The wolf lead David to a door. It was closed and looked fairly solid. A magnetic card reader was positioned ominously next to the handle. \u201cTry and open it.\u201d Fang instructed David, himself too short to reach the handle without jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid reached up and grabbed the handle. It didn\u2019t budge. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking locked!\u201d David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down princess.\u201d The wolf said as he looked around. The hallway was empty. \u201cLift me up. I want to see inside.\u201d <br>\r\nDavid hoisted the wolf up the wall, allowing Fang to comfortably look through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one in there.\u201d He said after a moment. \u201cThere's an open doorway out back. That must be where they store their supplies. So if we can just get through here\u2026\u201d The wolf trailed off as he inspected the window. \u201cI don\u2019t think this connected to any security systems.\u201d He said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, are you planning on breaking the glass?\u201d David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any better ideas?\u201d the wolf demanded down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed and shook his head. \u201cWell, how are we going to do that?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent a few minutes scouting the empty hallways, and managed to source a lose hammer from a fire alarm box. David hoisted the wolf back up to the window, and Fang started to beat the glass with the hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made a loud noise, but achieved little else. After about ten strikes, Fang gave up with a snarl. \u201cI\u2019m not strong enough.\u201d He said, perhaps for the first time in his adult life. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to try it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I going to reach up there?\u201d David asked as he let the wolf back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll lift you up.\u201d He replied simply, cupping his hands expectantly for David to get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re stron\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust get on my fucking hands!\u201d The wolf snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed and stepped onto Fang. He was reluctant to put all of his bodyweight onto the wolf\u2019s hands, but he slowly stepped up. To his surprise, Fang seemed to be able to handle him with apparent ease, and David was able to crawl up the wall to the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmash the shit out of it.\u201d The wolf instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t need the instructions, and felt a twinge of annoyance rise within him at Fang\u2019s micro management. But he sucked it up again, and belted the glass with all of his remaining strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third strike, a crack appeared in the glass. \u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d he said excitedly. The wolf grunted in response as he kept hitting the window. The cracks grew and multiplied, and soon the metal hammer pierced a small hole in the glass. From there, it was just a matter of David widening the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, I can fit through that.\u201d The wolf instructed, and immediately dropped David. He stumbled as he hit the floor, but the impact didn\u2019t hurt and he didn\u2019t lose his balance. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking drop me without any warning!\u201d he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust lift me back up, you can cry about it once I\u2019m inside.\u201d The wolf demanded. David scowled at fang a moment before he reluctantly obliged. The wolf crawled out of his hands and carefully through the hole in the broken glass, eventually slipping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card reader beeped shortly after that as the handle was suddenly thrown down. The door didn\u2019t open, so David grabbed the handle, and with disconcerting amount of effort, managed to get the thick door open. The wolf dropped down from the inside handle as it swung open, and David slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang lead David through a maze of workbenches and sinks, into a dark room out the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLift me up so I can turn the lights on.\u201d Fang instructed. David eyed the switch. He ignored the wolf, and instead got onto the tips of his toes and stretched up to it, flicking the lights on. The wolf stared at David before giving a dismissive grunt and began looking around the storeroom. David smiled. He\u2019d take the small victories. Nothing much else seemed to be going his way today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his heart sank as he looked around the storeroom. Put simply, it was a mess. Large cabinets, tubs, draws, shelves and cupboards were placed seemingly at random across the room. It would have been large at full size, but it loomed ominously over the pair now. Finding gold in here would be like finding a needle in a haystack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe yellow cards have letters and numbers on them.\u201d Fang observed. David looked around. He was right. Little yellow rectangles were placed everywhere and on everything. \u201cDo you know what the letters and number is for gold?\u201d Fang asked David. He scoffed to himself before the drake could answer. \u201cI\u2019ll look around. Go and find one of those chart things they always have in science labs. Find gold on it, and tell me what its letters and numbers are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grimaced. He couldn\u2019t really take offense to that, he really had no idea what anything on a periodic table said from memory. He sighed and went back out in the lab. There were several such charts plastered on the walls. He climbed up onto a workbench to read one. Damn it, this thing was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d fang demanded from the storeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking, there\u2019s like hundreds of little squares to look through!\u201d David snapped back. Was gold even on here? \u201cHere it is!\u201d He suddenly cried out excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s Au.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the number?\u201d Fang called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s two numbers on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d he demanded, his tone thick with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeventy nine and one hundred and nintety six point nine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, seventy nine is the one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid climbed down off the bench and re-joined the wolf in the storeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere.\u201d The wolf said when he was standing next to him, pointing at a metal draw. A yellow card was placed on it and read \u201979 Au\u2019. Unfortunately, it was on a single narrow draw that was closed, a keyhole featuring prominently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s locked.\u201d David pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks David.\u201d Fang replied flatly. \u201clift me up, I might be able to put my hand in the top there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid saw what the wold was referring to. The top of the draw bowed slightly downwards, allowing for fingers to purchase it. It was a very narrow slit, and David sceptically compared the size of it to the wolf\u2019s limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday, David.\u201d Fang demanded. The drake sighed and lifted the wolf up again. He fumbled around for a moment before hitting it with his paw \u201cFuck, no it\u2019s too small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let the wolf down. \u201cHey Fang\u2026\u201d he began awkwardly, choosing his words carefully. \u201cDon\u2019t lose you shit when I say this\u2026 but what if I made you smaller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s eyes sparked as his canines became more visible. \u201cThink about it! If your hand was thinner, then you\u2019d be able to put it in and get some gold. Once we have that, then we can grow you straight back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf thought a moment before raising an eyebrow. \u201cOr we can just wait for Tyler to make YOU small enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t have time for that! By then, it could be too late for me! We have control over how you shrink, but I can\u2019t stop Tyler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scowled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David watched the wolf stride purposefully out of the library, his tiny frame almost overloaded with the items he was carrying. Damn it, Fang was good at this. And he was also good at not giving David any breathing space whatsoever. It didn\u2019t seem to matter how ridiculous the circumstances, Fang had definitely taken the lead on today and asserted himself as the alpha male, much to David\u2019s distaste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now he was meant to find gold. The only thing David knew about gold was that it was hard to find. He knew that 24 carat meant pure gold, but he had no idea what anything else meant, or what exactly made gold impure. Did gold become impure over time? Should he try and find newer gold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasted precious moments searching his mind. He couldn\u2019t think of any gold sources, pure or not, new or old, real or fake. The chicks he\u2026 regularly spent time with\u2026 mainly didn\u2019t have any gold jewellery, at least so far as he could recall. Though admittedly, they could have probably hung a solid nugget of it in front of those jiggling titties without him noticing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rush of blood flashed to his cock at the thought. He was acutely aware that he hadn\u2019t cum in hours after several starts, and he was having a serious case of the blue balls. Fuck, concentrate. Once this was over, he promised himself that he would find someone to make a mess of. But in the meantime, he had hopefully one final task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind opened up when he remembered that Markus always wore a gold ring. His \u2018bling\u2019 he would call it as he showed it off, usually in some pathetic attempt to get some attention. It wouldn\u2019t have surprised David if the thing was made of plastic, but it was literally the only thing that had come to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing dogged him though. Fang had specified a strip of gold\u2026 a ring wasn\u2019t really a strip. Could it still work? How was it meant to be applied? But fang had long since left the library. There was no one to field such questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck it, I\u2019ll look myself!\u201d David said as he turned the computer Fang had been working. He sorted through Fang\u2019s browser tabs, stopping on a blog called \u201cMy custom biotic sale ray tool suitable for applicationing in solutions of agriculture and horticulture industry. \u201c David scrolled down the page, looking at the instructional pictures on assembling the gun. This was it. He looked for the part which talked about gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about two minutes he sped read, getting to the bottom of the page without finding it. Frustrated, he started again from the top, fighting his instincts which were screaming at him to hurry up. But the few additional minutes of more carefully sifting through the poorly translated blog yielded nothing. He had reached the end of the post. Now he was certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mention of Gold anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re fucking kidding me!\u201d David said to himself as he felt a sickness settle on his stomach. Fang didn\u2019t need any gold, did he? That meant\u2026  That meant that he had just let the fucker walk out holding everything he needed to make the size ray on his own. He\u2019d been played. Who knew what Fang was up to right now while David was distracted, running around on an impossible errand\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking TRAITOR!\u201d David roared in his heightened pitch, practically jumping out of the chair as he turned to chase after the wolf. He froze immediately as he saw a hulking Rottweiler striding purposefully towards him. His black collared shirt and long belted pants made him instantly recognisable as campus security. He waved two fingers in an authoritative gesture, instructing the blue Drake to approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog was huge, and not just from David\u2019s low perspective.  David frantically shifted his gaze between the security officer, the pile of stolen texts and electronics still splayed across the table, and the small crowd of onlookers.<br>\r\nHe bolted. Or tried, at least. He turned, managing to take three stumbled steps before losing his balance, tripping over his enlarged black pants. Panicked, he wildly kicked them down his thighs and off his feet before taking off again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d the Rottweiler barked savagely after him, the loud and deep outburst sending reverberations through the Library\u2019s expanse and up David\u2019s spine. He could hear the guard chasing him, his large paws thudding loud and evenly has he moved his bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s shirt flapped behind him like a cape.  He could feel it slowing him down, the fabric acting like a mini parachute. It was also giving the guard something to grab as he closed the distance. David was not hesitant as he wildly tore it off over his neck, discarding it frantically; his cobalt body was naked but free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rottwiler\u2019s strides were long and steady as he chased the drake up the stairs onto the first floor. David didn\u2019t know where he was going; the library wasn\u2019t exactly familiar turf. He had no plan as dove through rows of bookshelves, the movements more desperate than strategic. And all the while, the guard\u2019s panting breath growing closer as he steadily made ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid ran towards the first exit he spotted, a rather small plain, single auxiliary door. It was mostly hardwood, with a single small window that pooled into the library, indicating it lead somewhere outside. David invested almost all of the remaining distance from his pursuer getting it open. Everything was different at this height. The handle was almost eyelevel, making leverage more difficult. The bulk itself was heavier, and the metallic door closer offered more resistance. <br>\r\nHe barely slid out of the Rottweiler\u2019s grip as he felt the massive paw contact his back scales as he squeezed into the daylight, finding himself on a narrow little elevated footbridge that lead up and left into another building. The Hulking canine burst out behind him not half a breath later. This was it, David thought through grimly panic. He couldn\u2019t outrun the guard from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one smooth movement, David Vaulted over the guardrail.  He hadn\u2019t looked to see what was beneath him. It was simply the final desperate act of a drake that had everything to lose. He heard the surprised grunt of the guard behind him as he found himself suddenly airborne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was falling. It was only the first floor, but it was a high first floor. Below him was a paved path maybe about fifteen feet below his falling toes. Time seemed to slow as he felt the rush of acceleration as gravity took hold. He held his breath as the path rushed up at him, a howl of rushing wind growing in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one on the path saw him until he hit the pavement with a slap, rather than a thud. He landed feet-first, trying to transfer his weight onto his hands as best as he could. The world flashed white. He was vaguely aware of himself bouncing as he felt another one or two impacts, blending into several rolls before finally stopping face-first on the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear the startled shouts of onlookers as he lay winded and gazed, but otherwise conscious on the path. His body ached furiously everywhere, the sensations too overwhelming to immediately identify any sources.  He just knew that everything hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later he felt a warm furry hand on his shoulder, shaking him lightly \u201cOh my god, are you alright?!\u201d a female voice asked in shock. David groaned weakly as he fought for air, but his lungs weren\u2019t yet ready to budge. David moved his weak muscles feebly as she helped him onto his back. \u201clook at me\u201d she said, slapping his face softly a few times. \u201cLook at me, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at the vixen helping him. His heart was thumping desperately from his panic, shock, and physical exhaustion. But his lungs would only allow small slivers of air in. He gaped wide as he cycled short, sharp breaths. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d the vixen asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grunted as he nodded shallowly. The fox helped him slowly to his feet. Actually, he was doing alright, considering. He just fell from a significant height onto a hard surface, and de didn\u2019t seem to have any broken bones. He gently probed his ribs. \u201cI\u2019ll be..\u201d David gasped \u201cFine. \u201c \u201c\u2026thanks.\u201d He said sheepishly to the girl. Sure, he was scuffed and bruised pretty badly, but nothing was broken. Perhaps physics worked a little differently now he was smaller, perhaps he didn\u2019t have the mass to break his own bones from that sort of momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat on Earth were you doing?\u201d the fox asked, her tone suddenly shifting to concerned rebuke. \u201cAnd why are you naked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid suddenly blushed through his pain. Shit. He reflexively slapped his hands over his groin, cupping his rather unimpressive equipment has he looked away from the vixen in embarrassment. \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d he mumbled foolishly. He was suddenly acutely aware of the other eyes that he was attracting. He looked back up at the footbridge. Fuck, that thing looked high. The Rottweiler stood looking down over him, talking rather calmly on a hand radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d David cried as he felt a small welling of panic spark up again. He turned to the vixen. \u201cListen, thanks for your help. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I\u2019ve gotta go\u2026\u201d David trailed off as he felt the all too familiar warmth well up in him again. \u201coh SHIT!\u201d he cried with more purpose as he felt his cock suddenly fill his cupped grip, fighting against his resistance with external force and internal desire. He felt himself start to shrink again, in a rather public arena.</span></div></div>",

He stretched his massive tree-trunk legs, enormous foot paws flexing.  David stared at those thick, splayed toes and nervously wondered if his brother might be lying to him again about wanting to take the amulet back.  He growled weakly and backed away, gesturing to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-if we\u2019re gonna bring that amulet back, we\u2019d better do it sooner rather than later!  That way I can get back to normal as soon as possible!\u201d  He cried out, desperate to be sure that his brother was on the same page with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked and rose up, having to bend his knees and bend over considerably to avoid hitting his head on their ceiling, \u201cYeah yeah, calm down you whiny little runt\u2026\u201d  He snickered, quite enjoying getting on his shrunken brother\u2019s nerves.  He could just see the rage and embarrassment building every time he used a new nickname, that little face twisting with malcontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler giggled as he got his bearings in his much smaller looking room, happily running his fingers against the ceiling, enjoying how cramped he felt due to his size.  He growled playfully and stepped forward, bringing his 2-foot long footpaw down just in front of his brother, toeclaws digging into the carpet, \u201cGet outta my way, will ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let out a shrill yelp and bolted, stumbling over his own feet and nearly slamming into the doorframe.  He quickly ran ahead of Tyler, before turning and growling once more, now that there was some distance, \u201cStop playing around!  You had your fun, but now it\u2019s time to fix this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chuckled deeply, grunting as he pushed his thick body through the little doorframe, \u201cOh shut up, we\u2019re gonna fix it\u2026eventually\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, eventually!?  We\u2019re fixing this TODAY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, with an attitude like that I might have to keep your size to myself for longer\u2026\u201d He grinned toothily, stepping forward again.  He tromped slowly toward the pint-sized drake, his heavy shaft bobbing and smacking loudly against his muscular thighs.  Large drops of precum were flung in every direction as he did this, the drake\u2019s virility obviously much higher at his new size.  David merely stumbled back, staring up at his brother\u2019s looming back, feeling quite tiny whenever that heavy shaft swung.  He could imagine that one smack from a Tyler\u2019s cock would floor him, and that was enough motivation for him to stay well ahead of the towering drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler paused in the middle of the hallway, having been ready to turn into the living room.  He glanced down at himself and let out a deep, amused chuckle, \u201cPerhaps I should take a cold shower and put something on\u2026\u201d  He smirked at his tiny brother, \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026your baggiest shorts juuust might be big enough to double as skintight shorts for me, don\u2019t you think?  Though I dunno\u2026\u201d  He hefted his heavy shaft, \u201cYou never had a monster like this to stuff into your shorts, I might have a problem!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blushed deeply, skin turning a deeper blue, \u201cJ-just do whatever you have to, as long as it gets us closer to fixing this problem!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chuckled and simply stepped over his brother, making a show of slamming his foot paws as he walked along, his thick tail nearly slamming against his miniature brother, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what I can scrounge up, David\u2026But you know\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to look over his shoulder at his brother, \u201cYou know if I can\u2019t find anything to wear that you\u2019re gonna have to go by yourself to the shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes widened at his brother\u2019s smug tone.  Go to the shop by himself?  At three feet tall!?  He couldn\u2019t imagine surviving a trip like that; he imagined that even the mere humiliation of it would kill him!  The drake quickly ran down the hall, ducking between his brother\u2019s legs to get into his room, \u201cOh no, we\u2019re gonna find you something to wear.  I refuse to go alone!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rumbled his amusement and squeezed his way into his brother\u2019s room.  He plopped down in the middle of the floor, his meaty rump slamming to the carpet with enough force to make David stumble slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on then, pipsqueak.  Find me something to wear\u2026\u201d  He chuckled and idly stroked himself, purring thunderously, \u201cBecause if you can\u2019t, I\u2019ll have to send you along by yourself\u2026With a note pinned to you chest!\u201d  He burst out laughing, pounding his meaty fists against the carpet, \u201cGet it, because everyone\u2019s gonna think you\u2019re a kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blushed and growled, quickly rummaging through his closet \u2013 with great effort, at his size, much to his brother\u2019s amusement \u2013 trying to find something his massive brother could wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes David succeed, or will he have to go alone?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c...dickhead, tyrant, douchebag.\u201d grumbled the little blue lizard as he slammed his bedroom door behind him, pattering over to the closet as he anxiously searched for clothes that Tyler might be able to fit into. David knew the importance of looking good, so at the very least he had a wide range of clothes to choose from, from tight jeans designed to show off his impressive musculature, to vests and shirts that clung sensuously to his rippling upper body... ah. He was starting to see a pattern here. The dragon cursed under his breath as he ripped clothes from the closet, scattering them across the floor as he tried to find something that might work. Jeans were too inflexible \u2013 those titanic thighs Tyler was packing would shred right through the denim, and he would no doubt do it on purpose to show off his starkly dominant form. David retained a glimmer of hope that this would all be sorted out \u2013 he wasn\u2019t a fan of the new Tyler, and he did like those jeans, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he picked out useless clothes \u2013 while they looked great on him, Tyler\u2019s 9\u2019 3\u2019\u2019 physique would be far too much for most of them. A few potential candidates revealed themselves in the search \u2013 baggy workout clothes a little too big for him, or at least too big for him back when he was a more reasonable size. He threw them on his bed as he continued looking, finding vests buried at the bottom of his closet that might fit the bill, stretched as they were by his flexing and posing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the dragon bundled his meagre offerings in his weedy arms, struggling to see under the pile of various fabrics as he tottered back into Tyler\u2019s room. The air was rich with the scent of the bigger dragon\u2019s musk and sweat, and as David dumped the clothes onto the floor he caught Tyler absently playing with his weighty draconic rod, his claws tracing patterns in the throbbing meat as he grinned vacantly, breathing heavily with pleasure evident in his eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cTyler!\u201d snapped David, pouting with hands on his hips as he leered angrily at his brother. <br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t have taken so long.\u201d replied the purple behemoth with a breathy sigh, clearly enjoying himself. \u201cSo what are these supposed to be? Did you get these when you were five, or something?\u201d he asked, poking through the assorted pants and shorts with superiority plastered all over his grinning snout, sharp teeth comprising a wicked smile. \u201cWell, I better try them on, no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched in horror as Tyler took his largest, baggiest pair of sweatpants and held them up against his massive frame. There was no way they\u2019d fit, especially not with that... monster drooling all over the bedroom carpet, an occasional drop of pre slowly dripping from the substantial length. Tyler slowly put one leg into the sweatpants, looking down at his \u201clittle\u201d brother as he pulled them up.<br>\r\n \u201cWhat, you\u2019re not offering to help? Your loss.\u201d he said with a grin, shoving another thick, muscular calf into the pants as he began dragging them slowly up his gargantuan frame. They barely got halfway up before the waistband snagged on his heavy sac, Tyler licking his lips as he enjoyed the sensation of the fabric rubbing up against his weighty balls.<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm... almost there, I think. Just one... more... tug!\u201d With a jerk of his muscular purple arms, the sweatpants began straining with effort, the slick pre from Tyler\u2019s incredible length providing much needed lubrication and deeply staining the fabric. As the dragon kept pulling, the sweatpants tore themselves to pieces, unable to cope with his incredibly defined thighs and the sheer bulk of his cock. A shiver of pleasure ran down the titan\u2019s spine as David looked on, despairing. If he couldn\u2019t fit into those...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how awful. I hope those weren\u2019t your favourites.\u201d said Tyler, grinning. \u201cBut I have an idea, so come on, small fry!\u201d With a flick of his wrist, Tyler deposited the ruined clothing directly onto his smaller blue counterpart, a particularly sticky stain landing on the poor dragon\u2019s snout and overwhelming him with the reek of sex. Angrily, David tore the tattered and torn rags from his face, just in time to be bowled over by Tyler\u2019s massive paws. The purple paws effortlessly displaced his insignificant mass as he snarled and cursed, winded by the impact. <br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t see you there, runt. Better watch out when a big guy is coming through.\u201d Tyler remarked, almost purring with pleasure as he stomped down the hallway, savouring the impact of each heavy step. David picked himself up and brushed himself off, growling to himself as he scampered after his bigger brother. <br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going, Tyler? Look, there isn\u2019t anything bigger in my room...\u201d David whined, trying to peer around Tyler\u2019s muscular mass to see what he was up to. The bigger dragon squeezed into David\u2019s room and made a beeline for the curtains, effortlessly tearing them from the rail with powerful claws. He draped the silky material around his heavy form, turning to display his sculpted, muscular buttocks, squatting down on bulging haunches to bring himself down to his brother\u2019s level. <br>\r\n\u201cTie me up, shorty.\u201d With a deep blue blush, David tentatively took the curtains and put a knot in them, small hands working deftly with the muscle memory of a professional. He couldn\u2019t help but admire the definition of his brother\u2019s musculature while he was so close, though \u2013 he couldn\u2019t have ever dreamed he himself would be so huge!<br>\r\n\u201cD...done.\u201d stammered the little dragon, intimidated by his proximity to his colossal brother, who promptly turned around to reveal a significant bulge sticking from the silky fabric. The material ran down to his calves, but the sheer bulk of his cock pushed out to create an imposing tent that would no doubt turn heads as he walked down the street.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well. It\u2019ll have to do.\u201d he murmured, growling with pleasure as he patted his weighty member. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch that!\u201d snapped David, worrying for a moment that he might lose even more size. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re dressed, we can go now...\u201d he added with a whine, looking up with pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...almost.\u201d said Tyler with a purr, as he took something from the floor \u2013 a t-shirt. One of David\u2019s. One of David\u2019s favourites. One that he had picked up at one of the best concerts he had ever seen. The titan squeezed it over his head as David looked on with shock, the shirt straining as Tyler pulled it over sculpted purple pectorals and promptly ripped through the armholes with muscular biceps. The shirt was suffering a distinct lack of structural integrity as Tyler flexed his way into it, wrapped tightly around well-defined abdominals and just waiting for an excuse to burst open.<br>\r\n\u201cThere! Now we can leave.\u201d Tyler left the room carefully, trying to stop the t-shirt from self-destructing over his incredible physique as he stomped over to the front door, tightly bound in fabrics that threatened to snap at any moment. Sighing with frustration and jealousy, David jogged after him, eager to get to the antique shop and deal with the problem once and for all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David Grumbled and growled underneath his breath as he started sorting through his closet to try to find something for his behemothian brother to wear. It wasn't fair... it wasn't right. Hell, he was still having trouble totally convincing himself it was actually real! How was something like this even possible...?! He was doing his best to try to keep his mind on the task at hand rather than dwell on his demeaning situation... but it was kind of hard to keep his mind from constantly drifting back to all the size that he had lost... or to the thought of that giant version of his brother sitting in the living room stark naked, probably getting off to what he had done to David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way that jeans would work. They were snug on David when he was normal size (To show off his muscular legs and plump tush), and Denim wasn't known for its stretchiness.. most of his workout shorts he, himself, had already outgrown. And he gave up very quickly on even bothering trying to find a shirt for Tyler to wear. Some kind of pants or shorts were going to be the best he could do, if even that. Finally he found the biggest, stretchiest pair of sweatpants that he could find, which had, even for him, had to be tightened a bit around the waist to fit him. (he'd gotten them at the big and tall store, and they had been out of his size, and only had some slightly bigger.) Well. These were his best bit... Fingers crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he got back to the living room he found himself torn between anger and embarrassment at what he saw. Tyler was still sitting there, back propped up against the far wall of the living room, legs stretched out infront of him and having carelessly shoved both the coffee table and the couch to the side to make room for them. One of his meaty paws was on that massive nearly 2 foot long spire of dick jutting up proudly from his hips, slowly jerking up and down its still glistening, pre soaked length, while his other arm was raised up, fingers curled into a fist and arm curved inwards to flex the thick mound of meat for his bicep, as Tyler's head was leaned in, and rather noisily shlurping and 'making out' with his own arm, Clearly getting off on his new size. David tried to avert his eyes for a few seconds from the blatantly lewd display, before something dawned on him and his squeaky voice yelped out desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler! Stop it! Your gonna make me even smaller, god damn it!\u201d He yelled out in an almost panic, quickly walking his way towards the narcissistic giant version of his brother. David's words seemed to 'break' Tyler's concentration... or hell, it could have just been Tyler was more interested in further taunting his brother. Silently thankful that Tyler seemed to have stopped, he raised up the massive sweatpants, Longer than David was tall much to Tyler's amusement, and struggled to throw them at Tyler's huge feet. \u201cThere, that's the biggest thing I've got. Just... try to squeeze into those, I'll go see what I can find in your closet that might fit me\u201d he huffed out, struggling to keep his cool in the situation. It was obvious Tyler was loving Davids practically kid like whining and crying, so he decided he was going to do his best to not play into Tyler's little power trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to clench his fists and jaw to keep from retorting when Tyler called after him \u201cCheck under my bed, that's where all my old Kid clothes are!\u201d and David didn't even have to look to see that cocky, smug grin on Tyler's face as David disappeared around the corner into Tyler's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later, David was on his way back into the living room, with a bright green T shirt that hung down almost to his Mid thighs, sporting a large Green Lantern Logo on it, and wearing a pair of jeanshorts that hung down well past his knees, and had to have a belt wrapped tightly around his waist to keep them up on him. The smallest clothes he could find of Tyler's that they had kept from his childhood, still were too big to fit Davids current size properly...! The bad news just kept coming though, as when he caught sight of Tyler again, still sitting there with his back propped up against the wall, still stark naked and rock hard, he growled out angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler! What the hell, why aren't you dressed yet?! We have to go fix this shit!\u201d David would yell out, having to reach down and adjust his jean shorts a bit to keep them from sagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry bro, Looks like your going alone this time\u201d Tyler retorted with a playful grin, one that clearly told David he knew something David didn't, and as if to answer David's unasked question, Tyler raises up some torn scraps of cloth... which Took David a few seconds to realize were the remains of his sweat pants. Tyler's beefy thighs had simply been too thick for the sweatpants, so as he pulled them up his leg, the sheer girth of his thigh had split them open all the way down the seam, and when he tried to pull them up around his waist to at least be pair of 'hulk shorts', the elastic in the waistband had snapped and that too ripped apart. 7'3 was a far cry from the 9'3 monster sitting in front of David now... and thinking back on it, it really had been a fools hope to think that Tyler could have ever fit into anything David owned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler casually reached up, and carefully pulled the necklace up off his head, having to take a bit of extra time to get the comparatively small necklace around his now much, much larger head, then casually tossed it to David, grinning at him still with that \u201cI know something you don't\u201d look, and then growled out playfully \u201chave fun. Tell me how it goes.\u201d, obviously further taunting David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn't decide if he was angrier, more depressed, or more terrified at that moment, so instead of trying to figure it out, he just grabbed the necklace, stuffing it down into his pocket, and without another word to Tyler, stormed his way out of the house... a booming rumble of laughter from Tyler following after him when he had to reach up on his tiptoes to unlock the deadbolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd off he Went, on a desperate quest to find a way to regain his stolen size. The real question was, could he make it to the antique shop safely...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He walked as quickly as he could manage and kept his head down all the way to the bus stop, where he\u2019d take the transit into downtown.  There, he planned on locating the antique shop \u2013 which he had a vague idea where it was located \u2013 and ask, even beg, for the shopkeeper to help him reverse the effects of the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way he had to repeatedly stop and hike up his jean shorts.  Despite having the belt tightened \u2013 all the way to a notch he had to make with his claws, just to get it tight enough \u2013 he still felt the shorts slipping down his scrawny rump.  By the time he\u2019d scampered to the bus stop he\u2019d already been forced to stop and readjust his clothing four times.  And every time he would glance around, adjusting his belt and hoping no one was watching.  He could almost feel others staring at him, judging him for being such a runt.  In his mind he thought that other anthros would see him as some puny midget adult, while the reality, well\u2026he\u2019d soon find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid hopped up onto the bench at the stop \u2013 with a bit of difficulty \u2013 and sat down awkwardly, his little legs swinging from the bench.  He shifted and fidgeted constantly, feeling quite out of place in his oversized clothing and in plain view of other anthros.  It wasn\u2019t long before he noticed that he was drawing a few stares.  Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a wolf poking his head out of his front door to watch him.  He turned his head away, \u201cGod just stop staring\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only got worse from there.

He turned his head away, \u201cGod just stop staring\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only got worse from there.  Multiple cars passed by, all slowing down to rubberneck and give the drake confused stares from behind their tinted windows.  He kept his gaze to the ground, growling softly each time a car would come to a near stop in front of his bench, \u201cC\u2019mon, am I really that out of place!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was doing his best to avoid the glances of any motorists or pedestrians, and he knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before the bus would arrive.  He held his wristwatch in both hands, staring at the large timepiece and imagining that he could fit it over his entire arm and still have it hang loose.  He could see his bus approaching in the distance, but just as he slid off the bench a familiar, yet unwelcome wave of warmth went over his body.  The little drake snarled, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be fuckin\u2019 kidding me\u2026Damn it Tyler!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled over his shorts as he quickly made his way to the front of the sidewalk.  He was desperate to get to the antique shop, even more than he had been before.  If his brother was still eager to crank out, he was in deep trouble.  He felt his shirt nearly slipping off his scrawny shoulders as he lost another 6 inches, bringing him down to 2\u20196\u201d in height.  He used one hand to hold his shorts up and the other to hold his shirt, while his tail felt like it was carrying all the excess weight of his shorts and shirt on it, so much so that it was starting to get sore.  He even felt out of breath\u2026Had he really lost so much muscle mass that he was getting tired?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared up at the bus as it slowed to a stop, gulping nervously at the behemoth of metal.  He couldn\u2019t imagine what sort of looks he\u2019d get once he was in there.  His heart was pounding, his anxiety levels growing with each inch he\u2019d lost.  He didn\u2019t feel safe at all, and he was quite tempted to go back to Tyler.  But he couldn\u2019t go back!  His brother would never let him live it down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for David, when those bus doors opened, there was another obstacle that would prevent him from making that choice for himself.  He kept his eyes to the ground as the passengers exited.  All of them passed without incident \u2013 save for a few stares \u2013 except for one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last passenger loomed in front of David, staring down at the little drake and casting a shadow over him. The drake shivered and stared at those massive legs before him, not wanting to look up.  A deep voice questioned, \u201cYo kid, what are you doin\u2019 out here all by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the tone and accent of the voice that finally forced David to look up in shock.  His suspicions were correct\u2026There, looming over him with the most aggravating look of concern was someone he recognized...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They didn\u2019t make so much of a difference, anyway, and there\u2019d always be big jerkoffs like Fang from David\u2019s football team who outweighed him no matter how big he got... and without David\u2019s definite size advantage, his bigger brother might not be able to stick up for him when the going got tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...alright, let\u2019s try it.\u201d said David with a frustrated sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re usually right about these kinds of thing.\u201d He didn\u2019t loosen up any as he lead Tyler into his room, looking around for a heavy blunt object with which to inflict violences upon the pendant. <br>\r\n\u201cEr, usually I don\u2019t have to dabble in weird magical shit, but thanks for the compliment, I guess.\u201d said Tyler, blushing slightly as he watched his brother dig under his bed for useful tools. \u201cI just read a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, shut it, pipsqueak, this isn\u2019t a love-in.\u201d David pulled a large wooden baseball bat from under the bed, a replica of a bat used by a legendary ursine giant, and sized to match. \u201cI don\u2019t have a hammer, but if this doesn\u2019t do the job... stand back, short stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tossed the pendant onto his desk, the pair watching with anticipation as David brought his muscular arms over his head, bat in hand. With a vicious downward strike, he brought the weighty bat down into the pendant, cracking it clean in two and putting a nasty split in the desk as the dull, thudding impact echoed around the room. Brilliant sparks of energy illuminated the room, turning the room an ominous red as they glowed intensely. The two brothers shared a nervous look as they both felt the magic take a hold of them, warmth spreading throughout their bodies. David watched as Tyler\u2019s musculature thickened visibly, powerful biceps peaking outwards as his abdominals sculpted themselves into defined, rippling muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, it\u2019s not working, you\u2019re growing again!\u201d snapped David as he felt the magic tingling through every inch of his leathery hide. The purple dragon was shaken from his reverie, laying an enquiring eye on David's form...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David stroked a few layers of tissue over his half-hard shaft after blowing his load, at first unable to recognize the difference between the pleasurable warmth of his brief afterglow and the spreading, tingling warmth of the amulet\u2019s magic.  He faltered after a few moments, hand frozen upon his cock as that warmth spread throughout his body.  He let out a soft moan, a drawn-out vocalization that blended pleasure with a growing sense of confusion and fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the spreading sensation was decidedly foreign, the cobalt drake couldn\u2019t help but focus on it, and even enjoy the spreading warmth.  He moaned louder, his erection stiffening once more.  He tossed the balled-up wad of tissues away and gripped his shaft, panting softly as he stroked himself slowly.  Just as he started getting back into a rhythm he noticed another sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a soft growl and shifted his weight forward, feeling the flesh of his back digging into the rough fabric on his years-old office chair.  He turned to stare at it for a moment, confused enough to lose all sense of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelped when he felt his chair suddenly give way, the adjustable-height chair sinking down suddenly to its lowest setting.  David growled and got to his feet, kicking the chair across the room, \u201cOld piece of junk\u2026\u201d  His tail lashed back and forth, the drake more than a bit agitated at having had his second round of pleasuring interrupted by a failed chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that warm feeling was completely gone!  Damn that old chair.  David leaned against his desk, his hand moving to prop himself against the firm surface.  Half a second later he nearly fell over, having misjudged the distance he\u2019d have to lean to have a hand against the desk while standing.  It was as if his desk had been lowered\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything going wrong in my room!?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid, completely fed up, was just about to collapse on his bed and call it a night, after having his arousal interrupted.  But just as he started to let himself fall back onto the bed, a loud cry came from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid!  I\u2019ve got a problem!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had been sitting in his office chair, browsing \u2013 not unlike David had been \u2013 for \u201cinteresting\u201d material.  Completely naked and aroused, he\u2019d started stroking himself to a particularly raunchy picture of two dragonesses fooling around with a toy.  But he\u2019d hardly had a minute with the picture before some new, more alarming signal interrupted his stroke-session.  The purple drake\u2019s changes were much more rapid than David\u2019s gradual, almost unnoticeable growth.  He felt a chilling wave of dizziness overcome him, and before his very eyes he watched his monitor display raise a few inches in front of him, along with the rest of his room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-pint drake leaped to his feet with a start, his little footpaws landing a bit later than he expected.  He pushed away from his desk and chair, his tail lashing back and forth in his anxiety.  He ran to his doorframe, the most obvious representation of his height in the room.  He stared, absolute dumbfounded, at the doorknob.  Six inches higher than it should have been.  No, that couldn\u2019t be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out and gripped it.  It felt bigger, somehow.  No, he must be hallucinating.  The purple drake went to his desk and rummaged through the drawers, finding a tape measure \u2013 usually reserved for a few of his \u201cbuild projects\u201d from engineering classes \u2013 and quickly extending it.  He panted softly, heart pounding with worry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSssshkt.  The tape measure went to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon\u2026\u201d He muttered, putting a finger level with his head on the tape.  He pulled it into view.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c4\u20197\u201d\u2026No\u2026No\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared with disbelief at the mark beside his clawtip, shaking his head.  How could he be 6 inches shorter?  He whimpered and threw the tape measure to the ground, practically screaming as he called for his brother, \u201cDavid!  I\u2019ve got a problem!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t hesitate to rush to his little brother\u2019s aid.  The bond of their brotherly love was oft-tested, but never even close to broken.  And when it came to his brother\u2019s health and safety, everything else was thrown aside.  He barreled through his door \u2013 nearly breaking it in the process \u2013 and ran to his brother\u2019s room, still stark naked.  He threw open his brother\u2019s door and called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, what\u2019s wrong!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler yelped with surprise when his brother suddenly burst into the room, leaping back an entire foot.  He stared up at his towering brother, feeling even smaller than he had before.  He was shivering, hardly able to stammer out a sentence to his massive brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026I\u2019ve shrunken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at his brother with skepticism, but it didn\u2019t take him long to see that the difference between their heights had grown.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2026But you\u2019re right!  How did this happen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped forward, not at all concerned that \u2013 with their new size difference \u2013 his half-hard cock was nearly on level with Tyler\u2019s eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tyler did notice.  He stared up at his brother, trying not to gaze at that thick shaft in front of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but\u2026wait\u2026\u201dHe faltered, remembering that everything else in the room appeared six inches taller.  But his brother appeared to be an entire foot taller!  He quickly scooped up his tape measure and tossed it up to his towering brother, \u201cDo me a favor and measure your height, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDavid looked confused, but caught the tape measure deftly in his fingers.  He shook his head as he extended it, \u201cLook Tyler, I know you\u2019re scared, but I don\u2019t know how this is gonna help\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly completed the measurement, claws holding the mark where it was level with his head.  He read the measurement off, \u201cSee?  7\u20199\u201d that\u2019s completely\u2026not\u2026right?\u201d  David repeated the measurement, while Tyler groaned beneath him, the little drake already guessing at what had happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at the measuring tape once more, laughing weakly, \u201cThis can\u2019t be right, how did I get six more inches?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler growled with frustration, more than a bit impatient and agitated now that he understood what had happened.  \u201cIt was you!  You did something that let you steal my height, and now you\u2019re six inches taller, and I\u2019m more of a shrimp than I was before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snorted and rolled his eyes, tossing the tape measure to the ground, \u201cAs if something like that could even-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did happen, don\u2019t deny it!\u201d  Tyler shouted, his higher-pitched voice grating a bit on David\u2019s ears.  The little drake jabbed a finger at the amulet around his brother\u2019s neck, \u201cThat must be the key!  Something you did with that amulet, it must be magical!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobalt drake smirked and folded his arms over his chest.  He was only slightly concerned with why he\u2019d grown, at this point.  To him, it seemed like gaining six inches was a boon for him, and not really much of a bust for his brother, whom he already considered to be a shrimp anyway.  He chuckled, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything with it!  I just put it on and, well\u2026\u201d  He gestured to his cock, \u201cStroked one out, you know, normal routine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen that must be it!\u201d  Tyler cried, completely frantic now to figure out what had happened.  David raised an eyeridge, the wheels in his head starting to turn now that his brother had greased them with his intriguing ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, jerking off gives me more height?  Heh, sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me!\u201d  He growled playfully and gripped his shaft, stroking it enough to let it harden in his hand, \u201cMaybe we should test your little theory and see if I can add another 6 inches to my height!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head, \u201cNo no no, we need to take this back to the shop and ask the shopkeeper about it!  I don\u2019t want to risk getting shorter, I\u2019m already too short as it is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snorted and thought for a moment.  If he had the power to grow, he certainly wanted to use it!  But if his brother was so distraught\u2026He might just have to let such a blessing slip through his fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid finally decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou know, you did just give me this.\u201d David protested. \u201cLike, literally less than an hour ago. It\u2019s poor form to want it back now man.\u201d David said accusingly as he started to succumb to his brother\u2019s request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid! Look at me! Fuck your present, this is serious, I can\u2019t get smaller! You can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d Tyler part demanded, part pleaded. He looked so terrified, so helpless. How could David not take pity on his own brother?<br>\r\nThe blue drake scowled. \u201cOh fine then, if you can\u2019t handle this, then fine. OK. We\u2019ll take the dammed thing back tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler began to respond, but David pushed him away before he could. \u201cYou owe me for this man, you really owe me for this.\u201d The hulking blue drake stormed back to his room, slamming the door behind him. <br>\r\nHe caught himself in the mirror again. It was hard to believe it was really him staring back. He studied his form as he flexed and posed, imagining all kinds of uses for his newfound power. The display turned him on, and his erection stood to full attention again. He sighed longingly as he looked at it in the mirror. He would have to leave it alone for tonight. Forbidden from his own cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis put him in a bad mood as he climbed into his sagging bed and waiting for sleep. He wanted to believe there was a reason why he got this opportunity. He wasn\u2019t an overly religious or spiritual drake, but at that moment he was determined to believe that it was somehow fate. That he somehow deserved this opportunity, and resented the thought that his brother would selfishly deny him it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go pro. David didn\u2019t have a lot of strengths. He wasn\u2019t very good at applying himself to anything academic, and he had no real artistic talents to speak of. His assets all lay in his physical build. He needed every bit of his size and more,  if only for his future beyond college. How would he look back on his inaction tonight ten years in the future if he ended up pumping gas or working on an assembly line in some overheated dump?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it\u2019s not like Tyler needed any of the height he was trying to keep. He was smart, he was doing well at his studies. Hell, he was only 20 and already owned his own business! And worse, it didn\u2019t a matter a lick if he was four or even three feet tall, he\u2019s still get through life just fine. In fact, he\u2019d probably grow to enjoy being shorter than normal, he could dress up as all kinds of fantasy creatures to promote his store. He loved doing that nerdy shit, right? Hell, he\u2019d probably even get famous for doing it. Open up a whole chain of stores. The more he thought about it, the more sense it made for him to take the lion\u2019s share of their combined height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was only so far David could stretch such cognitive dissonance. Deep down he knew that he he\u2019d be doing his brother a serious wrong, regardless of what he told himself. \u201cFuck it all\u201d. He said to the ceiling as he rolled over and continued to pout. He couldn\u2019t rest while his mind and emotions continued to flow. It also didn\u2019t help that he was still feeling horny, as if he hadn\u2019t had any release yet. He spent a few hours just lying in his bed playing the situation over and over in his mind. Growing six inches should have sent him over the moon, so why was he sulking do hard? He was seven foot nine. That was miraculous. But it still hadn\u2019t sunk in yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven foot nine! The blue drake shot up with a start. \u201coh no fucking way\u201d he said softly to himself, shaking his head in disbelief. Seven foot nine. A single inch . A single, measly inch shorter than Fang. David realised that the only thing worse than being seven inches shorter than that showboating asshat of a wolf was being one single, significantly insignificant inch. David\u2019s heart pounded in is chest as a heat rushed towards his loins. This would not stand. At once, he was  committed. \u201csorry Tyler, sucks to be you right now.\u201d he snickered quietly as he grasped his renewed erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rearranged himself on his bead, sitting spread-eagled as he held his cock in both hands. \u201cOh fuck\u201d he said in surprise as he realised that it felt bigger in his hands. The thought sent a rush of pre dribbling down its significant length. David worked his cock as quietly as he could. He didn\u2019t want to wake Tyler before he was done, that would just make things harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about what he would look like in the mirror another six inches taller. He thought about how proud he would feel as he put Fang in his place, and have the whole team look up at him. He thought about how all the girls would buckle at the sight of him, about how he would drive them wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid worked harder and faster as his bed started to creak with each thrust. He was restrained in his actions, but his thoughts were guiding him to the edge. He closed his eyes and clenched his teeth as he went past the point of no return, bracing himself as he stated to cum. He tried to be as quiet as he could, but the intensity of his orgasm surprised him, causing the drake to slip a sliver of his voice into his gasp. His eyes opened wide in surprise as his hot seed erupted in a single long, thick ropey stream, spurting several feet in the air with far more force than David should have been capable of.<br>\r\nHe kept pumping his thick black cock as he felt a second orgasm build behind his first. David didn\u2019t have much time to think about it. His hot seed loudly dropped on his hard and sweaty torso just as another orgasm waved through him. \u201cFFFFfffffff!!\u201d David exhaled as he fought to contain from crying out in ecstasy as he came again, his whole body twitching as his massive shaft ejaculated a second, longer load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake breathed deeply in wide eyed amazement as his second load rained down over his room. That had never happened before. He had never came so hard in his life, and twice? It was like he had just released a pressure that had been building for weeks, if not months.  And now he was spent. He had never felt this good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afterglow lasted but a few more breaths however, as his heart quickly went from racing in recovery to racing in lust as he felt a wave of heat rush to his loins, his cock immediately flaring angrily back to attention. David moaned as his cock ached faintly from the pressure, the thick branching veins that hugged the length of his dark member flared outwards; every corrugation in his shaft defined itself as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d David asked himself. He wasn\u2019t simply ready to go again; he was positively aching to do so. He was not relaxed. He had no afterglow. It felt like his last orgasm had been robed from him; instead they were replaced by a burning desire for more. It was like he was growing addicted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThe burning desire spread out across his body as the warm tingling sensation overcame him. He could feel himself growing again; it felt like a pressure that built across his whole body as it pushed out in every direction. The blue dragon writhed on his mattress, his breath short and sharp as he felt his physical power grow. His heavy feet skited further down the bed, dragging his sheets with them. His head was pushing further into his pillows as it wedged them against the head of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt himself sink lower into the mattress is it fought against his weight. His saurian feet made contact with the foot of the bed, restricting further elongation. The blue dragon\u2019s knees began to buckled under the increasing tension, rising steadily higher into the air. \u201cyeess!\u201d he cried in a whisper between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tail was steadily spilling over the end of his bed, eliciting a surprised shudder from the cobalt drake as it made contact against the surprisingly cold floor, and began to snake further down it. His thick and powerful neck rode his heavy head up his pillows, and made contact with the hardwood headrest with an audible \u2018thunk\u2019. It creaked in its joints as the drake\u2019s head pushed against it with the full force of his irrepressibly enlarging body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord\u2019s couldn\u2019t describe how much David loved the experience. It seemed to drag out in slow motion, and just as he was beginning to think it would go on forever, it stopped. He simply lay still panting heavily. His head pressed hard against the headrest, tilting it down, giving him the perfect view of his body. His chest puffed out like two hills in a meadow, taking full advantage of the extra space his broadened shoulders gave him. Behind his heaving chest he could see his cut abdomen, the muscles, tendons and bones of his torso looked perfectly chizzled from a starteling blue gem as they flowed into his pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobalt blue complexion darkened as it faded into ebony as it traced up the shaft of his perfectly straight, thumping erection. It sagged down towards his chest, its dark angry glans staring back at him, crying pre as it yearned for his touch. The long thick shaft bobed with a slight offset of every powerful beat of David\u2019s heart. He rubbed his glans distantly as he looked at the feet that rose next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thighs had widened, rising on a slow but long incline, his knees forming the ridges to a valley his cock rose from.  While they were largely blocking the view of his calves, he could see they had thickened too, their board and meaty length leading to his powerful long, broad ankles. He curled his thick powerful toes over his bed\u2019s footrest. This was amazing. He must have grown another foot. Twelve inches of height, and a disproportionate length in the other two dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid moaned in delight as he massaged his cock with both hands. That was it, he would easily be clearing Fang now. In his mind, he imagined the look on the black wolf\u2019s face as he craned his neck up at David. He imagined the looks anger, of despair, of jealousy. He pumped his long, slick shaft with increasing intensity, his hands full as they gripped as much of his girth as they could,  the tendons in his fingers aching as they squeezes as hard as they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagined the wolf lashing out at him, only to be sent in the opposite direction as the blue drake\u2019s stature held steadfast. He imagined towering over the huddle on the football field, of crashing through walls of defenders as if they were not there. He grunted as he pounded his shaft furiously, bucking his pelvis in opposition. Pree spurted from his cock freely, the constant stream of lubrication  bathing his hands and shaft in excess . He imagined himself being Irrepressible, Unstoppable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncontrollable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was panting as he worked his demanding cock with full fury. \u201cyeagh!\u201d he muttered as he felt another orgasm build before he truly realised what he was doing. The thought that he should stop quickly flashed in and then out of his mind, but even if it fully registered it was futile. His hands worked like a piston, moving too hard and too fast to deny his destiny. David arched his back and dug his powerful toes into the bed\u2019s wooden frame as he crossed the point of no return without looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungh!\u201d David grunted as his orgasm unleashed, feeling his load make its long unstoppable journey through his body and up his shaft, erupting high into the air, spurting in one unbroken and seemingly endless rope. It was thick an opaque, and looked completely solid until it made contact with the ceiling, where it spilled softly. \u201coh\u2026 fuck!\u201d David whined in ecstasy as he felt another orgasm build before his first load had rained down hard onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could only hold his breath as he came again. His hot seed rained down onto his face, forcing him to close his eyes. He didn\u2019t see his second ejaculation, but he sure as hell felt it. His hands worked his shaft haphazardly as his testicles clenched and his urethra stretched wide as it vomited another long and powerful stream onto the ceiling. Intense pleasure flowed down from his glans and across his body, rewarding him for his actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid heard the splash on the ceiling moments before it rained down around him again, splashing his body from his face to his tail on the ground. David moaned with each intense breath, as he felt himself on the brink of a third wave. His cock was heaving, twitching as it fought to break through the point of no return. The blue dragon managed to gather enough senses to pump his hungry cock with force, guiding it past the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chaaaaaaaaaaahh\u2026!\u201d the drake cried as he clenched his teeth an arched his back as a third wave of intense pleasure washed over him. As he felt his seed rise up his shaft, he thrust his pelvis  high into the air, shooting his payload onto the wall behind his head. David whined as he held the pose. It would only have been for a brief moment, but it felt a lot longer. He could feel his seed being expelled with such force it pushed back on his cock, causing it to spurt blissfully across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as his seed came raining down again, he knew it was over. His body felt wrecked , as if he were unable to move as he panted deeply. And as he lay there, he could think of nothing. The afterglow consumed him, leaving him to drift through a void of his own pleasure. The best way to describe it, would be to call it indescribable.<br>\r\nIt was an experience to be short lived, however, as he is ripped back into reality when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David could do nothing but watch as he felt that other wonderful sensation hit him again; growth. Those stacked orgasms hit him one after the other after the other, and his growth followed suite. He watched in a combination of fascination, horror, and downright bestial longing as he could do nothing but watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned as his legs just started to stretch, growing out, thighs bulging with each and every beat of his heart. He closed his eyes, feeling that wonderful growing sensation spread to his overworked loins, feeling his dick just unfurl like an awakening snake, inch after inch just plumping it up into an absolute monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he felt his barrel chest just explode larger, growing to meet his new thighs, and those over-large paws of his. He felt with each breath his chest just seeming to stay puffed up, as if he never exhaled. But it was new muscle, new body-mass instead, just growing so fast that he could hardly keep up with it. The growth spread, up his arms, making those already tremendous biceps just bloat out, looking more and more like Fang's bodybuilder physique, which only made David smile wide through his half lidded eyes. He could barely tell what was going on, his mind was so fogged by pleasure, but he knew whatever was happening, he wanted more by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his body was eager to not let him down. After all of the muscle-mass on him had grown, his height was next. David couldn't help but just groan and watch as his body started to stretch, a foot being added, then two. David couldn't help but just smile as he watched his paws smack against the opposite wall, leaving indentations in it just from such a casual display of power. \"Mmmmpf... Hah... I'm a god-damn monster!\" David couldn't help but laugh through the haze as he just looked at himself, still growing, though steadily slowing down now. He had to be close to eleven feet tall, muscles that just went on for days... and days... and days! He didn't look as thick as Fang, his muscles still looking similarly shaped on his body, but they were much, -much- more toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery muscle, from his biceps to his thighs and calves felt thicker, more powerful, more efficient. David couldn't help but just snort as his hands idly moved across his stomach, loving the sensation of not one area of noticeable fat, not one soft area on him. Not even... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn't help but notice his cock. Even for an eleven foot monster of a man, his dick was -huge-. Flared out and completely hard, it had the thickness of a beer can, and ran all the way up to David's belly button. David grinned and just idly moved his hand down to it, grabbing it with one hand... only to gasp as he felt an overwhelming pleasure shoot through his body just from that one lone little grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuungn.... god damn, I'm still ready to go... this is.... -awesome-.\" David couldn't help but chuckle as his hand just started to idly stroke against his cock. He wanted... no -needed- to go again. Every stroke against his dick made that afterglow dissipate, replaced by an even stronger urge to cum. His room was already a mess, his walls and ceiling coated in what had to be almost a half gallon of pure dragon spunk. And yet here he was, bigger, more powerful, more loaded with cum than ever, and ready to just fuck himself to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I wonder what Fang would think of me now. Mmmpf, I bet I could get him to suck my cock if I told him that it would make me smaller at that point. I wonder what that would even feel like. That big idiot's mouth just wrapped around my di-... unnngh...\" David could feel another orgasm, bigger than any he'd had before come on. He stopped however, leaving his dick screaming for attention. It was painful to not cum at this point, but he knew he had to think for a moment. His room wouldn't support another growth spurt. His body was -huge- already. He was right at the top of sizes that could support normal life. And yet, here he was, ready to just steal more from his bro-....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" David's mind focused just enough to remember Tyler. \"Shit dude, Tyler... fuck! How small is that pipsqueak now I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid went to get up, before realizing that would be a bad idea. He was stuck, on the second story of house. He had outgrown the ceiling by this point. By this point, he'd have to get help to get out, or just keep growing until his house collapsed around him. He didn't particularly like the idea of his house getting crushed, but he had to admit being big and powerful enough to do it was just turning him on even more. He had to figure out if Tyler was still okay, but at the same time, he -HAD- to fuck something, even if it was just his own hand again. God the choices...</span></div></div>",

The erotic thoughts running through his head were interrupted with concern for his brother, if he was somewhere in the 11ft range then the younger dragon must easily be around 1ft tall now, if he kept going like this he would probably shrink his brother too small to see with the next couple of shots.<br>\r\nAs much as he liked to tease his brother with his bigger size he did also care about him too, could he really continue to steal all of his height like this? He had to at least check and see if Tyler was ok, though with all this extra height doubted that he would be able to fit through his bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of doing the logical thing of simply calling for Tyler he decided first to try and get out into the hallway, he removed his hand from his aching cock and shuffled himself around in the small room, he carefully gripped the door handle and pulled it open before starting to force himself through the small hole, only to be stopped by his huge thickly muscled chest which was simply too big to fit through, he tried to shove himself forcefully through the door, making large cracks appear around the frame but it was still no good, but then he felt something, something good, when he shoved his body forward to try and get through the door his throbbing erection brushed up against his dresser, the long thick dragon shaft rubbed up against it, sending a tingle of pleasure running through his body, and thanks to all the pumping he had just done to bring him to the edge of bliss, he couldn't help blowing his load. He bit his lip and tried to hold back a mix of a moan and a feral roar as his seed  pumped out, splattering against the wall and pooling on the floor, he bucked his hips with each throb of his cock, once again lost in the hypnotic feeling of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce David's orgasm had subsided he pulled himself back into his room where his mind started to clear for a moment, \u201cOh god...\u201d was all he could say before that warmth spread through his body once again, he could feel his body growing bigger, filling more of the small room, his muscles thickening, making him look stronger and more manly than ever, his tail swayed across the room knocking his computer monitor and other items from the desk, his cock expanded longer and thicker, still rock hard and ready to go again, he just kept on growing until it all steadily stopped when he was at least 11'9\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another room Tyler was woken by the loud crash of David's computer monitor slamming onto the floor, his eyes snapped open and he jolted upright, finding himself surrounded by a sea of fabric, he struggled against it trying to pull and push it away from his dwindling body, eventually succeeding in getting free. What he saw next terrified him to his very core, everything was huge, and seemed to be getting bigger by the second, \u201cArgh!!! What the hell is happening?!?!\u201d he shouted \u201cDAVID! HELP!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on his bed, completely naked having shrunk out of his clothes, at this point he didn't care that he was nude, he just wanted to get help, he had to climb down the side of his bed to reach the floor then ran to his door, he was in luck, it wasn't fully closed, it was open just a crack, just enough that he could try to pull it open. He grasped the edge of the door and started to pull with all his strength, struggling to move it with his ever decreasing size, \u201cCome on....\u201d he grunted out as he slowly tugged the door open just wide enough for him to slip through the gap between it and the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler ran as fast as he could towards David's room, seeing the door wide open, cracks surrounding the wall around it, he could smell the thick scent of his brothers seed filling the air and instantly knew what had happened, muttering to himself, \u201cHe didn't... He promised he wouldn't do it.... He....\u201d.<br>\r\nTyler stopped dead in his tracks as he reached David's room, almost unable to comprehend what he was seeing. There in front of him was his brother, as big as a building compared to him, he wasn't even as big as one of the blue dragon's feet anymore. Tyler could only stare in shock, seeing his brother so huge, hunched over even while sitting down to avoid smashing through the ceiing, the cock between his legs still standing to attention many times his own tiny size, thick pools of dragon cum pooled on the floor and splattered over the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD... DAVID?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!\u201d Yelled Tyler in a mix of anger and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned to look at his tiny brother, releaved that he was ok and hadn't shrunk out of existence, \u201cTyler! I... um... I'm... sorry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler growled, but at his height it didn't seem very threatening at all, it was almost laughably cute, \u201cSORRY?! SORRY?! YOU'VE STOLEN NEARLY ALL OF MY SIZE AND ALL YOU CAN SAY IS YOU'RE SORRY?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had to smirk a bit when he heard the quiet high pitched grow, \u201cIt's not my fault, it's that necklace, it makes you feel so good, it's hard to resist, the slightest touch and you're ready to go again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler growled out some more, \u201cNO! NO MORE! WE'RE SORTING THIS OUT NOW! I'M GOING TO THAT ANTIQUE STRORE AND I'M GETTING MY HEIGHT BACK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small sigh escaped David's lips, \u201cTyler...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou\u2019re going nowhere, runt.\u201d snarled David, one heavy paw pinning the tiny Tyler to the sticky carpet with ease. The fragile purple drake squeaked with fear as the sizeable foot clamped him to the floor, squeezing the breath out of him as David fought to stop himself outright crushing his trapped prey. With so much muscle behind his powerful paws, it would be all too easy to slip... but then where would he get those last few inches from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gave me this gift, and I\u2019m gonna make the most of it.\u201d he growled, head foggy with burning lust and passion as he wrapped his strong blue fingers around his achingly needy, extraordinarily long and thick member. The colossal spire of meat proudly standing between his muscular thighs towered over little Tyler, a mockery of his pathetic size... and David couldn\u2019t help but think the miserable little creature he called his brother would look good right next to it. Tyler felt the behemoth\u2019s weight shift from underneath David\u2019s sole, the thick scaleless hide pushing deep against his chest and squeezing the life out of him, before freedom beckoned as David lifted his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not to last. His super-sized sibling merely reached down and picked him up in one massive paw, treating him to the scenic overlook of his massively muscular frame. To Tyler, those biceps were bigger than he was, the crevasse between David\u2019s meaty pectoral slabs like the Grand Canyon... he was bigger and better than ever before, and he could see from the expression on his brother\u2019s face that he <i>loved</i> it. He was positively revelling in his new-found size and strength as he lowered the little dragon onto his monolithic meat...<br>\r\n\u201cDavid? DAVID?! What the fu-oof!\u201d Tyler\u2019s mewling protests were quickly cut off as David began to use him to pleasure himself, enjoying the cool sensation of the little plaything\u2019s skin against the warm, throbbing mass that was his cock. One great hand guided the spluttering dragon through a nightmare of precum and ebony veins, while the other worked the base of the elephantine erection and occasionally teased those massive, tensed and churning nuts. David couldn\u2019t help himself \u2013 every sensation was overloading his brain with sheer beatific bliss, the desire \u2013 no, the need \u2013 to pleasure himself overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes rolled back in ecstasy as he heard a tinkling crash behind him \u2013 his titanic tail had idly smashed the window with an errant whip. The sounds of his heavy grunting and moaning filled the room, and the already lingering musk from his acts of wanton self-pleasure only intensified the further he descended into hedonic rapture, coming closer and closer to climax. Tyler, for his part, was overwhelmed in every way it was possible to be \u2013 he was betrayed, beaten up, blasted with heady musk and basted in precum. He managed a few defiant growls, but little more, as David caught a glimpse of himself through half-closed eyes in the full-length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was... he was <i>godly</i>. As he stared at the massive, masculine figure he had become, each muscle its own work of art and his slavering endowment a monument to his depraved sexuality, his breath caught in his chest with surprised, aroused shock as he gripped his cock (and Tyler) all the harder, and began to growl his victory as he felt both his orgasm and the burn of magic take hold of him once more. Tyler panicked and flailed, the tiny strokes feeling divine against the sensitive member as spurt after spurt of sticky draconic cum stained the carpet further, blasts of the sticky substance coating not only the dragon, but whatever remained in his room. David lost himself in ecstasy, flopping back and losing his grip on Tyler as he lay bathed in the warm glow of his climax, enjoying the feeling of growth rippling through his massive form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed, the dragon admiring himself as the floor strained under him. His cock was... it was something different, that was for sure. He had clearly inherited all Tyler had to offer, with the sheer girth and length of the organ dominating the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... Tyler! It was painful to focus on anything but his burning arousal, but he fought through the haze and looked around worried for his little brother, only to find he was gone without a trace. Amongst the stained carpet and ruined furniture, he could see no signs of the little guy. Guilt superseded lust in the big dragon\u2019s mind, a feeling of sickness and nausea churning his stomach as he looked desperately for Tyler.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Tyler, what have I done...\u201d he whispered, shame flooding his massive form. \u201cI took it too far, and now...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Just... Goddamnit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the weirdest feeling David could've possibly conceived; every time he closed his eyes, he saw Tyler there, at the front of his mind, completely furious but in better detail than he could've imagined possible. But Tyler was nowhere to be seen in his room or in his hallway, from what David could find with a quick glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fantastic. I'm glad one of us can see something, at least!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, what the heck is this?\" David asked the air around him.<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" He snapped, full of anger and panic. \"It's black pretty much everywhere here except for where I'm standing, but I don't know where the spotlight's coming from. I don't even know where your voice is, it's just sort of... resonating from everywhere. You took the last of my size, you dickhead- I could be anywhere now. I shouldn't even exist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fearful brother's voice, loudly and clearly registering to him, gave David back all the clarity he'd been missing from his nighttime excursion. \"Wherever you are, I can see you when I close my eyes. And I'm not speaking to you using my mouth. It's like my thoughts are speaking themselves to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telepathy, David. That's called telepathy.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Another stupid term from his comics?<br>\r\nTyler shot him a very annoyed look, and David grimaced. He hadn't meant to send that message to Tyler.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, THAT'S what I'm upset about! You suck me out of existence, but I'm upset you think my terminology is dumb.\"<br>\r\nHadn't meant to send that message either.<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! David, what the FUCK?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Tyler, okay?\" Tyler's shouts generally weren't so bad, but these were going directly into his brain. \"I just couldn't think straight, the pendant kind of consumes your focus after a while-\"<br>\r\n\"After a WHILE? Why the hell did you even use it TWICE, you gigantic douchebag! It was draining my size, in case you didn't notice!\"<br>\r\n\"I...\" David trailed off. He really didn't want to tell Tyler about the inch-high difference he'd been behind Fang after the first use-<br>\r\n\"YOU FUCKING KILLED ME FOR A HEIGHT ADVANTAGE OVER FANG?!\"<br>\r\n\"You're not dead!\" David snapped defensively, again to the air around him.<br>\r\n\"Well, shit, David, no thanks to you! I don't know <i>where</i> I am, and I don't know <i>what</i> I should do! David, just...you're my brother! We don't get along perfectly, fine, but <i>how could you do this to me?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words cut David deep, the depth of the betrayal he'd committed really hitting home. Tyler said something, but David was scrambling frantically to think of ways to justify his actions- how the unbelievable, overflowing libido had consumed him; how fantastic it felt to grow; the craving he had to finally oversize Fang. Unconsciously, David put his hand against his groin, and almost instantly (certainly supernaturally) he felt the pleasure retaking him, again, slowly, with a twinge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the black void that surrounded Tyler began changing almost immediately after his outburst finished. The darkness had been... fluctuating, slightly, just off in the distance, as if between shades of black divided by a sound wave plot. More or less, it was matching with David's speech. Tyler tried walking to it, but it became clear that wherever he was, walking had no effect; he felt himself moving against a ground, but there was no indication he was making any forward progress. Trapped in this weird abyss forever. Thanks a ton, David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the outburst, though, the horizon started flashing rapidly a bunch of impossible colors. Colors Tyler didn't think possible to exist, that were yellow and purple and brown and gray all at once, going almost pitch dark to hideous, glaringly hot so much that they almost blinded Tyler if he didn't shield his eyes. He probably would've done so anyway- the colors were not pleasant to look at. \"What the hell?\" Tyler muttered. \"David, something's happening.\" He got no answer from his brother. Tyler couldn't even stay angry anymore- now, he was just scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly later, the rapid flashing died to a pulsing, then to a hum, then to darkness again. After they stopped, he became aware of a reddish, foggy cloud blooming up from the ground. He barely had time to register it before it enveloped him. It completely obscured his vision, but felt wonderfully comfortable, like sauna steam at perfect humidity.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe blinked confusedly and looked around him, but began to notice something else: the ground under his feet was changing texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog was receding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as David could be a tease and a horn-dog, even he typically shouldn't have been able to keep an erection with the shouts of his brother in his head. Today, however, was not a typical day, and as soon as his hand had touched his inflated cock- which, by all accounts, should've been spent for at least a few hours by this point- the amulet had it bulge once again and bathed his body in erotic feeling once more, as fervently as ever. David closed his eyes, and fantasy took him.<br>\r\nIt was a packed stadium. David's team milled around his shins, looking at him enviously, but they didn't have any part to play. How could they? David was all the team needed. At his size, David didn't even need padding. He was wearing his football jersey and a sports cup, nothing else. A line of cheerleaders in school uniform egged him on down the field. They all had pink hair- David suddenly knew they were all Jessica, his latest conquest from a few nights ago. All her synchronized copies yelled for David to go, fight, win. Go, fight, win.<br>\r\nBut if there was a game to win here, it certainly wasn't football. In the miniaturized (to David) field, an equally large emerald-green dragoness in a purple jersey that wasn't his team's was reclining over the goal posts. David recognized her from the porn he'd been browsing, a particularly gorgeous creature with perfect breasts being squeezed between her triceps. She wasn't using her hands,because they were busy spreading her opening wide. Fingers splayed her vag while she slowly masturbated, biting her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Dave,\" She panted sensually. \"Time to score.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid strode across the field confidently. He wasn't thinking, but he'd know what to do when he got there. He dominated the field with every sweep of his legs- the crowds went wild as his teammates scattered or got knocked over by just one of his paws, careless of their presence. Every stomp vibrated the ground like the T-Rex anthro of that dumb Jurassic movie Tyler kept talking about. He was a cerulean god of athletic perfection, and the stadium was his temple of worship.<br>\r\nWhen he was close enough to smell the luscious green creation in front of him, He became aware of two small but different things in either of his hands, one larger than the other, but not by too much. Both pretty squishy. He hadn't noticed them before. Huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his left hand absentmindedly, a smile on his face. A football, the size of a robin's egg. He knew where he had to put it. Time to score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the other-<br>\r\nTyler's small purple form was curled into the other and screaming-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything could kill the mood, it was that. David's fantasy vanished instantly, and Tyler once again took forefront of his mental vision, plopping on the 'ground' and all but hyperventilating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, what happened? Are you okay?!\"<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Tyler said. It was clear he was trying to recompose, but his voice betrayed him. He was afraid before, but now he was bordering on hysterical. \"David, what <i>was that?</i> Don't tell me you didn't see that, you were there- WHAT WAS THAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I don't know! I think it was the amulet again- I went to... adjust myself, and things just...sort of, came to mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe penny dropped. The words hung silently in the air, the implication finally connecting for them both.<br>\r\n\"David...\" Tyler said slowly. He was coming to the same realization as David. \"Don't tell me...\"<br>\r\nEvery time he'd had a thought, Tyler had heard it. Every time he had a fantasy, Tyler was forced to be included. And every time he'd used the pendant, something of Tyler had gone into him- initially meaning his size. But when his size was gone, the only thing left to take was...<br>\r\n\"Oh, my, GOD,\" Tyler yelled in outrage and horror. \"I'm trapped in your <i>mind?!</i>\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David tossed his handful of tissues into the wastebasket by his desk, groaning softly with pleasure and laying back in his office chair.  He groaned softly with pleasure and licked his lips, feeling more satisfied than usual with his self-induced orgasm.  That warm feeling of pleasure spread from his groin outward, and in seconds David was tingling all over; so much so that he let out a soft moan and reached down to grip his shaft out of reflex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hard as a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let out a grunt and glanced down at himself with amazement.  He\u2019d fooled around with himself enough times to know that he didn\u2019t simply get erect again within seconds after having an orgasm.  Not that he was complaining.  With a snarl of pleasure he gripped his sensitive shaft and slowly squeezed, his hand stroking up and down.  As he lay back in his chair with his briefs around his knees he felt a new sensation, a growing discomfort in his muscular thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snarl he stood up in his chair, only for the sleek, black chair to lift up with him.  Quite comically his chair had become stuck to his muscular rump, something which also had never happened to him before.  It had taken him a week to find a good office chair that was comfortable and wide enough for his muscular thighs.  And now it was too small again?  That couldn\u2019t be right.  He firmly gripped both plastic armrests and pushed them apart with his hands, prying the chair off his rump and letting it tumble to the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on\u2026\u201d  He muttered.  David took a few steps toward his mirror, stumbling briefly when his briefs held tight around his knees, the sound of threads snapping forcing him to stop mid-stride and readjust his pace.  After a few \u2018baby steps\u2019 to his mirror he immediately saw the problem.  Where he used to have his mirror looked lower than before, and somehow smaller as well.  In fact, as he looked around his room, everything looked smaller than he remembered.  Perhaps most telling of all was the fact that he was stooping over to avoid scraping his horns against the ceiling, which he\u2019d not realized he was doing until he saw that he was hunched over and bent at the knees in his mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taller\u2026I\u2019m TALLER!\u201d  He let out a booming laugh at the sight of himself.  He lifted his chin and stood up a bit straighter, delightedly nuzzling at the ceiling for a few moments before stooping back down to grin at himself in the mirror.  After a few moments of admiring his reflection he noticed something else.  The cobalt drake curled his arms downward and drew them inward, flexing his thick, meaty pectorals in the mirror.  He let out a groan of pleasure at the feeling of strength he felt, the tightness and firmness in those muscles that was a little more intense than he remembered.  It was if he\u2019d gained muscle mass all over, relative to his new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid chuckled deeply and spent the next few minutes admiring himself in the mirror.  He noted as best he could just how much muscle mass he\u2019d gained.  A few inches in girth around his biceps, more definition to his abs, a rock-hard ass\u2026He was enjoying the sight of himself so much that he kept his erection through the entire process of reacquainting himself with his own body.  He panted softly and put his hands on his hips, shaking his head in disbelief.  He couldn\u2019t even look himself in the eyes on his own mirror anymore, but that didn\u2019t matter!  He was more pleased with everything below his neck; even his cock seemed bigger!  He hefted that thick slab of meat and let out a soft groan of pleasure.  This was quite the gift he\u2019d been given, and whatever he did, it would have to take advantage of his new size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what should he do?  He thought he had a grasp of why he'd grown...but then again, it might be fun to show someone first!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a bit of thought, David realized that showing himself off to anyone would just be asking for them to try and steal his necklace from him. As delicious as the idea of lording even more size over his brother was, or showing off to one of the guys at practice, or hell even giving some poor girl the shock of her life, the thought of just enjoying himself for a while was becoming more and more prominent in his mind as he just let his hand idly trail over his body. He was sexy, cut, powerful, all of the things he had been before but... but more! And just thinking that in his hands was the power to just keep getting more and more cut, more and more powerful was intoxicating. He wouldn't have to work out anymore, wouldn't have to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grunted as his hands moved down to his cock again, licking his lips as he just stared at himself in the mirror for a while longer, a big grin on his face as he just started to stroke himself off, enjoying the sight of that thick dick bouncing in his hands. He was always a big guy all around, dick included, but as he just felt across his massive member it was obvious now that it had grown larger compared to the rest of him, giving him an even more manly hung physique. David could only think of how big it could get if this kept up, if he kept using the necklace. Soon enough he'd be rivaling Fang in power, and able to shame most equines with his dick!  He watched as his pre started to flow, dripping down onto his chest as he groaned loudly. Damn it felt even better than before! And was he imagining things, or was he getting even more, well, 'productive' as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of teasing, David just grabbed a hold of his shaft with both hands, relishing how even with both of them firmly wrapped around his dick there was still a bit of it poking out from under his finger tips. He started to just hump into his hands with reckless abandon after that. There was no point in edging himself after all, no point in taking it slow. After all, after he came, he knew he could just do it again... and again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the thought of being able to cum for days was exciting David more than he ever thought it would. He was always a show off, but he never really put two and two together and really wondered why he always got so turned on by teasing people, dreaming of just getting bigger and better than his lanky brother or his powerhouse teammates. As he sat there, feeling his orgasm come closer and closer, it finally clicked: It was the power. It was that simple, and yet that complex. He worked out because he liked the feeling of his thick biceps just being thicker by the end of a hard week and the compliments that would net him from his teammates and chicks alike. He liked bragging about the girls he fucked to Tyler cause he loved the look on his brothers face, that annoyed jealousy right before he turned back to whatever he was doing, his face blush as secretly Tyler wanted to be more like his big 'bro'. And to think, all of that was child's play now that he had this new power. He had thought of outsizing Fang and showing off to girls, but why stop there? He could keep going forever. He could grow to the size of the freaking world if he wanted to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's daydreaming came to an abrupt end as he gasped, feeling his orgasm coming quick and hard as he just kept humping hard into his own hands. He grunted, thrusting up into his hands with short vicious strokes, each hard thrust feeling intoxicating against his pre-greased palms. He groaned one more time before just blowing up, ropes of cum flying against his own chest as he sighed heavily, shivering in ecstasy as he just leaned back, feeling his body start to tingle, a smile on his face as he knew what that meant... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David just relished the feeling of pure ecstasy as it washed over him. He could feel his body start to expand and he couldn't help but just groan as he watched. Everything, from his big broad feet to his still hard as a rock cock began to thicken and grow. Muscle piled onto muscle, not necessarily making him bigger, but making him more toned by the second, the sheer density of the muscle in him making him feel like he could lift up his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just closed his eyes, unable to help himself as he just gently stroked his needy dick, still wet with his last massive orgasm. He sighed, opening his eyes to just watch himself almost get off once again, when he is shot out of his reverie by the sight around him. He hadn't stopped growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" David said, getting up, feeling his head crash against the roof of his house, cracking it noticeably. \"Oh shit, shit... shit!\" David frantically tried to think of something, anything that would stop his growth. He started to think of the unsexiest thing possible. Old women, dead people.... giant thick breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groaned as his libido was just too high. Even now, even as his house cracked around him he could feel it throbbing needily, like he had never gotten off at all. His feet blast through the wall, his head crashing through the ceiling. He had to be close to twenty feet tall already, and still he was growing! He brushed aside bits and pieces of his own house as he simply outgrew it, watching his cock blast a hole through the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god Tyler is going to...\" David blinked as he felt the floor finally just give way to his growing girth at the same time that he thought of that. \"Oh hell... Tyler!\" David looked around frantically, only to see Tyler, already outside, apparently having run out at the first sign of trouble. He could see him shaking, more stunned and surprised than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?! T-the hell...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain in a second bro just... uhm...\" David couldn't help but groan as his size ballooned up again, his ass now comfortably sitting atop the ruins of his former home, his entire body close to fifty feet tall. Finely, gratefully, he seems to have stopped growing. David sighed in relief, though honestly... there still was that heavy twinge of hotness about the whole thing. He was -huge-. His muscles were dense, packed, more so than years of working out could possibly give him. He was fucking -hung-, his cock probably close to nine or ten feet long on his fifty foot body, slaping against his belly button, with nice melon like balls to compliment them. It took a lot of willpower to keep from just grabbing a hold of it and just enjoying the sensations all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?! What. IS. THIS?!\" Tyler said below, kicking David out of his daydreams once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude it's the necklace! Isn't this awesome? Just fucking look at me! I'm -huge-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Y-you blew up our house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that kinda sucks... but just think. I can live anywhere I want to now.\" David grinned and just put his hands behind his head casually. \"I mean, who is going to stop me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what about me?\" Tyler said, still obviously in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry man, I'll still take care of you. I mean, just cause I'm now even -better- at you than you could possibly have ever dreamed of doesn't mean I won't take care of my bro. How bout it man? Hop on and maybe I'll take you for a ride around town? I want to see what this new body is capable of.\"</span></div></div>",

Quickly he grabbed his briefs and started tugging them back up his legs, unable to help himself but chuckle at how much of a struggle it was to get the now skintight, blatantly undersized fabric up his thicker thighs. Not to mention it ended up being nearly impossible to stuff his still throbbing erection into the front of them, ultimately leaving the head peeking slightly out of the top of his waistband, the best that he could do to hide it. With himself at least attempting to have some modesty, he turned and started making his way towards the door, unable to help but grin widely when he saw how much lower he had to duck to get under the doorway. Each of his steps caused a low, audible Thump to vibrate through the floor, louder than it had ever been thanks to his increased height and weight, and before he even reached Tyler's door, it began opening and the scrawny 5 foot dragon peeked out into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod Damn it David stop stomping around in... the hall... way?\u201d He started to growl out in annoyance before his eyes finally settled in on David. Blinking a few times at the sight of the far larger, and more muscular version of his brother. His eyes kept darting back and forth across the massive form of David, first up at how his head was brushing the ceiling, then down to that visibly thickened chest and arms. He did his best to keep his eyes off the obvious, swollen erection far too big for the partally torn underwear David had forced on, and finally looked back up at David's face. \u201cW... What the hell happened to you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn't it awesome!? I'm even bigger than Fang now!\u201d David practically roared out happily. He and Fang had been friends for years, and he'd long since gotten used to Fang's attitude, but him and the other guys had always joked about how awesome it would be for someone to finally come along and put the oversized wolf in his place. Now he could definitely do that, should he decide too.\u201dI mean, damn, check this out!\u201d He growled out, as he raised one of his thickened arms up, curling it inwards to flex his now immense bicep, causing it to swell up to the point its edge brushed against his shoulder, pushing at it a bit as if demanding for more room. David had always been pretty beefy, he worked out a lot to keep himself in shape, But this was far beyond the build he used to have. Hell he looked like he could be an amateur bodybuilder now if he tried! \u201cI put on that necklace you gave me, then when I started Jerking off, I grew!\u201d He exclaimed shamelessly, seeming to not even realize that he had just told his brother he was masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid. Look at yourself, this isn't natural! Aren't you like... freaked out or anything?\u201d Tyler stuttered, still staring up at his brother in awe... with a tiny bit of visible Envy. He'd given that thing to David, if only he'd kept it for himself. How was he supposed to know what it actually was?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way dude. This is one of those times where you don't look a gift horse in the mouth\u201d He replied with a grin, blinking a bit then smirking as he added \u201cOr a gift Dragon\u201d as if teasing Tyler about the fact that it had been Tyler that had caused all this. Immediately Tyler growled and Jumped at David, reaching up to try to grab the necklace from around David's neck, little paws shoving against David's stomach and thigh as he tried to get a grip on the looming dragon to try to jump higher and grab at it. \u201cWhoa whoa whoa!\u201d David exclaimed suddenly, and without even thinking he reached down and grabbed the back of Tyler's shirt in his fist, pulling him away and then lifting Tyler clean up off the ground with that one arm. He blinked a bit, seeming just as surprised as Tyler was that David was able to hold him in the air so easily like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod damn it Tyler give it to me, it was mine! You're already way too big!\u201d Tyler protested, growling as he flailed around in David's grasp, arms and legs too short to reach anything of David's other than that all but unmovable arm holding him up in the air. \u201cGive it back!\u201d He continued to protest, shoving and tugging at David's wrist to no avail. This was worse than it had ever been. He may never have been able to overpower David, but at least he'd always been able to put up some token fight. Now he couldn't even do that, he was totally at David's mercy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook bro, you need to calm down\u201d David growled out, giving Tyler a bit of a shake to get him to stop yelling.  Once Tyler settled down a bit he lowered the small purple dragon back to the floor and gave him a light push, unintentionally shoving him harder than he meant too and sending Tyler stumbling back into his room. \u201cEr... oops. Look. You need to calm down\u201d He said again, struggling not to smirk as he took a step back towards his room. \u201cNow you go back to your room and think about how you've been acting... MAYBE tomorrow ill let you use it once. But this thing is Mine, you gave it to me fair and square, got it?\u201d He explained to Tyler, who simply growled back at the towering blue beast of a dragon, but said nothing. \u201cNow. Goodnight, i'll see you in the morning\u201d David chuckled, and made his way back into his room, closing the door behind him and leaving Tyler there staring at the door in a mix of wanting and anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that taken care of, David found himself, while still raring to go, Having been drained of some of his 'desire', and decided to just turn in early. Hell, as far as he knew this thing would work anytime, so there was no reason to go all out on the first evening, right? With a chuckle, and one last narcissistic posing session in the mirror, he laid himself down on his noticeably smaller bed, stark naked save for the necklace around his neck, and let himself drift off for a peaceful night of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough... Peaceful might not be the best way to describe David's night, as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler had been stewing in jealousy for half the night. It wasn\u2019t fair, on any level. He had always hated being short, that was true. But it was a somewhat dormant, background hatred, placated by an acceptance that it\u2019s just the way it was. There was nothing he could have done to get bigger, so wanting to change the unchangeable was simply a waste of energy. It never helped that others were quick to point out his vertical deficiency, of course. Be they active, such as any social interaction with that oversized freak of a wolf Fang. Or passive, like a women\u2018s glance that only ever seemed to be passing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in may ways, the worst of the lost came from his brother\u2019s antics. David never meant harm. Well, not harm in any real sense of the word. But his actions were demeaning, and something that Tyler took to heart. He had taken the unintended anger and jealousy and buried it, layer upon layer. But ultimately, Tyler was always able to just get over it. To move on with life, and make the most of what he did have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not tonight. Everything had surfaced. The sum of Tyler\u2019s anger, jealousy and desire accumulated over his lifetime. It dominated his thoughts, it welled around inside his flesh, spinning through his stomach and making him sick to the core. It consumed him. It drove him mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd worse, the life of his dreams he dared not dream was in his hands. Only hours earlier. And he gave it away. To his brother. His BROTHER. Tyler spat the thought in his mind. \u2018MAYBE tomorrow ill let you use it once\u2019,  the phrase played internally over and over and over. Fuck him. His brother was too big to start off with. Now it was overwhelming. And it could only get worse. The disparity would just widen, the injustice escalate. Fuck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was going to steal that amulet back. It was the only thing he could possibly do. It wasn\u2019t a want. It was a base need. He needed that fucking amulet. He\u2019d rather be dead than be without it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Tyler crept up to his brother\u2019s door in the hours that transitioned from very late to very early. He could hear David snore. His heart beat hard and fast, his anticipation rising. Slowly, he opened the door. The action dragged on for what seemed like hours, but made no sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly crept up to his brother, the floorboards barely noticing his light frame. David was snoring loudly. Tyler was shaking. He saw the amulet, wrapped safely around his mountanous blue chest. Tyler eyed the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother was huge. Bigger than he should have been. David usually filled his king sized bed, but now it looked\u2026 ridiculously small. The blue drake\u2019s ankles were entirely suspended off the foot of the bed, his huge saurian toes curled a good foot and a half away. His head was jammed awkwardly between his mountainous, heaving chest and the head of the bed. It was difficult to compare the size of a vertical objet to the size of a horizontal one, but Tyler was convinced that his brother was even bigger than he was this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hear skipped a beat as David stirred, kicking out softly with his distended feet as he rotated his chest towards Tyler. The purple drake stood wide eyed and frozen, fully expecting his brother\u2019s eyes to open right at him. But as the seconds passed, Tyler started to calm down. He felt out of breath again as his heart pounded, making up for lost time. David smiled, his lips retracting enough to reveal a sliver of savage teeth. Whatever his brother was dreaming of, he was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting one and one together, Tyler eyed his brother\u2019s cock. It was hard to miss, the rock hard ebony rod bore no detail in the low light, but its silhouette was strong. David\u2019s ridiculously tight boxers hid the cock\u2019s base. But nothing else. The shaft extended up past the taught fabric, and just seemed to keep going. Past his belly button, to the base of his sternum. And it was thick. About eight inches in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had never seen his\u2019 brothers erect cock before. Why would he have? Once they learnt to respect each other\u2019s privacy by knocking on bedroom doors, the opportunity was limited. But he had seen his cobalt brother naked enough to measure up his flaccid state. It was something Tyler could favourably compete with, and a source of more pride than was probably warranted. But all that had changed as Tyler started wide eyed at the cock attached to his brother. It flared angrily, its strength battling its weight as it held itself barely suspended above the huge blue torso, bobbing visibly with each beat of the drake\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid mumbled as he stirred again. Tyler spotted of a cobweb like thread that ran from his brother\u2019s cock onto his chest. The aftermath of a wet dream. Renewed jealousy rose up within Tyler. So that explains it. The even more increased size. He wasn\u2019t going to stop cumming, and growing. And judging by his David\u2019s restlessness, another orgasm was well on its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler crouched beside his brother\u2019s fleshy mass. He froze as his brother whined, his brows furrowing as he distantly stretched his enormous frame. He was moving far too much for Tyler\u2019s comfort, it seemed as if David was about to wake himself. Something caught his attention in his periphery, and Tyler almost started as he saw his brother\u2019s big dark cock seem to stare at him. A small spurt of pre was spat in his direction. Tyler suppressed his feeling of panic into one of mere urgency. He smiled nervously to himself. The cock was ticking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully grabbed the body of the amulet off his brother\u2019s heaving chests. The blue drake was panting now, his muscles spasmed softly, letting Tyler know that he was tense and restless. His brother moaned and swallowed audibly as Tyler slowly elevated the amulet up over his brother\u2019s snout. <br>\r\nSo many things could go wrong here, Tyler was acutely aware. David might suddenly twitch his enormous head as Tyler tried to get the chain over it. The sensation of the chain being pulled from under his neck might be enough to wake him. Tyler had thought of this in advance. If David woke, he would rip the amulet from him and flee the house. The front door was open. He knew exactly where he was going to hide when his brother came chasing after him. It was all risky, but Tyler was never going to give up.<br>\r\nAs it turned out, David\u2019s wet dream seemed the perfect distraction. The way he writhed and whined, pivoting his hips and torso while he kicked out with his heavily muscled feet, were all far greater movements than the slow removal of the amulet. <br>\r\nTyler had cleared his brother\u2019s snout by the time David gave a cry. Tyler froze again, looking over his brother. Was he awake? Should he rip the amulet off now while he had the chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobalt\u2019s eyes remained closed. But he was scowling hard, his lips parted unevenly in an odd expression as his mouth opened and closed sporadically. Tyler looked down over his brother in time to see his cock spasm visibly as it shot another spurt of pre further up his chest, the trajectory skewed as the huge rod swayed itself. Tyler breathed heavily as his brother cried again, more urgently, as his cock sent another load of pre flying, landing on the enormous blue shoulder just in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was caught in two minds. His brother was clearly ready to cum, but how should he handle it? Should he rip the amulet off now, or abandon his progress and try again after things had settled down? This was not a situation he had pre-planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment of indecision dragged our long enough for his brother to emit one final half grunt, half shout, as he stretched savagely, his heavy pelvis thrusting forward before his cock exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was looking right at it. He saw it happen, and yet he was still too shocked to accept it. David came hard, the movement of his pelvis coupled with the cocks\u2019 own movement much akin to a fire hose sent his ropey seed streaming straight towards Tyler. He closed his eyes in time to protect them as the burst smashed into his face, then trailed down his neck and torso before finally hitting him in the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quantity and force was unimaginable. It felt like someone had sprayed him with a narrow showerhead on full pressure. At first, it felt like a stream of steaming hot water, but the sensation quickly shifted as the thick congealed liquid seemed content to hold its form, and dribbled, rather than ran down the purple drake\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was knocked back, still holding the amulet. The action finally freed it from his brother as he stumbled not so quietly into the wall behind him. Tyler barely had time to open his mouth in shock as a second stream hit him lower in the torso, the force causing a sizeable patch in his shirt to cling hotly and heavy to his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s moans and gasps were white noise to Tyler as he desperately tried to rub the thick sticky cum from his eyes, and so he was surprised when a third, smaller stream clipped his elbow, the bulk of the load hitting the wall behind him. <br>\r\nTyler finally got his eyes opened, breathing heavily as his heart raced in terror. Was his brother awake? He was caught flat footed if he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut David was simply basking unconsciously in the afterglow, his cock still twitching but nothing else was being ejaculated. A long, ropey stream of cum spread out from the cock head to the blue drake\u2019s shoulder, the long thick thread collapsing slowly under its own weight. A shiny messy trail lead up the drake\u2019s panting chest, past his shoulder and onto the wall behind him. Tyler was standing at ground zero, the hot sticky seed slowly dripping off him in an unimaginable quantity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stared at his brother a moment longer as he stooped, noticing\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler wiped his eyes again, trying to convince himself that he was mistaking what he saw. However, as he watched David shift in his sleep, it quickly became clear that it was a foolish hope. His shaft was still trickling onto the bed, and his grin seemed to grow wider as he moved and shifted about. His feet kicked out a little further, knocking against the ground as his knees slid out from the bottom of his bed. His brother had stopped moaning, but he was making a quiet, feral growl as he turned and shifted around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler couldn't move as he watched David's body move on its own. His legs seemed to twitch and shift, a loud thunk echoing through the room as his feet curled and his claws tapped against the floor. His legs burst out further, bending and holding to the ground. The legs of his boxers could barely hold the thick masses of his body, the fabric straining and splintering, starting to visibly tear as it tried. His arms were curled up near his head, his biceps pulsing as they pressed between his forearms and his body. His pecs pushed out larger and heavier with every breath that David took. His neck shifted and bent as his as his shoulders pressed outwards, rubbing to the bed. The creaks from the bed sounded through the room, clearly starting to buckle under David's weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler held his breath as he saw David's head pushing up, his horns making contact with the headboard of the bed. Despite the sudden motion, David was still enjoying his dream, and his shaft clearly indicated it. There had barely been any time he had blown his load all over, but it looked as though he was already building up for the next one. The shape stretched out from his boxers, hanging and bobbing loosely, strands of pre now dripping down onto the dragon's abs before sliding onto his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler clenched tightly onto the amulet as he shook his head, doing his best to get the rest of the sticky mess off of his face while he still could. He couldn't stand the thought of seeing it happen again. His brother had always overshadowed him, and it was maddening to see the gap growing with every passing second. His prize was clenched firmly in his hand. All he had to do now was creep out of the room, and put it to use. Tyler wiped his hands off against the walls before he slowly began to move back towards the door, both of his hands now holding onto the amulet as he tried to withdraw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he had closed the bedroom door, David's snores were sounding through it again. Tyler gave a sigh of relief as he moved away, his footsteps moving back to his room. As he moved, the reality of the situation sunk in. His caution quickly turned to excitement and exhilaration as he placed the amulet onto his neck, feeling it pressing against his skin as he dashed back to his own room as quietly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand was already reaching down into his pants by the time he reached his room. Without a second thought, Tyler was on the bed, both of his hands working as his shaft instantly sprang up in his grip. He closed his eyes as he began working, a quiet moan escaping his mouth as he began to jerk at himself, his hands sliding up and down along his length and squeezing at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never fantasized about being bigger before. His body had never been disposed towards any growth, and he never wanted to spend his time thinking about things that could only happen in his dreams. The most he had ever dreamed about was having some other muscled anthro, watching what they could do, maybe even getting close to one that he liked. But now that it was a possibility, his mind was completely focused on imagining what his own body could do. The idea of him looking into a mirror, flexing and showing off his body... Being able to lift things with ease... Even just growing faster and faster, slamming into the ceiling, and bursting out of the house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing quickened as he worked, his imagination driving him into a deeper lust than he had ever felt before. His shaft quickly surged out to its full length, 8 inches pushing up in front of him. He could only grin wider as he looked down at himself. While he had always been a bit impressive \u201cunder the hood\u201d, the thought of growing out even more drove him wild. He gripped at the tip with one hand, working and squeezing at it while the other moved to keep stroking along his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf David was still growing in his sleep, he would just have to grow faster. It wouldn't matter if he would have to stay awake all night. In fact, if the feelings in his stiff, leaking shaft were any sign, then he would enjoy it. All he knew was that he absolutely HAD to outgrow David before morning. The idea drove him to work faster and faster, the pleasure building and driving him desperately towards his release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fuck... Yes...\u201d He moaned out softly as his load splattered against the ground. In his excitement, he hadn't bothered to try to manage the mess he had made. He had cum harder than he ever had before, and his hand was dripping with his seed. He leaned back, his shaft still stiff as he slid into his afterglow. He grinned as an unfamiliar feeling seemed to spread out from his shaft, one of his hands clutching tightly onto the amulet as he felt it begin to work. \u201cYes... Grow me... Make me massive!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a vaguely similar setup to his brother's room with his bed, a mirror and a closet; it was always in a bit of a mess. The thoughts running though Tyler's mind were of growing bigger and being massive. But behind being the smaller brother, behind being the runt of the family and behind being stuck in his David's shadow for the rest of his life he wanted anything to be more confident in himself. It's true he was a bookworm, but it was much easier to pick up a book than it was a girl. He vented with envious eyes as his brother would go through multiple girls and have the nerve to keep going out and getting more. In terms of fishing, his brother was the Expert Angler and he was pathetically reeling his line in and throwing it back out because he couldn't get any. And its not like he wanted a slew of girls, just the one cute girl that came to the comic shop for some romantic, supernatural comic that he only carried because she liked it. It gave Tyler an excuse to see her once a month and it made lugging those heavy boxes back and forth in his SUV all the more worthwhile just cause he saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough after multiple bet he won with his brother, he would force Dave to stand outside his store in a super heroic costume to attract more clients, it usually does work, this time it also caught the certain glace of her. The comics she liked and her fawning over him, she must have liked big guys. After that day, he had tried desperately to get big in the past. But his efforts at the gym came with little to no fruition and he had practically given up on that. Jenny had given plenty of dismissive glances at Tyler, heck even at the register the talking was short... Short, heck when new customers came in they always look for the manager when he was clearly the owner. It was insulting that the world never saw him and only those that looked good got all the attention. He was certain that a spark must have been there. He just knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was then with those final thoughts, being her big man, her protector, Jenny's Knight in shining armor the unimaginable happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Starting from his hands, one hand to his shaft and the other to the amulet 'round his neck, a spicy hot surged from his fingertips that quickly spread to the rest of his body. A rumbling that came from his chest and his core. The feeling of growing bigger and more powerful as he fell to his bed with a definite THUD! His modest rectangular mirror on the wall, showing what his eyes could not believe. His deeply purple scales tightening as his whole frame was growing. The cracking and moving of bones, an initial pain that grew pleasure delighted his member as he began to grow in height, the horns on his head responding with a sharper and curved shape. Looking at himself, watching as his stretched skin began filling with volumes of muscle being poured in, similar to how you fill a balloon with water. Similar, but not quite as the form and definition of the muscle groups retained their visibility. From his cantaloupe-sized biceps and to his volleyball-sized thighs, he was a sight to behold. Bigger than the athletic jocks that picked on him in his dreaded high school days, he could certainly pass for a studly model or Grecian statue, his chiseled six-pack looked good in all the right places. Feeling himself up and around, all this power was his. It was crazy to see just moving his hands slowly up and down his muscled scaly body did the unrealness of him start becoming a reality. He was a built and sexy muscle dragon. It wasn't a dream, he wasn't fantasizing, it really was him. He hit a few poses his older brother would do and he liked what he saw. His shaft too got the special treatment  growing longer and thicker than anything he could have ever imagined on himself. It was longer than a ruler and thicker than a bottle of toothpaste. Pre was already forming, but Tyler's Willpower was stronger than that. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like lightning he dashed to his closet, moving things from side to side, looking for a prized treasure. For years he had kept this from his brother unknown, he probably one and only dirty little secret. In the back behind his various super hero costumes, a hangar covered in a black tarp that he tore from the closet bar, practically ripping it from the wall, crashing down. SMASH! Damn you were strong, but you hesitated briefly, hoping your brother wouldn't hear of you. But the gargantuan snore thundered the house from still and fell to white noise as your breathing quickened from your excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears ago, his brother graced those terror filled halls of their high school, where he was a veritable Lord and Master while Tyler alone, geeky and forgettable. David, being the jock that he was didn't stop at football, he pursued other areas of sport as well, such as basketball and baseball. But none quite like wrestling. His brother would bulk especially for wrestling season. Right after football, it would be a mad rush to put on more mass to make the wrestling team. His parents usually made it a family event when they could go, dragging me along to games here and there. But peeking over a book every now and then, Tyler remembered what it was like to see what happened when two indomitable forces collide as they tried to best one another. Like the heroes in his comic book, but without superpowers. It was happening in front of his eyes as he watched he brother twist and turn with a large bear of similar height and size. Though tougher around, his brother lifted him up, catching him off his guard and pinning him. He learned right than and there, and still remembers when they \"wrestle\" and roughhouse; his brother was no pushover and he had some serious moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the opaque black plastic material off the hanger, there in good condition was he brother's Senior year singlet bearing the schools colors: auburn orange with emerald green trim. It brought many memories of his brother displaying such power and strength. Things he wished he had, but now he did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnagging an old jockstrap, rolled up and hidden in his underwear drawer, he slipped that on. The breeziness of his bum exposed to the cold-hot air of his room felt oddly enjoyable. Tyler grinning broadly as he was pushing and arranging in his generous package to squeeze in to the tight pocket. Really looking and feeling the singlet in his hands, it was strange trying to figure how to get it on correctly without messing it up. His tail too had grown in size waved back and forth when he tried to put it on. He remained calm as slowly but surely let the slick, tight lycra hug his scaly body like a second skin. Pulling it here and there over his athletic torso and what were those things his brother called \"love handles\". He wasn't sure why but he loved the way the curves looked on him, you know that v shape upper body, slim waist but massive legs. Straightening out the pant legs part and then slowly stretching the straps over his muscled arms and fixing the bunching on his lats. Jumping to his mirror, he now had to step back and crouch a little to see himself in it when he would normally have to stand on some books just to barely see over the drawers and just have his diminutive horns on his head make it to a third of the way up. A mirror he used solely for fixing his headfur and to make sure his contacts were in good, but he stood there posing and feeling engrossed with power and strength. Tyler's bulge was even noticeable and he laughed a little, his voice an octave lower than usual. It gave him a quick chill, but he liked it as he tread lightly but quickly to his brother's other sanctuary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom they shared, but David hogged all the time. Tyler had to wake up early just to take a shower, leastwise his brother would be up showering and admiring himself a hour or two before he had to go back to the university. Though the bathroom had a full length mirror, he felt himself surge with power, striking poses and imagining himself beating up all the folks that picked on him in high school. They'd be sorry now, wouldn't they Tyler thought. He could command respect looking like this. Not overly big or chunky like his brother was when his brother begged him to drop him off at practice because he was late just a few days ago. He had a good three to four inches of muscle in his pecs as he looked profile. He looked damn good in that lycra! His snout wasn't buried in his pecs, though the thought crossed his mind to become big like that, a little self-control went a long way and he was comfortable at the moment. Though he walked funny because his center of gravity was off, his footfalls made thumping noises compared to when he made none at all before and his scenarios running through his head as to the best way to attract Jenny to him. O this was surreal on every level, pinching himself just to make sure it was all still real. Which he did, though he rubbed his arm, still stronger than he is familiar with. To think he used to struggle picking up one box of comics, flexing his arms in the mirror, he could probably lift four or five boxes of comics into his SUV with these guns. Nothing could take him away from the mirror but...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"O crap!\" he exclaims with a quick yell to whisper. The only thing that could pull him from his own adoration was the new shipment of comics, and possibly if a new batch of Jenny's favorite supernatural, romance came in, he could personal call and invite her in. She would see him, this hunk of meat and she'd run into his nice big arms and there'd she stay. O the idea of being with her, stirred his member as he was quickly, but carefully removing the singlet and hiding it in a box with some rare trading cards he used to collect, but still kept around for some reason. He slipped on what used to be very roomy boxers, that now felt very tight and cut into his side. Clearly these were a size or two too small as his member a bit flaccid was a couple of inches past his the left leg side. Perhaps he should have kept the jockstrap on Tyler wondered. He had to get changed quick to meet at the freight yard to get his shipment of new comics for the shop. He couldn't lounge around admiring himself like the Greek gods of ancient Greece, hell his brother was already doing that for him. Checking in on David, he silently opened the door to see he was still asleep, the smell of his spunk masculinity hit him like a wave. Judging with estimation, it seemed the growing had stopped and he was snoozing away like he often would. If David didn't have class (like he rarely showed), training sessions, football practice, bar nights with his teammates or intimate relations with a girl, he would be sleeping. Doing most of the housework pretty much fell on Tyler's shoulders, but as of late he had grown lax about it. He rolled his eyes but froze still as David turned to face him. His eyes still closed, a breath of relief and he began searching his brothers room for suitable clothes to wear. Like his clothes in his room would fit this beastly bod thought the snickering Tyler. Even though his clothes were baggy by choice for comfort, not even his Large black hoodie would fit him now, and he wore that practically every other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerusing his brother's disorganized drawers and closet space, keeping silent like a nerd on a panty raid, he kept delicate his hands to open and close the different drawers as to not make a single sound. He was beginning to learn how to control his newfound strength. Waking his brother would be absolutely dire with him being well over ten feet tall of brick blue muscle. He began making a small pile for himself of things he would try on, being quick and thorough knowing time was a factor. He paused for a moment when he came across a very revealing red male bikini swimsuit. He could have sworn his brother said he couldn't keep his lifeguard uniform from his junior summer job, he hated  it because the pay sucked but the only perk was legally being half naked. His white tank with a red cross symbol on it and this would be so sexy on him right now... He shook his head, he needed to hurry up. Closing the drawers and clutching his pile of clothes to his chest while sneaking out, he felt like he hit a gold mine. He didn't steal his brother's clothes often, but when he did it felt good. Back in his room he was trying on some different underwear, most of which wear either constricting his package or pinching his sides. He opted for his jockstrap, now pants were harder to come by. Tyler didn't know how he got out of there with some noisy track pants but they smelt awful knowing full well his bro hasn't done laundry in over a week. David, that lazy ass. Well, at least David also bought large exercising shorts in bulk. He wouldn't even know if Tyler took one of those. It wasn't even cold out, it was freaking spring! Tyler didn't feel comfortable just wearing some shorts and a sleeveless shirt. He wasn't on some exercise, plus what if someone saw him, recognized him even. Though his new chiseled square jaw and more than brawny facial features could give even his mother difficulty identifying him. But there was that chance that he couldn't risk and others growing curious, heck his brother alone might cause a stir on the local news. He shudders to think what could really happen, he hopes he will just be knocked out for the rest of the day perhaps the whole week which would be even better. Grabbing his wallet and keys, he takes some jerky from the pantry for some nourishment he felt ready to go. Grabbing some last minute things, like grabbing his brother's nice leather sandals (that fit him perfectly now) and his brother's university hoodie. Damn it felt weird leaving his house. Everything felt different now that he was so tall and ripped, he must have been at least 6 and a half feet tall, heck Tyler had to adjust the seat in his SUV and all the mirrors. He got an SUV because he liked being above the other cars, he was fucking flying above everything else being so high in his seat. He had to take the adjustors off the pedals that allowed him to drive the car when he was so small, but this was even an effort just to push the pedal gently without flooring it. Looking back at the house, some white spunk on the roof, an event he would like all too soon to forget he pulled out feeling the metallic amulet against his chest. It wasn't about what he wanted, it was what he needed for so long. To take charge of his life...</span></div></div>",

Tyler often wondered how David could go for hours upon hours training, either by lifting weights, running laps or doing scrimmages he always seemed to have an excess amount of energy and vitality that after an 8 hour work day in his comic shop Tyler was often exhausted and he pushed himself to do all the extra bits to running a business like taking inventory, restocking and what not. Tyler had a nerdy fox assistant that would come in during the summer, but often it was just him and maybe his brother if he lost enough bets. There was just no end to all the good this amulet had done for Tyler and he was singing its praises, turning the radio to a popular station with hot new music, mainstream sure like what David likes, but he was in the mood to just blast the speakers in your car. Dancing in your seat, you don't care who looked. You are fucking awesome and you know it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Tyler really just think that... He turned his radio off, was he changing? In more ways than physically he wondered. He still felt himself an intellectual one, though a Geek with bulging biceps to spare, he wondered what a certain green hulking hero would be thinking about in his predicament. Its not like he was going on some crazy smash-up-the-town spree or nothing. He just felt, well, good. Tyler didn't think it was possible but... he really did feel good about himself. A flashback to him days ago remembering those fitness commercials around new years and how you would blow them off, because you tried it and failed. Well, regardless how it happened, being big, fit and well a smoldering hot piece of dragon meat, he could certainly say he felt good about being who he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like he didn't have to wait for things. He felt like he could take charge of a situation and come out on top. He felt like he was in control of his life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never felt like that before. Driving in an autopilot fashion, Tyler was going over and over in his mind all the feelings he had over the years. None of them really \"positive\" per say, but this right here, right now. It was totally a step in the right direction. He often had deep thoughts while driving, it was one of the few things that could allow him to clear his mind from the problems at work, at home well his life in general. He didn't think he could put up with his brother much longer with the way things were going. The back and forth pranking and roughhousing was starting to get out of hand. Their land serious bout, had David's fist through a wall. But now, how is was feeling, is this what David feels like, like all the power. Powerful. Unstoppable. In Charge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think about it more, he had crossed the heavy tracks and was in the freight yard where sometime after 5 in the morning, a full hour and a half he usually wakes up to beat David to the shower, the train with his goods on it usually arrives. A look back in the dark, and he swears up and don't that lady luck was just screwing with him sometimes, laughing at all his misfortunes. It was about 5 then and he was mental preparing himself to flash the ID, sign the release form and pack up to go to the comic shop. Thought he debated whether or not to claim to be the usually five foot purple dragon that is awkward or be a hot stud delivery boy hired to handle it. He was flip flopping and couldn't decide, even after the course toss granted the coin shot through the window over thirty feet away. Let's see what the night guard would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to stroll or strut (though he was sure he was acting like a duck/peacock, not imitating David's signature power strut at all), avoiding his normal hunched over, poor posture drag he came to the window where you'd have to show identity and sign the pick-up form. Piece of cake... Such a LIE. F my life!!! Its Murray the night guard that is all chummy with the old me, Tyler wondered how guys past their prime could still be into comics (granted he still liked his atomic age stuff that is hard to come by, but still it made him wonder)...</span></div></div>",

He wasn't overly obese but portly was a good word for it, as some belly went over his belt with his nightstick and mace. This guy was pretty big too, he gave the term \"flying honey badger\" new meaning with his ruthless air combat in the Air Force. Though that was years behind him, he could click between normal and military like a light switch. No gun on this guy he grinned. \"Ack, who what,\" scrambling to find his hat and planting it on his head, the moment the hat hit his head his face turned all serious and the tone in his voice did too. \"Sheesh, can't you read the sign,\" he returned sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the window area in general, Tyler shook his head in either stupidity or meekness. The guy than threw out a sign attached to a string, \"Ring Bell, Hours 9am-9pm. Tyler rolled his eyes knowing that if you were picking up packages he didn't need to wait between those hours. That was one of the reasons why Murray was there in the first place. \"Dude, I'm here to pick up some boxes for the comic shop.\" Sure he dealt with hobby crafts and board top games, but everyone knew that the real money maker was the comics, some people have no idea how the comic industry is such a money maker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking in his brain, \"O yes yes. I hardly recognized you David. Its been a long while since you've come to pick up comics. Is your brother here?\" What the flying fuck thought Tyler as he was reeling with anger and frustration, he just couldn't catch a break tonight. In any case, Murray was right though. Its been several months or so since David had come here to pick up comics. It must have been over three months ago when Tyler came down with that terrible flu, and being a dragon getting the influenza could be a terrible thing, even life threatening. Heck, dragons had great immunity systems compared to most animals out there, but there are some things that are just as bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's back home.\" Short, sweet and cool he played, adding a deep firmness to his voice when he said 'no\" gave him such pride. Like one of those spy movies, next a drug deal gone bad breaks out in the freight yard and he'd have to save someone while taking some of the bad guys out with just his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, is he okay? I hope he isn't sick,\" Murray said with a hint of genuine concern. More than he gets from his brother, Tyler thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought I'd just give him a break. He was a tired mess last night. Something about 're-shelving'. He practically collapsed on the couch, I brought him to his room and stuff. Saw he had a pick up tonight on his wall calendar, so I thought he'd at least should get some sleep. I can handle the heavy lifting, don't ya think,\" he said putting his hands on his waist. That's how a real brother should act. The real David would probably just leave him on the couch and the old Tyler would be rushing in the morning to get the boxes back in the store and shelved properly before it opened. Sometimes he wonders if David is just a good-for-nothing that's too big for his own good. He sighed easing his inner tensions, now's not the time to go down that road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O poor guy. He works hard you know,\" of course he knows, he's Tyler though he couldn't suppress his broadening grin for being complemented. \"Well, don't want to keep you longer than you need to be. Okay ID and sign here, here and date with initials and you're good to go. Hitting the form with ease, it was a different story actually writing, he wasn't prepared for this as a caveman could have done better than this all wibbly wobbly shaky mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh thanks,\" looking at the form a bit dismayed, but gulping his comments he said, \"to the left fifth door down. You can move your vehicle closer if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that's okay I got it,\" the new Tyler gave a broad wave with a flex mixed it. He couldn't get over having a body this big and powerful before. It really felt in all terms good. And why did he fourth door, usually Murray just tells him the storage number, heck they are located above all the doors. Did he think David was stupid or something? He chuckled a little at the passing thought. Now the old Tyler, would have driven his SUV to the large door opening of the warehouse and made trips back and forth with the heavy boxes. Sure he could have just had the manufacture's just ship directly to his storefront, but no he deals in specialized comics that are hard to get and hard to find. That was the only way he would ever see Jenny and darn it he was dedicated to his work. Passionate about comics, he wanted everyone to be happy, he searched the ends of the earth or his contacts to get someone what they wanted. That's how you keep clients and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocating his boxes, they are relatively smaller than the crates and large boxes for furniture, he managed to grab all five of them with little difficulty and plop them in the trunk. Not even breaking a sweat, it would have taken the old Tyler over five minutes taking one box at a time, back and forth. He was radiating pride and self-satisfaction. Its been way too long going through life without a bod like this. Everything was falling into place and he'd never be little again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrapping in his seat, and slapping a smile on his face he waved off to Murray as he drove away to his comic, hobby &amp; games shop...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pulling into town, and across from a strip mall of sorts, Tyler's Comic, Hobby and Game Shop resided. A little over 5 years ago, he used to come here to work as a part-timer for what used to be an old Arcade that dealt with various items of Geekdom; such as trading cards, action figures and the prized comics. Though much has changed since it used to be where he would spend what felt like most of his childhood playing games with a handful of quarters. If he wasn't reading, gaming was next on the list. Even going so much as to working part-time at said Arcade during his high school years. But from a bad turn of events, lightning striking a nearby transformer, a horrible power outage damaged most of the games. An arcade without games just couldn't make it and they had to close up shop from the ruthless realty company that owned most of the town. The Realty Owner's son, acting like he owns the town was none other Fang, and o how he despised that wolf. Tyler always tried to find the good in the everyone, but there seemed like no ounce of good in that wolf's hulking body. Maybe, Tyler would get bigger and in a couple of rounds he would defeat that lummox. He kept the large neon lights, though broken, that said 'Shenanigans' in respect for the old ram by the exact same name who had owned the very same store in he had. Though for Tyler, the store's keys went from the ram's arcade to a horse tool shop to a butterfly's bakery bookshop and then to his scaly calls. Fresh out of high school and still deciding on what college to go to when he felt the calling for the shop. Sure people said he shouldn't do it or you should wait until you have a degree, but in a flash he felt the calling to build a shop there, a fire to do what no one else thought he could do. But that never stopped him and his determination from getting a small business load and building a reputable business that was doing well, always paying his bills and making his name in the town where everyone stood over him... But that was a story for another time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was on his mind as he was unlocking the door and disarming the alarm. It saved him a whole four seconds to not have to get the stepstool so he could reach the alarm and the majority of the things on the shelves. Taking the boxes from his SUV parked in the back, he put all five boxes on the tables where he set up for the tabletop gamers and hobbyists wanted to build and construct He first checked the comics and count them to make sure his order was filled properly. Taking special notice to Jenny's comics he would swim happily making a nice place for them out in front so she could see them. With everything accounted for had he to re-shelf his stock. Now this was probably the most problematic part of his job as he had take some down move everything over to their proper places, large sorters on the side divided everything by hero name. That took several hours just by his old self, but Tyler wanted to make sure everything was perfect for Jenny. He could sort everything into the proper place later, he wasn't that anal compulsive. He took the comics he took out and put them in the back room where his special stock was. Putting up most of the new comics away, he went to his main display where he put the New things he wanted to sell, and Jenny's out in front, but no to the side, Tyler though so she'd have to open to him while he was at the register. At the register, already counted and put in the safe with a till set at fifty, was the reason why he didn't reshelf last night. The controller to his this new game, though outside of his usual action-fantasy RPG, this first-person shooter game had an in-depth character creation system that he always delighted in making multiple different characters to his liking, subconsciously emulating what he wanted in himself. There weren't enough slider bars to match his muscles and studliness. He could just gag, but he was growing more and more accustomed to self-praising when the time called for it. It must have been around eight in the morning when he finished making sure everything was just right, even flattening of the cardboard boxes that could be used later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole two hours before he turned on the Open neon sign this Saturday morning. No one really came in that early, so he felt himself a bit hungry and in need of a good power walk. The town with its 500,000 or so other in habitants began to stir, with cars driving back and forth, early morning joggers and the nearby park setting up their monthly Cultural Art Festival with music, crafts and miscellaneous goods to be bought and sold. Stretching out his arms and legs, flexing a bit as he did so almost instinctually waiting for the pedestrian walk light to change. As the light changed, a smack on my ass, as a Cougar woman ran past me, making kiss face and a call me motion with her free hand. Giving her an odd look and than flicking my tail around, a sticky note attached to it with a name and phone number with a lipstick kiss mark on it. As much as Tyler wanted to attracted women, he hoped he would be more of a sight for ladies around his age. Walking to the strip mail were various places...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He felt the reason why Murray, a long time customer of his, didn't recognize him was because of his clothes. Sure his rugged good looks were new too, but he wanted people to see the new him and not just \"his brother\". O the thought of being compared to his obnoxious brother steamed him a bit. Tyler would have to have his own look, because as much as he secretly admired his brother, he wanted to be sure people would think it was him. That and he wanted to keep whatever part of his identity that wasn't changed by his beefiness while still proving that it was personality and not the looks; while we all know having good looks certainly doesn't hurt. The feeling of confidence was a new but fleeting emotion for Tyler, as some of his old thoughts wanted to spoil his fun. Also, he couldn't walk in his brother's clothes all day, they smelt like gym socks. Never having really spent much time here, you know working his own shop and all, his brother never really knew how much he made, only that he could handle the bills and the store front because he rarely bought himself new clothes. But hell with a body like this, you gotta look your best too. Not in these hand-me-down workout clothes. Approaching one of the stores randomly, was this intimate adult store with revealing pieces of clothes and outfits. Walking right past it, Tyler wasn't thinking that right away, but his member pulsed at the thought of having Jenny in his room. Maybe another day when his desires outweighed his needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next shop was Maximo Urban Fashion. He found himself in a world of slick new clothes with that street \"cool\" look to them. Fashion Baggy Jeans, fashion polos and various other things that shouted \"Look at me!\". Though Tyler walked around, he didn't pick anything up. The star-nosed mole gave him a glance and he was like \"o yeah!\" and Tyler was like out of there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh, he wanted attention, but from everyone under the sun, sheesh. Maybe this was a lot harder than he thought. Tyler wondered if David goes through what he was going through. Rolling his eyes, probably not since he's too cocky and used to it, he must think the world is his oyster or some thing like that. The next store was all about shoes, not interested. New Bay he thought was a good place to start. It had everything, he liked that with the clothing being very plain and while not having brand names plastered everywhere. He liked that it was clean and cut, he wanted to be himself and being a street thug or slut wasn't one of them. He found some nice khakis, the kind that snug under his tail nicely. A soft but comfortable orange, plaid button up shirt. That paired with his purple scales was always such a striking combination. He had been too afraid to do anything so bold before, but he just wanted her attention for him and if that meant changing it up a bit than so be. Sure still conservative but comfortable, he left getting things he know he would like for his 'New You' look. There would be time to go all ham when they were more intimate, but now he just wanted the spark to go both ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically a bulldozer, he ran with such vigor to get to his store and changed. Using his personal bathroom to hide him changing, he couldn't very well let people see a half naked stud undressing through the storefront windows. Though, everyone has a price he thought, looking at the amulet, he could get bigger and desired by all, he could be set for life just because he was an irresistibly big and sexy deep purple dragon. His scales would glisten in the light as he put on a show all about him... Slapping his face, keep it together he thought out loud. These thoughts were not his normal thoughts but his mind was growing increasingly dirty as the faint idea of making himself an object of other people's desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his clothes off, he could smell his musk, now masculine and powerful spread all around him. Taking off each piece of clothing and feeling himself up as he did. Tyler couldn't get over how each pore and scale moved with such strength. All of it was his, he found himself intoxicated with his own smell and his hard on not easy to miss. Practically 13 inches, now fifteen from his rubbings, Tyler couldn't stop himself anymore. Giving himself a nice jerk off before work, he could get used to this. It was his bathroom anyway. He moaned as he gave into his most primal of desires. Doing so warmed him all over, and not just his member but then something hit him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The energy and surge of heat breaking from his tips to his core, yes it was the same feeling of the first time he grew. From his diminutive five foot nothing to a six and a half foot tall dragon stud, this new growth was about as strong and as pleasurable as the last time. His bones and muscle breaking and reforming, the filling felt a little different this time. Perhaps he was starting to get used to having the weight and the muscles on him he was feeling a bit more powerful and stronger. Feeling his chest pump, cupping it with both of his clawed hands, from a comfortable four to a pumped six inches out his body filling in bigger and more bulkier than before. His scales stretching to accommodate his new bulk, his athletically, sexy slim bod was putting on the pounds as more mass and power filled him so. Finishing his load, his member craving more, the bathroom sprayed with white gunk, there wasn't enough air fresher to take that smell away. Twitching at now fifteen inches slightly hard with the width of a soda can, it was a veritable monster swinging your equally monstrous thighs. You thought you were big this morning, but now you feel super pumped and empowered. Your shoulders widening and become more defined to accommodate your added muscle mass. Your arms wider than water melons and some veins popping out on your forearm, you look like you've been pumping iron since  you were born. You were jacked and ripped with pumped muscles showing just about anyone you were in charge and physically superior. Looking in the mirror and posing like your brother, David, you looked like he did after his first year at the university. He was packed on with muscle and bulk, not an immoveable wall, but an XL beefcake with the right width and thickness to make any woman want you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that him again? Thinking that woman would want him? He looked like a couple more protein shakes would make him burst. He held his snout, \"What would Jenny think? Would she finally latch on and be his? Is this watch she wanted? Or deep down, was this what you wanted? Your thoughts waving in and outs like the waves on a beach. There you were a completely naked, pumped muscle hunk that could have and do anything he wanted. Damn it felt so good being so big and in charge. Going a full flex with his arms, he could lick his bicep and taste the manliness off of him. No one could refuse him. His chest puffed with pride, pinching himself with his powerful forearms and sharper claws. Still not a dream, and if it were he would never want it to end... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking a bit more clearly, he figured he hadn't much grown in size height wise, but with his growth this time around did do was max out the muscles and pump them up to immense sizes. His center of gravity had changed again and he squatted on the floor to go through his new clothes that would have been comfortably fitting on his athletic body, would now be fit and taut to his body. Remembering the cramped space in the jockstrap, it would be next to impossible to fit his cock in now. He did think ahead and pulled out XXL Boxers, just barely having room for his soft, firm buttock and his now fourteen inched soft muscle into the cooling boxer shorts. He didn't think he would given into the temptation so soon to jerk off again, but he hoped he could keep himself under control. His pumped biceps couldn't fit into his new orange plaid shirt, so he had to cut the sleeves off and with his puffed chest he couldn't button it up all the way. This wasn't very professional Tyler thought. He couldn't recall his brother ever being dressed professionally or formal, unless we are counting Prom or his college interview when he went in a 3-piece suit, his bulk begging to be let out. Banging a clenched fist in the wall, he shook the foundation a little, retracting and looking bug-eyed at the dust falling from the ceiling. Leaving the top four buttons unbuttoned because they simply couldn't reach while even with a slightly large waist, not entirely wasp-like anymore. And sudden movements or jerks could break the buttons. He never thanked so much in his life when he made the choice to switch the regular khakis for the ones with a stretchable waist. That new belt was just making it on the last loop. His brother's sandals dying underneath my probably size 12 feet when they were for size 10. Not much choice but to go barefoot, he did his best to clean up his mess with the mop and pail, reaching the ceiling was much easier while being able to stand at a good seven feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up and turning on your Open neon sign, he kind of missed being just athletic, the clothes fit better as he was tugging at the cut arm holes to fit better, adjusting his member to not appear so much on his pant leg, standing behind the counter all day would be fine. He sighed as the pumped hunky purple dragon stood behind the glass counter waiting for his first customers of the day.</span></div></div>",

It was Saturday morning, the local chapter of some ThunderWarHammer 60K always came in bright in early to get started on their tabletop game of science fiction military conquest. With characters in armor way to bulky and huge, it was impossible for it to believable, though any more bulk on himself and he'd find his snout buried in pecs and virtually no clothes that could fit him. Waving them in, he hoped David would be okay. He got what he wanted, no self-control at all. His brother would get so big he would destroy the house. Some freak accident, collect insurance and find a nice loft somewhere in uptown where Jenny and him could be alone at last. His daydream took form and then dissipated as the group leader was at the desk, \"Excuse me, hey meathead. Anyone there,\" snapping his fingers, this crane in his large glasses and sweater vest trying to get Tyler's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, \"Sorry, it's been a long night. What do ya need, Ned?\" Tyler asked, my voice a half octave lower that rumbled in my chest and reverberated a strong baritone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit startled, you could see his eyes shifting to Tyler and then behind Tyler and back again. To help me remember repeat customers, I would often find a sing song rhyme-like way to respond to their names. Tyler knew that and David did not. Ned had over the years, though annoyed understood that Tyler did that as well as two and two wasn't adding up. Sure that is what Tyler would say, but that wasn't Tyler standing behind the counter, it couldn't have been. It doesn't look like him at all. Ned brought his wing like fingers to a pause to his lower beak, thinking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello earth to Ned,\" Tyler said, mimicking the snapping motions in front of his face, though being polite and stupid to his level with name calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed flagged his posse to start setting up at the tables, by moving them closer together. The screeching on the floor, Tyler covered his ears, he yelled, \"What the fuck I tell ya about dragging those tables.\" He stormed from beyond the counter, \"let me do it!\" Lifting the other tables with ease, not even needing anyone else's help. He hated it when they did that, and usually Tyler would have the tables up and ready without all this fuss. He could not believe he allowed himself to curse at a customer already. Ned's rag tag group huddled in the corner in awe and the easily performed feat, when it took all four of them just to push the table. Pretending to clap his hands from dust, Tyler returned to the counter with Ned giving a grin...</span></div></div>",

Though you doubt anyone would believe him, it might attract the wrong kind of people, Tyler thought. Thinking a way to get Ned off your tracks you say, \"So want do you want, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grows narrowed eyed, and in his irksome chirpy voice replies, \"My X-52 sniper swarm, limited edition XY armor model...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying the dumb card, his brother's favorite go-to card when something wrong happens, \"A what? I don't think we have that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding my glee and Ned's frustrated face. \"Its from the Z series. You told me it would be in today?\" Ned tried to play a fast one, but you were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Yo, this is my first time here. Helping out my cousin while he's out at some convention thing. He said he'd pay me good money to man his shop for the weekend. Don't make me throw you out for causing trouble.\" I gave a glare and my best 'contained anger' look for when David was displeased. His brother never overly opened his opinion on things he didn't like, but his facial expressions and body language said it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you knew my name... Tyler keeps his special orders in the back, behind the curtain. It should be a fairly large box. It has a giant X-52 on the front with a robot suit in red and black...\" Ned put feathered fingers to his temple, massaging them. Ned had been a faithful but very particular, high maintenance customer that was always bothersome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler knew exactly what Ned wanted, he thought about screwing with him further and bring out something similar but in a different color. But he had had his fun and hopefully Ned would by the story and drop his accusations. Bringing it out, it was probably one of Ned's largest orders and his most expensive to date. Had to import this from a contact in Singapore. He'd never drop that kind of cash on toy. Bringing it back first, Tyler made his best vacant expression when he said, \"Is that it? The card hear says its for a Zed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the item towards him, his eyes glossed over behind his thick glasses, he said softly, \"Yes, that's it. Aww after weeks of waiting its finally arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, enjoy.\" Tyler watched on as the tall, but lanky crane had great difficulty balancing the package to the tables where he showed his friends, they \"geeked\" out and what not and that little fiasco was over. A few more people came in some with questions, others purchasing things on reserve though they all couldn't stop looking at him. Who was this big dragon standing behind the counter? He couldn't tell them the truth, hell the more he thought about it he was looking at the door constantly for some suits or policemen to barge in and arrest him. I played the whole 'cousin' story named Ty, almost having slipped up once by saying his real first name with Ned in earshot. Ned was lurking around waiting for him to slip up. A busty rabbit girl slipped her number to Tyler when he was ringing up her order. His face blushed as she giggled out the door saying how cute she thought he was. Granted that customer collected rare plushies and dolls, no doubt wanting to add Tyler to her collection of stuffed toys. You'd be surprised about the variety of people who come in and out of a place like this. I know most think that comic shops are mostly for nerds and geeks, but its really for everyone. There's a regular guy who rides a chopper, tough as nails, that comes in for all the new Ghost Biker comics. There was a little lull, and he was waiting for the chance to call Jenny and let her know her things were in. She always came when he called, though not in the way you would think. He had a book of contacts and sign up lists with people who wanted to be notified of various things, he circled, highlighted and once upon a time ago put heart shapes around her name and contact number. This was one number he was glad to have. His member stirred, but  shook it silent as he kept the curtain half open while making personal, I mean business calls to valued customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsyching himself up to call the woman of his destiny, he was sweating like crazy punching the numbers in the spiral-wired phone...</span></div></div>",

Hey you wouldn't mind waiting a little after five today. Had to cover my friend's shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for one of our favorites,\" stupidly winking over the phone like she could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, see you after five. Tell Tyler I said hi David...\" It clicks and she hangs up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought I was David, dropping the phone from the side of his face and to the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler punched the door frame with the curtain. The building shook again, the lights flickering a little this time. This wasn't right, this was wrong, all wrong. He began to slide down the door frame to the ground as best as his bulk would allow. Trying to make sure he was still himself, but he wasn't. If he still wanted to be himself he would be the dwarf that everyone ignores and looks past. Just because a dragon is five foot tall doesn't mean he doesn't feel things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time when Tyler felt at his lowest he would probably cry to himself to help ease the pain, hoping it would go away. His brother never knew anything outside of what he saw in his own reflection! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the years of neglect... All those moments of being in his brother's shadow... Sometimes not even good enough to be related to his brother. All the knowledge he had not being worth a damn most times... His brother had everything he wanted. He knew if his parents had a favorite, it would probably be David. He had the looks that could be in magazines, the charisma to get anything he wanted and the attitude to not be a doormat for people. Did he just let people walk all over him, because he wasn't comfortable with it. Surely, other people could see that but no one ever showed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in his life, he had the power to change that all, holding the amulet in his hand and looking at its heart-shaped jeweled center. Now that he had the look and the feel of his brother, was he still so unhappy? Was he to always remain unsatisfied and discontent?</span></div></div>",

The vaulted ceilings with expert acoustics probably makes the howling even more loud, echoing it around the mansion. Both of his parents at work like they always are. His mother, on some jet to some mega-conglomerate building and his father in a board meeting miles away. \"WHERE IS MY AMULET!!!\" he snarls with his sharp-teeth muzzle. Flipping his bed over in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking protocol, the mousy maid with curly hair entered the room. \"Master Fang. Please what is the matter? I am sure we can find what you are looking for.\" Probably thinking he easily left it someplace and forgot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown to his underwear, the muscles on his black furred body rumbled with power, \"Palmetto!!! What did I say about entering my room without my permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she cried, \"sorry so sorry Master Fang. Shielding her eyes and looking for the doorknob to shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was searching for it all day yesterday at school after practice and I've search high and low for it here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The staff had to clean this whole floor Thursday. Your father said he wanted the house looking perfect for a prospective new client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the door off its hinges to the floor that was covered with the mess from his earlier tantrum. \"WHAT!?! You were in my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Master Fang but we had to clean everywhere. You had so much trash and rubbish about, it was the only way to get the smell out. We even had to put in new rugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang did not care there were new rugs. He didn't even notice that his room was pristine and clean. The world revolved around him. How dare they touch his stuff; the absolute nerve. the audacity!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stole my preciously chained necklace, the one with a celtic knot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your what? I'm sorry sir, but we cleaned out everything. Anything that was considered trash or not befitting the standards of Master Fang was thrown out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was not trash... Standards? What standards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you set them so high, Master Fang. Anything that was cut, or torn or under $100 dollars was thrown out. We can get you another piece of jewelry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" he bubbled with lower fury, \"there was nothing else like that, it could never be replaced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing her head, her tears streaming down her face, not wanting him to see her face, \"My grandest most sincere apologies, sir. Had we but known a mere silver necklace had such sentimental value. We didn't know. Please Master Fang don't be too cross with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing his arms above his massive chest as they lifted up and down while he breathed, he watched her weep, taking in all the moments of her suffering. He sneered at the torment he caused. His mind raced with alternative scenarios, like an Interactive Story, picking and choosing what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are dismissed! Leave me at once!\" He got dressed, already seeing the effects of what would happen while being away from his precious amulet for so long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started years ago, quite honestly the only gift he ever received from his father when he was younger was the silver chained necklace adorned with a celtic knot. Though at the time, unbeknownst to anyone this amulet was magical and gave the wearer untold amounts of power and strength. The amulet lost in time was received by his father on a business trip from the British Isles. It was considered a valuable heirloom and was given to Fang's father for payment for one of his earlier real estate deals. His father didn't see it that way, and bulldozed the castle that was there to make way for another metropolitan success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone knew of Fang the brutish college football star, he was also a little nobody. Rough with everyone he met, spoiled, not a real friend in the world. His parents practically abandoning him to be raised by the house staff. He grew angry and resentful at his parents and the world. He was quiet, reserved and picked on everyone just for being a wolf. Wolves in this world were feared by all with tales and stories of them being treacherous and evil. You try going through kindergarten, with all the fairytales they tell involving wolves being the bag guy at every turn. They made him out to be the bag guy and he bore the label well, like a Scarlet Letter to be seen by all. Though that didn't last long as he may have been fast and quick-witted for his age, he was still scrawny and small and in the mad world we live in there is always gunna be someone bigger than you. Another bully, an alligator came to the school, a new kid that was just as confused and upset, put Fang in his place. Losing his first real right, a T-bone over his blackened eye, his father gave him that silver chained celtic knot to raise his spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough over the first couple of days, several weeks really, Fang's family began to see a change in him. Growing bigger than all of the other kids and only in middle school, he learned his place real quick in this dog eat dog world. Bouncing between private schools for his rough, ill-mannered behavior, it was finally encouraged to put that 'growing boy' to good use in sports where his feats of pummeling and tackling could be put to good use. Fang became the wolf everyone respected out of fear. Fang knew by then how the celtic knot worked and during sometimes when he took it off for a couple of days his overall mass would decrease and would go down. He liked being big so he wore it most times, hidden under his shirt. Obviously visible in the locker room showers with the guys, but no one asked questions. It was his secret to his success that he guarded carefully... That is until now...</span></div></div>",

Taking his hot red convertible today, he needs to find his amulet. Hopefully it hasn't been to long and sold to some idiot that doesn't know what kind of power it possesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking a few, donation place, he wouldn't be caught dead in he stumbles into the old thrift shop in little Chinatown on the outskirt of uptown. Many tigers and lions roamed about here and he had to be extra careful. It was practically enemy predator territory and he was in the heart of it. Knowing full well he'd have to reserve his strength just so he could get his amulet if there was the slightest chance it fell into the wrong hands though he hoped he wouldn't have to come to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawning some shades over his piercing gold yellow eyes, he approached the store front as low-key as an animal of his size could. He was still plenty big probably bigger than that cobalt dragon on the same football team as him, but another day or two and he could lose his advantage thought Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was dark with minimal lighting, incense smoke streams finding his way to his nose was rendering any of his natural senses fairly useless at the moment. He didn't have to smell though, just see it and he could make it his again. He could sense it though but it would still need to be close though. He had be in possession of the magical celtic knot for so long that it had formed a bond with him, not that it could choose who it bonded with but something that happened over time. Reaching the glass display case with the jewelry and the valuables. Scanning the box, his sense or instinct directing him to an empty space, his body yearning to reunite with the amulet, grew shocked and he was unexplainably loosing strength and even on his knees collapsed, one could still see his bulk heaving up and down with each breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the back behind semi-sheer veils, a jaded tiger woman with an oriental headfur style and fan emerge from the back, the incense smoke trails moving away from her. Her eyes were daggers falling upon him, but Fang too weak to see the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her friend covering most of her face, her tiger eyes sharp and quick. Speaking coyly, \"So you must be without magic that has been spent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCryptic and not in the mood for cheeky gals, \"Piss off lady, magic or no magic that amulet was mine, where is it. I can feel that it was here...\" His voice was meek, but a gravely serious tone persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are dealing with forces you can not dare comprehend lupe one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap, where is my amulet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waves her fan rabidly with a quick laugh, \"You sound so sure I have your answer, yet you have no answers yourself. You are reeking of magic wolfkin and I can only tell it is of no use... Your kind is stubborn enough. Leave before things grow beyond mess you have already made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to pull himself up the glass case with weakened strength but with re-ignited fury and purpose, \"I can't stop. I must find it. Its means everything to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her back to him, \"You didn't have anything to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing all of his strength he put his paw to her collar and turned her around in a quick motion, making sure she was looking at him when he said, \"I am not nothing...\" Collapsing and losing his grip, he fell to the floor of the dark shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her fan and whispering, \"Maybe you aren't after all...\" Clapping the silk fan in the air she disappears in jade green smoke as figures emerge from the shadows. Large tigers with expressionless faces each take an arm of the still large wolf and drag him deeper into the shop...</span></div></div>",

A slight elation, it was just a dream that suddenly shatters as it is not of a celtic knot but of a Chinese dragon biting another dragon in a never ending loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is called wisdom's cycle. Meaning one thing feeds another while another thing feeds on it. One is all and all is one. One cannot survive without the other while the other cannot survive without it. The give and take. I believe the terms in the street is 'dog eat dog'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I in a lecture hall,\" Fangs says while looking up. A younger tiger with a similar comparison to the tiger he spoke with in the shop, but her eyes and the way she carries herself are different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No a shrine, a wellspring for magic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he sees multiple stone statues of various creature and sizes, torches glowing cyan colored fire. A singular gold statue in the middle with a sort of alter in the enclosed space. He couldn't see an exit to speak of other than the look of stars and moonlight from the skylight letting more light into the room. \"Magic? That's not real...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice echoed, \"O but it is.\" A laugh took form behind him as the tiger woman before with the silken fan, he backed away from her towards the younger tiger girl in a half kimono and skirt. Moving back he noticed he wasn't nearly as bulky as he used to be, all of his muscle practically gone, how long was he out for, Fang wondered. \"So it seems the Purification ritual was a success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the young tiger said softly, \"he did live through it. His bond with the celtic magic has been cut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, \"Celtic magic? You mean my knot, my amulet, there was nothing wrong with it on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her fan let a torrent of wind flush around the room putting out the torches. \"Fool, you could have died...\" Letting the words sink into the darkness, there was movement from behind him. After a couple of moments, the flames seemed to reignite slowly and all at once, the young tiger girl appeared in an awkward pose with sweat upon her brow. \"You had become dependent upon it, eating away at the manasource of the world for years. You were a servant to the amulet and its base desires, not your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was a bit caught up in the amulet, he didn't realize how he was revolving his life around the amulet for all these years. Remembering all the things he had done, all the pain and suffering he had caused, the amulet amplified his most wicked of traits. His head pinged and panged with inverted memories of the past, he was now on the outside looking in at what a monster he had truly become. The young tiger went to him trying to hold and comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him Leena. He must suffer through his own failures,\" the tiger lady snapped, returning her fan to its habitual position that covered half her face. Though hesitant, the young tiger girl patted him again on the back and withdrew to the outer circle. Tossing and turning, he felt the acts of his evilness take form in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs what looked like a giant ball of slime it rumbled and sprouted into what he looked like days ago. The big wolf behemoth that he used to be... Everything else seemed to disappear in the room except him and the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could sense a fear that always existed, but taking action now and over twenty years of fear, rooted him to the floor. The truly monstrous gloop took on a wolf-like face slushing and sloshing into a muzzle with words spitting out with pops. \"Failure... Weakling... Pathetic... Unworthy... Weak...\" Trying to cover his pointed ears with his paws, he wanted it all to go away like an awful dream, no nightmare that he could wake up and his troubles be gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark blob laughing otherworldly was disturbing to say the least and was beginning to make his way towards Fang one step at a time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was trying everything to convince himself it wasn't real... He was trying so hard to hide from his fears... He couldn't do anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightness on the breeze whispered gently in his ear, the voice of the young tiger girl, \"Be strong, remember who you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice faded as soon as it had come. Be strong? How could he ever be strong against that thing. Nothing could stand up against it and take it down. He was the quarterback and that was a linebacker gunning for him. The way he could console himself was to try and think of things that made him happy. Though few and seldom he found self remembering the time he was on vacation with his family. The last time his family really did anything together where he was free to be himself. No expectations, no threats and no fears...</span></div></div>",

While playing around the island, he found little whirlpools and puddles that were losing their water from the tides changing from high to low. He found gasping for the life in the sea was a pair of fish stuck in a puddle quickly evaporating from the Sun's mighty rays. Finding his bucket, he tried desperately to try and move both of the fish back in the ocean. But the pail was far too heavy. Soon the bucket's handle broke forcing the fish back into their small puddle that would surely be their doom. Taking it upon himself this young wolf pup, he went back and forth, back and forth refilling the puddle with water so the fish would live. After what seemed like an hour, he was growing tired, his energy mostly spent, the breath nearly out of him he still continued on for several more trips. Curious what their son was doing, his parents wondered over to ask what he was doing that was tiring himself out. Explaining as best as he could heaving in and out with deep breaths dragging the bucket filled with water. Soon his father put the fish in the bucket and returned them to the sea. Seeing them go in, he collapsed in his mother's arms and he had a long nap... For the next couple of moments, he could see images from over the years of the rare acts of kindness that helped to cover up his fears. He was afraid of being alone... He was afraid of not being strong enough... He was afraid of losing his family...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly throughout that fear, he was able to survive and overcome all odds. When he was playing football, when it was the last few minutes, and the enemy near to a field goal to win the game, he passed through the walls and acted when it really mattered. He persevered with his inner strength, and though not measured in pounds or inches, it was worth more than all the trophies, all the fake friends and all the things he possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out at the slimy wolf ready to engulf with his golden-yellow eyes beaming with determination and the knowledge that he can be stronger without all the muscle and bulk. It was just a thing that was really nothing, not him. He was something worth while and the dark goo shrank writhing in agony, disappearing entirely from his sight. As it did the torches, returned and everything else in the room returned looking clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the young tiger girl with joyful expression upon her face as he ran up to her and hugged her, lifting her up and twirling her around. He felt lighter, better and, well, he felt like himself, his true self that had been hidden away for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like hours, the jaded tiger lady separated the two, putting her fan between them. \"That is all well and good, but we have more matters to discuss. For instance, the amulet you activated has been released out into the world is on the brink of creating such an uproar that all the magic rings cannot undo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around and then pointing at himself, \"You mean its not over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her stern eyes, with the wave of her fan, a transparent globe of the world was floating above them rotating as she pleased. \"Britain, China and Egypt, the magic capitals of the world are facing a crisis that you caused and it can only be undo by you. The areas of the world started out bright, but they soon began to fade and dim drastically. The Celtic Knot has been creating holes in the manasource creating an imbalance in our world. I had a feeling one of the Americans would manage to end the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking in horror of random black holes eating up the world and he was the cause, \"Well, how do we stop it? What can I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That amulet has already been activated twice, and being fueled at a rate twice as powerful as before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and sick to his stomach about what he has done, \"How could an amulet cause so much trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't meant for the way you were using it, and especially not an outsider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked hurt, \"Great, being a wolf has made things worse for me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young tiger girl put her hand on his shoulder, \"She doesn't mean it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger lady nods, as she flicked the wrist with her fan, as the globe changed to what looked like a feral wolf creature, \"wolves were nomadic and traveling the lands and while animals have always been conduits of magical energy, over the past two thousand years, animals' sense have grown duller and inhibited through their needs and wants. Only those that still practice the arts and belong to such lineage retain their magic sense. My granddaughter Leena has been under my care since she could walk. The magic sense skipping her mother entirely and like most animals, their magic sense dying out even earlier. Foxes, cats and raccoons are what we thought were the only three nomadic animals that could move between the three different magic rings of fire, water and air. We have never seen a wolf with magic sense for quite some time.\" Images of random animal species moving about the air and then disappearing one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why me and why now?\" asked the dark furred wolf, cupping his hand with Leena's on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving the fan, letting the images fade away entirely, the tiger lady walked to where the golden statue was with the alter. \"Although the magic capitals of the world have tried to find the Celtic Knot, like most magic artifacts created in the time before time, they are untraceable without the proper knowledge. Such knowledge lost ages ago. You have the magic sense attuned to it, only you can find it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Celtic Knot was in your shop, didn't you know what it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it hid its genuine intention from me, but it willed me to give it to its current owner, a Tyler Matthews. And to make matters worse a dragon. You must find this purple dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know who that is where to find him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You waste your time with these questions, you must go, find the Celtic Knot and destroy it before it can destroy the world.\" the tiger lady bayed, fluttering her fan and with another wave of her fan, everything around him disappeared and he was back in the dark antique thrift shop. He was still shirtless, and not big and muscular like he was hoping though he looked to be lean and wiry. The Wisdom Loop still around his neck, he began walking out...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The breath of life that that given to us when we are born, down to the gentlest of breezes that  move the leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really think of Chinese for wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena giggled a little, and Fang smiled a bit, \"Well its not really because China is known for air, its just that China's ring of influence is of the air. Rings refer to the kind of magical influence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember what the tiger lady was saying, he recalled, \"She said there three, Fire, Water and Air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, \"That is correct. China's ring is Air, Britain's ring is Water and Egypt's ring is Fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his hand, hold his necklace. \"So this Wisdom Loop thing, its Chinese so its of Air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes fell upon the Wisdom Loop and her face changed to pale grimace, \"In a matter of speaking. It is also another magical artifact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, \"O so does everyone with magic sense get a magical artifact thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replied with a quick shake of her head, her expression wanted to move away from the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does this do exactly? Why do I have it and not you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and said with some sadness in her voice, \"I'm not supposed to tell you but I am going to because I think you should know.\" Leena paused thinking how to word it, my anticipation thicker than butter. \"Since the darkness created in you from having the Celtic Knot for so long, its a darkness that has stained your heart and your soul. It means that the darkness was greater than you alone or anything that I could have done during the purification ritual. I was able purify the darkness from your physical body. But the darkness in your soul was siphoning off your connection to the manasource that everyone needs to live. Wearing that Wisdom Loop will prevent it from growing in thirst and hunger and keep the leeching to a minimum. I am sorry. It was the best we could do...\" Looking around, she saw Fang stop a couple of steps behind her. A grim look was frozen on his face and the fear was starting to show, she moved his muzzle up and stretched out the outer edges of his mouth to make him smile. \"Its not all bad, the Wisdom Loop does other cool things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O do tell, the news just keeps getting better and better,\" as he gently moved her hands off his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its suppose to make you throw things pretty well, have the wind bend to your needs, like skipping rocks or hitting targets. It helps you to ride the air better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ride the air?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you Americans call it flying. Riding the air has always sounded much better to me,\" said Leena with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I can fly now?\" a little excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start you off simple, like jumping high. That's always useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Air is pretty cool, it feels like its better than the other two elements already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, putting her hand over Fang's muzzle, \"You mustn't speak like that. All the elements work together harmoniously, no one single element is better than the other, they all push and pull against each other. It is the balance that helps keep nature and the flow at peace.\" Turning to the side and clasping her hands behind her while walking forward again, she said under her breath and whispering into the breeze, \"But air is pretty cool.\"...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking around Chinatown hoping it would jog his memory, Fang was at his wits end of trying to think who this Tyler Matthews was, and a dragon to boot. The only dragons he knew was David from football, Charles a Professor at the university and some of his Dad's wealthy stockholders whom he brought over to the mansion for a fine dinner, but none of them could he imagining going into a place like that to pick up a trinket. Racking his brain wasn't coming up with results. \"So, your Great grandma, why did she make that remark about it being a dragon? Does it matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing it has something to do with a dragon's natural ability to be a catalyst for magic, amplifying certain spells with dragon bones is an actual thing where I come from. And its probably why the Celtic Knot called out to the purple dragon in the first place. To amplify its power, that's why the manasource is destabilizing at a faster rate now. The damage you did with a couple of years, they can do in hours. The affects of the manasource collapsing will be much more visible if we don't hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun looked like it was setting if that was even possibly at five in the afternoon, but the strangeness continued. A sharp, like glass breaking was in Fang's ears, covering them. \"What's going on?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are more sensitive to the manasource now, its already starting.\" Leena held his paw firmly as the colorful particles reappeared, but they were moving sporadically now and they seemed to circling over by midtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"we should head in that direction.\" Fang pointed after watching the particles move and cross in a particular fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little time to spare, with Leena's hand firmly grasping she shouted, \"Hang on !\"</span></div></div>",

He picked himself off the floor and returned to handling the register. Good thing no one saw him break down; Big guy like him, turning to a puddle over nothing. The heart-like gem seemed to show a glow a little in the light. A pale blue, though it might have been a trick of the light he wasn't so sure. He thought about calling David, but heck he didn't look a gift horse in the mouth. The moment he was awake with his amulet gone he would try to get his hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like mind-numbingly forever, it was finally closing time and Ned and his group left, normally leaving their figures overnight with some of their newer pieces drying with new paint jobs. Ned gave another glance, but he just couldn't put his finger on it. Pushing his glasses and maneuvering the large box through the door was a laughable feat. Tyler gave a slight grin at the idea of Ned tripping and crying out in anguish over such a thing as a toy. It was a benign though, but a thought none the less. Ned seemed to do just fine and he was a bit disappointed, though brief with the prospects of Jenny seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO he jumped up and cheered knowing that when she walked through that door, he would win her over. He did want to look presentable for her. Looking through the clothes he bought from New Bay. He liked wearing his orange plaid button up shirt, but the missing sleeves weren't anything he was thrilled with. A kind of darkness crept his mind and he was strongly reconsidering everything. Maybe the way to attract her was to do it the way his brother did, though he didn't really have a clue about that. His brother never really laid out the 'facts of life' or the 'birds and the bees' for him, the books were okay but he dare not asked any questions to just anyone. His brother didn't have any time for him. And true Tyler was the younger brother at 20, but he surpassed David intellectually and maturely too. Both redeeming qualities he thought, but comparing himself to his brother, David could have a girl on both arms and he could just begging for one though he would probably even be way too shy to even beg. Everyone looked at him to be a kid, but he was an adult. He couldn't drink but what makes a man a man was his actions. If he really had feelings for her, he had to be upfront and honest. Taking off the amulet, didn't exactly do anything for his older brother, heck he could still grow without it. And be honest, pfft when he lied to everyone that walked through his door. He sighed; bringing himself down was not the way to get ready for Jenny. She deserved better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't decide between the large sport polo or the plain striped tee. What it was going to come down to was what he felt comfortable in. Getting it off was kind of hard. His arms felt a bit bigger around, but he didn't do anything to make them grow. He shrugged as he just unbuttoned it and shook it off. Imagine if he had wings, o boy that would make clothes shopping impossible. He didn't envy anyone with those kinds of problems, though they probably save a killing on car insurance. Though, having wings and flying around above everyone did have a nice feel to it, no one could really ignore you and you could be alone if you wanted. Trying on the light-colored tee, it was alright, but it was pretty boring. It didn't have any oomph to it. Putting on the sliming dark navy-colored sport polo actually felt kind of nice. The material was cool to the touch, even if he was having difficulty fixing in the back. The shirt was bunching up and he couldn't very well fix it as his arms made it difficult to bend certain ways. Man! this bulk was a chore to get along with. He was growing frustrated, wiggly trying to make the fabric unbunch and go down all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let me get that,\" a voice said from behind him, his back facing the door. He could feel the other hands go up, feeling his back scales and fix the bunching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, I wanted to put on something nice and I went and got myself stuck.\" He gave hearty laugh at himself. When the job was finished, he turned around to give a proper welcome. He turned to see Jenny in all her scaley goodness. She looked amazing for just getting off a work shift. Did she do something with her headfur, she looked positively beautiful today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O no problem, the bottom part of your shirt was caught on your tag, you should really go tagless. It'd save you a lot of time with that kind of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind,\" his voice box crumbling under the embarrassment of having her help him with his clothes. If he was getting graded, he'd surely get an F so far. \"So Jenny how was work?\" said Tyler trying desperately to make a conversation happen as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O the usual. Coffee beans don't make coffee themselves,\" she said with a small laugh. Tyler wanted to show off a bit began taking some heavy boxes down and putting them on the floor. He was playing it 'cool' looking interested while moving the boxes. His flexes looking showed off well in the sport polo. \"You know I work at that coffee place over by the Newton Museum. I heard they remodeled their indoor conservatory with all the star lights and constellations... You know space stuff...\" Oh my goodness, Jenny was flirting with me. Was she trying to drop off hints about want to go, together. Tyler was very ecstatic about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thought I saw something on TV bout that. Didn't some actor do a voice over for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked through her purse, \"I think you're right. I had a flyer in here somewhere. He did a lot of stuff on the DDC...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jones Earl Jameson?\" Tyler gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one. He does lots of voice overs. Anyhow I was wondering if you weren't too busy tonight or tomorrow night, I don't suppose you'd want to go with me?\" she asked sounding both interested and disinterested at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT! .... Did THAT just happen, thought Tyler. When you look this good, the girls ask you out apparently. Way to keep your cool, now keep this up and you'll have a heck of an evening. Rolling his shoulders from the heavy lifting he says nonchalantly, \"Nah sounds good, was just bringing these boxes done for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O that's sweet, bringing down those heavy boxes for Tyler. You're a good brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it is, that's it. After all that, she still thinks I'm David. David doesn't certainly sound like me or David doesn't really look at me. But really he's cobalt and I'm purple. Though I'm a deeper, darker purple now you'd think people could tell us apart. Apparently, people probably think the same about big guys, they all look alike and you want to say that you've at least 'been' with a guy like that, just to brag to your friends. No wonder David comes how with different woman all the time. He can't keep one long enough. Man, being this big was a real drag, Tyler thought. It was nothing like he thought it would be. This was going awful, this was worse than worse he sighed. This was ten times worse than crumby, and he hated things that were just regularly crumby. But than something snapped in Tyler...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't escape it, he felt as though he had closed his eyes and every time he opened them, nothing. Just surrounded by an empty void. The exact way he was feeling. He couldn't describe it but he felt like he was falling. What's the use? He even lost Jenny to his brother, and he's still asleep in his room, Tyler could bet. Maybe it was time for a nice long rest too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the comic shop, an eerie blue light came from the amulet, blinding Jenny and anyone that walked past. It was coming from that heart-like gem in the middle of the celtic knot amulet and when Jenny could see again she was horrified as what she thought she was looking at a big, tall hunky dragon that could sweep her off her feet, but now the eyeholes were vacant with the body being covered in a black-like goo that was covering the who she thought was poor David. She thought she might freeze, like a deer in a headlight, but when the blob let out an otherworldly dirge like cry, she ran out the door and bumping right into Ned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey watch where you are going,\" said the crane feeling for his glasses on the pavement. \"I need to have a little one on one with that dragon in there that calls himself Ty.\" Finally finding his glasses as they were shoved at him by the figure that bumped into him. A, a girl, he was speaking with a girl thought Ned, his glasses getting foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty..! Tyler?!? You mean that's Tyler?!?\" the girl panicked and pointing into the comic shop as a large blobby dark mass was heading in their direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that was my discovery, o geez,\" he reacted trying to get up from the ground, both of them running down the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching their breaths as they hid behind a car, Jenny was bewildered by the unreal events that were taking place. The dragon of her dreams just turned into a glob of black goo and was now trying to eat her. Worst date ever she thought. \"Are you telling me that big dragon in the shop was sweet little old Tyler?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to stop hyperventilating, he didn't want to pull out his inhaler to reinforce the stereotype but his coke-bottle glasses were so foggy from being this close to a girl, this was the best and only date he had even been on, and he was sitting on the ground of a dirty parking lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on bird beak, get with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, well, the dragon that was manning the shop all day claim to be,\" holding his feathered fingers up doing air quotations, \"Ty, a so-called cousin of his was taking care of the shop until Tyler returned from a convention. I had to go home real quick to check my scheduler and there isn't a significant convention that would even interest Tyler in the very least for another two week. Plus, everyone knows he wouldn't leave the shop without telling us about it. That and a  few other things I noticed throughout the day. His precise 2 o clock Mountain Dew break. The way he scans cards, handles the register, they were both conveniently 'left handed\" when they waved and restacked magazines.\" He looked back at her and he could see he weirded her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so is that Tyler or not?\" Looking through the window of the car they were hiding behind. The monster slowly looking for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been coming here since it first opened. The dragon that was at the shop all day was without a doubt, with a less than 1 chance variable, Tyler Matthews. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of shock and dismay swept over her, \"No wonder he went ballistic and lost his mind... I kept calling him David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O he hates being compared to David you know, it really pushes his buttons. Unlike me of course, I'd never transform into monster and try to eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shook her head at him, \"Not gunna happen. O I have to fix this somehow. Its my fault he's like this...\" She gulped in all her fear and gathered all the courage she could to stand up from her hiding place and walk towards the monstrous blob, trying to talk to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to do, get us both killed, I'm outta here,\" Ned said as he was fleeing into the street almost getting hit by a red convertible that screeched to a stop. A wolf and a tiger looking out in an odd serene yet panickless fear. Ned continued running off to save his own feathers, not interested in being a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouting, \"Tyler its me Jenny. I know its you. I'm sorry I didn't see it before. Please don't do this. Come back to us!\" the blob moved at its pace seemingly unaffected by her words. Fang and Leena ran next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked in awe, saying, \"I didn't know the celtic knot could do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given enough time and sadness it can. You know what you have to do Fang. You have to help him confront his inner demons, find that amulet and destroy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping his nerves, \"I was afraid you were gunna say that.\" The whole group was moving slowly backwards while trying to speak with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispering to Fang, Jenny said, \"Whatever you do, don't mention his older brother David...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it clicked for Fang, unintentionally saying loudly, \"O man, you mean David from football, we're on the same team. He had a brother,\" He never saw much of him on the field that is unless he was bullying him whenever he did see him. More painful memories of wickedness returned to him. Being the cause of all this his actions rippled out so far... Cupping his hands over his mouth to make his voice sound louder, \"Tyler, Buddy its me... Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goo monster responded to that by rumbling angrily, forming dragon like appendages of arms, legs, tail and head, face with a glopping mouth and two rounded horns curving back. Forming sloppy words that raked through the air, \"Fang. . . bad!\" A car nearby was slammed out of the way while another was picked up effortlessly and thrown in the group's direction. Both instinctively moving out of the way, Leena floated off to the right while Fang did a super jump with Jenny in his arms. Landing as best as he could and bringing her to safely. The monster turned its mass to the direction of Fang and Jenny. \"Fang take... Jenny. Fang BAD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Tyler. Please hear me. I am sorry for what I did to you. I really am. I'm not that wolf anymore. Please Tyler listen. You're brother and me we are on the same team, you remember the football team. He's a cool guy and I bet you could be a cool guy too if you wanted. David really does care that you're brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAVID!!!\" It made an ear shattering cry as it form bubbled with fervor and two tar black wings sprouted from its back as it begin to lift up and fly over them. The blob's dragon tail, snaking in and taking Jenny with it!</span></div></div>",

Holding his hand in hers, his next jumped stayed in the air and he was sufficiently floating. The colorful particles appeared again and they were in constant chaos, much worse from before, heading in the direction the blob was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, hovering like this is great but they are getting away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gunna have to fly sepearately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I wasn't ready to fly on my own yet,\" Fang said clutching her hand a bit tighter and looking down for their altitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay, just think light thoughts. Its as simple as imagining yourself as a cloud moving through the air. Here close your eyes and visualize it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did, but he felt a bit foolish doing so, \"I don't think this is working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, looking at him a good three feet away. He bobbed a little at the sight, but Fang was able to keep up with hovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Visualize yourself moving and being where you need to be, the air takes care of the rest,\" she said in a freeing fashion while moving a little bit further way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust making out the dark blob in the air against the night sky, he imagined himself going there, gaining speed and flying in front of it, he had to talk to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, he flew along the currents, gaining speed, flying was an unreal but empowering feeling, unlike anything he had done before. Gliding upon breezes like a bird. Steadying himself was difficult at first but grew with ease as he let the Air take him around. The blobby mess, though big and cumbersome was flying very fast. Jenny was moved up from the tail, to its drippy front claws. The flying mass of black goo was a horrific sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching it, he could see Jenny terrified, her screams turned hoarse from her constant screaming and attempts of talking with it. Jenny dared not look down to see how high see actually was, but the air was a bit hot and thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tyler can we talk this over,\" said Fang casually. The monster's face gave a quick glance, and tried to shove him out of the air by trying to ram into the wolf. Evading easily, and gaining speed. \"So you want to do this the hard way, okay I can play that game...\" Trying to get near Jenny, to secure her safety, he continued to try talking with the black gooey glob. \"I know what its like Tyler. To not feel like you're not good enough. To not feel strong enough, I was just like you a long time ago. I took the easy way out and look where it got me. I was surrounded by fake friends. I was alienating myself from my family. I felt like I could never be strong enough to protect them or myself. That amulet turned my fears against me and turned me into a cocky self-centered brute that reveled in the pain and suffering of others. I cannot tell you how much regret I have from the actions that I had done and that I cannot undo all the years of hurt I caused you. Picking on those that were smaller than me, made me feel stronger, but it wasn't true strength. The true inner Strength that comes from inside you to help you overcome and withstand what life throws at you. You Tyler have been taking it like a champ for all these years. You and me we are survivors, we are the same...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster bellowed, \"Not SAME\" in a gurgling mess. Using his long dragon tail to try and whip Fang out of the sky was much harder to evade, and the gooey mess smacked him a bit, but Fang persisted more though it was a lot more difficult to reach Jenny now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Jenny who desperately wanted to be saved, but at the same time wanted Tyler to be okay too. Fang thought of another way to try and reach Tyler, because somewhere within that hulking mass was Tyler. He just needed help to see the light. \"Tyler I was surrounded by fake friends, because I forced them to be there,\" he hated to admit it but to say it out loud made him feel very awful, \"I wasn't very popular in truth. I was afraid of being alone too and it drove me to be do awful things. Jenny, how are you hanging in there? You say you are not the same as me, but here you are abducting this fine lady. What will you do? Force her to be your friend too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster just growled internally and began swatting him again with his tail, the claws gripping tighter around Jenny. She felt the breath squeeze out of her and she blacked out, lying limply in the claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang grew worried and he had to break through to him somehow... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But instead of needed to hold his breath like when you go underwater it was an empty void. Similarly to how he was back in the shrine with the tiger lady. It was just the same, being in a place where awful memories played  over and over. Trying to find a happy memory was hard for him, he couldn't imagine how difficult it was for Tyler. Even memories that appeared to be just passing moments, were here as well. All the times he was ignored and looked over. In the scenes and memories playing like multiple projectors all around this void, he finally found Tyler. The purple dragon, was little, but he seemed to have shrunk significantly like he was a doll or stuffed animal really. The coloring of scales were either dulled or darkened, making it the reason why he was so hard to find. Even while approaching him, Tyler's gaze was fixed on a single screen showing multiple, multiple times of his older brother receiving all the awards, appraises and attention. And him, ignored and alone. Fang saw a few images of his old self bullying him and he was none to proud. Poor Tyler, he didn't deserve this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy,\" Fang said trying to begin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight glossiness in his eyes, he said in a monotone, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To start over, to be friends...\" said Fang, the most sincere he has ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejectedly, \"You must mean my brother, not me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're tricking me. No one ever wants to be friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't have come all the way here if I didn't consider you a friend.\" He finally looked away from the screen and at Fang now, nervousness superseded the tiredness and lack of energy from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly putting his clawed paw up, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its Fang,\" he said but his glee turned sour as Tyler withdrew his hand entirely and turned his back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you. You've hurt me before. Leave me alone. Maybe being ignored is all I'm good for. I can't get hurt if they don't see me...\" His gaze shifted to the side, looking at another screen with images of Jenny at the shop and him being too shy to even talk with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang grew saddened to see him completely withdraw within himself like that. Its like he was letting all the things he hated define him. He recalled when he probably first met David and Tyler together, it was at football tryouts in high school. Fang was a shoe in but this new guy, David was a contender too. He didn't realize he'd be on the same team with David for the next seven years of his life, but he had always been competing with David, not Tyler. He saw that Tyler often kept to himself, reading a book in the bleachers. A loner that Fang would often call out 'pipsqueak' or 'small fry' and soon Tyler stopped going to the football practices and he hadn't seen him since. Only in the montage of people he'd bully constantly. Fang and Tyler never really had a relationship to begin with, and if they did it was rocky at best. He couldn't believe how selfish he was to not even consider that he even had feelings, even earlier in the day he recalled how he treated Palmetto, his mousy maid. There was no telling how many bridges he'd burned and would now have to begin to repair to even start the road to forgiveness. But he knew that he had to start somewhere, and Tyler was a perfect place to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was reaching out for him again when...</span></div></div>",

A purple dragon with a pretty built, but slim athletic body appeared. Not the toy-like Tyler from before, but a different version that didn't have a glossiness to his eyes that seemed to have more attention and focus. \"Hey Tyler, is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around bewildered as the screens seemed to disappear, the purple dragon gave a side ways glance at the black wolf. \"Yes,\" he started out slowly that grew to panic, \"where are we? and who are you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a friend. I've come to help you out of here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the ground that was supporting them shook wildly as if they were at ground zero for an earthquake, both of them finding it difficult to balance and helping each other stay standing. Just then a blue light shown, as from beneath the blackened ground a dark mountain sprouted and grew with the Celtic Knot at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shaking and rocking subsided, they both looked at each other, and the back at the amulet. Tyler feeling his neck, making sure it wasn't just some trick, the silver chained necklace wasn't around his neck. A sigh of relief though quickly broke as their feet started sinking into the ground like quicksand. Jumping up instinctively, Fang made sure he had a firm grip before extended a hand to help Tyler. \"Come on jump, grab my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to get one foot on a solid piece of ground, the other stuck in the enveloping floor. Scared and fearful, \"O please help. O no its stuck,\" almost driven to tears. Just out of reach, though the floor seemed to be eating mountain as it felt like it was sinking too. Just a few moments more and Fang was able to connect their wrists, pulling him up and out of the floor. \"Thanks,\" said Tyler trying to take a breath to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry no time to stop. We need to climb and reach that amulet. Its the only thing that can stop all of this. So they began climbing this dark mountain while it was sinking, so it was a race against the clock. Trying to find good footholds, and letting him know where to place his feet and hands, Fang was leading the expedition. About halfway up he could feel his energy sapping, and the powers from his Wisdom's Loop amulet didn't seem to be working in here at the moment. Fang could also see the exhaustion on Tyler as well, but he kept at it. Fang didn't know if Tyler had climbed before, but as a first timer he did pretty good and without a harness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ledges were getting more narrow and the ledges were much more harder to find. Hearing Tyler gasp, he slipped and Fang snapped quick to grab his arm with both hands, readjusting quickly to have one hand hook on the ledge and the other grabbing Tyler. He was at a standstill now. He didn't have the strength nor the energy to lift him back up as he was just using everything he had to keep them from falling...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The look in Tyler's eyes was strong, but from Tyler's perspective the black wolf was very weary. Tyler now was steadily regaining more and more of his memories and the events leading up to this point. Tyler knew who the black wolf was. He who trying desperately to save him while risking everything for him, this was not the same wolf that would pick on him every chance he saw. It was a genuine change and he could see that him in. And poor Jenny, he put her through so much, not even fathoming things would turn out this way. Just because he loved her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he had, that was the truth. Never before did he feel so strongly for someone that he would go through all this mess just for the chance to be with her. Sure he wanted to be big and strong to compete with his brother, but he wanted to be a better version of himself for her. Someone she could be proud of to say \"That's my dragon, he's taken,\" thought Tyler. He didn't care if everyone else ignored him, but to at least be that special someone for her, meant everything to him. He would never feel alone and he would never feel like he was stuck in his older brother's shadow anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he would up being a bit of a jerk and look where it got him... One false move and it would be game over... No, Tyler thought, 'this is not my end, I put her in this mess and its my job to be there for her, be her knight in shining armor, her caped crusader'. Feeling a lightness within him, he felt a warmth from the tips of his hands to his core. Not quite the burning and breaking of bones from before, but a special kind of feeling that he'd never felt before. He had a purpose, a real goal, a girl worth fighting for that needed him and he needed to get to her. Those thoughts spun within him as the feeling moved to his back and he could feel something strange happening. A new feeling as appendages sprouting from his back forming and closing, they were Wings, real Dragon Wings. His family of dragons wasn't the flying sort, but they did exist, so it was an all too new feeling to be flying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang through all this saw the nervousness and extreme shyness melt away as he saw coinfidence and a driven look grace his face, that and a pair of wings flapping behind him. \"Care for a lift? As you have been trying to save me, friendship isn't a one way street. It works both ways. Thought I could help out a bit, so hang on,\" Tyler said grinning loudly, lifting off of the mountain and towards the amulet. Tyler using both of his hands to hold Fang's hand, while Fang's other hand outstretched ready to grab the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiping the amulet quickly and surely, the whole area around them seemed to crumble and fade away like fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blobby creature seemed to rumble and bubble , still grasping the ill-fated Jenny, and then seemed to burst open with a deathly screech. A flying purple dragon emerged holding a black furred wolf with the blue glowing amulet in his paw. The blob mass seemed to be falling randomly, making sure Fang was fying, he let him go and dived to save the fair Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming a bit, she didn't know what was happened, until she fell into someone arms. He was pretty cute, another dragon like her, but his scales were a deep royal purple and he had broad, leathery-sheen wings. He had the sweetest of smiles with a slightly square-ish chin and pronounced snout. His two horns curved back from his head from a shaggy mess of headfur. Her eyes fell to his. It was then she knew his eyes were the same. She smiled at him, both of them blushing a bit. \"So if its alright with you, could we have a do-over for tonight. I uh wasn't quite myself,\" he said with a smile and apologetic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw his blush intensify, and she wrapped her arms around him practically choking him, \"I've been waiting for you for ages.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecretly, Jenny had always felt something for Tyler. She wasn't sure if it was the cute boyish way he carried himself or his sweet personality, but one thing for sure it wasn't really the comics she wanted. It was him. Though after months of trying to make advances, him oblivious or paralyzed with his extreme shyness for the opposite sex (still a cute quality) she grew tired of waiting. It wasn't until she saw his older brother, that even being a bit of a lug head, he too had that same charm. Sure she liked him, but it didn't compare to what she saw in Tyler. She thought he didn't like her at one point, but she was sure at that point, with her in his arms, she was safe and that's all she ever really wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looking around for a safe place to land, felt like he knew this area, he couldn't gather why... But then it hit him...</span></div></div>",

The neighborhood seemed oddly quiet, but that soon changed. The mass crashing it loud splooshes, it was an eerie, short lived rain with black globs all over the ground. Landing on the sidewalk outside his house, Jenny sprang out of his arms and latched to his side in a warm snuggle while Leena landed  next to them looking for Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang soon landed distraught!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glowing amulet gone, he was freaking out, \"Its gone! It just disappeared. How could that have happened?!? I thought this was over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his hand and patting it softly, \"its okay we'll find it. Don't you worry.\" Giving a comforting embrace, Fang let his muzzle rest on her shoulder still practically exhausted, he looked at to see the colorful particles zooming by and heading into the house they were standing in front of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang about to speak, Tyler burst out, \"Oh my gosh! David!!! Running up to the door to pull it open, damn it was locked. He fucking left his keys in the comic book. Trying to ram the down open. The foundation of the house and the ground around pulsed with tremors and fissures. The gang all up on the porch as the house seemed to creak and break. The roof flying off as a being emerged...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was David! Bigger and stronger in all forms. A depiction of legendary dragon, huge and menacing. He was a giant now, easily 25 to 30 feet in height. Breaking out of their house. His eyes were glossy and a constant look of pleasure and lust permanently on his face. An evil glow from around his monstrous neck, the Celtic Knot fixed firmly to his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did continue to grow while he was away, thought Tyler trying to distract himself from their practically destroyed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Giant David gave an otherworldly roar as if calling out and it did. The black goo globs swiftly moved to him and with the group backing up across the street, Jenny squeezing Tyler's arm tighter and Leena gripping Fang's hand more firmly. Fang was able to see the colorful particles flowing in him, into that monster. The globs forming over him making a gigantic gooey monster looming over everyone and the entire neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sighed, he just wasn't getting a break tonight. Its not like saving the world was supposed to be easy. Fang looked to Leena for some encouraging words, she was too speechless. Then Leena, Tyler and Fang all heard the sound of a thousand glasses breaking, the manasource would soon give out and the world would end. No pressure, thought Fang as he gulped about to make a run to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a movement came first from Tyler, trying to break free. \"Don't leave. Now that I have you back, I can't let you go. It could kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's still my brother. I have to go. I have to at least try. I'm the one that gave him the amulet in the first place. Its my fault he's like that,\" Tyler said trying to convince her to let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang did a half step forward and turned, kissing Leena's hand and releasing it, \"No Tyler. I started this over Twenty years ago. I'm the one that needs to end it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid, you don't have the energy to get to it, let alone fight it,\" Tyler insisted, \"Let me go, he's my brother. He's my family I'm responsible for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant black blob was forming its massive dragon-like appendages, its head boomed with another roar shaking the very night itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, one of them broke away...</span></div></div>",

Holding him from beneath his arms, to take some of the stress off of Fang's legs and back. They were flying in towards the direction of the giant blob that could play hacky-sac with military tanks and fighter planes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet close enough so I can jump into the center near the amulet. The closer I am the better my chances are, I feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Tyler said with determined eyes, \"I'll get as close as I can, you'll probably only get one shot so make it count. Dodging some incoming tree that were being thrown like wads of paper, the blob bubbled with anticipation. Tyler knew a direct approach would be the easiest thing the monster was expecting so he tried a different tactic. Circling around, evading his long whipping tail, and shooting tendrils from its back (that was new, thought Tyler) he managed to fly under the arm and close enough for Fang to swing in. Tyler's last words, \"If you don't come out in five I'm going in after you!\" With the black wolf submerged, the glob shrieked with vengeance. Setting its sights on the winged dragon and two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get moving!\" shouted Tyler, \"We need to keep it busy for as long as we can.\" Jenny hopping up into his arms again, the group flew off to a woody section, a mile or two beyond the neighborhood, to prevent any further damages or destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiving again into the sticky glob like goo, Fang found himself in the void again. But this time it was much different. The area was blindingly white with a checkered floor. White constructs of furniture, chairs and a desk filled the large room. Sitting at the desk was an unknown figure to him. It was just a man in a suit, he was pretty normal looking until you got to his face. His hair and blonde-colored goatee framed a terrifying image. In place of eyes and teeth, resided that dark black goo, dripping but none on his pristine white suit. He held a black cane that adorned several gems and diamonds, but the real ticket item was the Celtic Knot around his next. That was all that Fang cared about. Trying to make himself big, he stormed over to the desk ready to jump across it and grab the amulet. His feet quickly stuck to the floor as the rug under and in front of the desk became a square piece of black goo. He was not sinking, though he could guess why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you could join us Fang, or did you want Master Fang. You don't have to hide from me dear boy. I know everything about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'll humor him, \"Just Fang is fine. Its funny, you know me but I don't know you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding a leather-black gloved hand to his chest, \"O I'm hurt Fang. We've been the best of friends for the last 21 years.\" Fang's eyes grew wide, could this be... \"Yes Fang,\" the gloopy mouth stretched its face, \"you are right. I am the amulet you used to cherish and adore. You brought me back to life after my magic had been drained. You have been treating me so good, I thought I would return the favor and give you everything you ever wanted. I gave you power. I gave you strength. I made you the best player any team you joined. You wanted girls, I made you the most attractive wolf around. And this is the thanks I get! Destroy all my hard work!\" It stomped its cane to the ground for emphasis. He paused to regain his composure and walked around the desk, twirling his cane as he walked around. \"Too bad, you look like half the wolf you were if not less...\" Some gooey tendrils sprouted from the goo square and began to bind Fang around his arms and muzzle. Taking his cane and sliding it underneath his neck. \"I see you've replaced me so quickly,\" it sneered and outstretched his arms doing a broad gesture, \"I've moved on to bigger and better things Fang.\" Snapping his fingers, a door opened and moving in sideways because he was so freakishly massive and built, David thundered with each step taking a place next to the evil orchestrator. \"Don't take it the wrong way, but I've upgraded. Do you like what I've done with the place? It was fairly vacant so I moved right in.\" Moving about the room, the goo tendrils forcing Fang to look wherever he was going. \"And here, what a glorious host this dragon is. So simple, yet so powerful. I should have found a dragon at first, but you were a consolation prize I suppose.\" Using his cane, he bopped the head of David, not even flinching. \"Such simple desires and fears. So nourishing...\" It lick its lips with a long goopy tongue. Making another broad gesture with his cane, transparent like screens appeared around the room like those other times before, showing images of David's successes and triumphs, filtered in with scenes from the last twenty-four hours. \"I would have had another pet dragon if you left well enough alone, but he's outside trying to stop my monster, he won't get too far and he will be mine again very soon...\" putting a gloved hand on the screen, on Tyler's image. With a wave of his cane, screens vanished and he turned to face Fang again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice and laughs were becoming more otherworldly and strained, \"To be the biggest. To be the strongest. To be the best!\" He jerked, almost skipped a visual beat, one moment standing next to David, the next in front of him. He drew a hand back with his cane gripped at the handle, backslapping Fang and a laugh so evil it reverberated off the walls. Fang lowered his ears, feeling the pain on the side of his face. \"That is what a winner looks like, Fang. To have the balls enough to go deep and grab the goal, the gold.\" He walked around admiring the room and returned to sit at his desk. Taking a silver pocket watch from his coat, and sighed. \"I am fairly patient and,\" he paused snapping his fingers, releasing the tendrils and the tar square disappearing as if it were never there, \"a good sport. We have some more time before the manasource collapses. So I have a little wager for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a chance to breath, the tendrils were constricting his lungs after all, taking multiple breaths between words, \"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in a good mood, so I'll let you live if you can best my friend here,\" gesturing towards David, his eyes glazed over and nonresponsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have a choice?\" Fang gulping nervous to face his jacked team mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? The end of the world won't be as satisfying if I don't make a game of it. I grow bored too quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what kind of game did you have in mind?\" Fang inquired a bit afraid of what the response would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care surprise me...\" he said in a twisted fashion. \"You choose the contest and I'll make an arena for you. If you win, you live, free to leave. If I win, you have to stay here without a fight and become my slave again. It would be just like old times. You get everything you've always wanted again for your complete servitude. Win - Win wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dice, the world is ending and your little departing gift has my days numbered anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O so you know about that. Well, they think the world will end, but it will go back to the way it was in the time before time. Magic running rampant throughout the land, and us the Magebloods will be on top again. Above you ingrate humans and animals, you once served us as slaves before and now again,\" he paused briefly and continued, \"Why not, if you do manage to win, I will take the darkness away that's eating at your soul. But if I win, you must also retrieve the other dragon for me so that he too must become a slave only for me. It seems a shame that little Tyler should miss all this fun. Have we got a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery reluctant but feeling as though he had no other choice, \"Deal,\" as he outstretched his hand as the other thing outstretched its hand, tendrils from its sleeve holding his hand too. Fang pulled back quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Fang, what contest do you wish to lose in?\" the entity sneered, the dark gooey smile outstretching its face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing the only thing he was the best at, even during practice scrimmages, football was the only thing he could think about. He took a deep breath in before speaking, \"I choose football. Flag football that is. First to five goals wins, a Goal is worth two points and a kick is worth one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning broadly with the gooiness bubbling, \"Very well. Flag football it is.\" Waving his cane and turning back to his chair, the checker board floor began glowing, turning green as the white constructs of furniture, chairs and tables exploded into nothingness. A rectangular field of 50 yards appeared behind Fang as David walked forward to take position. A shadow construct helmet, similar to the light furniture but black, appeared on David's head. Some large, black spiked shoulder pads and a black flag over his tail also appeared on the brute as he stood ready to demolish anything that stood in front of him. Goal posts popped up on either end setting the stage for the final battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what about my gear,\" said Fang a little whiny, but more concerned than anything else. He was still only wearing his paints and amulet, he didn't even have shoes on, it had been a weird day for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing laughed, waving its cane as a light construct helmet, shoulderpads and flag for his tail appeared on him. They weighed a ton, Fang thought. The white suited man seemed to shift further back to the sidelines to get a better view, moving his chair and his desk with him. He put his elbows on his desk and leaned forward, intent on the action that would ensue. \"Ready, when you are, Fang...\" Calling out to his champion, \"Don't fail me my pet!\" David remained unaffected, his trance too deep and his mind only focused on winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over there was just taking all the energy he had with all the gear on, but he couldn't leave himself unprotected either. With David's massive size he would slaughter him, brake bones and crack ribs. Fang gulped he had to do what he could, maybe something that big would be slow too, Fang could only hope. Getting in position, Fang looked around for the football. \"Hey what gives, where's the ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerforming a dismissive gesture, \"He's your pigskin, you have the ball first.\" His gooey grin stretched again as if already knew the outcome. Appearing in his hands was a light construct football with black for the threading. The weight felt about right as he held it in his hands. Closing his eyes and breathing in and out, the entire world is counting on me, he was thinking to himself. \"I can't let them down,\" he said under his breath as he crouched down. Calling out three random numbers then, \"Hut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, the living mass charged into him pushing him to the ground, with more power to make him somersault back a few yards. He still held the ball, but the pain was all too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that's First Down,\" it called out with wicked glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to pick himself up and resetting positions, it was clear to see that this wasn't going to be easy, not by any means. The rhythm coming back to him, sure muscle helps you take and give out blows, but that wasn't going to win the game. Calling out numbers again, he called early and made a dash to the left only to be stopped by a colossal fist. David's hand practically the entire width of Fang's waist. He dropped to the side, not loosing any yards, but his side hurt like hell. Hollaring out, \"Flag football isn't a contact sport, you bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling his gooey smile, \"Perhaps but you didn't say so it isn't a rule. A down is when a player losses their flag or falls to the ground.\" He may have been accurate, but hell that wasn't fair. Fang could tell he didn't intend on scoring goals to win, he just wanted to beat him up and tire him out. The amulet enjoys watching others suffer he remembered. This wasn't about winning at all to him and Fang knew that even if he did win the sly thing couldn't be trusted to keep his side of the bargain but what could he do...</span></div></div>",

Throwing the helmet off and the shoulder pads off to the sidelines, they evaporated as they touched the ground, he was feeling lighter already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O tough guy, you must really have a death wish. You sure you don't want to forfeit? It would makes things so much easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking his neck and rolling his shoulders a bit, Fang responded, \"Like you'd even let me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prolly not, seeing your spirits get crushed is way too amusing,\" its gooey lips stretching again, leaning back in his chair to enjoy the rest of the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's try this again, Fang thought. Really planting his feet, letting the oddly real grass between his toes and letting his claws dig into the ground to give him an extra boost. He'd have to book it this time. Calling out numbers and starting early, he faked to his right and sprinted down the field, breathing heavily foregoing his victory dance for some well needed air. At least, once he got past David he was home free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure turned narrow-eyed as it snapped its fingers making a light construct scoreboard appear on the other side of the field. A large square board, like the kind for basketball games. The names Home and Visitor appeared in black. The zero under Visitor changed to a two. Finishing his breathing and feeling a second wind come he went ten yards to make a field goal. Holding the ball, he watched that even though David's eyes were glossed-over the eyes never looked away from the ball, David wasn't even registering Fang at all from the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust calling, \"Hut!\" he kicked the ball making a broad arc over David and through the goal posts. The figure behind the desk rolled its eyes, as the two became a three. What the entity didn't realize was that unlike David, he actually practiced different roles instead of just being a Linebacker, he always knew that practicing to be a quarterback would come in handy, that and being a Quarterback was like a total babe magnet.\"Half way there, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth a little as his face returned to normal (if that could even be an appropriate way to describe it). \"Consider your luck run out, Fang. Now its our ball.\" The ball disappeared from Fang's hand and reappeared in David's massive claws. There was no way he could block him. Going back to position, he could see David looking straight at the goal posts. Perhaps he could try talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a lowered voice, \"Hey David, buddy you in there. Its me Fang. Hey I don't know if you can hear me but if you can know that only you can stop this. If not for me, think about Tyler. If you win we all lose. Is it really worth losing everything, just because you want to win...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the head didn't move, his mouth did, speaking in half thoughts, \"expect ed to wi n..\" Calling numbers and charging on the third, Fang jumped out of the way and let him pass, looking for where the flag was. His waist was so wide, Fang could give him a bear hug and his hands would be at least two feet apart. But the flag was still there, it was a long strip of black, but the main concern was his dragon like tail that would make it more than difficult to grab. The zero under Home changed to a two. Moving into position for the kick, Fang laughed to see the kick catapult the ball high into the air, shattered the magical football. The entity stood up in his chair, his goo bubbling with anger. So being all powerful wasn't what it was cracked up to be. Sure being big and powerful and a hulking mass of muscle helped in sports, but sports had finesse and a tactical element to them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping his fingers again the football appeared in Fang's arms, this time the football was bigger and heavier than before. So he wanted to cheat, Fang would have to make due as the old football weighed a standard pound, this new one must have been at least twenty. It was heavier, but not entirely impossible to move around with. It would be hard to fake with properly as the change in size made it awkward to hold. Calling out numbers again, he moved on the third count, and seeing the massive bulk ready to charge him again his arms out wider for the tackle. Tossing the ball up, David's focus remained on the ball as ducked under his arms and vaulted over the massive dragon tail to catch and jogged with the ball to the goal. The score under Visitor changed from three to five. That was it, it was over, he had won, but why wasn't everything changing back...</span></div></div>",

Not by a long shot... From his desk to Fang in the end zone in a blink, he used his cane to pick up the black furred wolf under the chin. \"Tired are we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang nodded as it was plainly obvious, he even sat down on the artificial turf. He rolled the ball over to him, \"We had a deal, first to five. Its done...\" The words getting caught in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, so na\u00efve.

His goo breaking out as if it had been restrained, it roared in Fang's face as it quickly returned as the whiteness formed over like makeup covering a bruise. \"Believe me I am being very civil with you Fang. My poor pet was so set on winning, heck winning is the only thing worth doing,\" it said with more emphasis, \"So I am extending the game. Whoever scores to seven, wins. And this time the stakes will be much higher to be made worth your while... I assure you...\" It grinned wickedly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, knowing he won't have another choice, \"I'm listening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win this time, you'll also get a chance to free David. I know how much it means for you to save them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked he looked at him surprised by the offer, \"You mean you'd be willing to give him up just because you want to win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a manner of speaking, yes...\" his cane gripped in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing better than to deal with this demon, \"But, what's the catch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I win, that amulet will be mine!\" it shouted in muted anger, pointing with it's cane at Fang's necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could you want this thing for?\" Fang's curiosity drawn into what powers his new amulet held that he desired so badly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for me to know and for you to worry about later,\" he said waving his cane as screens popped up showing the outside world where his friends were doing their best to distract the giant blob monster that was destroying the forest area that they had lured it into. They were growing tired and he saw that poor Leena was walking now too, not knowing why she couldn't fly. Perhaps it had to do with the growing instability of the manasource. It must have been causing more interference. A raging whirlwind was in effect though, almost sucking everything into the blobby mess; leaves twigs and even whole trees were being sucked into the vortex forcing the giant to grow in size. They were running out of time, hell the whole world was... Fang couldn't trust him neither... was this really happened or was this a trick to throw him off his game, or even deeper if the manasource crashed what that really meant. Would he be free to roam an apocalapse-like earth and make everyone his slaves... Things were not looking good for anyone... \"Do you accept the terms of our new deal?\" it said extending its hand, tendrils at the ready to shake on it.</span></div></div>",

The entity looked on more focused and intent on winning. Trying to lift the ball again, it remained heavy, but with a glare and a snap, the ball returned to its normal weight and size but the screens remained up, a live action cam as to the fall of his friends and the world, as he played football. Just freaking terrific, thought Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being in the pristine suit called out, \"Don't disappoint me, my pet. Crush him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind filled with gloom and uncertainty, could he really take David again, not feeling any reassurance from that last remark. This was growing monotonous and the weight on Fang's shoulders couldn't be any heavier. He sighed getting ready for the kick for his single point. Holding it in his hands, moving the football to see if David's focus was fully on the football which it was. Counting out numbers till, \"Hut!\" and David was in a full blitz, a steamroller heading for impact without stopping. Fang's nerves snapped halfway through the kick, and opted to jump to the side. The football not even making it close to the goal post. He couldn't risk just getting one point, if David was just going to trample him and seriously hurting him and rendering him unable to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not too late to surrender, Fang,\" he said in a halting fashion as his gooey smiled curled more and more, like a Cheshire cat. Fang shook his head, he would have to make another touchdown to win this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLining back up in midfield, David's eyes still glossed over, was there no way to reach through to him. How strong was his hold on his former teammate, Fang wondered. Trying to speak to him again, maybe using the screens to his advantage, \"Look David, while we are here playing our friends are out their risking our lives for us. Come on, break free, I know you can... Don't let him control you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's gaze remained unchanged, but it looked like his fists and upper body language was easing up. Talking halfly, \"Can n't disss appoint,\" as his call for numbers began, springing early on three as his legs tore up the field. Trying to get out of the way and trying to bounce back fast enough to grab his flag, he was just a few centimeters away, he felt its breeze and then nothing. David's dragon tail, smacking him upside the head, his face still sore from the entity's cane slap from before. He'd been in more scraps than this, but without all his muscle or body weight to take some of the impact off, he was starting to get more bruises and cuts along his face and exposed body parts. His arms and pants covered in grass stains from leaping to safety so many times. The scoreboard changed to a four under home as soon as David crossed into the end zone, throwing the football into the ground to gloat. The entity was pleased, leaning closer and closer almost out of his seat at the anticipation of winning and owning everything Fang held dear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepositioning for his kick, Fang just watched, already knowing the result, exploded football. He took this precious time to regain some of his strength by inhaling and exhaling in deep intervals. The giant lummox thundered his steps and kicked in clean through the goal posts and into the unknown. The scoreboard matching the scores up, Home and Visitors where five each, one more touchdown would end it. Fang was holding his paw above his eyes, to see where the ball had gone. Then, suddenly the ball appeared in his arms at such a force, still moving with great speed, as it pounded into his stomach and arms; pushing him back at least seven yards. Catching it, but talking a blow similar to being kicked or punched pushed out some air, spit and blood. He had trouble getting up and the white-suited thing just laughed, reveling in the black wolf's suffering. Fang wanted so much to stay on the grassy floor and wished this all be over... Maybe this was some sick nightmare that he would wake up soon and it was all some sick dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd be back in his mansion, he's parents away on business trips, the amulet safely around his neck and he'd be on his way to football practice... Wouldn't that be nice, he thought trying to find some peace in the chaotic events surrounding him; the screens with his friends in peril, the estranged laughter of the gooey-grinned entity and the monstrous breathing of his friend David... What was he going to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The phrases 'No pain, No gain' and 'Quitters never Win' on the gym wall in the college came to mind. He'd spend hours working out, running miles and building his endurance... This was nothing, he could do this in his sleep. That's why he chose this contest in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause he could do it and will do it; push come to shove if not for himself than to save David, his friends and the world. He couldn't think what his new life world be if the manasource collapsed. He didn't want to lose his friends, his parents or Leena. It suddenly occurred that he wouldn't have come so far without her words of guidance and her comforting gestures. He felt determined than ever to win this thing, if not for everyone else but her. He had to do this. Make this one last play and he would at least be free to go see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough his sights re-focused on Leena, the back of his mind still wondered how he was going to destroy the amulet, he wasn't any closer to it. Though once he freed David, maybe he could have some ideas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mood soared at the thought of finally winning. One more touchdown was all he needed. His gaze couldn't help but keep switching between David and the screens. Soon she would be safe. Soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into position and staring down David, knowing that psyching him was an impossible challenge. He began calling the numbers, when suddenly a scream echoed from the whole arena, looking around, the screens were now audible and the sounds of his friends filtered in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leena, Leena what's wrong?\" Tyler's voice reverberated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, sighing, \" I don't know her head is all warm, she just collapsed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't stop here, \" as Tyler picked up Leena, flying low because the trees stopped his escape and to be close to Jenny as they proceeded further and further into the woods. Fang had been looking at maps of the city for quite some time since his father wanted to get him into his business, but his heart was on football at the time to take any heed from his teachings. But he remembered everything about these particular woods, his father was going to take down a large section of them for some kind of factory, that would 'legally' dispose of waste in the sea. Steep cliffs were at the end of the forest that led to a sheer plunge into sharp rocks and choppy waves. They were running out of time... Fang trying to block out the noise, the entity's grin literally stretching from ear to ear and then David ramming into him pushing him back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Fang shouted, \"I didn't call it yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking too long, ten yard penalty,\" the gloved fingers tapping each other in an impatient matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it get any worse, just than as he feared, his friends were nearing the cliff. They had run out of room and the now fifty foot blob monster roared, getting closer and closer. Tyler couldn't carry both of them to safety. He had to hurry this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth at the pain, he got ready to make another go at it. Hunched down and calling numbers, feeling horrible about his friends' predicament, he ran on his second call hoping to catch David off guard while ducking under his massive left arm. Feeling great, just home free and smack, David's tail clobbered him. This was ridiculous. He couldn't dodge the hulking mass and his freakishly long tail, seriously did it get longer, thought Fang. He looked to the entity that was just sitting there, radiating pure evil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not have time to be wrestling David and his tail, it was practically two against one. Man, did he need some help...</span></div></div>",

There was no faltering his boundless energy and raw power... \"Shouldn't it be mutual on both parties. The game continues Fang, or should I say my soon to be slave,\" he grinned the gooey drops from its mouth still not touching his spotless white suit. \"Though if you want to take a break, you are more than welcome too, I'll take it as your admit to defeat. Failure is inevitable Fang. Just give up and it will be easy roads ahead of you. Think, you could have your muscle back, your strength, your size and vigor. Not this tired wannabe little pup that's barely hanging by a thread. Enter my fold and you will never regret it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not likely, slimeball,\" Fang said crossly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than stop stalling and play!\" It cursed with bubbling rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he had tried to stall, but a few more moments and some monologue from his villainous enemy may have bought him enough time to reserve some strength. Sure he was thin and his muscles were wiry and ropey, but that didn't really matter. If Fang really made it out of this alive and he did save the world. He could always train and earn his muscle and size back. Getting results instantly was not doing him any favors for him. Hell, he wouldn't be where he was now if he didn't take the short cuts he had. Letting the amulet build him up. Sure, he thought it was all him, there were moments were he would shoot in size and muscle like no one he had ever known. What high school freshman had an 8 pack and could intimidate any other player just because he was already over two times their size... He new than that the amulet was more than special, almost magical in nature... He had never truly understood the amulet, or its mysterious affect on him, other than it made him huge and a completely decked out athlete with muscle and curves in all the right places. Looking back, he was a fool to think things didn't come with a price...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today he was paying it all back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got ready to line up, David's body eager to go, but his face seemed to soften. Fang had completely tuned out his friends so he could play, but his gaze returned to the screens as they had reached the cliff, with what looked like only minutes to spare till the monster would eat them or push them over. They needed him and he was done with playing the creature's game. They were fighting over who should be saved, trying to wake up Leena to see if she could fly but nothing, it was like she was unconscious and Tyler wanted to save them both, but his strength was waning too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a deep breath, he counted again, going all the way to the third number and this time he'd make it, even if David was unresponsive, he could help him. Like a mouse trap, Fang shot off, his movements well planned with precision as he faked left and under David's swipe; here came the tail. He grabbed the tail as it came and vaulted over it, making a break for it to the finish line. Landing a little crooked, and crazy weak after he put the last of his energy to escape the tail he was moving in a slow power walk to the finish. The entity cursed and was yelling for David to react and chase Fang down. David managed to grip the ground to sharply turn after having charged practically all the way to his goal posts. Fang was now, doing a sort of gallop movement as his legs were burning. He just had to outrun him this last stretch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 more yards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 more yards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped falling forward as David was on his heels, he could feel his heavy, hot breath on the back of his neck. Practically charging and dog piling on top of him (it was definitely a dog pile considering his entire weight probably equaled if not more the entire defensive line of their football team). He could feel his ribs crack... He never wished for anything more in his entire life for the ball to be over the goal line. It just had to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A sigh of relief watching the scoreboard on the Visitor's side change to 7 and than disappear. The entity shrieked with fury. His tendrils escaping from his sleeves as he pounded and destroyed his own desk. David, was on his arms and knees looking at the ground, the screens still on and playing, his friends meters from certain destruction. The white-suited entity, finished destroying his desk and chair as he blinked over to David. Giving him an earful about 'how worthless he was', 'how he would never amount to anything' and 'how he was the biggest disappointment he had ever seen'. He took he cane in hand and backslapped him across the head. David now a blubbering mess, half spoke meekly, \"So sooo rrry, sorrrry, nnneveeer aaagaaaiiinnn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was starting to feel bad for winning and making him lose. As the entire arena seemed to fade, their positions had not changed, but the area rebuilt back to the room with the light construct furniture (his desk and chair fully repaired) and the checkered marble-like floor.

So you can either waste your chance to save him,\" while the screens still up of his friends outside, \"or pursue your freedom while I'm in a slightly giving mood.\" Using his cane to point behind him, as a large white door appeared behind him with blinding light escaping from the cracks. \"The choice is yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there's a catch... What was he going to do? He couldn't believe that his actions from the past were having such consequences on him now. He'd never take an easy way out for as long as he lived, he swore it. But right not he had to make very difficult decision. He was literally between saving and losing, it was lose - lose all around. Leave without the amulet to help his friends or dive down the hole to save David and risk losing his friends...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He didn't have to think about this twice, he had to save his friend David. It was the only way he would ever have a chance to get the amulet back. Taking a deep breath, he jumped into the squared hole that David submerged into moments before. His friends could last a little longer, he hoped. As the darkness was all around him, only now the screens seemed to be following him and clicking between the outside and to David's most personal memories. He saw many things, trying to decipher what could be holding his friend back so far. He thought David was actually a pretty well-adjusted guy. He didn't think he had any problems. He did well on the field, he talked highly about his younger brother during practice (though the memories of him pinning Tyler to the floor were a counter to that) and sure he had problems in school but what jock didn't. That wasn't anything to go nuts over. Fang didn't have any siblings to really understand the counterproductive behavior praising his brother while at the same time rough-housing with him to the extremes it would seem, they seemed to fight and disagree a lot... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching an end point, he landed on top of a giant cage with solid black bars. Inside was David, massive and huge, his tail, longer than anything he had seen when he was at football practice, was snaking around trying to find room in the cage, only to have a third of it fall out the bottom. David as big as he was, though not as big as he was when he was just playing flag football with him, was really in a downer mood. This must be the real David as it were, where before he had only seen shadow versions, engrossed with power from the amulet. Similar to how he had to find Tyler, he had to make him see the light so he could free him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was crying bitterly at a screen in front of him, the blubbering, musclebound cobalt dragon was a sight for sore eyes. Even if he was a little dark and faded, Fang would find a way to bring his color back. He started out like he did before, \"Hey David, hey Buddy how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awful, just fucking awful dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww it can't be that bad bro. We'll get you up and out of there in no time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking away from the black wolf, \"Ahh, whats the point. I've let my brother down. I've let me parents down. I'll lose my scholarship... everything man. Its over, game over man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa calm down,\" Fang said trying to reach his arms in and to pat his wide back to comfort him. Wow, was he falling to pieces quickly. Fang felt this was one of those, 'grass is always greener' deals. He thought that David's life was perfect. At least David saw his parents every holiday and they even came to his big games. Fang barely saw his parents but a handful of times throughout the year. The family dinner table was always just him it had seemed. Well, perhaps the opposite was true, maybe having active parents was putting a burden on him. His expectation to excel all the time was similar to his. He really didn't think it bothered him, he hid it so well. Being the best is always a struggle and its a hard thing to overcome and to be the better person and to know when you've reached your limits... Fang remembered something he had read that reminded him about the way parents are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\u201cAll parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.\u201d \u2014 Mitch Albom</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents were like that, and probably the only thing that the amulet was ever good for, was that he had survived his childhood, meetings his parent's expectations, and they were very high. His parents were never satisfied yet he always seemed to meet the mark... that is until it came to taking over the family business, finding a suitable wife and being an upright citizen in the community, with those topics all bets were off as far as Fang was concerned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut David didn't have the amulet to help him do well and to exceed the expectations, Fang was lucky to escape his childhood a little unscathed from his parents, but David was a veritable train wreck, a bull in a china shop, that whole bit. Bouncing between football, school, social life and the addition of his little brother. His parents must have been wanting him to be the perfect role model and to always look out for his little brother, Tyler. So much was going on with David, the pressure to be the best, the pressure to always win, no wonder growing and getting big was an easy desire of his, thinking back on what the entity was saying about his 'simple' desires. David must have been carrying the world on his shoulders too, though not literally the world but the world that mattered to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never really thought of David more than a teammate yet here he was at his lowest point and, him, Fang, his arch-nemesis, his rival, an almost physical equal back before this whole amulet nonsense gone awry, he had been making everyone's life a living hell. There was just no way around it, he was the worst being to roam the planet, he felt as a darkness stirred within him. His heart pained greatly, and his muscles convulsed a bit. What was happening to him, Fang felt bewildered and confused. It must have been the darkness on his heart and soul stirring within him. He felt like he was dying as he was trying to grasp for the breath of life that was escaping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking from his depression, David looked on... \"What's wrong? What's happening to you? Can I do anything to help you? I don't know how I got here or who you are but if there's anything I can do to help, please let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping his furred chest with his claw, Fang tried to augment his breathing while the other keeping a shaky hold of the cage. It was sweet that it didn't matter how bad he was feeling he always seemed to put others before himself. That was David, the gentle giant of the football team. Not so much a pushover, but hell David at least did some community service work and helped out his brother, as long as his brother never found out. He'd deny it though, even when he had helped clean his shop a couple of times and repair the roof when it was leaking. David went so far as to ask me to see if I could convince my father to give them a week extension for a late month's payment for the comic shop back when it first started out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, past all the expectation and the need to be a good role model for his little brother, David was probably more caring and loving than Fang and even Tyler realized. He did out of love, a brotherly love that Fang seemed to know nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally trying to do his best to keep it together, the pain still there but not an overly pressing thought compared to saving David, Leena and the world. He spoke with a light grunt, \"No, I'm fine. Its you I'm more worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rolled his eyes, \"Don't waste your time,\" his tone lowered to his deep bass. \"I'm a waste of time, not worth a damn!\" Scoffing as his gaze drifted back to the screens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was debating how to handle David's shattered ego...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Really, needing to hurry this up, Fang didn't need to hold David's hand. A good old reality check was what he really needed. If he could reach him, Fang would slap the shit out of him. \"Don't be stupid David. You're fucking awesome! Don't ever say your worthless, EVER! I don't care what others say, you are a terrific guy that would do anything for others in need. You don't wait around to act, you never looked for a reason to help someone, you just did it. You can't sit there and tell me that Tyler doesn't think you're worthless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's gaze shifted downward, as his tail ventured back into the cage, finding his clawed hands, he began to hold it like a dammed security blanket... \"It's worse. He hates me!!! We had a terrible fight, I pushed him into a wall just because I wouldn't share the amulet with him. I was all about doing the right thing, but I wanted to be selfish. I deserve this,\" gesturing to the cage, \"I should have let him have it. He deserves the amulet more than I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me you couldn't be more than wrong,\" Fang laughed a little though the pain in his chest was getting worse, Fang continued with tension in his voice, \"Why do you think I'm here and we're in this mess? Why do you think you're in a cage of darkness? The amulet feeds on negative emotions, giving you your desires as it destroys everything around you that you love. Sure you shoved Tyler into a wall, but you guys fight all the time. Its what you guys do, he'll get over it I promise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking away, still holding his tail, \"But what if I do it again? What if I really really hurt him like I hurt you, I could have killed you,\" David slowly remembering the events upstairs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew the risk, David. I took them anyways, why do you think I came down here. Just to watch you suffer. No, you deserve better than that. You are my friend and I know that you'd do the same if I were Tyler. You need to know that your younger brother will always love you, even if you are acting stupid. It kind of happens when you are apart of a loving family. Your parents cared for you so much, that they only wanted what was best for you. I know what its like to have the pressure of meeting high expectations, my parents were the same way. And sure they can be strict at times, and sure you may have arguments with them, but by the end of the day your family will always love you no matter what. And that's something you can never hide from. You know its true...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that was all the wisdom he had to give, he felt the area grow lighter somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long pause, David let go of his tail and tried to stand in his cage. In a booming voice, \"You're right. It doesn't matter what trophies I do or don't get, my family will always love me and even forgive me when I do stupid stuff.\" His color was retuning back to him, and his attitude was returning to his face. His dropping expression, turned alive and steadfast. He looked at the bars and with a sweeping motion of his arms and tail, the cage was gone and blurred like a smoky fog. As the cage disappeared, he caught Fang as he fell into his arms, David could sense something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a pained smile was on his face, Fang had to put all of his energy just into breathing. It was awful that there wasn't anything he could do to help. Suddenly, all the darkness began to fade away and they were back in the white room with all the furniture and the entity with the now dirty white suit, he made a violent gesture with his cane, as all the screens vanished as they weren't helping him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to gloat I presume! You mortals are disgusting! All feelings and emotions, all I wanted was to make you the best you ungrateful Sonsabitches, the lot of you. I gave you everything, and this is how you repay me. I can't believe I wanted you as my slaves...\" his voice sounded weak but high-pitched. His face and fingers thinned considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than you don't... understand us very well...\" said Fang pushing the words out, still in David's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preposterous, you humans and animals are all alike. Greedy, selfish and needy. You don't care for anything but yourselves. I've seen your kind for centuries destroy one another, the rise and fall of civilizations countless times... When the Mageblood were in control it was paradise. Peace throughout the world, that none of you could fathom. I wanted to make the world right again and you pathetic creatures don't even deserve to bask in the light of the Sun. Go, on and hide in your holes. The Manasource is moments from collapsing and all my brothers and sisters will be freed from their exiles. In moments, the whole world will be as it should. Go before I change my mind!\" Throwing his cane, across the room and behind them at the white door, that now cracked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get up and out of David's arms, trying to walk to the entity, clearly struggling, his voice straining, \"No, we're not finished yet. The darkness, take it away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being's gooey mouth, returned with a smile, \"Well, its not a complete loss I suppose. There's that. I could watch you suffer till your last dying breaths,\" the floor turning to more mudlike than slime, and the tendrils weakly tried to hold the black wolf in place just faded away as quickly as it had come. \"But no, a deal is a deal. I never go back on my word. Though,\" he hesitated, that was never a good sign...</span></div></div>",

As much as I like watching you suffer, I don't like the idea of seeing you explode over my nice suit. So a trade, your amulet for mine. Seems fair? You won't need it anyways once the darkness is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid moving a bit behind Fang, putting his arm on his shoulder, whispering as best he could, \"No don't, it's a trick. He'll control you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no. I can only control you when you voluntarily let me. Fang clearly despises me and would never let me back in again willingly,\" it spoke with eerie sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, I'd rather go back to climbing that mountain,\" David gave an odd glance, as Fang returned an 'I'll tell you later' glace, \"than have you control me again. Then how will it work. Us switching amulets. What will it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he said as he walked over to meet him half way in front of his desk, \"when you wear my amulet again this time, the darkness that came from it will return to it. Kind of like how the dark blobs returned to the amulet before. You see, its true there is darkness stained to your heart and soul, but its my darkness and its a wanting that yearns to be reunited with me. If you just joined me it would have gone away in time. But these days, everyone needs it done now now now. The half-assed purification ritual your girlfriend did severed the connection forcing what was left to poison your heart and soul, not the other way around.\" Fang gave an angered look. \"Its true. I will prove it. Everything that belongs to me, always finds it way back to me and my Celtic Knot amulet.\" He took the amulet off and held it in the air, walking around the room as the white furniture turned gooey and black and got absorbed into the amulet. Even his desk and chair, retreated into the amulet as he held it in his hand. \"See, like I said. You don't have much time to think on it. With the manasource collapsing soon, will also mean the collapse of the connection the animals and humans share to the manasource. And when that happens, the darkness that has stained your heart and soul, that feeds on your bond with the manasource will begin to leech your life away as a substitute. And that process will be excruciatingly painful and will kill you. You think what you are feeling now is bad? Just wait till later, you will be begging to be put out of your misery. I have always been civil with you Fang, haven't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang still tumbling the facts in his head, did nod a little. I guess as bad guys had come, he had been pretty tame with them. Sure, twisting the rules and cheating a little isn't too bad. If it really wanted Fang to suffer, it would have killed Leena. There wasn't enough howling in the world that could have spared his heart the pain of losing the only creature he ever truly loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I'm not a bad guy. I like getting my just desserts as do you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you get when you get his amulet?\" David asked standing his ground and being suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its no secret I'll gain more power I suppose. What's it to you? I can't exist without having a sustainable flow of energy, feeding off of your desires and your fears was the only way I could survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O so you're like a vampire now?\" David asked a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but sure if it helps you understand my plight,\" he walked around where his desk was, being a mime and feeling as though it were there, \"Once upon a time, I was trapped, weak and asleep. But then this wolf came and reawakened me with the strongest desires, wants and needs that couldn't be bought. Showing my gratitude for awakening me and playing as my host for all this time, I repaid him with strength, power and size. Making his muscle grow bigger and greater than any athlete his age. He was an all-star, the very best! I thought it was what he wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used me,\" Fang grumbled, the pain forcing him to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this isn't something you have time to analyze and think about. It's either yes or no. Life or death... Deal or no deal?\" it implored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing you to make a decision quickly...</span></div></div>",

Every moment that passed felt like he was dying and he had come too far to stop. He knew he had to pay for what he had done, but he didn't think he really had to pay with his life. That would have been to much, there was so much left that he hadn't done yet. He didn't tell his family and his house staff how sorry he was for being a jerk all these years. Sure Tyler was a first, but there were many others he bullied that deserved to hear him say how sorry he was. So many bridges burned that needed to be repaired so he could the process of forgiveness and healing. Its true he had done a lot of awful things, more than he cared to think about, but it had to be done and it wouldn't resolve itself if he died. He had to make things right, and heaven help him do the right thing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking weak and soft, \"Deal,\" as he outstretched his hand. The entity took his empty hand and tendrils and shook on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who knows, you may even regain some of your strength and muscle you lost,\" winking to Fang as they shook, which was beyond creepy as eyes sockets were filled with gooey goo, that would make anyone cringe. The idea of getting some strength back was reassuring to say the least, he couldn't even think about returning to football with his currently lightweight frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his amulet off and having it in his hand to make the trade, David still behind him worrying and saying, \"Are you sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked at him, cringing in his face from the pain of now having taken the amulet off. His chest on fire! \"I don't have much of a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically doing the trade, simultaneously, both had their hands out, releasing their prized amulets to one another. The white-suited entity laughing greatly as it merely held the Wisdom's Loop amulet, he began to fill out again. His thinned expression, was returning to what it was if not more. His chest expanding and the suit tearing at the arms, as his biceps tearing through the fabric. He was growing in size as the amulet began to spin around and around in his hands, growing outlandishly tall and sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang on the other hand was bereft of his cure, as the pain was becoming too much to bear. Howling mournfully as he tried to grip the blue-glowing Celtic Knot amulet steady and trying to hold it to his chest, clearly it had to be worn to work. David was helping him put it on, but the pain was taking much longer than expected to leave him. David holding his hand, trying to give him support and strength, the entity laughing maniacally lost in its own power trip, the scene was a complete disaster. Fang pulled David in, whispering so light that no one but him could hear. With his free paw, sprawled on the floor, it pointed toward the door. Fang laid his head on the ground, as the amulet glowing blue lay face up on the checkerboard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching carefully at the entity, it's focus lost in its own ecstasy, David used his extremely long tail to grab the cane by the door. The moment it was within his clawed hands, in one swift motion he flipped the cane and smashed the cane into the amulet, cracking the heart-like gem in the center!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the surge of power cease, the entity looked down at the scene of the broken amulet. In a bloodcurdling scream, it shrieked, and howled in pain. His white suit, what was left of it was turning black and gooey, as the bubbling mass began to fizz down, slowly but surely being called back into the Celtic Knot amulet. The room around them too became gooey like, and the white door behind them began to turn into the black goo as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go,\" David hollered as he picked his weakened friend up and exited through the shrinking light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant blob monster from outside suddenly froze and rumbled in place. The black goo bubbling furiously as it exploded into nothingness. The colorful particles it had been collecting and stored within its mass shot out in the sky looking like a meteor shower around the world, restoring the Manasource.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Fang appeared in the massive clearing of trees that came up to the cliffs edge. Where were his friends, Fang wondered as he awakened with a jolt, his hand cramping from holding the Celtic Knot amulet so tight. David was trying to get his bearings as he wondered around the cleared area and looking into the wooden areas on the edges. Calling out for his Brother and Leena...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing some noises, coming from the cliff side, Fang dragged himself over looking down to see that on the edge of a thick tree root and Jenny's strapped bag, they were able to make it over the ledge with Tyler holding the unconscious Leena and Jenny hugging fast to Tyler's waist. His wings flapping softly to support them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smiled to see them safe, but he hadn't the strength to pull them over. He could barely stand, yet he called out for David to assist him. Not instantaneously, but within a couple of moments David popped his head out of some bushes as he made his way over to them. Laying on the ground and extending his arm over the edge, he pulled his littler brother up with the two girls with ease. Tyler gave a sigh of relief and blushed smile as David hugged him rigorously with a noogie for his headfur. Jenny than clasped her hands with Tyler and thanked him properly for being so brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm the one that pulled you up from the cliff...\" David said wanting some credit too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, she said as she punched him in the shoulder. \"If you two didn't take so long we wouldn't have had to.\" David rubbed the side of his arm, pretending it hurt. He looked over to Fang with Leena in his arms as he pushed back her headfur, the strict bun that her hair was in was loose and made her more serene and at peace. She didn't have a fever now, but why wasn't she waking up? Fang looked on gravely...</span></div></div>",

Fang looked up to him with a thankful expression as he hastily draped the amulet around her neck. Her eyes not a flutter or movement in her chest. He held her closely now, crying like he had never cried before. The love of his life that was so kind to him, she didn't even know him but he had saved him countless times. How could he thank her for being his inspiration, for helping him get through all these tough times. Today, Fang had faced all of his deepest troubles and challenges that could not be compared with any of his trials and tribulations in his past. And now this, he held her closing wishing for her to be alive again just so he could, at the very least see her smile on her elegantly calm striped face. He cried for her, hugging her tight once more. A cyan - green light glowed from the amulet around her neck, splitting into two pieces, the two dragons that were forced to round forever, were separated with one half adorning her next and the other on Fang's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments, Leena gasped for air as her breathing returned. Her eyes flew open as they darted around, afraid at first, but the moment she laid eyes on Fang, she smiled and knew he had done it. He had saved the manasource, he had saved everyone and finally he had saved her from the abyss and death's door. With the manasource weakening and her need to use her powers, she just couldn't drink from a well without any water as they say, and she fell ill and mana deprived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said soft but sure as she kissed his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning the favor, \"No thank you. Because without you I couldn't have help myself or anyone else.\" She shook her head, clearly embarrassed, yet humbled. \"No its true. I think it goes without saying that we all wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, this guy,\" she said holding her paw to his face, \"such a sweet talking.\" She smiled again and nuzzled his nose, as their cold, wet noses sent a spark through one another. Leena taking her moments with Fang slowly, she broke away to look at Tyler and Jenny snuggling it out. \"And thank you Tyler for carrying me when I could not walk. You must have been carrying me for a couple of miles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O it was nothing,\" he blushed, \"its what any gentledragon would have done.\" David about to hit him upset the head, but Fang held his arm and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bro, how'd you get those?\" David said looking at his wings intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O these,\" said Tyler hovering up and around, \"probably the same way you got that crazy long tail of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? I'm thinking of naming it Taily. It has a mind of its own sometimes,\" David joked and looked around, \"so how do we back home from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home? Don't you remember, you destroyed it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?!?\" David a bit afraid. \"O gosh, what are we gunna do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O peep down over there. Can't a guy get some sheesh. It's the least I deserve for saving all of youse. As soon as we get into town in the morning, I'll for my driving to pick us all up. We can have breakfast at my place and we can work things out from there,\" Fang said yawning as he curled with Leena by his. After getting lost in each other's eyes for a bit, they soon fell to sleep. Dreaming about the rest of their lives, and the time they would spend together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jenny, Tyler settled down at the stump of one of the trees, letting his wings settle softly before leaning back. Jenny cozied up with him  as they held hands, overlooking the cliff and what seemed a never-ending shower of meteors and twinkling stars in the colorful night sky. It was clear out here in the wild and nature held the best view of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing about between the two couples, David laid his head on the ground staring up at the sky with lights moving around and the stars twinkling. Sure, he had skipped school and football practice that day, but if he meant to do it on purpose, he couldn't think of any better company than his closest friends and his younger brother... Yeah, life was good, but life would be better with bacon, \"Will there be bacon?\" he openly asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couples responded with shushes and sighs, Fang said, \"Whatever you want. Now be quiet and go to sleep. Tomorrow is the start of something new...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David was drifting off to sleep, he thought simply of a story he knew long ago. A story he and his brother knew by heart when they were much younger, but now have forgotten. The characters and colors danced in his mind, blurred with footballs and his studies, the words rhyming and soft with their own self-made tune. Though simple and few, it made him remember of what fun times he and his brother shared that carried him to sleep this night: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Today was good. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one. -Dr. Seuss </div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up to the sunrise first, David got up stretching. The light filtering through the clouds was pleasant. He didn't feel any different, other than maybe being an inch or two bigger all around with his tail practically twice as long as before, he couldn't be too sure without a tape measure. Waving it back and forth, picking up things with it, he could totally use to help during football he thought. Hopefully the coach won't be too mad about them skipping practice. They did have a game on Monday David thought, as he shrugged his shoulders. Looking around at the two couples, it was kind of nice seeing them with a special someone. He couldn't really think about it with the prospect of the game on his mind. Stretching his legs before walking around, he saw the Celtic Knot amulet below Fang's hand. He must have dropped it in his sleep. He wondered if the nightmare really had been over, but he couldn't muddle through all the thoughts that were going through his head. He thought he could scream, but picking up a nearby stick, he began to draw shapes in the ground to keep himself busy as he awaited for the others to wake. His stomach grumbling for food as he hushed it. It felt like he hadn't eaten for days, though its probably only been just one. He looked back at the giant cleared path of trees the glob monster had cut into the forest. It was a long way back to town. He sighed, finding some hard pieces of broken ground and rock, throwing them over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny seemed to wake up yawning and stretching, slightly bewildered but than a quick flash of her memories and she remembered it all. She saw Tyler, his head tilted, drooling a little. In a cute way of course, she couldn't help herself from taking off her jacket and putting on him. Other than some pants, he and Fang were both pretty barebacked. A lot had happened yesterday as she softly walked over to David, her arms crossed, supporting her self as the wind was gentle and soft. Looking at him. \"So how long have you been awake for?\" she asked softly, not to wake the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a half hour, not too long really. What a crazy day yesterday, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she gave a forced laugh, could he really take things so lightly, \"a lot did happen yesterday. I'm still trying to get some of the images out of my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked clueless of Jenny's experience in the comic shop parking light and the fearful flight across town. Explaining as well as she could, he was a bit shocked. \"Whoa, wow... I'm sorry about all that. While I was busy sleeping, you all were going through hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"Its not too bad, but that gooey face, that monster so formless and terrifying. I don't think it will leave me soon. It came in my dreams in the night, I hugged Tyler closer but I didn't want to wake him.\" She looked at Fang, \"Seeing just the aftermath of what Fang has gone through, I can only imagine what you and Tyler went through as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" Tyler perked over, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey. I was saying how Fang, David and you went through a lot yesterday and it doesn't compare to what I went through at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O,\" trying to pull her closer to comfort her, \"that's okay. Its probably better if you didn't think a lot about it, it was quite rough. Though,\" he said putting her back and putting his arm under his chin, \"I did spend the morning shopping for new clothes.\" He said trying to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed a real laugh and said, \"O Ty we'll just have to get you some new clothes then now won't we.\" She smiled back at him, but he glared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping some dust off his pants, \"If you don't mind I'll just stick with Tyler. It's just it reminds me of trying to be something I wasn't Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O,\" she said covering her mouth, \"I'm sorry I didn't know. I thought you liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At one time I did, but it just never really worked out the way I wanted,\" said Tyler knowing that anytime anyone would call him Ty for short, he would have flashbacks of the events of yesterday, both the good and the bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O that's nothing, I played football yesterday with Fang. We tussled a bit, but Fang beat me out in the end,\" his mind suddenly went off like a lightning bulb moment, \"wait a second, that's Fang as in Fang I play football with on the same team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the whole conversation, Fang and Leena laid where they were looking at them as they grasped their hands a little tighter as they slowly stood up. The colorful particles were in the air, gently moving about in no particular fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the biggest guy on the field, to that,\" he said gesturing to the black wolf next to Leena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Fang, we've all been through a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wolf went through the most,\" said Leena playing with his headfur and playing with his face trying to massage and de-stress him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww dude, I don't know if coach is gonna let you play looking like that,\" he said disheveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing Leena's hands away and taking a moment to stare at the Celtic Knot amulet, he picked it up and put it in his pocket. \"And I'm okay with that,\" he said with determination. \"Now if ya don't shaddup you won't get any bacon. We have a long walk ahead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why walk when you can fly,\" said Tyler, swooping Jenny up as Leena with fang flew up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning behind them, \"O come on you guys, that's not fair,\" following them along the cleared path.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, making it to the Matthew's House a good two hours before noon, a bunch of cops and media vans were about. They didn't think of that, they looked on frozen in shock. Fang and Leena, stopped flying so no one would see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe five or ten minutes later, David was up behind them out of breath. \"Hey why'd you guys stop,\" noticing all the cars and vehicles. One of their neighbors pointed out to them and they were swarmed by cameras and reporters, even that steamy fox from channel 7 was there. All talking at once, throwing out words such as hurricanes, meteor showers, destruction and such. They didn't know anything about the amulet. Only that their house was the only thing destroyed in all the bizarre events. Fang managed to push them all off, making up the excuse that they were camping in the woods when it happened. And they thanked their lucky stars how they weren't in the house at the time. Some cops took down the rest of their statements. Tyler having to file a report for insurance purposes, a call he really didn't feel like making. Apparently they all thought they were killed and they were reporting on what they thought were natural disasters not of the supernatural phenomena kind. After, Tyler made a rather lengthy call, David called out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the fridge!\" as he knelt in their half destroyed kitchen. He cried a little as the others were assessing the rest of the house for damages. The second floor structurally unsound, there wasn't any real way to get their things past the first floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insurance said they were have people out by the middle of next week. David, pick yourself up off the floor and call Mom and Dad and let them know we're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I doing it?\" he feebly protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I just handled a half hour long phone call with our Insurance to make sure all the damages and the things would be replaced. I am not in the mood to be speaking with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, \"okay okay. Don't have a cow. Afterwards then can we have breakfast?\" he asked dialing on the landline which was still working, despite the gapping hole in their house starting from his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After my phone gets charged a little. I'll have my Dad's chauffeur come and pick us up and have some food ready for us back at the house. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyup!\" David said happily as the phone was ringing and his tail was swinging back and forth. After moving some rubble from the closet door, he took out a luggage bag and started collecting some clothes and books, being responsible and taking the things out of the safe too. Important records, cards and papers that couldn't be left there, his parents already taking all of the super valuables they had with them to Florida. Jenny helping him sort through the wreckage for things he may need. \"Tyler, mom wants to hear your voice to make sure you're alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea yea, hi mom, busy trying to save some of our stuff, can't come to the phone,\" shouting from across the house from what was their living room. Good thing their furniture was cheap but their TV had like two more payments left, he was hoping Renter's Insurance covered that. He was shouting out things for Jenny to write down so he could send them to claims. Leena was just looking around at the destruction, all of the other houses untouched, but theirs. It was extremely unfortunate but at least no lives were lost, so that kept her spirits up a bit as she looked a Fang who seemed to be having a hard time to convince his driver it was him, just because he said 'thank you'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up the phone a bit heated, but calmed he said aloud, \"Okay he'll be here in fifteen. If we don't get it all Tyler we can come back. Would that be okay Tyler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding his head, \"Yeah, I'm just about finished, I am a bit worried to grab anything from upstairs. Any real movement could drop the second floor on top of the first and not even wanting to thing about all the old stuff in the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not, you know, fly up?\" Jenny said pointing at his wings with the pen she was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed a bit and replied, \"O gosh, I totally forgot about that. O good. I can grab another bag and get some of the electronics. Good thing it wasn't really a storm or we'd have to have those replaced too due to water damage.\" Flying up with his dragon wings, he was being careful to move things as he threw a duffle bag over his shoulder, grabbing more clothes to protect any of the electronics he put in like his laptop, the tablet and his game console. Stowing some of the games in to play later if he had the chance. Maybe hook up to a motel TV and de-stress. \"O man, the comic shop. I can't just leave it closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can stop by their real quick and you can post a sign and take a personal day,\" Fang suggested his house was a mess and he knew that he'd have to do more with insurance before the day was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good,\" he said as he was flying his way down with two bags ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, love ya too. Tell Dad not to get so mad on the golf course, his blood pressure, ya know, okay bye...\" he sighed, hanging up the phone. \"O sheesh, well they said for us to get the stuff from the safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already taken care of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny responded, \"Yep\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O you're good. Call them before the day is through. They worried about you too little bro.\" Deliberately landing next to him to compare sizes. He wasn't so small and diminutive anymore. He was a good foot and a half tall. Six foot five was average for dragons, and David laughed. Messing with his headfur, David said, \"You'll always be my little bro no matter what happens to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes and pushing the bags to him to carry, a long stretch car similar to a limousine, but not quite showed up. Honking in the front, Fang walked over to the driver window, as the driver pushed the window down, blown away by Fang's appearance. \"Master Fang!\" he exclaimed. Fang told him to calm down as everyone piled in, getting the suicide doors open for the girls while the trunk was popped up for David to put the bags in. They all sat there relaxed as the crushed velvet maroon seats felt like clouds from heaven.</span></div></div>",

Not too much damage, but he'd have to clean it up still... But to hell with that, the idea of a personal day sounding better by the minute. The car ride was relaxed with the exception of David who was complaining about how hungry he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a minute he was in there, a lanky white bird in suspenders meandered in, squawking about, as Tyler was checking everything to make sure nothing was broken or stolen. \"I knew it was you!\" He said pointing a feathered finger at Tyler who was walking through the curtains with a cardboard box with some papers and valuables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need, Ned?\" Tyler said looking over his desk for his keys and his probably dead cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O don't play that card with me again, Ty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face tensed up, and some bad images of yesterdays affairs zoomed in and out like a passing car. \"If you don't mind I would like it if you never called me that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O come on you were a rampaging monster, channel 7 is gunna want to hear the exclusive from me about how I rescued a damsel in distress from the monster made out of goo,\" he said with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like the start to a bad monster movie Ned, no one is going to believe you. They think it was a natural disaster. You got no proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes going back and forth, scanning his mind, he was right he didn't really have any proof, looking back at Tyler, \"Well, how do you explain those? Those wings? You just suddenly have wings now huh?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop it Ned,\" too tired to really go at it. \"I'm thinking of extending my personal day to at least two now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I saw,\" he said red in the face and flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Ned, its pretty much you say, I say right now. So as far as I'm concerned nothing happened. If you just want to keep cool about it and not say anything to anyone, I'd really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I... You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me ban you from coming back here Ned, I am not in the mood for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that guy giving you problems bro,\" David said, standing in the doorway with his arms on his waist. His masculinity enough to intimidate anyone with a weak heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was just leaving,\" Ned said as his gaze narrowed, making his way to the door. Using his feathered fingers, he was pointing at his eyes and back to Tyler repeatedly, \"I'll be keeping an eye on you. This isn't the end of Ned,\" he proclaimed as he cautiously moved past David and ran off to his car to drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, \"thanks,\" Tyler said finding his phone in-between some papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a whack job, you deal with some strange people, you know that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He saw everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" he said pounding his fists into one another, \"need me to rough him up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his arms down, \"nah, he's pretty harmless anyways. It'd be a waste of your time... O wow!\" Tyler said with some surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? What is it?\" David said moving towards Fang at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My phone is still working,\" he said as he was looking through his messages, \"Your coach called me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww man,\" David said as threw his arms down, though his tail had a different agenda as it snaked around and grabbed the smartphone from Tyler. \"Let's see what else he said,\" as he looked through the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait, stop!\" Tyler said as he was trying to grab his phone. David, still able to hold him back with one hand on his head, even with wings, his tail pulled one of his legs down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler left his screen on the photoscroll, David grinned a bit, \"So this was you huh? After you grabbed the amulet from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O come on man, don't bring that up. I was deleting them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, why they're good you handsome devil you. Fuck, some of these are my poses aren't they.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, \"Come on David give it back, I was deleting them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why these selfies are pretty good. With a bit of muscle you turned out to be a real stud. And you were like this for a whole day! Bet you got some nice compliments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but that's not me anymore. I don't want to be that jerk from yesterday. Had to hide behind the counter the whole time to hide my hard on. I was practically turned on the whole day. It was something I don't care to remember so I'm getting rid of all the evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do that?\" he said with a different tone, \"you can't delete parts of who you are. You may be Tyler the dragon who owns this comic, game and hobby shop. But you're also a young male. You're thinking of getting with Jenny right?\" Tyler blushed at the thought, he wanted to take it nice and slow with her, he wasn't some guy who needed to satisfy himself whenever he felt like it. \"Thought so, but you know better. Leave that to remind yourself every once and while who you don't want to be. Because safe to say it bro, there is a hound dog in all of us and you gotta let him out sometime.\" Holding the phone in his fist, and lightly punching Tyler in the stomach, \"besides, you could use some more muscle anyways. It wouldn't hurt for you to go back to the gym. I'd even help ya, you know. Just cause I have football and college these days doesn't mean I won't make time for you...\" Tyler was trying to say something, but his tongue was tied with the deepness the conversation had gone. \"And I'm sorry about before,\" David said in a lower tone, dropping the phone in Tyler's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the phone and then back to David, Tyler thinking this was probably the most intense conversation he had ever had with his brother, \"Sorry for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For pushing you in the wall that day. I was being a jerk and you were hurt and I shrugged it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler recollecting the events the night he stole the amulet back from his brother, \"O well, it wasn't so bad. We were just being you know brothers, its what we do. Don't gotta get so emotional about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I hadn't been so rough with you, you wouldn't have taken the amulet  back and got all gooey and in darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not all your fault. The blame is clear to share. My own jealousy wanted the amulet back, and my own fears forced me into a prison. I didn't think I could be anything other than your shadow. I lost who I was just because I couldn't measure up to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave a hard look at his younger brother, they were both kind of opening up to each other about the whole thing for the first time, \"Don't ever think that you have to ever measure up to me. We're not the same and that is what makes each of us, you know special...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, pocketing the phone and leaving the pictures alone, \"I know that now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both pretty messed up,\" David said halfheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to say was, but if you still feel that way, you're the messed up one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ass,\" he said as he gave Tyler a noogie to his headfur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes as he tossed David the cardboard box. He walked out as Tyler turned to close the door and lock up, the black smears on the glass not something he wanted to think about. He eagerly jumped back inside the limousine, safely with Jenny and the rest of the gang. They sped off to... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Driver opened the door and bowed his head. Five more animals in suited-attire, three were at periodic intervals on the large stone steps while the other two came to retrieve the bags from the trunk.

She shook as Fang approached her, looking at the floor and dared not to look him in the eyes. \"Here you are Master Fang. We managed to repair the door to your room and I found some clothes for you to wear. Are you alright sir? The driver gave such grave news and I was worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after all he had done to her before, Fang thought, she was still trying to be nice to him. He felt bad, he knew he had treated the rest of the staff just as awful as he treated Palmetto. He put his hand to take up the clothes, knowing full well the clothes were too big, they fit the old him. Speaking with a stiff tone, \"These clothes are much to big, Palmetto...\" She flinched, with her hands free she folded them over her skirt, bowing repeatedly saying 'how sorry she was'. \"No no,\" said Fang a gentleness that had never been known in these halls, \" Please there will be no need for that. Its okay my dear. I will find something for myself to wear. Well, I mean to say is that I should be the one apologizing to you.\" He put his hand on her shoulder and lifted her up so she could stop groveling and for once be looking like civilized folks. Her eyes grew wide, but her face stayed reserved as it has been for so many years. \"I would like to apologize for my behavior yesterday and for so many times before. I had treated you especially awful Palmetto receiving all my years of wrath first hand. I am sure the things you've told the staff about me are true.\" He looked to everyone, all the faces he'd seen over his years of living. Not even knowing all of their names, he was just beside himself. No wonder the amulet liked him, he had made all of them suffer with his verbal abuse, reducing them to nothing. Well he had to make amends, and he was hoping he could change the way they thought about him. \"And that goes for everyone here. I know how you all must think of me as a horrible wolf to put up with, but I want to put your minds at ease. That is not who I am anymore and no one should fear me, especially within my own home. I hope you all can forgive me in time for my insidious behavior. And as a sign of my new self, you all must have the rest of the day off, paid in full. You have done a lot of hard work and the place looks amazing for father's guests tomorrow evening. Please take the day for yourselves and may you come back to know the better me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was such a silence in the halls that a pin dropping would have been heard through the mansion. Then slowly they began to disperse, their footsteps in an energetic pace and surprised whispers. Palmetto remained only not afraid or trembling, but rather glad with tears rolling down her face. She had been the one taking care of him for all those years and to see him turn into a rampaging beast nearly broke her heart. But today, she was so happy to see that he had made a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O Master Fang,\" she started, \"it makes me so happy to see that you are doing better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding a finger up, \"Not better, great!\" He put the oversized clothes tucked under his outer arm as his other arm held hands with Leena again. She too was smiling seeing the grand gesture and generosity that seemed to make the old Fang vanish completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a bold mood, she leapt to hug the two of them, smiling, \"O thank you, thank you kindly, Master Fang. I can only tell that this young lady is the cause for your change, but to see you standing together so happy. Words cannot express my gratitude to you fair tigress.\" After a long hug and squeezing their necks, she hopped down and made her way out of the hall, looking back every so often and sighing with ease and longing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O wow Fang, what was that all about?\" Tyler said breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, repairing bridges. I had gone on too long with anger inside me, that now I must makes things right again. Like I did for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit, \"Well, we kind of helped each other out so it was no big deal. Let bygones be bygones you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to face Tyler and David, \"Not exactly. You and your brother are without a home because of me. I insist you stay here while your home gets repaired for however long that should take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler taking a step back, 'stay here in this castle' he thought. But David went up to Fang, picking him up as he said, \"O thank you thank you Fang. I knew we were buddies! We can go to class and practice together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it friends,\" Fang said with strain under David's enormous muscles crushing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O sorry,\" David said putting him down, forgetting he wasn't the big behemoth he used to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler trying to be very civil with him, \"Fang thanks but you really don't have too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense I wouldn't dream of my closest friends staying in some rundown motel when I have plenty of room to spare. Your bags have already been brought up to our guest rooms. What's mine is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid made a b-line across the floor, Jenny said quickly, \"Where's he going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a smell from the air, the fragrant aromas of the meal already prepared for them, \"There can only be one answer to that...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the group made their way into an extravagant dining hall, a large table filled with fifteen seats on each side, the smells of food were quite tantalizing. David already finding a seat at a far end near a giant turkey, ripping the leg off as he began eating and trying to fill his monstrous appetite. The others joined him on the same of the table. Fang sat at the head of the table with Leena to his right as the windows on the side of the hall were letting in such might from the sun; scattered slices of colors from the glass and crystal. Fang smiled broadly to see the dining table to be filled with such joy and splendor, the rare yet required business dinners he had to attend for his father were hardly considered quality family time. But this, with his friends and Leena, this was more than he could have asked for. He was mad hungry, but with a normal helping, he didn't need to wolf down as much food as David did. He knew David was just bulking up for the game tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did have a football game tomorrow, but how could he go there looking like this. He certainly couldn't play linebacker anymore. Being an athlete and playing football was his life. He wasn't sure what else he could do. Fang dreaded the thought of going into business and following the footsteps of his father. He wasn't all the good with numbers or finances that was true. He couldn't do something he didn't love. He liked being active and doing sports. The first time he was suited up in his gear to play High school football was the greatest feeling he had ever had. He felt like he finally found a place where he belonged. Even though he didn't look like he could play, he couldn't deny what he liked to do regardless of his current size. It was the same reason why he challenged the entity to flag football. He couldn't think about doing anything else. He sighed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying some delicious soup, Leena glanced over to Fang. His face was indeed lighter and happier, but there were just some things you can't hide. She held his arm, slowly moving to his paw and one by one their fingers locked together. She gave him a reassuring gesture, but the worry from his brow didn't dissipate as well as she would have hoped. \"What's wrong Fang? Do you not like your food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, trying to put a fake smile, \"No no. The food is great I was just thinking about tomorrow. I don't know how I am going to explain to the coach why I can't play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny eavesdropping a little asked cluelessly, \"Why can't you play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between bites, David spoke up, \"Because he's too small. He'd get crushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table kind of took a moment to think about Fang's dilemma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said Tyler thinking a bit, \"Couldn't you switch to another position? You're still plenty strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This late into the season? They wouldn't allow that. I'll probably get benched for the rest of the season,\" Fang sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing and putting the turkey leg down, David said with optimism, \"That's not a bad idea bro. I mean you'd have to prove it to coach, but you could probably be a wide receiver or even a Quarterback. Those guys don't got to be so big, they need to be fast though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if it wasn't for your tail, I could have run circles around you,\" Fang said lightheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, can't see why we can't give it a try,\" looking at the large grandfather clock in the corner, \"We got about another hour or so till football practice, neither of them had classes on Sunday. \"What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He who trying desperately to save him while risking everything for him in the process. Even though Fang wanted to hang on still, Tyler knew what was at stake. \"Take care of Jenny for me...\" Tyler released his grip as these word's filled his mind as he fell: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\u201cIt hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it\u2019s so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn\u2019t come back. You\u2019re left so alone that you can\u2019t explain. Damn, there\u2019s nothing like that, is there? I\u2019ve been there and you have too. You\u2019re nodding your head.\u201d \u2014 Henry Rollins</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shouting for him, \"Tyler!!!\" But it was no use, with what seemed like minutes for him to fall, in reality seconds. His eyes started watering as he couldn't look at the fading image of Tyler falling. He was charged with the task to destroy the accursed amulet that started this whole mess. But why couldn't he have saved Tyler too. With a renewed fervor to finish this once and for all, he started to climb again. Hopefully the faster he did it the sooner he'd see Tyler again. Though somewhere in the back of his mind he didn't know that for sure, but he had to at least try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why did he feel like he failed... Other people shouldn't have paid for his mistakes... Not like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside of the void, Jenny had awakened to see she was being carried off to what seemed the the unknown. She'd never seen the town she lived in from such an angle or height that it was seemingly surreal. But she did see though a flying tiger girl. She is in a monsters claw, a girl is flying, this must be some whacked out dream. That is until she felt the slime around her, that felt all too real and she remembered what was going on. Tyler became a monster because of her. She didn't know how, but it felt like one of her supernaturals comics that was styled in anime. A secret magical world as the main character, hunky tanned dragon was a detective for strange cases. That sort of thing... Hopefully someone could save her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena saying to Jenny as best she could to soothe her, she was always softspoken, \"Girl I need you to remain calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't much else I can do,\" she sighed with one of her hands supporting her head give her that 'look'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you are falling please remain calm and I will catch you and bring you to safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... WHAT!\" Jenny said shockingly as Leena preformed a few hand motions and her one arm was glowing a cyan-like green color. In a slapping motion, the energy detached from her arm, slicing and cutting the blobs' appendages that were holding her. Falling through the air, she could she the giant blob flying though with a slow reaction noticed she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeena, in a skydiving pose to reach Jenny first, the blob watched at the young tiger girl swooped her up and sat her down in the street.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler could feel that strange tingling sensation seem to seep from every inch of his body and then surge downwards towards his groin, his eyes still held firmly closed as he basked in the bliss of what had to be one of his strongest orgasm's yet. But despite that, when that tingle hit his groin it turned rock hard again, and his fingers didn't irritated it in what would normally be an overly-sensitive state after orgasm. Instead, if anything, he felt even hornier. Thoughts of being big, huge, massive floated through his mind as his paws continued stroking up and down his impressively sized shaft, body arching upwards and eyes still slid closed as he let the various mental images flood through his head. His second orgasm came quickly, further splattering his bed and himself with his own juices, and again that heated sensation flooded through his groin and made him feel just as horny as before. a minute later his third orgasm hit and he further plastered his body in his own slick juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until about then that Tyler started to notice something was wrong. His underwear, still around his mid thighs hadn't shredded off, his feet weren't hanging off the bed... he wasn't sinking any more into the mattress than he usually did. He wasn't any bigger. Still his same, normal diminutive barely 5 foot height. He couldn't help but groan out in disappointment and confusion. He had felt something from the necklace! It had to be doing more than just making him able to consecutively get off, he'd seen what it had done to David!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thought, worrying and irritating at the same time floated through Tyler's head as he jumped up to his feet, underwear dismissively falling down to the floor below, and as quietly as he could he ran stark naked over to David's door, and slowly pushed it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately wish he hadn't, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe first thing that hit him was the smell of sex. Raw, masculine, overpoweringly intense sex. Tyler hadn't been the only one having fun with himself, though David was still sound asleep and obviously having wet dreams. The thing that made Tyler wish he hadn't opened the door, was the sight of his brother laying on the broken remains of his bed, his head shoved up against one wall while his footpaws pressed against the other wall, literal feet of massive, throbbing ebony colored erection jutting up into the air above David's waistline. It dawned on Tyler what had happened then. Each time Tyler had gotten off, the necklace had activated... but it hadn't made him, the wearer grow bigger... it had made David bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had been big before, one of the biggest guys in school, but now he was just monstrous. He could easily toss someone like Fang around like a rag doll and laugh about it. His body rippled with thick, corded and powerful muscle rivaling the beefy powerhouse of a wolf, but what really took the case was the sheer size of him. Head and feet pushing against opposite walls, Davids legs were still bent, he was taller than the room was wide! The first time the amulet had activated it had added almost a foot of height to the already impressive blue dragon... that plus his previous 'release' when Tyler had tried to steal the necklace, and Tyler's three own... as well as at least one other one from a wet dream the growth had obviously induced, had to have left David somewhere between 13 and 14 foot tall... He was almost 3 times taller than Tyler was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooo...! this wasn't supposed to happen\u201d Tyler groaned out in disappointment, staring over at the behemothian blue dragon that was his brother. He didnt look long, however, as he heard a low rumbling growl resonating from the giant, as Davids body began to shift atop the remains of his bed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler watched his brother fidget in his sleep, the thick 14 foot drake writhing aimlessly. The remnants of the mattress and wooden bedframe buckled noisily under his torso. Lose dislodged springs sang in a muffled random melody as they were compressed and twisted in unintended angles beneath the overwhelming force. The wooden frame crunched loudly as it splintered into thousands of new pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed as he realised that the bed was engulfed entirely by the blue drake\u2019s torso and ass. His brother\u2019s heavy head crept up the wall while his feet and tail snaked across the four into the far wall. But only his torso was above the bed. It was longer than he was tall! And the big black cock that twitched and swayed above the pelvis it sprouted on would have been as big as Tyler\u2019s own torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake was shaking. From anger, jealousy and fear. Tyler felt hopeless. It didn\u2019t work for him. It never did. In fact, he had only made it worse. This was all his own making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snorted as a wicked grin split his face. He clenched and unclenched his fingers and spread his toes over the far walls. His cock spasmed as it spat out a spurt of pre. Tyler mindlessly watched the spurt of liquid arc it\u2019s long decent onto the meaty blue slabs of David\u2019s chest, the drops splashing loudly like water slapping against concrete. The blue dragon laughed feverishly as his restless body writhed again. Judging from the drake\u2019s movements, his dreams were obviously quite vivid indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt his own manhood throb in front of him. His erection had simply not subsided since he had stopped attending to it just minutes ago. \u201cFuck off!\u201d Tyler hissed at his own cock. It seemed almost treacherous. It begged for his attention, ready and rearing for some love, yearning to make his brother even bigger. No. He wouldn\u2019t touch himself again until this was over. At least, that\u2019s what he told himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid moaned and then whined loudly behind him. Tyler spun around wide-eyed, being torn from his own tangent. David was breathing heavily and unevenly through his mouth. His powerful hands scraped against the floorboards, trying to grasp at supports that weren\u2019t there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock wildly twitched and swung in randomly, being propelled by a mixture of restless motions. Pre was flowing liberally down its long thick shaft in an almost constant stream, his cock glistened in the low light as the fluid made its way down like a weak waterfall, pooling at the drake\u2019s bulging abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scowled darkly and turned to leave as his brother started weakly thrusting his pelvis to no set rhythm, moaning through his breaths as he did so. David was making an even greater show of this than he did the last time, and Tyler had no desire to see another finale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the purple drake hesitated at the doorway. His brother whined and yelped behind him, the sudden thuds on the floor below him letting him know that the thrusts were starting to land with more purpose. Tyler sighed. What was he going to do? Read a book? Tyler reluctantly turned around. This was like a train crash. It was impossible to look away.<br>\r\nDavid snarled ferociously as he thrust his cock angrily into nothing. His rod was thrown in all directions as it flung spurt after spurt of pre wildly across the room. A deep guttural rumble welled up inside the drake\u2019s chest as his fingers pierced deep into the wooden floorboards. His enormous blue feet scraped up and down the far wall as he tried to stretch them into a space that wasn\u2019t there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his balls clenched and every thick powerful muscle on his frame flexed. He roared as he came, an angry, savage roar that shook the room and caused Tyler to flinch. It was loud and deep, sounding more like a nearby rumble of a jet engine than his brother. David\u2019s eyes were clenched closed as his scowling brow bore down on them, his savage teeth completely naked as they lashed out into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock switched from spurting clear pre into spraying the real stuff through a single, heaving spasm. The enormous cock ejected the seed forcefully in an unbroken, thick rope. His unanchored cock flung wildly as it came, sending the stream loudly into the back wall, onto the roof, onto the front wall and the Drake\u2019s face, and then back up facing the side wall where Tyler was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake duck instantly as he saw the stream start to head in his direction. Luckily the stream ended abruptly, and Tyler was left looing down the barrel of David\u2019s empty cock as it flung past him. Tyler barely had time to register the sounds of cum raining down from the roof and walls around him before David released a second burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floorboards cracked under his fingers and his feet dug a hole through the plaster as he roared again, arching his back and lifting his pelvis clear off the floor. He held the pose as his cock sprayed his head and the wall behind it. It crashed into him at such a high velocity and volume that the loud splats almost sounded like a deafening crackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s face contorted into a wide grimace as he clenched his teeth in anticipation for the third load. He moaned a forced exhale as he came onto the wall behind him again in a long, steady stream. His pelvis hit the floor with a sharp thud, the entire first floor shaking with the hard heavy impact. David grunted weakly as his cock spat a much smaller, fourth spurt across the room. His massive slick ebony rod twitched dangerously after that, but he had nothing left to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s hear skipped a beat as his brother\u2019s eyes opened, staring proudly at his cock. Long wide sticky ropes spilled from its head in all directions, visible threads connecting the cock to the various messes it had left across the room and the large blue dragon that largely occupied it. The large cock seemed somewhat spent, already looking deflated compared to what it was in its orgasmic throws. It looked merely puffy, rather than fully engorged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler calmed down as he studied his brother\u2019s eyes. They were open, but they had no alertness or purpose to them. They were glazed and his gaze was distant. He was still asleep. He stood perfectly still until David closed them again, sighing contently as he breathed in deep, catching his breath from the excitement, rather than exhaustion of his rather effortless orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, he let out a delighted murmur. A flirtatious grin replaced his contented calm in an instant. He scoffed as he shifted his body weight, his cock visibly springing back to full attention as it twitched needily. And then he started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s heart sank further as he heard the cracks and pops of his brother\u2019s lengthening bone and cartilage. David grunted approvingly, his muscles twitching randomly as they stretched down his expanding frame. The drake was anchored at his pelvis. His knees slowly rose as the nearby wall seemed to close in on him. His head crept up the other wall as his expanding chest drove him into it, riding his neck up at a sharper and sharper angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis widening frame pressed against the wall to his side, slowly beginning to tip his torso as he ran out of lateral space. With a series of loud cracks, his enlarging angles finally pressed through the far wall and into the next room, the movement causing his knees to drop sharply, before slowly ascending again as his ankles found new purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still he grew. He shredded the floorboards with his powerful claws as his hands expanded. Great sheets of muscle layered up all over his expanding body, stretching his thickening taught blue scales. Tyler could see the long protruding blood vessel on his brother\u2019s bicep grow and spread as the muscle swelled. With an audible thump and continual cracks, the blue drake\u2019s shoulder ran into the wall and pressed into it, they themselves slightly beginning to ride up the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while his cock stretched higher, sprouting from his anchored pelvis like a thick weed. The base of his cock swelled wider, forming a slight taper as his length made its way to its head. More meat slowly pressed out of his shaft, new veins creeping up the length as they swelled and thickened. The cock\u2019s head inched higher at a much faster rate than his base, the entire shaft inflating with more meat. The whole time it twitched and swayed, spilling pre in time with the drakes heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth finally stopped just as Tyler was beginning to panic that it might not. His brother had just grown by much more than a foot. Tyler didn\u2019t know if his brother\u2019s growth was simply compounding, or if his own orgasms had somehow accelerated David\u2019s own reactions. But that was an exponential spurt. He must have been at least fifteen feet long now if he could spread himself flat. At least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst thing of all was that his brother was already getting restless again. He shifted aimlessly as he whined and moaned, his long, thick cock washed itself clean of the sticky cum as it leaked a renewed flow of pre as it twitched and swayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swore angrily as own stubborn erection, still standing at full attention. Tyler scowled at the situation. Should he wake David up? What would David do if he woke up? Could Tyler trust his brother to keep his hands off his cock? Or would David get carried away like he always seemed to do, and work his cock ten times harder than his dreams? On the other hand, he might be able to make immediate contact with the store owner to get this fixed. He could look up his home phone number and ring the rest of the fucking night if that\u2019s what it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Judging from David\u2019s not too subtle moaning and air humping, getting bigger seemed to be his goal. Waking him up to find that it wasn\u2019t just a dream and granting him his wildest desire was just too dangerous. Tyler sighed disarmed at the situation that just kept getting worse, his brother had already started gyrating his hips again, on the remains of his bed with squelching sounds coming from the thoroughly soaked everything in the room, making his monumental cock spurt and sway lazily following his movements. Tyler didn\u2019t know what to do, but he had better do it quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned back into his own room to find a phone, if anyone had any more answers to how this pendant worked \u2013 it would have to be the crazy fox he got it from! His room was situated right next to his brother\u2019s and had received a good bit of residual pounding from the oversized dragon too. The outline of two massive feet were carved into the wallpaper and everything along that wall had been strewn across the floor. Tyler thought that his biggest defeat was looking upon his brother\u2019s ever expanding dick that seemed to grow out of proportion to everything else, but now that he traced a paw down the outline of a giant toe in his wall, the scale of what his sibling was becoming seemed to dawn upon him all over again. He had better find a cure to this problem or get used to this feeling \u2013 and he doubted he could really do the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moan shook the house, a good amount of that voice now rested well below the hearable frequency and instead made the books dance and his keyboard clatter along his desk. The moan was followed by a stomp against the wall and a splatter of fluid somewhere else making Tyler break from his trance\u2026 \u201cThe phone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not want to stay in his room when that already slanting wall lost its hold and sent the oversized paws through, so grabbing his hand-me-down phone and the receipt for the pendant he trudged back out to the small hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed was that the air seemed to get exponentially more seeped in the smell of sex and jizz the closer he got to the adjoining room. The thick musk was intoxicating in a way. His own cock, which still stood defiantly at attention, strained against his underwear, dribbling more precum into the soggy fabric of his underwear. Ever since trying on that pendant his body had been screaming for attention much like David\u2019s seemed to be. If only it had worked on him in the same way this might not seem so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing he noticed was the cascading waterfall, or \u201cpre\u201d-fall, that rolled in a steady stream out of David\u2019s room and down the stairs. The entire room was filled with over an inch of seed and sweat; and everything his virile brother now produced just added to the further spreading water damage and filling of the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked over the small receipt from the store in his hand, a hastily scribbled note with little credibility. Normally it would have seemed quaint now it just seemed frustrating. \u201cGood plan Tyler, of course there\u2019s no number to call..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid moaned again while mumbling something under his breath, his large hand palming his even larger balls, gently massaging them and making them slosh back and forth on top of his thighs, like two overfull water balloons. His cock would jump and lurch as if teased by unseen hands and splat a lazy stream of precum up at his chin and over his broad chest. The angrily boned cock seemed ready to grow the already towering dragon at any time and David\u2019s now curiously roaming paws wasn\u2019t making Tyler any happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked back at the note in his hand. It was a blank paper, obviously designed to look old and mysterious, with the hastily scribbled words: <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u201cWishing necklace \u2013 9.95<br>\r\n \u2018When gifted, unlocks your true potential.\u2019\u201d</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018When gifted\u2019 \u2013 Tyler repeated the words in his head and then it hit him. Why the pendant hadn\u2019t worked the way it was supposed to! He would have to get David to willingly give him the pendant to grow! His heart dropped. That plan would mean waking his brother up and hoping that he'd willingly give his powers to Tyler. What were the odds of that..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the house started to shake and the trickle of the waterfall down the stairs flowed faster. Tylers eyes stared in shock at the behemoth that was his brother as every muscle clenched and bundled up hugely on his massive form. His breath was short and sharp and his cock looked positively obscene as it reached all the way up to poke him in his cheek. Then something happened that Tyler did not anticipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed to move in slow motion, like a National Geo-\u201cway too\u201d-graphic show, when David slowly lowered his muzzle towards the sputtering tip of his cock. His eyes were still firmly shut, if not from his dreaming then certainly from the drying cum that covered them and every other available inch of his body. Still his muzzle was dedicated to its goal, glorious auto-fellatio. His lips wrapped around the tip or the huge head, almost making out with his own cock. Tyler knew he should look away \u2013 he should be devastated. But he was oddly fascinated by the lewd display, fascinated and a little jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grunted as a shot of thick salty pre filled his muzzle and he wasted no time to gulp it up, murring deeply before opening up and diving straight back into his make out session. If he cums now, there is no way that the torrent of spooge won\u2019t wake him up. But what could Tyler do about it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler forced himself to move, even as his eyes refused to leave the scene in front of him. Next to that giant, he's helpless. He was always small, but compared to the mass of his brother... He could be careless before, but now, David could throw him aside with one hand. And it would only get worse if David woke and decided to turn all of his attention to his growth. To the way he slowly slurped at his cock, to how his head pushed against the wall, to the mass he gained as he scrunched up in the increasingly-cramped room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had to do something, <i>anything</i>. Even if he could just push David's head away from his cock, it'd help. But David already filled up much of the room, and the fluid flowing across the floor didn't make it any easier to move. And even if he got close, what could he do? By now, he's not even sure if he's strong enough to move his brother's mammoth cock... That alone looked like it could be as tall and as thick as Tyler was! His mind churned through everything he could imagine as he plodded through the growing swamp, discarding one bad idea after another. He was getting closer, but Tyler didn't know exactly what he'd do when he got in reach of his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's purple scales stumble forward with a splash. He's not sure what he stumbled on, but at least he's caught himself against the ground. He pushes himself back onto his feet, but coated his hands in David's pungent mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes him reel and spit out. He tried to shake some off, but the stuff clings and drips along his arms. He wipes it off on his shirt, but his fingers stop when they reach the amulet still on his neck. He yanked the chain off, swinging it down in frustration. It whips through the air before the amulet smacked him on the upswing, leaving a stinging pain where it hits. Tyler shouted out in pain as he glared at the thing. \"This thing,\" He mutters through gritted teeth. His shaking hand clenches around it. There had to be <i>something</i> he could do with the thing, if he could just figure out what. If only he hadn't given it to David... If only he could get David to give it to him...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at his hand, now clenching the pendant tightly enough to leave marks on his palm. Would his brother let him use the pendant? David said he would let him use it, right? If he had his chance then... Could he just refuse to return it after? That could work, right? That could let him catch up... Even outgrow his massive brother, let him see how it felt to be the small one. He'd just need to make sure David gave him the pendant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if his brother knew he had tried to steal the pendant... Tyler shivered at the thought of having a giant dragon upset at him. At the best of times, David could be a little rough. The dragon didn't try to intentionally hurt his smaller brother, but he could be careless at times. But if David found out what Tyler had done, there was no way the massive lizard would let him use the pendant. At best, Tyler could kiss any chance of growing goodbye. At worst, David might accidentally send him through a wall. No, he needed to make sure that he returned the pendant back to its place on David's neck. His brother was bigger than anybody else in the world, so he would... He had to be willing to let-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rumble jerked him back to reality. He must've been lost in thought for a minute or two, and his brother hadn't stopped during that time. Both of the massive dragon's blue arms are reaching forwards, his biceps raised up as his hands grasp at different parts of his cock. His mouth and tongue slid around, working across the head and trying to press to the source of the fountain of seed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Tyler cursed as his underwear gains a wet spot. Tyler's own cock refused to relent, and was now beginning to leak pre. He takes a deep breath to calm himself, but the musky air makes things worse. It's impossible not to think of sex with the scent in the air, and with the overwhelmingly sexual dragon in front of him working on himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his attention away from his libido, and back towards the dragon towering over the scene. It might've been a gamble, but he couldn't think of a better plan. He isn't able to think of a way to stop his brother from his constant masturbation, but he could still try to take advantage of the pendant. He clutched the trinket's chain, hoping that it would still fit around the dragon's neck. And when his brother moans out, his legs begin to move again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room would only take a few steps to traverse, but for Tyler, the distance might as well have been across a stadium. It's an effort to wade through the growing mess. The stench of sex made his footsteps unsteady. His brother, even unconscious, was making things more and more of a struggle. The strengthening stream of pre continued to flow into his brothers maw and out the corners of his shifting maw, before it slips down onto his thick neck, down onto the top of his bulging, pumped pec and down onto the ground, adding to the mire on the ground. And with each step Tyler takes, the flow increases, his brother's efforts growing more and more concentrated with the dragon's errant licks turning into devoted suckles at his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Tyler's standing right next to his brother's head. He unfastens the chain and reaches forward, grateful for the fact that at least he could still reach David's neck. Even with the dragon's massive size and hunched posture, his head was still accessible to Tyler. But with David's massive cock inches away, the scent's ever-present and it's difficult to avoid bumping into something. As David sealed his mouth to the tip of his cock, Tyler tried to finish the task. The amulet dropped back against David's chest, re-attached and back on his neck. Tyler let out a sigh of relief as he pulls his hands away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore everything around him started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny dragon cursed under his breath, but those sounds were overwhelmed by David's body. The massive dragon's arms clenched at the length of his shaft while it struggled in his mouth. Tyler's vision wasn't steady enough to see, but David's constant, muffled moans told him everything he needed to know. Each spurt of cum made the massive dragon's body lurch, his head cracking the wall as each shot makes the blue mass jerk his head back. And after each shot, David's head forced itself forwards again, his mouth reapplying itself onto the gargantuan tool. Cum flies everywhere, much of it going into David's mouth and so much more splattering around, covering the wall, the remains of the bed, David's body, and Tyler... Each shot is as intense as the last, and David's body heaves with each one. Tyler grasps at the wall after the first, steadying himself with it as the building shakes. But the wall doesn't give enough support, and one of the giant's errant twitches slams an arm against Tyler's legs, tripping him and sending him tumbling forward.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler stood a moment as he absorbed the sight of his brother felating himself. Davids body stretched 14 feet across the wet floor, a span too long to properly fit into. his head and feet wedged up the two straining walls on wither side, forcing the perfect angle for him to suckle his own manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's enormous body was stacked with rock hard muscles that formed perfect definition under his drenched cobalt scales. They flexed and relaxed intermitantly as the drake twitched in pleasure; the picture of an immense and perfect machine that was everything Tyler was not. And would never be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drakes fists curled as be watched his brother subconsciously lick his enormous black cock with increasing hunger, his deep breaths and gutteral rumbles shook the room around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if David didn't already have everything. As if Tyler hadn't missed out enough. The thought caused the purple drake to see red as he started to snarl. \"That's ENOUGH!\" He roared as loudly as his feeble voice allowed, and charged at the head of his brothers cock, trying to dislodge it from Davids oversized maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavids cock was easily the height of Tyler, and far thicker. Tylers hands slapped up against the pillar of steely flesh with a wet crack, but save for a shudder, it didn't budge an inch. His body followed through, causing him to bounce off and stumble backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid welcomed the impact, gunting in pleasure as his cock twitched in response, unloading another flow of fresh pre into his maw. The deep powerful tones of his brothers voice vibrated through Tyler's body as if he was a sheet of crate paper. As jarring as it felt, the powerful oscillation caused his own throbbing manhood to jolt in pleasure as it dumped its own, much more modest load of pre in his underware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler paused a moment, part in awe and part in response to the pleasure. His anger quickly rose back to the surface however, and with a snarl, pushed back up against Davids cock, determined to disarm it from growing his brother any bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake hissed through barred teeth as he mustered all his strength to push the several hundred kilograms of suspended manhood. In response the dark cock twitched and bobbed, veins as thick as Tylers arms flaring up its length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slowly inched further to the side, until successfully dislodging from the cobalt drakes lips with a loud smacking sound. A sustained cracking noise soon followed as a thick and constant stream of pre flowed from the monstrous tip, crashing onto the cobalts rock hard chest a metre below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was able to move the cock against the far wall with much less resistance, allowing him to put a leg over his brothers neck, leaning over the cobalt drakes oversized head. The length from the back of his scull to the tip of his muzzle was about the same thength as Tyler's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down on David as he slept reslessly, his smiling lips curled in ecstacy and his brow furrowed in need. Tyler snarled at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" He shouted with a shrill voice that was equal parts blind fury and panic. He beat down on his brothers slick muzzle with both fists, no longer caring if David woke up or not. \"Fucking stop i...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's voice cut off with a surprised yelp as Davids enormous cock swung back into his flank, the heavy tool grazing forcefully down his lumbar and pushing him forward over Davids head. Tyler grabbed his brothers brow for balance as the heavy cock wedged into his back, sandwiching his torso between it and Davids muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake moaned deeply at the sensation of his cock being so forcefully rubbed, and Tyler felt a surge of pre pumped onto his back, spilling over him and drenching his purple scales in an instant as the cock slid over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyes rolled briefly back as his bothers voice again rolled through him, causing his cock to vibrate powerfully in his now drenched underware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drakes own manhood didn't remain in its confines for much longer, however, as Davids cock pulled the underware down as it came to rest on the small of Tyler's back, his 8 inch erection popping free and slapping the blue drake in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gasped as he felt this happen, but was left without enough time to stop it sliding into Davids open mouth. He cried out in a confused moan as he lay trapped, bent over his brothers muzzle as a stream of thick warm pre flowed down over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid whined as he stirred restlessly, his nostrils flaring as they sent a powerful jet of hot air crashing into Tyler's abdomin. He dry swallowed as his need intensified, the action causing his heavy moist tongue to graze across Tyler's cock as it penetrated into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake moaned helplessly as he felt Davids mouth become a vaccuum, pulling his manhood deep inside, overwhelming him with a tight warm environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexual pleasure caused the small purple drake to flinch violently, which caused the lubricated cock above him to graze up his body, which caused David to moan, which caused Tyler's cock to vibrate wildly, which caused him to writhe in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's tongue lolled from his panting maw as his heart pounded violently in his chest. Underneath his buried cock, he felt his balls churn heavily, getting ready to blow a massive load. \"No...\" He moaned half heartedly as he felt the pleasure build deep inside his glans. He had to pull out. As badly as he suddenly wanted to cum, he just hand to pull out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shifted restlessly below him again as the enormous drake grunted, his tongue idly flicking up to wet his lips. Tyler felt the rough but slick organ trace forcefully up the bottom of his cock and down over his balls before retreating again down the same path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gah!' Tyler cried as he felt himself hurled to the cusp of an orgasm. With weak hands he tried to pull himself up against the weight of Davids cock above him. He managed to rise a few inches before collapsing back down, the movement causing both he and David to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bucked again, trying at first to leverage himself free of the drakes mouth, but his motives for doing so quickly shifted as he felt himself cross the point of no return. Tylers slick purple ass bucked hard and fast as he felt himself begin to cum, his will to resist broken by the surging primal instincts that had awoken within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pumped his manhood deep into Davids mouth, the blue drakes giant cock slid up and down Tyler's back. As Tyler's face contorted in feral intensity, above him Davids pre turned a cloudy white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler came harder than he had before in his life, the throws of his orgasm so strong he could do nothing but whine with a feeble intensity behind barred teeth. He convulsed again and again as he wildly released his seed deep within Davids maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen abruptly Tyler felt an explosion behind him. He saw a flash of white, before everything faded. Every sense Tyler had seemed dull. He had no bearings on where he was or what was happening. All he could feel like as that he was enveloped in warmth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself splutter, coughing reflexivly as he gasped for air that didn't exist. As sluggish as his mind was, he still felt the terror and desperation of a man drowning. He opened his eyes but caught only a blurry sliver of light before an intense stinging sensation forced him to close them tight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe writhed around on the wet floor, trying desperately to find balance.<br>\r\nCum. It was Davids cum, he realised. It covered him, filled his lungs. And gallons more was crashing down on him. Forcing him down onto the flooded floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lifted his head against the stream and snorted, sending ropes of seed flying from his nostrils as he finally found air. He shakily forced himself onto his feet as he half dived, half stumbled away from the torrent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fit of violent desperate coughing, Tyler cleared his eyes of handfuls of Davids seed before he could finally open them and witness what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he saw was one of Davids feet rise and crash down silently onto the floor in a fit of passion, causing the whole room to shake. It took him a moment to realise that his brother was roaring; the low powerful bellows completely overwhelming his senses and seemingly causing the whole world to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCum rained down from everywhere; the roof, the walls, the furniture. Streams of it flowed off the giant blue drakes body in a thick violent cascade, flooding the floor and causing a wave if it to rise and flow out through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still David came; his enormous black cock spraying thick powerful jets as it flailed wildly, the recoil seeming to give it a life of its own as it shot thick powerful waves of seeds into the wall and cieling, shearing thick holes into the plaster wherever it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTylers shoulders sagged at the sight. His back stung and his body ached. He was literally beaten by his brothers sexual potency. And as David continued to cum in truly godly proportions, he knew that he was utterly defeated. His brother had ascended, and he was left behind. With nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with bitter resignation that Tyler slowly made his way out of the room. Behind him, David quietened down, and his cock twitched dryly, finally empty of its unnatural load. The purple drake vainley wiped the excess cum off his body, his own manhood grown soft from the ordeal. At least he had gotten his rocks off, if nothing else, he thought bitterly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no sooner had that though crossed his mind, when he felt a fire light within his loins. With a sharp gasp, he felt his heart pound as his balls shifted in their sack. A rush of blood flowed into his cock, filling him with renewed need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his brother shift and rumble in anticipation behind him, and he knew that David suddenly felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned slowly to face his brother again, just as the growth of both of their orgasms began to hit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun was warm and the air was still. David stared at the wispy clouds as they passed slowly overhead; the lush grass beneath his back felt like a soft mattress. His body was still as he breathed in the crisp, fresh air. He felt good. Really good. It felt like the height of spring time; an overwhelming fuzzy feeling of content enveloped him as he basked in the feeling of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a soft rustling noise in the grass to his left. David tried to turn to face it, but his body simply didn\u2019t respond. He put up a token fight, trying to move his paralysed muscles, but the effort seemed far too great. He closed his eyes and dismissed the disturbance. It was easier to just bask in the perfect day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a giggle from somewhere above. It made him smile as it slowly opened his eyes. His heart skipped a beat as he saw a beautiful young female deer smiling down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe was\u2026 perfect. Though David\u2019s enormous frame dwarfed her, it was clear that she was relatively tall, without being lanky. Her form curved soft and deep from her torso down through her hips and thighs. But she didn\u2019t have any visible areas of fat. She was fit and toned, but her muscle definition stayed firmly feminine. Perky nipples sat high upon her two breasts, the mounds of flesh full, but not abnormally large. Her fur looked perfectly clean and fluffy, her pelt mostly light brown, with a patch of white that ran from her breasts down to the insides of her thighs, through the underside of the short, soft tail that sprouted from her full ass. Her hips were wide, her flat abdomen bowing into a pair of tight, welcoming virgin lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while the doe\u2019s body got David\u2019s heart racing, it was her face that took his breath away. Her complexion was perfect, her fur short and thick. David didn\u2019t often use the word cute, but there was no other way to describe the nose that sat on the end of her short snout. Two fairly large round ears flickered in the still air above her head, while her lips stretched into the warmest, most genuine smile David had ever seen. But it was the doe\u2019s eyes that imprisoned his gaze. They were full, and shone a brilliant electric purple. It was a colour eerily unnatural, and yet they sparkled like gems, and nothing else could have substituted to complete her perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid fought to numbly move his jaw before he was finally able to speak. \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\nThe doe\u2019s smile widened.  It made David feel warm. \u201cI am Gaia.\u201d Her voice was soft but strong<br>\r\nGaia? The name was vaguely familiar to David. He quickly searched through his memories for clues. He had never seen the doe in his life, so it couldn\u2019t have been someone he used to know. Yet it was a name which held and unknown significance. \u201cAre you famous?\u201d he asked in hope.<br>\r\nThe deer threw her head back and laughed heartily, as if David had told the funniest joke she had ever heard. Her full breasts jiggled to the throes of her laughter, stealing David\u2019s gaze. \u201cOh David, obviously not famous enough for you to recognise my name.\u201d She smiled as she watched David eye her body. David could feel his cock rising without restraint as he lusted over her perfect body. Gaia crouched down over his laying form, making no effort to conceal anything. \u201cPerhaps you would recognise my more colloquial title. Mother Earth.\u201d<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as his gaze returned to the doe\u2019s brilliant purple eyes. \u201cMother Earth?\u201d he repeated dumbly.<br>\r\nGaia smiled proudly as she nodded. \u201cI am the creator of all life. I gave the Earth spirit, setting it apart from all the other planets.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a god?!\u201d David asked in awe.<br>\r\nThe deer chuckled, and traced a finder along his massive cobalt chest. \u201ckinda.\u201d She teased.<br>\r\nDavid breathed unevenly at her touch. Damn, it felt good. \u201cDid you make the stars and planets?\u201d<br>\r\nThe doe cocked her head, sighing into a loving smile as she ran a tender hand softly over the blue drake\u2019s head. David gasped at the touch. It was so soft, so warm. He wanted to touch her soft body, but he was unable to move anything below his neck as he lay paralysed on the soft grass. <br>\r\n\u201cOh David\u2026\u201d Gaia began as she stared deep into his eyes. \u201cWould you think less of me if I didn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\nDavid swallowed as he eyed the deer\u2019s breasts as they swung just inches away from his face. He shook his head.<br>\r\nThe deer\u2019s expression turned serious. She bent down to whisper into the drake\u2019s ear. \u201cYou like my body don\u2019t you David?\u201d She panted he breaths loudly. \u201cYou want to mate with me, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\nThe deer laughed delightedly, shifting her position so that she had one hand planted on either side of his torso as she lent in over his shoulder. Her breasts compressed against his inflated pectorals. \u201cGood!\u201d she cried approvingly. \u201cYou are healthy, young and strong. You are faithful in your duties. It is how I made you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid whined as he stared at her breasts press flat onto his heaving chest. The deer felt so good on his scales. He wanted to grasp her, he wanted to ravage her. But his body remained still. He breathed hard and heavy, lusting for her. \u201cYou made me?\u201d he asked between breaths.<br>\r\n\u201cI made all life.\u201d Gaia explained. \u201cI designed it all. I created the sexes. I gave each their own role, and each the power to fulfil it.\u201d<br>\r\nThe doe slowly leant down and kissed David on the neck. Her wet, warm lips made him gasp. \u201cYou are a man. You are doomed to be barren. I gave you no womb; you will never give the gift of life to another. That is not your role.\u201d David groaned helplessly as the deer licked up the length of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are not powerless.\u201d The deer said into his ear. \u201cA woman owns the womb, but only a man can fill it. She has only one womb to fill. But men have no such restriction. With each orgasm, a man can sire a new litter, or clutch. His destiny is to roam the countryside sewing his seed within everything that moves, filling new wombs with impunity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt his cock throb painfully, but he was unable to do anything about it. Gaia lifted a leg over his abdomen, the display revealing her parting lips as her thighs spread wide. She lay her body down over the blue drake. He felt her soft, fluffy tail reach down his lower abdomen, but his needy cock remained untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia smiled flirtatiously. \u201cOnly the strongest, most deserving of men were meant to fill my daughter\u2019s wombs. That is how I designed it. Lesser men should fall by the wayside, to be starved, or diseased, or beaten by his superior. A woman\u2019s gift to her children that of life, but a man\u2019s gift is his strength. If he has no true strength to give, then he corrupts nature.\u201d<br>\r\nDavid stared at the deer intently. His heart was pounding. He wanted to fuck her. He wanted to start and never stop. He wanted to press down and write with her, to fill her, to grasp and lick her. But he couldn\u2019t move. The doe had all the power. She was teasing him. He was frustration was quickly turning into anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his heart dropped as a great sadness suddenly welled in Gaia\u2019s eye. He couldn\u2019t bear to see such sorrow in the doe\u2019s eyes. It was like the deer had suddenly cast a spell on him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe stared long and deep into David\u2019s eyes. \u201cBecause this is not the way of it, is it? Life has been pure for billions of years, but now, it has all fallen to corruption.\u201d Tears welled into the deer\u2019s eyes. David couldn\u2019t help but weep with her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d David asked in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe scowled as anger flashed in her eyes. \u201cCivilisation.\u201d She spat.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201ccivilization?\u201d Daid repeated dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe nodded. \u201dIt is a cursed institution that corrupts all I designed, all I intended. It allows weak men not only live, but bear children. Monogamy limits the strong to only one womb. You were designed to be promiscuous! Do you see, David? Do you see how civilisation corrupts my children, how it weakens the worthy as it strengthens the weak? Generation after generation suffers. It is detestable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid swallowed. He nodded, but he wasn\u2019t completely on board with what Gaia was saying.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIt should outrage one as strong as yourself.\u201d Gaia said, squaring her jaw. \u201cAfter all, you are one of the strong men. You were meant to spread your seed far and wide your whole life. But instead your rightful destiny has been taken from you. Civilisation dictates that you are merely one amongst billions. Equal to the weakest male.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt a tinge of resentment build within him. He was strong. And he did want to sleep around. The doe was striking a chord. Gaia\u2019s mood lightened as she smiled lovingly into his eyes again. His heart melted. He loved the doe, he realised. He didn\u2019t just want to fuck her senseless. She made him feel content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia looked at the amulet on David\u2019s chest. \u201cI have spent a thousand years in that amulet, waiting for one strong enough to award my gift. And David you are the one I have been waiting for.\u201d She rubbed the drake\u2019s face with affection. David stared into her eyes timelessly. The doe flashed a flirtatious grin and then kissed him on his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid licked at the doe as she was moving her face away from her kiss. His enormous tongue caught her on the snout, electing a delighted squeal from the doe as she laughed playfully. Her expression turned serious as their eyes locked again. And then they passionately kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in many ways awkward. David\u2019s mouth was big and sharp enough to bite off the doe\u2019s head, and he only had command of his body from his neck up. But as awkward as the logistics were, it was the most impassioned action he had ever experienced.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The deer began grinding her pelvis up David\u2019s hard, washboard abs. The action caused her to moan through her sharp breaths as she embraced the Drake. David could feel her leave a small wet trail as she scaled his clefts and crevices. Gaia fell into a rhythm as she rubbed her clitoris along the drake\u2019s torso, her muscles twitching and shaking as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to be my mate.\u201d Her voice trembled as she bit he drake\u2019s lower lip. \u201cI want you to sire the world.\u201d She stretched her ass further down the drake\u2019s torso than she had before. David cried out as he felt his cock brush against her fluffy tail, the action causing it to spasm and spurt pre onto the doe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia rubbed her hands along the drake\u2019s enormous face as she licked down his neck. \u201cI want you to start everything afresh\u201d. She gasped as she lifted her ass into the air. David felt his cock press against her as it slipped into the crevice of her cheeks. He breathed heavily as his cock wet the doe\u2019s ass. The doe kissed and licked his pectorals as she continued her trembling voice desperate with need. \u201cI want you to destroy civilization. I want you to fill every womb. I want your seed to run free. I want it to fill the rivers and flow into the sea. I want you to fuck it until the oceans themselves turn white!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia shifted her pelvis as she spoke, and David moaned as he felt it slip down her ass crack, resting pressed against the entrance of her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia stared into David\u2019s eyes. A very pregnant pause insured, punctuated only by the sounds of their heavy breathing. \u201cWill you do this David? Will you be my mate?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!\u201d David roared in agony, desperately fighting for command over his own pelvis. He was maddeningly close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer smiled ecstatically. \u201cI knew you were strong, David.\u201d She licked her lips and opened her mouth as she pressed down onto David\u2019s cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake threw his head back and groaned as he felt his cock slowly pierce the walls of doe\u2019s vagina. His thick manhood slowly parted the tight lips, the pressure overwhelming. Gaia cried out as she pressed down harder, arching her back as the wet head slowly filled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid whined as his cock slowly buried itself into the deer. Surely, it would never fit. He was too thick, and too long. He would destroy her. But his cock never stalled as it slipped bit by bit into her warm, moist vice. David cried out as he felt his head pop into her, the doe\u2019s tight vaginal lips closing forcefully behind it. It was the most intense rush he had ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe breathed heavily above him. \u201cWhere\u2019s almost there big guy.\u201d She said between laboured breaths. David almost laughed. Part from the fact the doe was reassuring HIM, and partly because he was just so damned happy. He gasped again as he felt the doe press down his shaft. He bit his lip and almost squealed as he felt his head force her vaginal walls to part in its wake. He felt throbs of pre spurt into the deer, mixing with her own juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia moaned, a mixture of intense pleasure and pain as David filled her inch by inch. The feeling was almost too powerful for the drake to handle as his head dug deeper and deeper. David kept wondering when he would bottom out, but to his amazement, the doe ended up sitting on his abdomen, somehow stuffing his whole length into her comparatively petite frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia paused when he had finished. \u201cWith each release I will make you stronger.\u201d She panted. David could feel her heart beating as her vagina gripped his entire length with unprecedented force. The doe licked her lips as she looked down on David. \u201cI will give you the power to fulfil your role.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cried out in unison as she pulled herself forward, dragging the drake\u2019s cock slowly back down the length of her. Their breaths were deep and sharp as the doe grinded up and down David\u2019s length with painful slowness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake barred his teeth so tightly it almost made his gums bleed. He fought hard with his pelvis. He concentrated, focusing all of his will on getting it to move to his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was elated when he felt a tingle rise up his spine, letting him know that his body was waking. He concentrated harder as the deer slowly worked her body in circles on his cock. He swallowed as he finally broke through his paralysis, managing to elicit a random series of weak thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer gasped in surprise as she felt the cock within her move on its own. Her wide eyes stared into David\u2019s. The blue drake gave a cocky snarl as he felt his hips waken further, giving him more control. He began thrusting with a rhythm and intensity that forced the doe to respond in kind. Gaia bit her bottom lip as she grunted, her eyes closing and her mouth flicking between a smile and a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t know if he had just managed to break through a spell that Gaia had cast on him, or if he had simply finally overcome his own challenge. But he laughed delightedly as his thrusts began to land with purpose, the two bodies slapping on contact, the impact sending ripples up the doe\u2019s body. Her mouth opened as she whined, licking her lips as she pushed back. She stared at David with glazed purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake intensified his actions until he was pounding the doe with reckless abandon. His thrusts were hard and fast, his tremendous shaft glided in and out of Gaia\u2019s tight grip effortlessly. His hips were a blue blur of motion as he pumped ferociously, his large, long balls flung violently, loudly slapping the deer\u2019s ass and his own tail over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia moaned with increasing urgency until the cried out in an overwhelming ecstasy. David felt her vagina spasm around him as she came. He grunted and focused his efforts. It felt unbelievable, but he wanted to make her do it again before he was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t let up as the Doe moaned, slapping his meaty chest. Her breasts jiggled wildly with every pound. She looked to the heavens as she flexed her tongue as her lips twitched. David\u2019s cock was slick with juices, and the smell and sounds of sex hung thick in the still warm air. David emitted a guttural growl with every laboured breath as he somehow found another gear. The doe\u2019s moaning was getting more urgent as he himself began to feel the distant pressure in his own cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snarled as he felt the pressure build, racing beyond the point of no return. The doe pushed back desperately as her cries became hysterical. They both roared, and as one they came. But as David clenched his muscles as he felt his seed erupt, suddenly she was gone. There was no deer on the end of his cock as he came into the night, ejaculating his thick hot seed in every direction. He grabbed his cock with both hands and worked it as he came twice more, his essence raining down freely over his head and torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed heavily once it was over. His balls ached, and his hands were wet and sticky as they nursed his spent cock. His heart sank as it raced, the drake coming to terms with the fact it was all just a dream. It was the most vivid, intense dream he had ever had. He had loved the deer, and now she was gone. He was in his room, in the middle of the night. Alone, covered in his own cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed as he rested his head against his pillow. He was calm in his afterglow, but he still felt almost heartbroken. He pictured the doe\u2019s loving, purple eyes. He felt almost stupid for believing it could have been real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt a renewed surge in his loins. He felt his cock waken under his grip, his heart beat faster as it filled it with blood. His cock\u2019s head felt good under his grip, welcoming the contact and pressure, and pleaded for more. David smiled as he licked his lips. Damn, he was feeling horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth in his groin spread out over his body and intensified. He felt himself start to grow again, the tingling sensation appearing across his scales and deep within his bones. He felt his mass increase as his muscles puffed further out. His feet were already suspended off the foot of his bed, but he watched as his knees slid towards the edge of his mattress. His expanding feet slowly lowered until they touched the floor, the sudden sensation of the cold hardwood causing David to flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his cock growing in his hands. The drake moaned softly as he held his hands as steady as he could. His expanding shaft pushed its length through his stationary fingers, the movement entirely caused by more of his growing cock spilling further out. He felt the shaft thicken in his grip, and he felt new veins creep out over its surface like a weed. He started leaking pre as he began to idly rub his expanding head and shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mattress creaked as it sagged further under his weight. David\u2019s head touched the headrests and then kept pushing into it, compressing his neck onto an awkward angle.  David kinked his head to allow his expansion to creep it vertical rather than horizontal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was working his shaft in earnest as his growth stopped, the slick shaft squelching under his hard and fast strokes. He laughed to himself as he felt the bed shake violently under his movements, the creaking protests of the wooden frame telling a story of torment. He was huge now. Absolutely huge. Gaia appeared to him in a dream, but she didn\u2019t disappear with it. He could feel her power in his loins. \u2018With each release, I will make you stronger.\u2019 Her words played over in his mind. He smiled viciously to himself as he felt the pressure of another orgasm build in his massive wet cock.</span></div></div>",

A frown crossed the bigger blue dragon\u2019s face as he stopped pumping vigorously at his member, his orgasm \u2013 and his growth \u2013 denied. \u201cThat\u2019s... uh, some pretty impressive stuff, there!\u201d The smaller dragon visibly blushed, cringing slightly at the sheer awkwardness of being caught watching his brother mid-stroke. \u201cI\u2019ll just, um, leave you to it, okay?\u201d Tyler gave David\u2019s muscular bicep a friendly pat with a much smaller hand, turning to scamper out of the room. \u201cLat-argh!\u201d A large blue fist wrapped around Tyler\u2019s skinny arm, the large fingers enveloping it completely in an unbreakable grip.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were trying to steal my amulet, weren\u2019t you? I\u2019m disappointed, Tyler.\u201d David spun the smaller drake around, forcing him to look over his massive, muscular frame as he began to sit up, the wood beneath him beginning to scream in protest as he towered over his smaller sibling, even while sitting roughly on the bed. Tyler\u2019s view was nothing but thick, throbbing ebony cock lost amongst a sea of blue muscle, and judging by the purple dragon\u2019s nervous squirming, it was just as impressive as he wanted it to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re weak, Tyler, and I\u2019m strong. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been, and the way it will always be. You thought you could match me and take a shortcut to true strength, true power with the amulet? Sorry, bro, but it wasn\u2019t going to work for you.\u201d As David spoke, Tyler growled, fighting savagely against his leathery blue bonds.<br>\r\n\u201cFuck off, David! You\u2019re such a selfish dick! And you\u2019re wrong, too \u2013 I\u2019m not weak. Maybe I\u2019m short, maybe I\u2019m skinny. I\u2019ll give you that, but think about this \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Tyler, I mean it wouldn\u2019t work at all.\u201d interrupted David, his deep, booming voice cutting off the shrill, snapping tones of the little dragon. \u201cIt chose me because I\u2019m genetically superior, because my body is perfect. There\u2019s a spirit inside the amulet, Tyler, and it wants me to bring everything back to the way it should be. Back to the natural way.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m... uh, hesitant to say you\u2019re crazy, bro.\u201d snarled Tyler. \u201cEspecially since you\u2019ve just grown a couple times my size by cracking a few off... but David, listen to yourself! You sound pretty... well, New Agey.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d replied David. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the perfect male. I have to spread my seed and stop the corrupting influence of society. Marriage, money, medicine \u2013 weak males like you are given the chance to breed where in nature you could not. Strong males like me? We\u2019re limited to one, maybe two partners by civilisation... so I\u2019m going to tear it down, and we\u2019ll start anew \u2013 me and Gaia.\u201d A dreamy glint appeared in his eye as he thought of the doe \u2013 that perfect form imprinted deep in his mind as his rod twitched in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, did you fail biology or something?\u201d snapped Tyler. \u201cDo you have any idea how genes work? Let me list all the stupid things you just said. One \u2013 we\u2019re the same. We\u2019re brothers. You have half my genes, and I have half of yours, which means that theoretically, were I actually able to attract some sort of female-\u201c Tyler lowered his brow in low anger, growling his words \u2013 \u201cMy kids could grow up to be just as big as you. Well, just as big as you pre-crazy. Second \u2013 you can\u2019t go around impregnating <i>everyone</i>. Inbreeding, bro. Genetic deformities \u2013 that\u2019s why hicks in the middle of farm country have webbed toes and learning difficulties, and your big blue master race will end up just the same. Thirdly, and most importantly, I\u2019m not fucking weak. Remember who bought you that fucking amulet? Remember who covered your rent every time you spent too much on shots with Fang and those other losers? Face it, if you\u2019re going to get all Darwinian on me, if it wasn\u2019t for me, you\u2019d be totally unfit to pass on those \u201cperfect\u201d genes. You\u2019d end up in a fucking trailer park somewhere with your cross-eyed manatee wife and a litter of runty drakes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you finished, <i>little</i> brother?\u201d growled David, gripping onto Tyler painfully and watching him wrestle against his immovable arm. \u201cI got something of my own to say.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You ARE fucking weak, and you just proved it. So what if I\u2019m not fucking making a lot of money or paying my own way? What is money, Tyler? How does it make you strong!? It\u2019s a tool of civilisation! Civilisation it makes ME weak to empower YOU. That\u2019s what Gaia told me!

It\u2019s illegal! I\u2019m forced to play by the rules, scrape together a pathetic existence! Fuck it all!\u201d David shoved his brother as he released his grip.

Keep your job and your money!

It\u2019s such a stupid, bullshit attitude, but man\u2026 you\u2019ve really outdone yourself here. You\u2019ve grabbed that little personality flaw taken it to its extreme. Do you even fucking hear what you\u2019re saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do!\u201d David roared at his brother. It was a powerful, booming roar that shook the room and made Tyler take two panicked steps back. David smiled triumphantly. \u201cIt makes perfect sense. I know you don\u2019t like it; it\u2019s something you\u2019ll never be willing to accept. It must suck that you\u2019re so weak, but it\u2019s not my problem.\u201d David shook his head. Why was he even bothering to talk to Tyler? What difference did it make wether he agreed or didn\u2019t? The pathetic little purple drake was irrelevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler recovered from his fearful reaction, and stood defiantly in front of his colossal brother. If anything, his anger had only solidified. \u201cYou\u2019re not better than me.\u201d He said with fiery calm. \u201cYou\u2019re big. But that doesn\u2019t make you special. It doesn\u2019t make you more entitled. It just makes you arrogant, and delusional!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scoffed at himself as much as his brother. What a waste of energy this was. He idly grabbed his erection. His eyes fluttered and the faint traces of a smile appeared on his face. \u201cFuck off Tyler. You aren\u2019t worth the effort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s it, huh?\u201d Tyler demanded as his eyes darted to what his brother was doing. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing else? I notice that you didn\u2019t even try to address anything I said about Biology. Is that because you know that what you\u2019re saying is so fucking stupid?\u201d Tyler\u2019s voice was becoming hysterical. His uncontrolled anger and jealousy made David smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Gaia would know what she\u2019s doing there, wouldn\u2019t she Tyler?\u201d he asked his brother dismissively, turning his attention to his cock as he kneaded it in his hands. It was only a slight movement, but the wooden bedframe creaked and snapped angrily under his immense weight.  \u201cYou can\u2019t see the world through your bullshit science. It\u2019s just another tool of civilisation for me to bring down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit Science?!\u201d Tyler said incredulously, almost gasping. \u201cSCIENCE IS SEEING THE WORLD! It flew us to the moon, David! It gave us medicine. How useful would your perfect genes be if you were laying there with smallpox? But that\u2019s not something you have to worry about, is it David? And do you know why? BIOLOGY! The same science you\u2019re fobbing off now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed and shook his head helplessly, but he never took his attention off his own cock. \u201cOh Tyler. I know you believe what you\u2019re saying. You NEED to believe it. The weak will grab hold of whatever straws they can. That\u2019s what makes them so pathetic. Tell me Tyler, if your genes are the same as mine, then where\u2019s the rest of you? Why aren\u2019t you as string as me? And you think your children will be as strong as mine? That\u2019s a laugh. Does science really say that children don\u2019t inherit stuff off their parents now?\u201d He pulled a hand away from his throbbing manhood, but left the other to snake up and down the shaft. Multiple thick tendrils of fluid strung from the head of his cock to his palm and fingers. David studied them with approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what science says!\u201d Tyler interrupted angrily. \u201cThat\u2019s a strawman, which you\u2019re using because you\u2019re too fucking ignorant to address it properly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid chuckled. He was playing with his brother now, basking in his insecurity. It made him feel all the more empowered. \u201cAnd your little joke about inbreeding. \u201cHe continued with a smirk. \u201cTell me Tyler, does Science say life came from a single source? Wouldn\u2019t that make us all inbred? If I\u2019m the product of inbreeding, then imagine how strong all my children are going to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely different David! You cannot be that stupid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely different David!\u201d The blue drake paraded his brother\u2019s words mockingly as he laughed. \u201cWhat sort of answer is that? You cling to your science with great faith, but it will never give you the wisdom of Gaia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler advanced towards his brother grabbing his brother\u2019s bicep forcefully. David raised and eyebrow. Was he trying to stop him from playing with his dick? If so, then the action was completely symbolic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince when has spiritual wisdom EVER fought science and won?!\u201d Tyler hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned his massive head to face his brother, his expression one of amused incredulity. \u201cAre you serious Tyler?\u201d His weak purple brother held his gaze defiantly for a moment longer, before David used his free hand to gesture grandiosely at his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler followed the hand as it flowed down the giant drake\u2019s body. Tyler was reminded that his brother\u2019s muscles were unimaginably hard and huge, and his stature was simply beyond precedent. Blue feet and a blue tail spilled over the bed and onto the floor, and then continued across the room. But the cobalt drake\u2019s centrepiece was his giant, throbbing erection. It\u2019s hard veiny ebony surface slick with his seed, and eager to release more. \u201cGaia\u2019s explained her theory. What does Biology have to say about me now, Tyler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake simply stared at his brother. He worked his jaw, but no words came out. He snarled loudly in frustration, scowling as he closed his eyes. He held his arms wide in a calming motion as he gathered his thoughts into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk David. Let\u2019s just say that you\u2019re completely right. You saw a real spirit, or a god, or whatever in your dream, and they spoke to you. Let\u2019s say that angels and demons are real, and one of them has chosen you to be their prophet, or whatever.\u201d Tyler leaned in to accentuate his point. \u201cHow do you know that it was really Gaia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared blankly a moment before he stared laughing. \u201cBecause she fucking said she was!\u201d he shook his head helplessly. \u201cShe told me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why should you believe her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured at his body again, this time slightly more aggressively. \u201cBecause look at me, look at the power she\u2019s given me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cSo WHAT David?! This is your problem; it\u2019s ALWAYS been you problem! You\u2019re excited easily and too quick to buy into things! Take a breath and think about it. Once we\u2019ve opened up the possibility that gods are real, than how can you tell the difference between Gaia and a different god who wanted you to THINK they were Gaia? How do you know that it wasn\u2019t really Loki playing a trick on you? What if it\u2019s a demon tarting himself up, convincing you to destroy the world? That makes a hell of a lot more sense than Gaia, considering how evil what you are saying is! Do you think that a goddess of life would want you to DESTROY civilization? Can you IMAGINE the scale of the resulting genocide? That sure sounds more like the ambitions of a minion of darkness to me! David, HOW DO YOU KNOW?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was trying to shake his brother\u2019s neck, as if trying to throttle him. The gesture was lost on the blue drake, whose mass was too great to react to his frantic movements. David stared at his brother a moment, thinking to himself. Then he scoffed, and shook his head solemnly.</span></div></div>",

You have a point.\u201d With an exasperated sigh, David let go of his gargantuan girth, letting it bob freely in front of Tyler\u2019s snout. \u201cI guess all that fantasy roleplaying did you some good, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou just have to listen to yourself, David. Destroy civilization? You sound like a Saturday morning cartoon villain... a really, really X-rated cartoon villain, but one nevertheless. And what about me? You\u2019d really kill me, or at least destroy everything I\u2019ve worked for, just because some spirit told you and helped you get your rocks off? Do I mean so little to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger drake stewed in Tyler\u2019s words for a moment, ignoring the burning need tingling down his monolithic ebony rod. The two shared an awkward look, Tyler craning his neck to see past the obscene blue and black anatomy, David hunched over and peering down on his smaller sibling. The silent moment was broken as David lowered one great arm down to Tyler, seizing him roughly and drawing him close to his massive frame.<br>\r\n\u201cDavid? David! You... urk!\u201d Effortlessly, with supernatural strength, David plucked Tyler from the ground and buried him deep between the valley of his meaty, slab-like pectorals. As Tyler squirmed violently in the bigger drake\u2019s grip, he felt the warmth emanating from the massive blue frame.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, bro.\u201d said David, hugging the smaller drake lightly against his upper body. \u201cYou\u2019re right, we need to think about this. And what\u2019s more, I was being a dick.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNothing changed there, then \u2013 hey!\u201d Tyler chuckled as he realised David wasn\u2019t planning to crush him between massive fists, but his little comment earned him a crushing squeeze.<br>\r\n\u201cBe nice to your bigger brother!\u201d smiled David, as Tyler awkwardly returned the hug as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Tyler... what\u2019s the game plan?\u201d David lifted the purple drake from his frame, plopping him down on what little space remained on the bed.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it, but we definitely have to go back to that antique shop where I got it. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to find something that lets us understand it more.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but what about right now?\u201d replied David, casting a glance over his statuesque musculature \u2013 and more importantly, that achingly needy cock still dripping pre.<br>\r\n\u201cIt sucks, but try not to go crazy with it. We still don\u2019t know how this works beyond the most basic elements \u2013 you don\u2019t want to end up some brainwashed tool. Besides, if you get too big, you\u2019re going to wreck the house \u2013 no, that wasn\u2019t supposed to be a turn-on, get your hands off!\u201d Tyler frowned as a dreamy expression crossed David\u2019s muzzle, a hand idly flitting towards his rod before Tyler roughly shoved at it.\u201dLook, if you have to do it, try to keep it to one or two, max... or, you could give the amulet to me for safe-keeping. I could do some research on it, try to figure out where it\u2019s from before we go to the shop tomorrow.\u201d <br>\r\nDavid considered his options, toying with the amulet between massive claws as he looked down at Tyler...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He picked his brother up of him and placed him onto the floor next to him. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if this makes my cock soft.\u201d He said with a wry smile as he lifted his tree-trunk hands behind his neck to retrieve the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re making me take this back tomorrow\u2026\u201d David begun as he placed the amulet in his brother\u2019s tiny outstretched hands. \u201cThen you still owe me a present.

But ok, it\u2019s a deal. I\u2019ll let you pick out a replacement for yourself. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t turn you into a princess, or some shit.\u201d <br>\r\nDavid chuckled. Tyler gulped nervously as he studied his brother\u2019s frame reverberate from the action. How the hell was the bed stills standing upright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, anyway, I\u2019ll see you in the morning man.\u201d Tyler said as he gathered his composure. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d He nodding towards his brother\u2019s erection as he turned to leave. The enormous log of meat still bobbed above the blue drake as straight as an arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cTyler.\u201d His brother called out to him. The purple drake froze. \u201cDon\u2019t wear it.\u201d His enormous reptilian eyes were hard and serious. \u201cI suppose, if it really is Gaia, she wouldn\u2019t come to you anyway. Not after what she said to me. But if it IS a demon, or some shit, then she will probably come after you as well. Either way, there\u2019s no good that can come from it. Don\u2019t wear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wear it.\u201d he promised, holding the amulet in his closed fist. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave it on my desk or something.\u201d He had a final look over his brother, his enormous frame still coated in his own juices. \u201cI\u2019ll come and get you as soon as I wake up tomorrow. I know the fox that owns the store. He\u2019ll be there fairly early, even if he\u2019s not open. Plus, I imagine it\u2019s going to be a bit of an effort to get you outside and find something for you to wear\u2026 and you need a good hosing down to boot man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at himself and laughed. It was a much louder noise than he intended. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll see what happens then. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler left his brother, and carried the amulet into his room, closing the door behind him. Across the room, he saw himself through the mirror in his closet. He was shaking; his eyes were wide as he reflected on the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of his brother\u2019s enormous eyes had burned into his mind. He was huge. Unnaturally so. No one on the planet would get remotely close to him. And Tyler being able to temper his attitude was a close call, to say the least. Unless there was a way to reverse this, life would never be the same. He was worried for his brother, but he was also jealous of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, he did go in there to steal the amulet. And now, he was holding it in his hands. Had anything really changed? Yes, his brother had asked him not to wear it. And his stories about gods or demons did give him pause for thought. But regardless, in his hands he held the key to a body he had always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the short, frail purple dragon in the mirror. He imagined himself a foot taller, with wider shoulders and angular definition. He could see himself flexing his muscles, his torso contoured and flowing with a v-taper. The thought sparked a stirring in his loins. He had a choice to make.</span></div></div>",

He was going to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scrambled his clothes off and hurriedly put the amulet on over his neck. He practically jumped into bed as he lay on his back. He grasped his growing erection in his both his hands as he worked it softly. He breathed steadily. He had to be quiet. He couldn\u2019t allow his brother to hear him.  He idly wondered to himself if David\u2019s bigger ears would help or hinder his hearing. Either way, it was best to play it safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped working his dick once his erection was full. Tyler had an impressively huge penis for the average male, let alone for the below average one. When aroused, he was a full 8 inches long and 6 around. He didn\u2019t have much else to be proud of, so he had done the numbers. He was a statistical anomaly, having literally twice the manhood of the average guy. Such a proportional size gave Tyler a number of luxuries, including the one he was about to display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler slid his body down his mattress to lay flat. He then lifted his feet up over his head, letting his toes rest on the wall behind him. Lying on his shoulders and neck, he bent his spine and lifted his pelvis into the air. He grabbed his erection with both hands once he was comfortable, and started licking its head, moving shaft up and down in opposition to his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Tyler wanted to, he could stretch even further and put the thick head into his mouth. But doing so required quite a stretch, and the payoff wasn\u2019t worth the discomfort. So instead he kept the head just outside of his lips, and let his tongue do all the work as it slid and wrapped around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler snorted through his nose as he hungrily lapped at his cock. He coated his hands with a mixture of saliva and his leaking pre, and used it lubricate his fingers as he began to work his shaft above his head, his hands keeping his cock sliding up and down across his tongue as they worked his sizeable length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought against his urge to accelerate and harden his efforts. Quietly, he thought to himself. He had to keep himself quiet. However, he gradually found a higher gear as he ground away at his cock. His toes stretched hard against the wall and his tail flicked in time to his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took longer than normal, but he felt the welcome pressure build within his cock as his orgasm approached. Despite himself, Tyler threw a sizeable amount of caution into the wind as he responded by digging his ands deeper and faster into his meat. The mattress underneath him started to squeak softly in time with his movements as he felt the pressure build beyond the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes closed shut and furrowed his brows as he hungrily lapped at his cock for as long as he possibly could. He gave up as he began to feel himself ejaculate, and in that moment he pulled his head back. His muscles tensed up, his pelvis was thrust further into the air as his feet pushed out against the wall. His tail straightened and stretched as his ebony cock spat his pearly white seed onto his torso. He emitted several suppressed grunts though barred teeth as he came, his hands still working his shaft until every last drop of his cum had been milked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then retreated his feet from the wall and with a soft thud, lay his body down flat onto the mattress. He breathed hard as he stared at his spent and sticky cock. This was it; this was when he was meant to grow, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler sat waiting as he caught his breath. He felt good, but no better than he usually would after such a session. He was relaxing in the afterglow, not really sure what to expect. The moments passed without incident. His cock started leaning on an angle as it slowly deflated. His hot seed was beginning to trickle down him, onto the sheets below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw his head back down and stared at the ceiling. His brother was right. The amulet wasn\u2019t going to work for him. He pouted quietly a long moment before he sat up and wiped himself clean. He felt like shit. He had the key to his desires around his neck, but wasn\u2019t going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for him to sleep, but eventually it came to him in the early hours of the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he was dreaming when he woke up standing in a familiar place. Hunks of moulded plastic and strips of painted metal and wood rose colourfully around him, forming the various playground structures that sprouted from the large bed of woodchips. Tall green trees bordered the park, shielding the scene from the busy city that bordered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a common scene in Tyler\u2019s dreams, usually finding its way into whatever demented narrative his mind spun, but this time felt different. The dream was vivid. There seemed to be a great deal of detail in the scene, he could even feel the rough woodchips pierce uncomfortably into the bottom of his feet. And he was standing completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also someone standing behind him. With a start, he turned to face them. Tyler froze as he gaped at the doe. She was... indescribable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood about six feet tall, her frame flowed from her small cloved hooved to the large round ears that stood a full foot above Tyler\u2019s eye level. The doe\u2019s curves were deep and soft, her limbs strong but thin, her hips and breasts were wide and full. The way her hips flowed into her thighs, the way the white fur on her belly narrowed as it flowed down unto her vagina. Every curve and colour on her body seemed to guide the eye into those tight gentle lips. Tyler had no idea that femineity could be taken to such levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body responded as base instincts raced within him, and Tyler immediately he felt his cock start to spring to life. He realised that he was staring, and quickly ripped his eyes up to the doe\u2019s face. She stared back down on him with stoic purple eyes, her head slightly cocked in quiet judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was suddenly acutely aware of his own nakedness. Tyler reflexively slapped his hands down over his groin and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe scowled and squared her jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d She said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler froze for a moment. Was she telling him to remove his hands, or to not get an erection? His jaw moved but only a confused grunt came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe took two angry steps towards him, standing just a foot away. Her breasts bounced and swayed with the motion, and Tyler had to fight to keep his gaze firmly in the deer\u2019s angry purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cover your body as if you were ashamed.\u201d She said as she looked down her petite muzzle at him. \u201cThat body is a gift I made for you. It is an affront for you cower from it so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler held his form for a moment longer. He could feel his cock filling his grip, his erection fighting to break free. But the doe\u2019s gaze was unremittent, and so Tyler slowly parted his hands and put them to his side. His cock sprang up in the freedom, reaching out to the doe that stood so closely in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe\u2019s face softened as she inspected the cock that bobbed just inches from her. \u201cThere, that\u2019s not so bad, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler kept his eyes on the doe\u2019s face. When she returned the gaze with her purple eyes, an awkward moment followed. The doe stared expectantly at Tyler, but he had no idea what she wanted him to say. Nervously, he took a step back to afford them both some personal space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe signed and shook her head. She stepped past Tyler, and started walking through the playground, surveying the landscape with her hands held behind her back. Now that she wasn\u2019t looking at him, Tyler allowed his eyes to wander. He stared mesmerised at the doe\u2019s ass as it swayed away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gate was effortlessly seductive, as if it was simply her natural walk. The doe\u2019s small tail stood erect, its soft fluffy white underside drew a line down the middle of her cheeks which Tyler hypnotically flowed. His cock angrily demanded Tyler to bury it inside her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we Tyler?\u201d The doe\u2019s voice pierced though his thoughts. He shook his head as he tore himself back into the scene. \u201cThis is a park I used to play in when I was a kid.\u201d He said as he caught up with the deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you come here often? In your dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose I do. I don\u2019t know why. I guess I dreamed about it when I was younger and it just kinda tuck with me as a regular setting as I grew up.\u201d He suddenly felt embarrassed. It seemed like an incredibly childish place for him to still dream about. \u201cI haven\u2019t been here for years. If it wasn\u2019t for my dreams, I think I\u2019d have forgotten about it.\u201d He tried to justify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe came to a sudden stop. \u201cThis field over here.\u201d She said, looking through a thin line of trees. A wide, open area of grass behind them, a think metal fence surrounded a rectangular field. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t belong here, does it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tyler said as he followed the deer towards it. \u201cThis is a football field I used to go to. It\u2019s not really next to the playground; it\u2019s closer into the city, down by the river.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet your mind has connected the two scenes. What is the common thread?\u201d The doe probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \u201cI guess it\u2019s they\u2019re from the same time period in my life. That\u2019s probably why it\u2019s here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe stopped in front of the steel railing. She looked over the field and said nothing. Tyler was uncomfortable with the silence. \u201cI remember watching my brother play Pee-wee football here when we were younger.\u201d He began. \u201cThere were friends and families, all watching and cheering. As a little kid, it was magical. I wanted to play, to be a part of it. And I was going to be, when I got a bit older.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked over the field and sighed. \u201cBut older meant bigger. I didn\u2019t realise that at the time, I suppose. I can\u2019t remember the moment when I stopped waiting and realised I\u2019d never play. It must have been a gradual realisation. But If I\u2019m honest with myself, it still hurts that I never got to participate. David\u2019s over a year older than me. He\u2019s always been bigger. But when I was younger, I thought that it was just because he was older. I believed that I one day, I would catch up and be bigger than him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was never to be your destiny.\u201d The doe interrupted without emotion. Although she didn\u2019t look at him when she spoke, it at least let Tyler know she was at least listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that, now.\u201d He replied. \u201cBut when I was younger, anything seemed possible. I could play football. I could grow to be even stronger than my brother. I could talk about becoming an astronaut, and mean it. That\u2019s gone now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou regret how your life is?\u201d the deer looked at him from the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cNo. No, I suppose I\u2019m very happy with where I am now, I don\u2019t have many regrets. Well, I don\u2019t regret anything I had a choice over, anyway. But as I get older, less things become possible, I suppose. Life closes in. There are still open possibilities. Where do I go after college? I could stay in academics, and be a professor. Or even take it a step and become a scientist. I could expand my business and form a retail chain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked up at the deer. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never play football. And I\u2019ll never be an astronaut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head softly, but Tyler couldn\u2019t tell what it signified. He felt himself go flush. Why was he saying all of this to her? It was deeply personal, and she wasn\u2019t reacting with much care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the doe\u2019s body again, his throbbing erection was in no hurry to dissipate. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re Gaia, the Greek goddess of life?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not Greek.\u201d The doe said flatly, almost annoyed. \u201cGreek is a mortal attribute. Gods cannot be Greek. Greeks cannot be Gods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I meant.\u201d Tyler mumbled defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe looked away again. \u201cI\u2019m making sure you knew what you meant.\u201d Another awkward pause followed. Why was she not looking at him? She wasn\u2019t looking around anymore. She had seen everything there was to see, and was now just staring into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed. \u201cFrom what David said, and what you just implied, they got a few things right about you though, right? I mean, you ARE the goddess of life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe was stoic a moment before she nodded softly. \u201cYes. You could call me that, if you wished. As for the Greeks and their tales\u2026 well, usually even the wildest inaccuracies have their origin in a grain of truth, regardless of how tenuously. I am the creator of life. I designed it, manufactured it, nurtured it, and loved it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded distantly. \u201cSo what else did the Greeks get right? Did you give birth to gods and Titans?\u201d<br>\r\nThe doe finally turned to face Tyler. His eyes darted to her breasts and back. Her eyes held no warmth. She looked almost bored. \u201cI can\u2019t give birth, Tyler. I am not made of flesh, this is just an avatar. But I can, and did mother life, in a sense. Not Gods, that power is beyond me, and I wouldn\u2019t make use of it if it was.\u201d The doe almost smiled cheekily. \u201cAs for the titans, well\u2026 what do you think?\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler studied the doe\u2019s expression for a moment in confusion before it clicked. \u201cYou\u2019ve\u2026 David! You\u2019ve done what you\u2019re doing to him now before, haven\u2019t you? You\u2019re turning him into a Titan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe shrugged almost playfully. \u201cIn a sense, yes. What I am doing with David is similar to what I did to the Titans. Thousands of years ago, at the dawn of civilisation, I realised that it was the ultimate corruption of life. I thought I could fight it. My design had lasted four billion years in perfect purity. I was naive. I ended up fighting a symptom. The real cause of the problem lay in a flaw in my design, that had lay dormant and invisible. But at the time, I honestly thought I could save it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe turned away from the field and began walking back to the playground. Tyler followed behind. \u201cAnd so I chose several champions to take up arms for me. I chose one man from each of the fledgling civilisations and gave him great strength. I turned them into titans, and tasked each to destroy the communities that blooded them. Together, they would all purge the corruption.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia sat down on a swing. She spread her feet wide, parting her vaginal lips, the action exposing a great deal of warm pink flesh. Tyler pointedly stared at her eyes, but the sight of it in his peripheral vision was enough to get his heart racing again. His cock had stayed hard this whole time, but it found another gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe stared up at him from where she was sitting and began to idly swing back and forth. \u201cBut another god interfered. The details are long and irrelevant. In the end, my titans were killed. Civilisation prospered, and I was banished into the amulet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are going to do the same thing again with my brother?!\u201d Tyler demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia shook her head. \u201cNo. David will dwarf the titans of old. And the role he plays will be greater. I have accepted the flaw in my design. Even if I purge civilisation from Earth, it will re-appear eventually. I am evolving life as you know it, fixing it. I will bring it forward in a new form, with new rules. And David will live to see my new world. He will father it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJealousy rose within Tyler. \u201cWhy him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is strong.\u201d The answer was simple and succinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t I?\u201d Tyler asked angrily. Suddenly, he was asking the deep, burning question that had consumed him for years. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I strong?! Why did he get everything, and I got nothing?!\u201d He was shaking as he fought back tears. \u201cIf you made me, then why did you make me so weak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe stopped swinging. For the first time, her purple eyes held a trace of sympathy. \u201cYou are strong in different ways, Tyler.\u201d She said reassuringly. \u201cYou are smart, much smarter than your brother. And your size is as much an advantage as it is a setback, if you used it to your advantage. You aren\u2019t inherently weak, Tyler. You can\u2019t sum up your being with that word. But you are weak in the areas I require. Nature will pass over you. I pass over you. It\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d<br>\r\nTyler shook his head despairingly. \u201cBut why?!\u201d he almost sobbed the words. \u201cWhy is that the way it is? Why can\u2019t I be special? Why do I always miss out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe\u2019s lips tightened in sadness. \u201cI passed over you because I knew you were corrupted.\u201d Her voice was one of regretful candour. \u201cAnd you have proven here in this dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Tyler demanded. \u201cHow am I corrupted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia stared hard into Tyler\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou are a young male. The body of a young female stands before you, presenting your erection with her open vagina. And you can\u2019t even bear to look at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what would you have me do?\u201d Tyler asked, even though the answer was perfectly clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d He demanded helplessly. \u201cI\u2019m corrupted because I don\u2019t fuck you like an animal?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia flinched as she closed her eyes, and her ears shot flat and backwards. It was as if Tyler had just shot her. When she opened her eyes again she did so slowly, releasing a single tear that ran down her cheek. \u201cTyler. You ARE an animal.\u201d The doe got off the swing and stood up. Tyler\u2019s anger disappeared in an instant. His heart sank at the sight of tears flowing down her beautiful face. Her eyes were full of immense and genuine sorrow. She stepped forwards and embraced the purple drake. Tyler gasped as his cock skid up her fluffy white stomach as she held him tightly. \u201cThis is why you are corrupted.\u201d She cried into his hear. \u201cTo deny your heritage is to deny you are one of my children. You\u2019ve turned your back on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s heart beat rapidly. He felt immensely guilty that he had brought the doe to tears. He wanted to stop her crying. He would do anything to achieve that, he realised. But at the same time, the doe\u2019s touch was warm and electric. He could feel her heart beat underneath the breasts that were pressed up against his chest. Her fur was soft and delicate, and her smell drove him wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid eyed me unashamedly as soon as we met.\u201d She sniffed in his ear. \u201cHe begged for me to fuck him. But you forced your eyes from my body and denied your instincts. You stepped away from me, Tyler.\u201d She let go of Tyler, and took a step back. His cock slid back down her stomach and complained angrily when it no longer felt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Tyler, and ran a hand tenderly over his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s not because he is bigger than you, Tyler.\u201d She said consolingly. \u201cIt\u2019s because he is purer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave out a single sob as the doe held him. He realised that he loved her; she was like no one he had ever met before, and would never meet again. He wanted to be with her, he wanted to make her happy. But she would never love him back. He felt his heart break at the realisation. \u201cI can change.\u201d He said with a desperate helplessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe closed her eyes and shook her head. \u201cNo Tyler, you can\u2019t. The corruption is as ingrained and unchangeable as the colour of your scales.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia looked down at his penis, the disproportionately large ebony rod still stood as hard as a rock. She grasped it tenderly in her hands. Tyler breathed uneasily as he felt the rush of the deer\u2019s touch as she slowly traced her finger up its length. \u201cEverything here is working properly.\u201d She said, as she studied him. \u201cBut everything here\u2026\u201d she looked at the drake\u2019s head, and placed her hand on it. \u201cYour mind is clouded and full on untruths. You have a perspective of the world that is completely unnatural. It fights against your nature, and it changes it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe looked into his eyes, before embracing him again. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you Tyler.\u201d She said into his ear as she traced her fingers over his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You have no control over what you are. It\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t see the flaw in my design. I failed you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shuddered as he began to cry. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me.\u201d He pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia held him a moment longer, before releasing him again. \u201cI have passed over you, Tyler. Why would you want me to stay?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want to be with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia looked over Tyler\u2019s body, as if evaluating him with a different perspective. \u201cDo you not embrace your corruption? Do you not wish to defend your civilisation?\u201d she asked. She gently placed an open hand on Tyler\u2019s left breast. \u201cWhat does your heart tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d Tyler said, as he placed his own hand on top of the doe\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe looked at Tyler\u2019s hand. \u201cYou betrayed your brother\u2019s trust when you wore the amulet to try and take my power for yourself.\u201d Her eyes moved back onto his. \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked away. \u201cI feel bad, I guess. I went behind his back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The doe instructed. \u201cYou did the right thing. Your brother is a sexual competitor; and a formidable one at that. You should afford yourself every advantage possible. If that means using your superior intellect to take advantage of his ignorance, then so be it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia grabbed Tyler roughly by the shoulders and pulled him towards her. This time, his cock slipped under her, between her thighs. He let out a whimper as he felt his length get enveloped buy warm, soft deer. He felt the doe\u2019s fluffy tail tickle his head and her warm lips wet his shaft. \u201cThis is what it is to have a pure mind, and a pure existence.\u201d She whispered through clenched teeth.  \u201cYou cannot value peripheral things and people. You must simply value the things in which you can fuck, or help you to fuck. It is a ruthless, but beautiful existence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe grabbed Tyler\u2019s hands and guided them to the bottom of her ass cheeks. Then she ran her hands up his back and licked his neck. \u201cIf you truly wish to be pure, then I can purge the corruption from you.\u201d She said through heavy breaths. \u201cI will give you a test Tyler. You can choose your destiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was panting as his blood ran hot and fast. The doe was slowly but rhythmically rotating her hips, sliding Tyler\u2019s cock between her thighs, her wet pussy sliding up and down his shaft. Gaia shifted her weight onto one foot, and then wrapped the other foot around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck me.\u201d She demanded hungrily into his ear. \u201cProve to me that you want to be pure. And I\u2019ll make you my new champion. I\u2019ll give you my power, and cleanse you from corruption. I\u2019ll make you bigger than your brother, like you\u2019ve used to dream. And then I\u2019ll give you even more. And more. And more\u2026 more, MORE!\u201d The doe escalated the word until she cried it out, her voice trembling with need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck me.\u201d She pleaded. \u201cRelease your corrupted inhibitions. Don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t think. Just fuck.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler stared up and down the perfectly sculpted, brown and white furred body as the doe ground against him, aching pleasure searing through his substantial rod. He gave a slight, almost involuntary buck of his hips as he moved to encircle the doe with his arms and lay down with her in the soft and gentle dreamscape. His purple, leathery skin pressed up against Gaia\u2019s delicate fur, and he looked up to share a loving glance with his would-be partner... but then, it hit him. The dragon froze stock-still as he looked into the intense purple eyes of the doe, a malicious glint and just the slightest hint of a disdainful sneer curling the edge of her mouth drawing his attention.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I...\u201d stammered Tyler, pushing back from the clutches of the deer, brushing away from her in a panic.<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, <i>fuck me</i>.\u201d she demanded, taking step after determined step after the backpedalling dragon, swaying her hips as she strode forwards. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get bigger than your brother. You don\u2019t want him to loom over you forever, do you? A paragon of fitness, constantly reminding you of your impurities? Stop thinking, little dragon, and you\u2019ll go far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I can\u2019t.\u201d spluttered Tyler, holding out clawed hands in a defensive posture. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t!\u201d he snarled, stepping back away from the doe, her placid, uncaring expression twisting slightly as she lay a look of sheer contempt upon the dragon. \u201cYou talk about wiping out civilization as though it\u2019s just a natural thing to do \u2013 as though it should be obvious. It\u2019s the act of a monster, though \u2013 an unthinking monster. You said as much to me \u2013 my strength isn\u2019t physicality, it\u2019s my intelligence, and I\u2019m not going to stop thinking.\u201d Pouting as she cocked an eyebrow at the drake, Gaia placed her hands on her hips in irritation, looking down her petite muzzle at the smaller figure before her.<br>\r\n\u201cUnlike David, I know when I\u2019m being manipulated.\u201d said Tyler, struggling to get his words out as the gaze of the doe nearly pierced his soul, bathing him in pure disdain. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me react to my emotions. Lust, jealousy, anger... if I was a big muscleheaded lunkhead, maybe I\u2019d fall for it, but I\u2019m not going to be your tool. I\u2019m not going to destroy civilization for you, and neither is David. For once, I\u2019m going to protect him \u2013 you\u2019re not getting your claws on him, you fucking harpy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimmering with rage, Tyler stood defiantly in the dreamscape, his little chest puffed out and his fists balled as he looked up at Gaia\u2019s emotionless expression, deliberately fixing his gaze on her eyes so as to ignore that perfectly rounded and sculpted body.<br>\r\n\u201cTyler...\u201d she said, almost whispered, as a breeze kicked the scent of her dripping sex into the drake\u2019s senses, nearly sending him reeling with a wave of animal lust.<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d He spat, dismissing her complaints with a definite wave of his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not controlled by my urges. I\u2019m not an animal, I\u2019m a person. First thing tomorrow, I\u2019m taking that amulet back and I\u2019m going to deal with it, and you. Consider your offer denied!\u201d With a flourish, Tyler turned around, stomping off further into the dreamlands in an attempt to ignore the god before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his plan was not to work. A few steps later, he heard his name ringing throughout the fields, deep and booming and unlike anything he had ever heard before. Turning quickly to see the source of the sound, he was faced by a towering hoof looming over him, connected to the powerful leg of a colossal Gaia. His eyes traced along the intimidatingly large frame of the deer, following the patterns in the fur up past the white treasure trail, past a behemoth set of breasts, and finally into those deep purple eyes, staring him down with sheer malevolent intensity.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you will not play this way, perhaps another tack will convince you of the just nature of my cause. Rest well, little Tyler. You will need your strength for the day to come... and to compete against the champion of my will.\u201d Nausea and fear welled up in Tyler\u2019s stomach as he watched the massive hoof twitch, but he barely had time to react before it smashed him into the ground, pulping him beneath tons of muscle and hoof...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was, of course, when he woke up, coughing and spluttering as he started awake, flailing and screaming in pure terror. Dawn light crept through his curtains as his heart began to settle in his chest, and as he looked across his purple frame, he noticed... an oddity.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two things caught Tyler\u2019s as he sat up and examined himself. The first was the cold, sticky mess that ran down his erection and onto his abdomen. The second was how foreign his body looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scales were purple  but that\u2019s about where the familiarity ended. His slick ebony rod was too big, even for Tyler. The torso beneath it was the wrong shape, and void of his familiar pot belly. Instead a good amount of definition flowed across it. Tyler touched his abdomen to make sure it was his. His torso felt the touch of his cold fingers, his fingers told him his gut was a lot harder than it should have. His eyes traced down his feet, which simply looked too long on the mattress he was laying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler quickly jumped out of bed, but his feet hit the ground far too early. He lost control of his momentum and sent himself diving horizontal across the room, hitting the cold wooden floor with a loud thud. He lay there a moment dazed. His heart was racing. Nothing felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, he picked himself up. He wobbled a bit as he passed his usual height, and kept rising. And rising. Tyler breathed heavily as his back cracked, letting him know he was finally standing up straight. The walls of the room seemed a yard closer than they should have been in all directions. His bed, desk and bookshelf\u2026 hell, everything looked much smaller than it should have. It was like he was in a scale model of his own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had grown. He was about a foot taller, though that estimate took a while and a lot of referencing to reach. A foot was a lot, but it wasn\u2019t as much as he first thought it seemed. He caught is own reflection in the mirror. He didn\u2019t look quite like he had imagined the night before \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t too far off it. His muscles, while perhaps slightly bigger and clearly more defined, were still far from what you\u2019d expect form even a casual bodybuilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the frame underneath them was notably different. Last night, Tyler\u2019s body was very flat and straight, his shoulders being about as wide as his hips. But this morning, they were clearly broader, and looking from the side, his chest seemed to be deeper. While he wasn\u2019t exactly herculean, his body had gone from being a sickly thin, into something thicker, if not overly fleshier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock was another story though. It had grown slightly beyond proportion, its tip reaching around eleven inches from its base.  Tyler rotated his pelvis and watched the hard cylinder of meat trail his motions. While he was nothing on his brother now, he was ridiculously well hung regardless. He cupped his balls in his hands to try them out. They felt full and heavy compared to what he was used to. He swallowed as he probed at his groin. His cock was aching with the attention, wanting to cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head violently and started rummaging through his closet, his heart racing. What the hell did Gaia do to him? He was having a hard time feeling too good about his new body, considering how the doe had turned malevolent. He had walked away from her, but she was still manipulating him. And worst of all, he didn\u2019t even remember the orgasm that caused it. He had never heard of an unconscious wet dream. Could Gaia make him black out? How much control did she have over him now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA \u2018new worst of all\u2019 thought suddenly hit Tyler. He was a foot taller. After he promised David not to wear the amulet. How was he going to explain that away? What was he thinking when he put the damned thing on?! His mind raced as he frantically threw clothes onto the floor one after the other. Nothing. He couldn\u2019t think of anything. Lie? He could make anything up, he supposed. They were working with spirits and magic, it\u2019s not like it was making too much sense to begin with. But he was sure lying would end up backfiring. The last thing they needed now was misinformation thrown into the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he settled on a shirt which a relative had gotten for him several years ago. He never wore it as it was several sizes too big. It was still too big after he put it on. He quietly tried to remember who the hell had given it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis erection hadn\u2019t gone away. This made things more difficult, as his pants and his underwear were already comparably smaller. He groaned in frustration as his cock refused to retreat, instead it was seemingly content to simply push out against his clothes no matter where he put it. In the end, he tied a belt around his stomach under his shirt to keep it flat against his chest. It warmed his abdomen, the sensitive head resting just below his sternum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised he felt heavier as he carefully made his way to his brother\u2019s room. Despite everything that was happening, he did quietly enjoy the feeling of increased pressure on his balls and toes with each step. The occasional floorboard even creaked with each soft thud of his footstep, a sound he wasn\u2019t used to making. His smile faded as he opened his brother\u2019s door and turned on the light. He dreaded the explanation in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cah? Uh.\u201d His brother grunted as the light stirred him. His voice was deep and grating, almost guttural as it flowed from his wide, elongated throat. For a brief moment, Tyler got excited. His brother was still huge; he spilled over his dangerously bowed bed and across the room. His cock was still hard and enormous, but he wasn\u2019t as big as he remembered him last night. Then he realised it just because Tyler himself was bigger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Tyler.\u201d He managed to mumble as he squinted at his brother standing in the doorway. Tyler stood frozen, a nervous grimace on his face.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d his brother asked, the bed moaning a protest as he slightly inclined himself. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost. Did you forget what happened last night, or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler blinked. Was David serious? Did he not notice that he was six foot tall now?! Perhaps his growth his sense of scale was all fucked up. Whatever the reason, his heart fluttered. If David didn\u2019t notice, then he could get away with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he sighed and shook his head. No, this would be for the best in the long run. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not you.\u201d Tyler\u2019s eyes grew wide in shock as he fought the instinct to cup his mouth. Holy shit, was that his voice? It was almost as if it had broken again! He cleared his throat and spoke a little softer. \u201cI saw her. Gaia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s enormous eyes grew wide. \u201cWhat? How?!\u201d he demanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at the ground and rubbed his wrists. \u201cI, uh\u2026 I wore the amulet last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was an awful pause before David responded. \u201cYou WORE the AMULET?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Tyler looked up at his brother\u2019s furious eyes. If he had hair anywhere on his body, it would have stood up at that sight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry David, but I just had to see it for myself. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, I just wanted to know what I was dealing with, but you were right man. No good came from it. She told me a whole bunch of stuff, but who knows if any of that is true. It was useless, but now I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s some spirit in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s scowl was deep and unmoving. His aggressive demeanour demanded a better explanation form Tyler. The purple drake fidgeted nervously.  \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s really Gaia, or a demon. But to be honest dude, that doesn\u2019t matter. If it\u2019s really Gaia, then Gaia is a demon! She wants to control us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUs?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded. \u201cShe played me, I don\u2019t know how; she must have cast a spell, or something. But I ended up telling her a lot of\u2026 well, personal things, and then she made me angry, and jealous, and she\u2026 fuck, at one stage I felt like I loved her. She tried to confuse me, but I said no. She wanted me to have sex with her, but I said no. Then she got nasty\u2026 she, fuck. She killed me, in the dream. I turned around, and suddenly she was huge, and she stomped me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wore the fucking amulet?!\u201d David demanded again, his rage escalating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler dropped his shoulders and nodded. \u201cYes. But there\u2019s a bit more. I woke up after that, and well\u2026 I must have had a wet dream, or something. I don\u2019t remember it at all. But there was a mess, and I\u2019d grown a foot taller, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou GREW?\u201d David shouted incredulously, the force of his voice made Tyler take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah dude, but it was against my will!\u201d he pleaded defensively. \u201cI didn\u2019t fuck her, I swear! I woke up and\u2026 something happened, I don\u2019t know how. I rejected her, I told her I didn\u2019t want anything to do with her, but she\u2019s done it anyway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid held his furious gaze a moment longer.</span></div></div>",

Hell, I\u2019d be willing to bet she looked slightly different for the each of us, playing off our greatest desires.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d pondered David, idly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say my ultimate woman would really be a deer. Call me old fashioned, but I\u2019m more a fan of other dragons... besides that, though, she was perfect. Totally perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cToo perfect.\u201c added Tyler, thinking as he tried not to look at David\u2019s imposing manhood throbbing away against his massive blue frame. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a trick, but it\u2019s okay now. We can go and dispose of this thing, and then we can enjoy our new sizes!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Shame I didn\u2019t get any bigger, but this is pretty cool.\u201d rumbled David. \u201cI bet I\u2019m gonna get banned from football, though \u2013 man, I wonder what Fang will say? Oh man, it\u2019ll be great!\u201d With a wide smile across his face, the huge drake hunched over as he lifted himself up, trying and failing not to scrape against the ceiling with massive, broad shoulders. \u201cAnd hey, at least you got a little something out of it too. Maybe it\u2019ll stop that big douchebag from pushing you around so much \u2013 though if he wants to try anything now, I can punt him halfway across the field.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, for sure.\u201d said Tyler, smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna freak! You gotta take me with you when you go to see him, I just want to see that smug smile wiped plain off his ugly mug... but let\u2019s deal with this amulet, first. We don\u2019t want it floating around to give someone else growth powers so that they can destroy civilization.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. Besides, I think I\u2019m pretty happy being the biggest around here, I don\u2019t need any contenders!\u201d Tyler watched with a frown as David tried awkwardly to push his massive physique through the doorway, his oversized muscles tensing and flexing as he tried to fit through the gratuitously undersized frame, his large blue tail flicking out awkwardly and knocking a few items off his shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you ain\u2019t gonna fit, bro.\u201d Tyler said, pondering the logistics of the size problem as his brother squeezed around the doorway.<br>\r\n\u201cMan, this is awesome! I\u2019m so huge!\u201d replied David cheerily, removing his head from the frame and lumbering back into the room. \u201cWell, I gotta get out somehow... oh, I know!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what are you...\u201d Tyler stared awestruck as David simply pushed through the bedroom wall and out onto the grass below, his considerable bulk landing with a resonating thump on the ground below and leaving deep pawprints embedded where his weight fell. His powerful muscles barely even tensed as he simply tore through the walls, his unimaginable strength providing him with ample force for his dynamic exit. Gaping through the hole in the wall left by his sibling, Tyler stood with his jaw hanging open as David posed a little, debris and dust caught on his impressive body.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the shit. Look at that! Tyler, are you watching this?\u201d David turned to notice his brother staring slackjawed at the titan on the lawn with some pride, flashing him a cheeky grin as he stomped off to the streets.<br>\r\n\u201cDavid... David! Aren\u2019t you going to put some clothes on? I... er... oh well.\u201d As David wandered off, his heavy footfalls sounding out a rhythmic booming beat, Tyler ransacked his drawers for a few old clothes \u2013 maybe they\u2019d fit better than his current offering. An old pair of somewhat musty shorts proved to be the answer to his prayers, and he quickly lashed it to his 6\u2019 frame with a belt to ensure it wouldn\u2019t trip him up on his way to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly grabbed some fruit as he dashed out the front door after his brother, amulet securely in his pocket as he scampered after the big dragon. It wasn\u2019t hard to find him, considering his substantial height \u2013 his horns were poking out from behind a row of small trees.<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, come on, the shop is this way!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, fiiine.\u201d Tyler watched as large blue legs crashed through the neighbour\u2019s fence, crushing the white picket to splinters under David\u2019s powerful paws. Out in the open, Tyler could really appreciate the sheer size of his sibling \u2013 with the house as a stark visual comparison, Tyler could see just how massive the dragon was with 15\u2019 of height to enjoy... and enjoy it he did, if his still-hard erection was anything to go by.<br>\r\n\u201cMan, they\u2019re gonna have a field day with you on the news. Corrupting the innocent youth with your nude shenanigans.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYup!\u201d smiled David, briefly placing his hands on his hips to emphasize the size of his enhanced endowments. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to watch it, and enjoy it, because it\u2019s not like they can take me in for public nudity. I wouldn\u2019t fit in the cell!\u201d he said, proudly.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, take it easy. We don\u2019t need any hassle on the way to the shop.\u201d Gesturing for his brother to follow, Tyler started to walk down the street, and he was quickly joined by the sounds of large paws slapping against the sidewalk...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey, how much faster do you think I can run?\u201d David\u2019s voice boomed down at Tyler from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid suddenly launched himself forwards, a massive blue leg passing mere inches from Tyler. The purple drake watched his brother as he sprinted down the sidewalk; his muscular tail stretched backwards counterbalancing his sharp forward lean, suggesting the drake was running as hard as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, it looked like he was running in slow motion. It took gravity a while to pull his mass downwards with each step, and his legs had a long way to travel. But the motion itself was anything but slow. His toes were a blur as they stretched and compressed with each step, the blue mass propelling down the street at great speed. Each step heralded a loud thud and cracking concrete sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler ran after his brother, surprised at how heavy he felt under his own feet. His cock scraped up against the torso it was strapped onto, his sensitive head rubbing against his smooth scales. At first it chafed, but it only took a few steps before it had lubricated itself, and started to glide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was enjoying the sensation by the time he had caught up to his brother. A little too much. He probably would have cum if he had kept running. While he obviously enjoyed the pleasure, it unnerved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey David\u2026\u201d be began as he panted. His brother looked down at him with raised brows and a curious grin. Tyler looked away from him. \u201cDid your\u2026 erection go down last night at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head. \u201cNah. I don\u2019t think so, anyway.\u201d The two of them continued on their way, David\u2019s long strides setting a brisk pace. \u201cIt took a while to go to sleep. it doesn\u2019t work that well when you\u2019re horny. That\u2019s why I was so tired when I work up. But I\u2019m feeling good now. Really good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, David veered across the street, his attention caught by something unknown to Tyler. The purple drake just watched in curious silence as David ran up to a brick fence and kicked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis foot effortlessly went through the (normally) chest high wall, the orange-red clay splintering as it was sent flying over someone\u2019s front lawn. \u201cWHOOO! HAHA!!\u201d David shouted as he stared at the hole he had made. His voice was loud and deep enough to carry an echo in the suburban street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, what the fuck?!\u201d Tyler called out in shock. David grinned as he made his way back across the street, his enormous erection swinging wildly out in front of him with each step.  \u201cMan Tyler, this feels great! I feel so alive, I just want to celebrate, you know? I\u2019m fucking huge!\u201d He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that again.\u201d Tyler said nervously as he looked at his chuckling brother. Perhaps it was the oddities of the day that had stopped Tyler form seeing it earlier, but he was acting weird. Very weird. The way David had just kicked down the wall of his house to leave it, the way he just walked down the street undeterred by his own nakedness. And the way he brazenly threw his body around, expending his excessive energy without concern. He was acting unnervingly carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, slow down.\u201d Tyler called to his brother as he started pulling away from him. His cock was sliding gracefully back and forth against his scales with each step, and it was reacting quite favourably as a wet patch began to show through his shirt. He was going to have to take it easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked behind him and grunted, slowing down. \u201cOh man, they are gonna ban me from football though, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he mused. \u201cThat\u2019s going to mess up some of my plans. Not that this is bad, being huge and all. I\u2019m not complaining. But I suppose not playing football again sucks. I would have been happy with just eight or nine feet, but this is too much isn\u2019t it?\u201d He looked down at his brother, a slight glimmer of concern in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave they ever banned anyone for being too big?\u201d Tyler asked he slowed down another half step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid thought a moment, before shaking his head. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t heard of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed. His cock leaked more pre. He tried to focus on other things. \u201cWell, it does sound sort of discriminatory, in a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 maybe.\u201d David shrugged his enormous shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe you could get the ACLU or someone to help you if they tried to ban you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid thought a moment and then gave a sharp laugh. \u201cHa! Trust you to know what to do, hey. I think I\u2019d kill someone on the field though. I must weigh a ton.\u201d David spontaneously launched himself high into the air. Tyler could feel the ground shake next to him as he LEFT the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concrete splintered beneath the cobalt drake\u2019s enormous saurian feet ah he landed. Powdered concrete flew up between his spread toes as his huge hips continued down, his knees buckling as his thick powerful thighs and calves tensed in the follow through, his heavy tail slamming down on the ground shortly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shockwave jolted through Tyler, and for a fraction of a second he couldn\u2019t feel the ground beneath his feet. The violent movement sparked a sharp wave of pleasure up his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gasped as he felt a big spurt of pre shoot up his length. \u201cSTOP!\u201d he yelled at his brother as he realised with horror that he was about to launch himself into the air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake was laughing as he turned to face his brother. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked with a playful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head as he swallowed. He could feel an intensely pleasurable pressure in his cock, \u201cNo, David, stop\u201d he panted \u201cJust for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at Tyler curiously. Tyler\u2019s heart raced as his cock twitched. He was so sensitive that every movement was bringing him closer to release. Every breath, ever beat of his heart, every contraction his shaft made as it ejected more fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his breath to stop the movement, stop the pressure building. He closed his eyes and barred his teeth, fisting his fingers to his side. He quickly though of the least attractive things he could think of. But nothing seemed to be pulling him back. It was if his cock had a will of its own as it marched relentlessly forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cARGH!\u201d Tyler snarled in a mixture of frustration and shock as he felt himself pass the point of no return. He opened his eyes wide and quickly pulled the front of his collar out it out as he lent forwards. He let out an intense cry as his balls clenched, and the biggest load Tyler had ever expelled came flying out from inside his shirt, spurting hard onto the bottom of his jaw. He moaned helplessly as a second spurt followed, only half of it managing to escape his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood hunched over in wide eyed shock as he panted heavily. His heart pounded as he trembled. David held an expression of shock before he literally fell over laughing. His ass hit the pavement hard, sending another shockwave jolting up Tyler. He grunted in disbelief as he felt his cock again take pleasure from it. Holy shit, he was ready to go again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid continued to howl with laughter, his booming voice shaking nearby windows. \u201cOh man, Tyler!\u201d He managed to get out between breaths. \u201cYour face! Your face bro!\u201d he continued laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stared at his brother wide eyed as he began to shrink. No, he was growing. He could feel a warmth surge through every cell in his body, a rush of increasing power that in its own way could have been described as orgasmic. He looked down and saw his chest swell; his lose shirt stretching taught on his frame. He could feel the pressure increasing on his toes as his mass increased. He felt his cock creep further up his sternum and onto the bottom of his chest as his balls ballooned in his shorts, weighing down heavier with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stopped laughing as he caught the end of his brother\u2019s growth spurt. Tyler winced as he felt the belt around his stomach grow overwhelmingly tight. He fumbled with the buckle to drop it down a notch or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I didn\u2019t know we were allowed to do that Bro!\u201d David said as he looked down on his brother. Tyler was comfortably over seven feet tall now, but his brother still had some clearance on him as he sat on his ass. Tyler\u2019s eyes widened as he watched David idly rub his own cock, the enormous rod immediately spurting its own pre in response to the attention.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not!\u201d Tyler burst out. \u201cYou saw me just then, my hands were by my side! I didn\u2019t do anything! I tried to stop it!\u201d David chuckled, but he didn\u2019t stop playing with himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler continued urgently. \u201cI have an erection too, alright? I belted it to my chest so it wouldn\u2019t pop out. And it kind of rubbed against me as I walked. But I stopped, you saw me. I thought I was getting too close, so I backed off. But I kept coming David. She pushed me the rest of the way! She took control!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid smiled broadly \u201cHeh, you looked like you loved it though Bro. I\u2019ve watched a lot of porn in my days, but I\u2019ve never seen a face like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, this is serious!\u201d Tyler shouted. \u201cShe\u2019s got control of us! As long as we have these\u2026 cannons, cocked and ready to fire, then she can strike at us! So get your hand off it, before you push yourself too far!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha\u201d! David laughed in delight. \u201cI like how you said cannon. That\u2019s what it is, isn\u2019t?\u201d David\u2019s hands moved up his shaft suddenly as he gestured an explosion. \u201cBOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAVID!\u201d Tyler snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled as shook his head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou\u2019re so stressed.\u201d David chuckled as he sat on the shattered sidewalk, continuing to massage his enormous black cock.\u201cFirst world problems, hey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat?!\u201d Tyler demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you know.\u201d David responded with a shrug. \u201cThere\u2019s people starving and shit, while you worry about getting your rocks off and growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou aren\u2019t looking at the whole picture David! This isn\u2019t fun, there\u2019s something really wrong here. Gaia isn\u2019t helping us, she\u2019s using us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid chuckled in his deep booming voice. \u201cMaybe I like being used.\u201d he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwh..\u201d Tyler began, but couldn\u2019t find the words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid chucked again. \u201cRelax Tyler, we\u2019ll get it sorted once we get back to the store. But in the meantime, there\u2019s nothing wrong with  having some fun, is there? We\u2019ll never have the opportunity to improve our bodies like this again\u201d The enormous blue drake cast a discerning eye over his smaller brother. \u201cWhat you are now, I honestly can\u2019t tell anymore. Seven feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked down over his body. \u201cMaybe about that, I can\u2019t tell either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you could take my position on the team now, hey? I mean, you\u2019d want to bulk up a bit first and learn some skills, and you\u2019d probably suck anyway. But in theory, I mean. Doesn\u2019t that make you a little bit happy?\u201d David asked with a brow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s ignoring the elephant in the room, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid smiled. \u201cWe aren\u2019t ignoring it. We\u2019re going back to the store to fix it.? We're shooing the elephant, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with riding it out, is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not the same. There could be lasting consequences for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d David said so loud and abruptly that it made Tyler jump. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to be 8 feet tall? Imagine that, hey Tyler. You\u2019d be able to kick Fang\u2019s ass yourself. It wouldn't matter if you sucked at football either, with a body like that no one would have a chance to notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed. \u201cBut then why stop at 8 feet, David? Why not 9? Or 10?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chaha, yeah, why not indeed? Now you\u2019re starting to get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Tyler put his hands on his forehead in frustration. \u201cNo, I mean; it will never be enough, will it? You\u2019re well beyond 10 feet, and you've STILL got your hand on your dick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid licked his lips as he looked at his large cock. His hands were rhythmically working his head, drenched in the slick lubricant it spurted. \u201cWell, I figure I\u2019m probably too big to play football now, so I may as well make the most of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt what point will you have made the most of it?\u201d Tyler demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged. \u201cI donno. I\u2019ll see what it is when I get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence ensued, broken up by the distant sounds of traffic and the regular squelching noise od David\u2019s massive claws on his slick solid flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, please stop.\u201d The purple drake pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, be fair now. \u201c David said in a measured tone as he closed his eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t cum since I gave you the amulet last night. I\u2019ve got a lot built up and, well\u2026 I need this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid\u2026\u201d Tyler said as he looked around the street. Unsurprisingly, they had attracted some attention. \u201cDavid, people are watching!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d David laughed, not opening his eyes. \u201cMmm, I bet they\u2019re jealous at the sight of me\u2026 of such a huge and perfect specimen. I bet they want to be me.\u201d His hands slid up and down the length of his haft, his thick claws gripping tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust imagine what they will think\u2026 when I\u2019m growing.\u201d He said as he breathed in heavily. \u201cGrowing even bigger. Growing even stronger. They\u2019ll be like you, Tyler. They\u2019ll ask me to stop. Mmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words morphed into wild grunts as his thrusts picked up pace, his face contouring into a look of concentration. Tyler opened his mouth, but he knew that there was nothing he could say. He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid worked his shaft with increasing effort. He opened his mouth, his tongue lolling as he whispered approval. It didn\u2019t take long before he started moaning as his orgasm approached. His cries became more urgent before he finally grunted then roared as he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot his load like an artillery shell. A single, thick white rope cannoned out of his outstretched cock, reaching high into the air before starting to break up as it reached its zenith. David roared again as a second stream was released, his huge blue feet ripping a sizeable chunk of turf out of the easement as he writhed his body in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had to dart out of his brother's way as he flung his torso backwards, lifting his feet into the air in the same movement. He rested on his lower back as he bowed inwards, working his shaft with all his effort. Through a snarl and several guttural moans, he came twice more, each time rocketing his ropey seed high into the air, only to have it loudly rain down several breaths later with thick, wet splats. Most of it landed on the road, where it slowly formed small streams that flowed into the gutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid panted loudly as he lay back on his enormous elbows. He looked at Tyler and smiled contently. \u201cSee Bro\u2026\u201d he said between breaths. \u201cYou only live once. Ya gotta make the most of it.\u201d The blue drake suddenly rolled his eyes as they closed, his mouth opening wide as groaned sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of his eye, Tyler could see his brother\u2019s cock twitch, the sticky and somewhat deflated head suddenly flaring. The wide veins that meandered up the long black shaft abruptly expanded as fresh blood pulsed through them, and within seconds the entire cock was as stiff as ever, fresh pre gushing down its length as it bobbed and twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed as he stepped backwards, well aware of what was happening. David laughed in delight as he admired his own cock with glazed eyes. He shifted his weight so that he could gently caress its head with single hand as he started growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicks and pops coming from the cartilage and bone deep inside his body. His chest broadened further as his fleshy pectorals hungrily ate up more space. His shoulders drifted further from his body as they filled out even further, the growth cascading down the rest of his elongating arms. His abdomen flared as expanding sheets of muscle pressed out in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this size, Tyler could see new scales form on his brother\u2019s expanding skin. Old scales stretched out in all directions as they expanded, revealing fresh new ones underneath them. David\u2019s cobalt skin swam over his expanding form, the glisten from the morning sun animating as it shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid murred lustfully as he sat up again, placing his free hand on his cock. He worked the head with both hands, his claws sliding effortlessly over the exposed flesh as it released bountiful pre. Underneath his hands, the black cock expanded. It\u2019s head lifted further into the sky, rising steadily higher as it thickened further. Underneath it, the large sack of testicles seemed to stretch as the testicles within them ballooned in all directions, filling with fresh seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler watched his sitting brother rise further above him. Where his eyes were once level to his jaw, they were now looking at his neck, and steadily getting lower. His feet were planted in the turf, his toes depressing further in the ground as his long, thick legs compensated for the tightening space by bowing further, his knees raising higher as the top of his ankles dropped towards the ground, even as they lengthened. The end of his tail flicked happily as it snaked out further across the grass and onto the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had added several feet of height by the time he had stopped. Tyler watched David lather the head of his cock, which stood now stood chest high. \u201cStop playing with yourself, David.\u201d Tyler said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, his brother moaned softly. His hands switched from firmly massaging the head to working up and down the whole shaft, his grip tightening as he did so. He started grunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid! Stop!\u201d Tyler cried out urgently. He stuck out at David\u2019s upper arm, his hand slapping uselessly on his brother\u2019s rock hard biceps as he jerked his claws up and down the length of his enormous shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake\u2019s arms and upper body were committed completely to servicing his cock. Underneath his scales, his broad shoulder blades slid across his back, driven by the epic system of meat that tensed and flexed in rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat slabs of shoulder muscles pounded his arms with incredible force, his forearms a bur of motion as they moved up and down several feet in rapid succession. His towering black cock jerked violently as his tight grip throttled it, responding approvingly to the abuse by flicking thick trails of pre in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake\u2019s expression was almost one of agony \u2013 his teeth were clenched tightly in a snarling grimace as his brow scowled intently, his eyes clenched close with all of his strength. He accompanied each hungry, unstable breath with a guttural grunt and snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet moved sporatically, the balls of his gigantic saurian feet dug deeply into the turf and ripped it out as he kicked out. His thick tail flowed off the turf and onto the asphalt of the street, it\u2019s tip cracking down on the surface as it curled and whipped violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler whimpered to himself as he watched his brother\u2019s  movements escalate further, the tone of his grunts steadily increasing in urgency as his pitch rose. \u201cDavid! you have to stop this!\u201d Tyler pleaded loudly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hands off, pipsquack!\" David ordered as he walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had changed out of his football uniform and was now wearing a light blue tank top and shorts. Tyler gasped, letting go of the small glass bottle that contained unknown liquid on reflex. It fell to the floor, but David caught it just in time before it made contact and broke. Breathing a sigh of relief, he held it tightly in his claws and fixed his younger brother with an angry frown. Tyler shrunk back, clearly intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were times that his pride would have granted him some extra courage, especially if his elder brother was acting with injustice, but Tyler knew that he wasn't suppose to touch David's things, and he nearly broke it that the larger drake probably bought with hard earned money, so David had a reasonable reason to be crossed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch my stuff, man,\" David warned him with a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry,\" Tyler apologized, \"I was just curious, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid knew that he should just drop the confrontation he had with Tyler and forget about it, but he decided to press on, for he was curious. Usually his brother didn't care about the workout supplements his brother brought home, being small and thin person he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean that you were just curious?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tyler began, \"I saw the warning label.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to the bottle, and David looked at it, realizing just now that it really did have a warning label. It shouldn't surprise him, for anything that had words written on it, small, closely typed and without pictures, David tended to avoid. He never like reading. That was his brother's profession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says you can suspect some nasty side effects when you use it,\" Tyler continued, his toned turning accusingly, \"It also said that it's not approved by any medical board. David, where did you get that? That stuff is legal, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger drake grit his teeth in annoyance. Dam Tyler! He always was the smart one, having the ability to identify things easily. Yes, the stuff wasn't legal. David had to buy it off at some shady website. It promised to built mass in a short amount of time by injecting it into the bloodstream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid really needed it, for Fang, one of his teammates and rivals, were busy stealing his spotlight away. The drake wasn't going to allow that brute to walk away with his popularity and everything soft female figure he came across. Fang didn't deserve it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't care about the side effects. The only thing that mattered was that the product could make him bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is,\" David lied, \"Leave me alone and stop bugging me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said he stomped off, leaving a very concerned Tyler behind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang loved hosting parties. Just not at his own place. This time, he had 'convinced' David to have it at his house, well, more like Tyler's house. David hated the fact that though he was much stronger and bigger than his little brother, the purple dragon held all the power when it came to the house. \"I pay the rent,\" he said. As such, David could only scratch his head when he told Tyler about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's Fang,\" David hissed though his teeth. He had to bend down just to get on eye-level with his tiny purple brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" the smaller drake spat with his hands in the air, visibly shaking. \"I- I'm not having him in the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know he'll come in here whether you like it or not,\" David huffed and crossed his thick arms across his chest, his pecs expanding outwards. Tyler rolled his eyes. David could be such a big baby sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Tyler said in hushed annoyance. He then pointed his finger at his brother and pushed at the brute's pec. He hardly made a dent, but he stood adamant and continued with his stern, yet squeaky, voice raising, \"But you owe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed heavily and slumped his shoulders. He brought one meaty hand up and pinched the bridge between his eyes. \"Okay, how many weeks this time?\" He dreaded dressing up in skimpy outfits in front of his brother's hobby shop. He didn't mind showing off his bulky physique, in fact, he loved it. Just, not with all the nerds staring. Tyler just held out three fingers before turning around and going into his own room. \"Oh, and can I borrow some booze money?\" David asked as he craned his neck down the hallway. Four fingers shot out of Tyler's room. The blue drake groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guests had started filing in barely an hour after David had gotten back from the liquor store. He had rushed getting things prepared, i.e. making sure his toilet was safe to throw up in, replacing the sheets on his bed with something disposable and getting a fresh garbage bag for the endless supply of red solo cups. Though, he didn't forget about setting up the snacks and the all important keg too. Even Tyler helped with the set up, sneaking a bit of beer for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler,\" David rumbled darkly. He clenched his fists, but dropped them as a pair of chicks walked in with a six-pack and he flashed a quick smile and 'graciously' accepted their gift. He turned back to his brother and exhaled heavily through his nose, like the dragons of yore, though no smoke came out. He mouthed, \"Don't.\" The smaller drake just gave him a cocky look and rubbed his fingers with his thumb before raising his cup to an imaginary cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was a decidedly better host than David was, the small guy was already tipsy from half a cup of beer and was chatting up the new guests like no tomorrow. David sighed, sometimes he hated being the bigger brother. Responsibility sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the guests had already arrived, about half of them invited, before Fang and his entourage of football players arrived. It was obvious they had been predrinking, the smell of spirits was heavy on the titan's breath as he boomed, \"Yo, party time!\" Behind him, Marcus and some of the other guys had either a couple of bottles of hard liquor or a two-four in each hand. The crowd roared its approval and the music dialed up to the max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the party went on, David rubbed his temple and slumped onto the kitchen counter, taking lazy swigs of his first, and probably only, beer. He had a hard time keeping track of all the people, some had left, some were passed out. Luckily the only casualty so far had been Jessy, her pink streak accented the bathroom nicely as Alison nursed her over the toilet. Okay, maybe Tyler too, Fang having just shoved his head into a headlock as the wolf flexed for some of the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off him,\" David growled as he came bowling over the mass of dancing party-goers to confront Fang. He puffed out his chest and bore his teeth. Fang casually tossed his brother aside, the little guy rolling onto some girl's lap and the purple dragon giggled loosely, clearly inebriated. The wolf came closer and loomed over the blue dragon, a predatory grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill,\" the wolf said, his breath rife with alcohol, \"Just showin' off. Loosen up.\" The wolf picked up David, much to the dragon's chagrin, and threw him onto the couch beside Marcus, their bodies helplessly crashing into each other. David groaned and looked over at Marcus as he hissed a pained apology. Though it didn't look like Marcus minded much, the kangaroo was spaced out, his eyes blinked dully as he gave a half-nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asshole,\" David grunted flatly, looking back up. Fang just challenged him with a snarl and tossed David a beer. The blue dragon grudgingly accepted the bottle, popped the cap and took a deep gulp of the ambrosia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another hour or so until most of the guests had left, the music stopped and the silence was only being filled by idle chatter and the occasional, \"Oh God, my liver hurts,\" kind of groan. David just kicked back, after what must of been his tenth or so beer, he started feeling the buzz set in, and looked around the room full of passed out party-animals, only a couple of the guys sitting around the couches still conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt his loins twinge. He rarely got horny while drunk, but the feeling of his cock swelling in his pants was really good. This time, better than good. Though, he never felt so much pressure before from just his pants. He looked down and froze. There grasping his crotch was Marcus' large paw as the kangaroo stared with a shit-eating grin plastered on his face, trying to unzip David's jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid breathed gingerly, trying not to garner attention to the fact that one of his buds was trying to get into his pants, literally. He jabbed Marcus in the ribs, the large roo grunting in discomfort before returning to his endeavors. David's eyes darted around the room in panic, trying to see if anyone noticed. Luckily no one seemed to be looking, even Fang was dozing off slowly, the large wolf's chest heaving slowly, his mind on the edge of sleep. David iced over when he felt his hard-on pop free of his underwear and a warm firm paw circled around it, giving a slight jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, Marcus!\" David yelled and pushed at the intoxicated kangaroo. The blue drake's heart skipped a beat as some of the still living turned their gaze towards him. He blushed, the blood darkening the scales on his cheek. Worst of all, his cry had woken the slumbering wolf. Fang snorted as he lifted his head and gazed right into David's wide eyes. He glanced down and noticed the scene that had unfurled. The giant shook his head, not believing what he had just witnessed. When he looked back, he still saw a kangaroo licking the ebony head of the blue drake's 8 inch boner and the dragon struggling to push the roo at the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho, dude! Marcus's a fag!\" the titanic wolf whooped. If David's yelp didn't get everyone's attention, Fang's roar definitely did. In fact, it was loud enough to wake the dead, some of the passed out party-goers groggily getting up to wonder what all the commotion was about. David continued to look at everyone staring at him and Marcus, his breathing becoming short. He panted sharply, his cock betrayed him and gave an errant burst of pre into Marcus' waiting maw. The kangaroo gave off a grateful moan. Fang just continued to grin devilishly at David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him off!\" David hissed urgently at Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he's trying to get you off, bro,\" the wolf said with a cool smirk. \" 'Sides, gonna make him suck me next.\" The wolf lewdly grabbed at his own crotch, the bulge inside visibly growing as Fang continued to rub. David couldn't muster a response and just groaned as Marcus started going further down on his dick, his breathing getting heavier. \"Think you like it anyways, Davey.\" David could only snarl and eye the wolf with contempt as the pleasure just began to build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon started to buck his hips, his massive glutes clenching as he thrusted automatically into the roo's mouth. \"Marcus s-s-stop. Pleeease,\" the dragon huffed between breaths and his claws dug deep into the faux-leather of the ottoman. The kangaroo just gave a few dopey giggles and flicked his tongue. David was almost sent over the edge that time and whined loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few more motions by Marcus' mouth, the drake felt his testicles pull up and unleash the first wad of his seed up through his shaft. The drake winced and groaned as the kangaroo sucked harder on his length, draining him completely. After a good four to five spurts, he was spent, his cock giving a couple of twitches as Marcus rolled his tongue along the glans as he dislodged and sat back. The two of them were panting heavily from the ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stopped basking in his afterglow when he heard a moan from beside him. He turned to Marcus and saw the burly kangaroo beating himself off. He was about to turn away in disgust when he, and everyone else that saw it, went wide-eyed as Marcus...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone was surprised that David had just ejaculated in front of ten or so conscious people, surprised that he let Marcus go that far. David knew to be embarrassed, but as he looked at Marcus beat off, he couldn't help but think that the kangaroo definitely looked larger than usual. The whole group went bug-eyed when they saw that each time Marcus slammed down on his raging boner, his arm looked definitely bigger. And it wasn't just his arms, the kangaroo was growing all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus let out a pained moan, the feeling of his skin stretching taut over the expanding muscle made him feel like his body was on fire. And it could have been, he was burning up from the exertion, his skin beet-red all over underneath his russet-brown fur glowing angrily as he he clenched his teeth. He felt his bones cracking, his spine elongating as mounds of meat piled on top of his frame, going from a moderately beefy, tone athlete to something similar to David. In fact, as he continued to pump hard, he grew even larger than David. The kangaroo's shirt began to fray at the seams, the sleeves too constricting as Marcus' biceps slowly expanded and eventually the fabric ripped as he flexed experimentally. He flexed his entire body, the shirt ripping along the back and his jeans fraying at the thighs. A dribble of clear pre ran down the roo's length, drooling farther than it ever had to before, as the shaft swelled to a massive fourteen inches. The pre soaked into the underwear, now straining to keep the large testicles held within. When the growth stopped, Marcus was still furiously beating himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo let out a deep huff and pinched a nipple with his free hand, enjoying the feeling of just how large his chest had gotten. What was once a fit six-pack had turned into a rugged eight, and the roo couldn't help but feel the deep valleys of his abdomen. All this self worship was too much and he cried out as his cock lurched heavily and his testicles pulled up, visible through the pre-soaked, translucent underwear. Everyone stopped as they watched the newly grown kangaroo's first jet flew straight up, the volley so powerful and potent it took a good five seconds before it landed on Fang's muzzle and another two seconds before the stream ended, the wolf too stunned by Marcus' recent developments to do anything. The roo continued to buck and groan wildly as his orgasm continued. After the seventh shot, the cock was firing blanks, still lurching, but with no ammunition left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaah,\" the now giant kangaroo sighed. Marcus just leaned back satisfied after he had the most intense orgasm he'd ever had. He looked around at the guys who were watching him, and for the first time in a long time, he was proud of what he did, proud of what he was. He turned to David with a dopey grin, the blue dragon sitting next to him just stared back in horror. Marcus then cupped his paw on David's cheek and pulled him into a kiss. The blue drake pushed back hard, trying to pry himself free of the now larger kangaroo. Marcus forced his way into David's mouth, the dragon helpless as he's violated by the roo. When Marcus stopped sucking his face to breathe, David finally pushed hard enough to get himself out of the lock and stands up, stumbling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me, you fag!\" David yelled. He wiped his mouth and scowls. Marcus looked up incredulously, now quite sober as he realized what had just transpired between them. David began to turn, tucking his cock back into his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave, wait!\" Marcus said, he stood up and everyone saw just how magnificent he had become. At seven feet and 6 inches, he was a foot taller than he was before and much much heavier. He was just four inches shorter than Fang now, and his build was equally impressive. His brawny physique moved in awkward spasms, the kangaroo inexperienced with this kind of bulk. He tripped and crashed over the edge of the sofa, his hand extended out as he watched David disappear into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rushed to his room and locked the door. He slumped with his back to door and curled himself up, his head bent down between his knees as he began to cry softly. Was it technically rape? Is that what Marcus did? He enjoyed it, but he didn't want it? That's what rape was wasn't it? Unconsensual sex? A blowjob is sex, right? David kept his thoughts reeling, his mind racing through what had just happened to him. His mind stuck painfully in replay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon heard shouting coming from the living room, some sort of scuffle and furniture crashing. He knew he should go and stop it, it was his house. But he couldn't show himself to the others, still embarrassed about the Marcus incident. Speaking of Marcus, how did he do that? Grow like that? David looked down at his crotch? He'd never done that sort of thing with a guy before. Plenty of girls had accommodated him, but none of them ever hulked out like Marcus had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this why gay sex was supposed to be evil? Because it did <i>that</i> to guys? All David knew was that he didn't like it, didn't like feeling another guy get off on him, feeling so helpless as they grew bigger than him. He shuddered at the thought if Tyler, his own <i>brother</i>, were to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to calm down when he heard a banging at the door. David stands up and backs away from the door. The banging becomes more insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to finish his sentence when...</span></div></div>",

But no one's stronger than the Fang!\" The massive wolf just flexed his guns and strutted forward towards the cowering blue dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, stop,\" David whimpered, knowing he couldn't take the giant on even if he tried, \"Please, don't do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, little man. I'm gonna get so big, I'm gonna be a true muscle-god,\" the wolf sneered. He pushed the dragon onto the bed. David struggled, trying to resist the titan's grip, but ultimately failed to ward him off. Fang backhanded David in the jaw, the resulting force knocking the dragon out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to, the wolf had already stripped the blue drake bare, his own impressive musculature splayed across the bed. In fact, he looked like he was readied for a dissection, his arms and feet tied to the bed. He tried to struggle and heard a familiar snarl. He looked down and saw Fang with a hand on his ebony cock, he was close as Fang continued to jerk his cock with a strong grip, the pre flowing freely across the wolf's black claws. The wolf noticed him looking and gave a toothy grin, the malice oozing through the gaps in his fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let out a gasp as he felt cock twitch violently as his release began. On cue, Fang clamped down onto the throbbing shaft and swallowed everything. David whimpered in horror as splurt and splurt of his semen was entering the already hulking wolf. When he was finished, Fang let go of his length, a sick grin plastered across the wolf's face. Fang's eyes rolled back as he let out a deep moan before collapsing to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could only wriggle and writhe on his bed as he heard the wolf pleasure himself. Fang's moans got louder and lower with each passing moment. The dragon could hear the audible squishing sound of each powerful stroke and the snapping of fabric as Fang grew to colossal proportions. David began to tear as Fang started to snarl, the beast close to orgasm. And as Fang came, David could only watch as thick streams of the wolf's seed arched all the way up to the ceiling, splashing and scattering everywhere, a couple of droplets even landed on the helpless drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe presumably larger wolf let out a tremendous sigh and David heard and felt a head thumping to the ground, the wolf must have passed out from the pleasure of his wank-off session and growth. David took this as an opportunity to escape, he tried with all his might, but the ropes that bound him were too strong. He cried out, \"Help! Is anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tyler rounded the corner his eyes bugged out when he saw what David knew to be a much larger Fang. \"Tyler, help me,\" David begged, his voice ragged and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry David, I was just getting everyone out of the house and dropping off Marcus at the hospital. Fang almost killed him,\" Tyler said as he began to untie one of the foot bindings, \"I should've called the cops and an ambulance-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you?!\" David hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's gaze darkened. His hand went over to David's spent shaft and took hold of it. David let out a pained yowl. \"Because, I didn't know if I wanted a taste of what Marcus... and now Fang have had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't! Tyler, dude, I'm your brother. That's worse than being gay,\" David said as he began to struggle in earnest. \"That's like incest and gay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it worse than being small all your life?\" the purple dragon scowled and David stopped to look at his smaller brother, the little guy was trying to bottle his tears in.\"You don't know what it's like David. I'm small and weak, when I should be big and strong like you. We're dragons for Pete's sake! A-and you think you've been protecting me? Your friends harass me when you're not there and when you are, you're always teasing me and roughing me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler? Is that what this is about? About being small?\" the blue dragon asked, his voice insistent. The little drake nodded solemnly. \"But, you've got everything you could possibly want; your nerdy toys, your own shop, marks that I would kill for. Just look at me Ty, all I've got is my muscle. And even then, its not much now, now that Fang's probably the Hulk down there. I guess, I've always been jealous of your brain, so I take my shortcomings out on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler backed away from David and wiped his eyes and snout and gave a little chuckle, \"Yeah?\" David nodded. \"You never were good with words, but you always buttered mom and dad up, I guess I know why.\" They both giggled lightly, having a brotherly moment in one of the strangest of circumstances. Tyler spoke again,\"...</span></div></div>",

David breathed a silent sigh of relief as he felt the small purple fingers fidget with the knots, and once he had a hand free, he started aiding in his own escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some clothes on man.\u201d Tyler said as the last of the restraints were loosened. \u201cI don\u2019t need to see any more of that tonight.\u201d He said as he motioned, but didn\u2019t look, at David\u2019s half masted cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sat his heavy frame up on the bed, the mattress creaking beneath him. His back was straight as he eyed his little purple brother. Now he was free, he was fuming at what Tyler had said to him earlier. But they had shared a moment, so he wasn\u2019t sure if he should just let it pass. His face was stern and his eyes were hard as he internally debated on what he should do next. Tyler\u2019s face dropped when he saw how his brother was eying him. His mouth opened as David made up his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Tyler protested in surprise more than anger as his David suddenly launched himself at him, scooped him up and slammed him into the mattress, landing his heavy blue frame onto his brother's skinny back. It was one quick, smooth motion and Tyler had his breath knocked out of him before he knew what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that shit about wanting to taste me Tyler? How fucking sick are you?!\u201d David roared at his brother\u2019s back, snarling as he pressed a knee into his tiny frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler spluttered and gasped as he vainly fought to get his brother off him. \u201cGet off me!\u201d he cried into the mattress as he wriggled underneath David\u2019s naked blue frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Not until you explain that shit!\u201d David jolted more force onto his purple brother to accentuate the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler kicked his neck to the side to try and breath more freely. \u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t gonna fucking touch you, alright? I\u2019m not a fucking freak!\u201d he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you said! What was that shit about tasting me, and that shit about being a dragon, if that\u2019s not what you meant then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler breathed heavily under his brother for a few seconds before saying \u201cI was thinking\u2026\u201d He trailed off and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat?!\u201d David demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking, maybe if you did something like jack off into a cup, I could mix it with rum or something and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking sick!\u201d David cut off his brother with a snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! Alright, I know! I wasn\u2019t actually going to do it. I just thought about it. And then dismissed it. Straight away! I want to be bigger, alright David?! But I couldn\u2019t actually go through with\u2026 that. I just brought it up because you pissed me off when you snapped at me. Alright? It was a stupid thing to say. I\u2019m sorry. Please let me go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid held his brother a moment longer before suddenly pushing back off him to stand in front of his bed. Tyler immediately turned around, his face flushed. He briefly looked up at his brother, but then quickly looked away, clearly embarrassed with himself and the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid folded his arms as he stood over his brother. \u201cI\u2019ll pretend you never said anything then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Tyler said as he idly rubbed his elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he noticed that Fang's broad, golden eyes were looking up at him. his enormous black body lay face up, his upper torso sitting up on his elbows. He laughed under his breath. \u201cOh no, don\u2019t mind me. I love conflicts.\u201d The wolf rumbled in a frighteningly loud and deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood frozen as he evaluated the wolf. He looked\u2026 huge. He sprawled across the room from David's feet to the far wall. His jet black fur shone in the dim light, highlighting every hard and sharp crevice of his trim, hulking muscles. His pelt seemed to hug his frame so tightly it revealed every major vein and muscle group on his colossal frame, and almost looked like it would tear in half with each deep breath the wolf took. A not too small pink tip bridged the top of his enormous thick sheath, the contrast with the dark fur drew David's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a frightening picture, but David shook his head and snarled in contempt. \u201cFuck you Fang. That\u2019s fucked up, what you\u2019ve done, you know that? You\u2019re FUCKED UP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf chuckled loudly, his voice so powerful David could feel the reverberations.  Fang pointedly licked his lips. \u201cI also love it when people get mad at me. Because they can\u2019t fucking do anything about it, and I just love the sense of powerlessness they give off.\u201d An inch more of the pink flesh pressed out of his sheath as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet the FUCK out of MY HOUSE fang!\u201d David roared, his own voice shaking the room with unbridled fury. Tyler gave an almost inaudible whimper as he retreated behind David. The motion only made David even more determined. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit how big you are, I\u2019ll fucking do a better job on you than that faggy kangaroo!\u201d He clenched his fists as he shook with rage, ready to engage Fang, if not entirely fearlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smiled and shook his giant head slowly, keeping his hard golden gaze on the blue drake. \u201cNup. I ain\u2019t going nowhere. Do you know how much you\u2019re worth to me?\u201d he asked. David said nothing, waiting for the wolf to make a move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt felt so fucking good\u2026\u201d Fang continued, his gaze clouding over. \u201cAnd now I feel\u2026 haha, I feel so alive David. You have no idea. I want some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it sucks to be you then!\u201d David snapped. \u201cYou aren\u2019t touching me! Get out, you\u2019re fucking insane!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what if I am? What difference does that make?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang, I told you to get out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNup.\u201d The wolf said defiantly, and began to move his enormous frame. He kept his eyes on David as he slowly picked himself up. David lifted his own gaze as the wolf rose up before him, his joints creaking and popping as they took his new weight for the first time. Fang hit his head on the ceiling hard, but seemed impervious to the contact. Instead, he forged a little hole in the plaster above him, which housed the top most of his head. Standing up straight, his ears were pressed firmly against the plaster. He looked down on David and smiled broadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight and a half feet. That was how high the ceiling was from the ground, and Fang was bridging that. David swallowed in spite of himself. Well, it wasn\u2019t a full foot like Markus took, but it was still more than enough to upgrade Fang from being freakishly huge to unnaturally hulkish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want it.\u201d Fang said as he closed fists of his own, his knuckles cracking loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you how I get it though, David. I like your brother\u2019s idea. I don\u2019t much care for playing with other cocks, you know. It\u2019s not my field of interest. So you either give it to me in a cup, and I\u2019ll mix it with some rum or some shit and try not to think about it. Or\u2026\u201d He stooped down so that his gigantic muzzle rested just in front of David\u2019s. \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll just suck it up myself again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang slapped an enormous paw on David\u2019s cock before he could reply. The blue drake\u2019s eyes shot opened and he gasped as he felt Fang fish and grab his shaft, his cock sending a jolt of approval at the unsolicited contact despite what David truly thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake reacted by roughly punching and clawing at the massive black hand, but fang's arm felt like iron. He stepped back, but Fang held his grip and simply followed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smiled as he felt David\u2019s rod swell in his grip. \u201cSo what you wanna do?\u201d he challenged the drake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He struggles with all his might to push but the massive hand holding on to him wouldn't budge. Still, the blue dragon was determined to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" the wolf snarled, \"Then how's about some leverage.\" Fang took his other hand and swept behind David's back. When the hand reappeared, a bewildered Tyler was hanging by the scruff of his neck, held by a giant's fist. \"He's so small, David. I wonder how hard i have to squeeze to snap his neck.\" Tyler looked at David, the purple dragon welling at the eyes, kicking and scratching at the enormous arm holding him off the ground. The little purple dragon choked and mouthed at David for help as Fang's grip tightened around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it! I'll fucking jack off in a cup, j-just let him go,\" David surrendered. His body went slack as he stopped his twisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you'd see things my way,\" the wolf said, admiring his own body, admiring the way he could control everything and everyone. He threw Tyler to the ground, the little drake wheezing as precious air flooded his lungs again. \"Tiny Ty,\" Fang sneered, a wicked grin on his face as he looked at the crumpled heap of purple, \"get your bro a cup and some booze. And make it strong, I want to feel it burn all the way down.\" The little dragon whimpered and scampered out of the room. When he was gone, Fang brought his hand up from David's crotch at grabbed hold of the blue dragon's neck. \"Start pumping, bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid obeyed and slowly began to stroke his shaft with one hand. The skin was sensitive from releasing twice in a row already, his rod was raw from all the attention it had received. But still, David continued to pump, desperate to get off for the hulking wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler bolted back into the room, and stopped when he saw David wanking in front of him, his cock twitching dryly from over-stimulation. Fang noticed him, the giant wolf grinned devilishly and with a black claw, motioned the little dragon closer. \"Give it to him,\" the wolf boomed. Tyler winced at the command, but submitted, walking slowly up to David and placing the cup filled with dark brown liquid into his older brother's paw. When Tyler looked up, he saw the grim determination in David's eyes and David gave him a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David continued to stroke himself, he noticed Tyler at the edge of his vision. The black wolf was too busy grinning to himself, stroking his own massive erection and waiting for David to finally finish so he could grow more to notice the small dragon sitting on the bed. Tyler was waving his arms in arcane patterns trying to convey a message to his older brother. When David noticed, he immediately shot his gaze to Fang, the big wolf had his eyes clenched shut, too rapt in his own self pleasure as he nursed his humongous shaft jutting from his sheathe. David discretely watched Tyler at the corner of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tyler gave a signal, David grunted loudly in confirmation. Fang mistook the grunt as David being close, though not far from the truth, he wasn't quite ready to blow. The big wolf opened his eyes and stopped pumping his own shaft to look down, his enthusiasm growing and he shot a thick wad onto his chiseled abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see, big guy?\" David chuckled dryly, exhaling softly as he felt his orgasm build. The big wolf squeezed his neck hard and snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, and finish already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you're thirsty, how's 'bout a little taste of what's to come,\" David jeered and brought the cup quickly, splashing the contents of the cup into the hulking wolf's face. Fang let go of David and brought his hands to his eyes, clearly in pain as the alcohol seared in. \"RUN!\" David yelled to Tyler. The little dragon wasted no time in bolting to his feet and running towards the door. As they exited the room, Fang shrieked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"LL GET YOU FOR THIS, MATTHEWS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could only let out a faint laugh that only grew louder. He got away. He actually got away! Tyler led him out the front door, he didn't bother locking it, for all he knew the beast inside their house would be bowling out any minute now. Tyler unlocked the truck remotely with his keypass and the two dragons hopped in, Tyler at the wheel. \"Tyler, go! Now!\" David yelled, trying to hurry his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" Tyler retorted. He fidgeted with the keys, trying to start the truck up. When the engine roared to life, there was an audible screech as rubber burned underneath them and they sped off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were far away enough, Tyler loosened his grip of the wheel and relaxed a bit into his seat. He turned to his brother, he himself starting to giggle at the thought of their smooth getaway. Though his smile dropped when he saw what his brother was doing. \"Dude, seriously?\" was all he could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was in the passenger seat, his still naked frame kneading his shaft desperately. The blue dragon let out a longing moan and said, \"Sorry, bro, was just so close. Might as well finish and be done with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, David can't you hold it?! This is my truck you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was a bit too late as David let out a deep bellow and came on the spot, rocketing a couple of squirts of his seed onto his abdomen, his release was weak in comparison to his last two, his prostate and testicles sore from being forced to produce so much in such a small timeframe. He let out a sigh of release and slumped into his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?!\" Tyler groaned, his truck was going to smell of David for weeks. When he looked back over, he nearly went off the road. David had scooped as much of his cum on his belly as he possibly could into his paw and began to bring it to his mouth. Tyler couldn't peel his gaze as David licked his hands and claws clean, devouring his own seed and swallowing, the empowered liquid oozing down towards his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let out a moan.</span></div></div>",

However, a strange warm, relaxing calm seemed to spread out from his stomach as soon as he had forced it all down. \u201cbut it feels\u2026 warm and\u2026\u201d David trailed off as he felt his jaw numb, his body seeming to vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the blue drake felt a crackling sensation build in his balls and flow up his cock. He could literally see each spark and hear it crackle; a thousand little white flashes crept up his erect cock as if it was a thick meaty sparkler. He gasped at the sensation as his cock literally came to life, demanding his love and attention. David impulsively grabbed his shaft and started pumping. He had never felt so horny in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truck he was sitting in seemed to fade into blackness as he felt his mind lifting up out of his body. His hand felt numb and detached, his movements blurring into mere ambiance. He giggled as he saw his once blue body start to refract countless colours, his scales looking green and red and pink and everything in between they sparkled, sending rays of light out into the darkness around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rays formed stars and multiplied into galaxies. He felt himself floating through the air, a mighty wind that was both hot and cold flowed through his body, renewing him and energising him. He laughed in delight as nebulas exploded in colours around him, like flowers blooming in fast motion. All the while he felt a wonderful sensation emanate from his cock, an intense orgasmic ambience that made him feel as if he had been numb his whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a caterpillar inside his cock, he realised. It wanted to break free of the cacoon, and to fly through the infinite sparkling universe around him. \u201cI\u2019ll help you out!\u201d David cried to his cock as he felt his own hand distantly work at it. The caterpillar thanked him. It was a silent gratitude, coming to David as a mere awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery thrust of the rainbow drake\u2019s claw helped push the caterpillar out of the cacoon. David could feel every small victory as it freed itself, it felt so good. David laughed and cried as he thrust ever harder. He felt the caterpillar break through the top, its head breaking through the ceiling of it\u2019s prion. David cried out in happiness. It felt so good, the movement signalling the start of his orgasm. A feeling that only intensified as the caterpillar hauled teg rest of its body out. Noting could stop it as it burst free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when David realised that it wasn\u2019t a caterpillar anymore. A butterfly burst forth from his cock as David came, launching itself forwards at a tremendous speed. It opened its wings, revealing four delicate sheets of brilliant shifting colours as it flew through the universe, growing as it tasted the sweet freedom. David cried out, not just in intense pleasure, but also happiness. He wept he held his hands out to touch the butterfly. But it was too late. It was flying away. It thanked him. It wept in happiness too. It said goodbye to David. It was off to live its life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt warmth of content fill him completely as the butterfly flew away. The universe seemed to fade away into blackness. No, he realised. The universe wasn\u2019t fading. He was. He was fading to black. He was dying, and he had never been happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke slowly after a timeless period. His heart raced and he breathed hard, but he was perfectly calm. His eyes fluttered as he gradually realised he was back in his brother\u2019s truck, the streetlights bathing him in both light and darkness rhythmically as they passed overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you awake David?\u201d His brother asked urgently, trying to keep his eyes at least partially on the road in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid mumbled incoherently as he evaluated the setting at his own pace. He was being squeezed in every direction, the seatbelt he wore dug into him, pressing him firmly and uncomfortably into the seat, restricting his breath and movement. His toes were pressed onto the carpeted floor, and his knees jammed into the hard dashboard in front of him. His head pressed against the truck\u2019s roof, kinking his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCum was everywhere. It dripped down from the roof in front of him onto his lap, the pearly seed splattered all over his blue scales. The thinner patches were cold, but it the larger pools that had collated into his crevices still held some warmth. The windscreen and dashboard had a liberal spray, the splatter patterns suggesting it was all reflected off the roof. Fortunately for Tyler, his half of the cabin was largely untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake looked at his brother and gave a mirthless chuckle. \u201cAnd to think, I was getting upset at your first wad.\u201d He said in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid frowned at his brother. Tyler looked\u2026 even smaller than he usually did. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m bigger, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he finally managed to stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Tyler said as he stopped at a red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid opened his claws in front of him and studied them. \u201cAm I as big as Fang?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cNo, nowhere near. You grew a few inches. Maybe half a foot. But that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at his brother as he took that in. His mind seemed sluggish. \u201cIt makes a big difference.\u201d He mused, mainly to himself. Well, he barely fit into the truck before. Anything else was bound to constrict him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light turned green and Tyler drove on. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged. \u201cThe city, it seems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere abouts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI donno.\u201d He said without much emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s just the direction the truck\u2019s pointed in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that David noticed that Tyler\u2019s window was down. But the flow of cold, fresh air was no match for the musky scent of David\u2019s seed. It was a familiar smell to the blue drake, but it was never this powerful. And there was something else in the scent. Something which seemed\u2026 almost appealing. It made his mouth salivate with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid started laughing. Softly at first, but it slowly grew. He tried to stop, but tears welled in his eyes as he lost control. He kept laughing, kept shuddering, and he realised he didn\u2019t know if he was laughing or crying. \u201cOh man, this is all fucked up. So fucked up.\u201d He said to Tyler when he had control of his own breath. \u201cFucking Mark and Fang\u2026 fucking hell, you know? That\u2019s got to be the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. Ever. Nothing else comes close, that was just so fucked up. It really hurts, you know?\u201d he asked. He looked away from his brother as he felt his eyes well dangerously. He composed himself and sniffed manfully. \u201cAnd you really fucking frightened me when I was on the bed Tyler. I know I said I\u2019d forget it, but to be honest that\u2019s gonna haunt me for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler seemed to slump into his shoulders as he gave the road far more focus than it needed, but didn\u2019t say anything. David continued. \u201cAnd on the other hand, I just\u2026 had the most amazing experience ever, and I\u2019m bigger, which is probably the best thing that ever happened to me, you know? It\u2019s stuff of dreams to me, Tyler. I know you think I\u2019m big already, but this is really gonna help me. I need it as much as I want it, you know? And now, my own fucking cum is soaking the cabin, and the smell is driving me wild and making my mouth water. I honestly don\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and looked out of the cum drenched window beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s all so fucked up. Things are out of control, you know?\u201d Distantly he thought he needed to stop asking if his brother knew. He was rambling hopelessly, as if he didn\u2019t have control of his own dialogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d He said with a wry smile. \u201cI never wanted the party in the first place, but I tried to make the most of it. Then the next thing I know I\u2019m driving people to the hospital and people are fucking growing and you\u2019re literally on my back, and\u2026 \u201c Tyler rubbed his face with his forearm. \u201cFuck, I thought Fang would kill me. I almost blacked out. There was nothing I could do.\u201d He was visibly shaking as he relived the memory. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re effectively kicked out of home, we have nowhere to go, and you\u2019ve just destroyed my truck. Shit is out of control, alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at his brother a moment before he violently slammed a large fist into the dashboard. \u201cFuck Fang!\u201d David spat with unbridled fury as his brother reflexively cowered away from him. He remembered waking up tied to his bed with the black wolf crouched over him. What the fuck was he doing back at their house right now? He was probably tearing the place apart in spite, knowing him. But worst of all, David knew that he was unstoppable now. The way he held his brother\u2026 he couldn\u2019t protect him. It was one thing to have Fang dominate himself, but David felt like a failure when he couldn\u2019t protect Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell onto the dripping cum falling from the cabin\u2019s roof in front of his muzzle. There was so much of his seed in the truck\u2026 even Markus, who got the lion\u2019s share of the three of them, would have only swallowed a fraction of what surrounded David now. And as he looked down on his half-erect cock, he was willing to bet that there was still a bit more left in the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly looked at Tyler.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, God. Oh God!\" Tyler cried out in panic, \"David, what are we going to do?\" He continued to drive, but his speed slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drive!\" David hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude, it's the police,\" Tyler snapped back. He pulled the truck over to the side of the road and the two continued to argue. As they traded insults, they didn't notice the constable walking up to their truck. Tyler nearly jumped through the roof when he heard a rapping at the window. The two dragons froze in place, Tyler slowly plucking David's hand off his horn and David slowly trying to cover his less than decent crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rolled down his window and began to speak nervously, \"Hello, officer...\" He turned to look at the policeman and was greeted with a middle-aged lanky kangaroo. His blood froze and he barely meeped out, \"Officer Fletcher, how nice to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policeman did a double take from his notepad before speaking, \"Tyler? Tyler Matthews, that you?\" As he looked down, he saw the little purple dragon shrinking into his seat. That's when he noted the smell, the unbridled musk wafting into his nostrils. He bent further down, only to see the hulking, naked David staring wide-eyed right back, a glob of his cum landing on his snout as he gawked, and Tyler flashing a cheeky, but guilty grin. \"David?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi, Mr. Fletcher,\" David whimpered in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, what are you two doing out here, heading into the city at this hour?\" the kangaroo demanded, his arms akimbo. \"And, David, why are you naked? And is that what I think that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler let out a soft nervous laugh. \"Uh, Officer Fletcher, we... we were just headed out to see Marcus...\" the purple dragon lied, but that was the only thing he could think up on the spot. The way his words came out, his pitch rising at the end, it almost sounded like he was asking a question. He didn't notice David hold back a growl and facepalm behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Fletcher's interrogative stance softened a bit, a sincere smile creeping on his face, \"Really?\" The kangaroo paused a bit before continuing, \"Wait, Tyler, you were the one to drop my boy off at the hospital weren't you?\" The purple drake nodded slightly, not sure how to react. The kangaroo ripped a page off his notepad and crumpled it, throwing the ticket he was writing away. \"Thought you were some hooligans DUI'ing,\" the older man said, his tone cracking up a bit, \"I really appreciate what you've done for my boy. I don't know what I'd do if...\" The kangaroo stood up and wiped his eyes, trying to keep his cool in front of the boys. \"They told me he's stable, even conscious every once in a while. I was headed there myself when I saw you two swerving up front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what a coincidence,\" Tyler said, trying to hold his groan in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...\" the kangaroo pondered, he bent back down to look at David, the blue dragon froze back in place, \"Son, what are you doing naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Oh you know, just trying to keep it loose,\" David said reluctantly, the lie more obvious than his exposed privates. He was a decidedly worse liar than his brother. The kangaroo just raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what he meant to say was, uh... that he wanted to surprise Marcus with something sexy... you know, them being boyfriends and all. And the mess was because... he got carried away. Yeah...\" Tyler said, though he kept his cool, not even he believed it. However, the kangaroo's reaction completely surprised the two dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boyfriend?! Mark never told us he had a boyfriend!\" Officer Fletcher said overjoyed. He bent back down, looking directly at David, completely forgetting that the giant blue dragon was naked as the day he was born, well sans the cum. He asked, \"You and Mark a couple then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to put an arm behind his back, however, the cabin was a little too small and he just shuffled uncomfortably instead before nodding weakly and saying, \"Uh, yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo burst into a laugh of glee, his mood lifted. He excitedly craned his head into the truck through the window and exclaimed, \"Well, son, let's get you cleaned up and dressed, not letting you see my boy looking like that. Follow me to the station, might have something that fits ya, and you can shower there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" David said staring blankly at the kangaroo, too stunned to refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo practically pranced back to his vehicle and drove in front of them. Tyler began to follow. That's when the awkward silence was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the FUCK, Tyler! BOYFRIEND?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Did you have a better idea?! Just hangin' loose, officer!\" the purple dragon said, halfway between a sneer and full-out laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to argue all the way to the station, their voices getting louder with each passing mile. When they finally arrived, Tyler parked on the street and turned to his still-fuming brother. \"Okay, you know the plan, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just say, 'Sorry, I change my mind, I can't stand to see him like this,'\" David grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, just don't screw up, and I'll drive us to the shop or something, okay? Just go!\" Tyler said, pushing his brother out the door. He looked as his brother got out and stood up, the blue drake's enormous frame finally given the space it needed to breathe. The dragon walked to the awaiting kangaroo, his gait forced into a bodybuilder's strut with all the mass he had on him. Tyler just slumped into his seat and gave a sigh of relief. He turned to look back out, his brother and the officer already inside. It was then he saw the strands and puddles of cum his brother had left behind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the station, David was just getting out of the shower, his body rid of the rank stench of his potent seed. Officer Fletcher held one paw over his own eyes and a gigantic pair of pants and a crisp white shirt out. David grabbed them from the kangaroo and slipped the pants on. As he started buttoning up his shirt, he realized that it wasn't going to work and decided to leave his impressive pecs and abs exposed. He gave an experimental flex, enjoying the feeling. He tapped the kangaroo's shoulder and said, \"Hey, Mr. Fletcher, it's kinda small, but it'll work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo lifted his hand from his face and took his first good look at the dragon. Standing at seven foot nine, the dragon was an inch shorter than the old Fang and impossibly built, an imposing figure to the six foot tall kangaroo, arms wasting away with a slight paunch as age took its toll on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho, when'd you get so big, son?\" the kangaroo joked, punching David in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh, look, Mr. Flet-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, David, call me Derek,\" the kangaroo chuckled and came in for a hug, \"You're practically family now.\" He pat the blue dragon on the back, and the dragon felt obliged to give a light pat back, his gaze looking away, praying to some higher power to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started to walk back out, David kept trying to tell the older man he had to go, but Derek kept going on about him and Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can't believe he got the courage to ask someone out! Or did you ask him? He's so shy when it comes to boys, not girls I'll tell you. Used to come in with a new one each week. You should have seen his face when he came out to me an' Dorothy. He paced about the house all avro, wasn't 'til dinner he came up sobbing. Said he still liked girls, said he'd marry a girl just for us. He's a good kid. You're a good kid, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just walked with the blabbering kangaroo, trying hard to drown out his words. But with each step, he felt something grow in the pit of his stomach. Here was this man, full of hope, and who was he to destroy that? Derek Fletcher was always that kind of dad that you hated to have when you were in high-school, the odd-ball father who must have been a hippie back in his day, the kind of father who was a Mr. Fix-it. The kind of dad you wanted as you got older, the one's who'd share a beer with you at your convocation. The kind of dad that could keep your secret and, in secret, encourage you to follow your dreams. Derek Fletcher was a good man. He could see where Marcus got his level-headedness and modesty. Could David really break this man's heart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when they exited the station, the cool night air brushing against his exposed scales, that David realized that that feeling in his gut was guilt. It wasn't just for what he was about to say, but also what he had said to Marcus. He turned to the older kangaroo and said, \"Hey, Mr. Fletch-- I mean Derek,...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The aging kangaroo evaluated David sceptically. \u201cNo, you were going to say something else.\u201d He insisted. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s heart raced as he ceased the unexpected opportunity. He had been prompted now; he could say it without being the bad guy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t see Marcus like this.\u201d He recited stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek grimaced, and laid a comforting hand on David\u2019s bare shoulder. \u201cDo you know what David? I feel the same way. Honest to God, I really do.\u201d He said with a shaking voice, his eyes moistening slightly as he looked up at David intently. \u201cBut it\u2019s happened, it\u2019s not something we can run from, so we gotta face it, Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s heart sank further than ever. He looked away from the kangaroo and almost vomited. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow you then.\u201d He said as he carefully moved outside the range of Derek\u2019s reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good kid David.\u201d The kangaroo said. \u201cAnd for what it\u2019s worth, I won\u2019t forget this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded softly and turned towards his brother\u2019s truck. Not another word, he pleaded of the kangaroo to himself. He couldn\u2019t handle another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused as he opened the truck\u2019s cold handle and looked inside. \u201cWhere\u2019s all the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cleaned it up.\u201d Tyler said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief burst of panic ran through David as he lent down to get a good look at his brother. His fears weren\u2019t realised as he immediately saw that he was the same size. Relief swept over him just as quickly, but his heart still pounded. He awkwardly tried to disguise the sudden movement as him simply entering the cabin. An effort aided by the fact that the action was indeed awkward.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt took him several attempts to angle his oversized frame into the space. Tyler waited patiently as David struggled to squeeze in, the seat loudly squeaking with every movement. When he was moderately comfortable, he closed the door behind him with more force than he intended. \u201cI can still smell it, though.\u201d He said with a modicum of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned the truck on. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going anywhere. I\u2019d better get used to it I suppose, because there\u2019s no resale left. I\u2019m stuck with this now.\u201d He looked at his brother expectantly. \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. Closing his eyes, he placed a claw on his face, and massaged his eye sockets with his fingers. \u201cThe hospital.\u201d He said with resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scoffed softly. \u201cYeah, you were in there for ages. I figured you\u2019d chickened out.\u201d Darkness enveloped the cabin as he pulled out of the police station, trailing the red taillights of Fletcher\u2019s cruiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want to see him.\u201d David moaned. \u201cEver again. Not after what he\u2019s done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave a nervous smile as he shrugged a single shoulder. \u201cWell, as sick as it sounds, maybe you\u2019ll be lucky and he\u2019s still unconscious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid suddenly put his hands down and pressed his head further into the roof as he failed to sit up straight. \u201cHe\u2019s unconscious?\u201d he asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake furrowed his brows. \u201cYeah dude, I told you Fang did a number on him. I told you he almost killed him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought it was a figure of speech! You didn\u2019t tell me he knocked him out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head incredulously. \u201cWhat, did you think I rushed him to the hospital after Fang gave him a nookie?\u201d he asked sarcastically. \u201cDavid, Fang really tore into him, and when he fell down he just kept kicking him. It was awful, I didn\u2019t call an ambulance because I was afraid it would take too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head in disbelief. \u201cWhat the fuck is with Fang?! Why would he do that shit? I mean, I understand why he would\u2026 do what he did to me, but why would he go so hard on Markus?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged. \u201cI donno. He just went crazy. He\u2019s a fucking sociopath. I guess he must have gotten jealous. Markus didn\u2019t provoke him much, he just told Fang not to follow you up to your room, to leave you alone. That was it. He just snapped.\u201d Tyler looked around as he approached an intersection. \u201cI had to get several people to help stuff him into the truck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grimaced as he reflected on the situation. \u201cWhy would his father pull us over if he\u2019s in such a bad state? You think he\u2019d head straight there, that\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d do if my son was hospitalised like that! \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cI donno David.\u201d His tone held a hint of frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t know the man. But something\u2019s not right with him. I mean, come on. Cops don\u2019t patrol by themselves at this time of night. My guess is that he was relieved from duty but couldn\u2019t bring himself to go. Maybe he dreaded it too much, or was in shock or denial or something. And as if he couldn\u2019t have been suspicious of us. You were going to visit the emergency ward naked when you just wouldn\u2019t help yourself and jacked off in the truck? I mean, it was better than your excuse, but come on. Fuck, we\u2019d both smell like a brewery and he didn\u2019t care. You didn\u2019t notice anything weird when you were with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pictured the kangaroo as he quickly relived their interaction. \u201cNot really. Maybe now that you mention it. I dunno, I\u2019m not good at picking up on shit like that, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drove in silence for a while. The night had long switched from very late to very early, and there was literally no one on the roads to stop them as they drove under sequential flashing yellow lights. David turned to his brother. \u201cHow did you know that Fletcher knew Markus was gay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler returned David\u2019s look quizzically. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just blurted out that I was his boyfriend as if he knew. But Marcus wasn\u2019t\u2026 he wasn\u2019t open with us, I had no idea he was gay. How did you know that his dad knew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyebrows rose as his lips curled slightly upwards. \u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t suspect anything? Are you serious? I barely have anything to do with him and I could tell something was up. You mean you\u2019ve showered naked with him and didn\u2019t even suspect anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d David sighed as he looked out of the passenger window at nothing. \u201cAs I said, I guess I\u2019m bad at picking up on that shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOblivious.\u201d Tyler offered. Another moment of silence followed before Tyler\u2019s musings ended it. \u201cIt must have been hard, to be gay and all, and try and keep that a secret. From the whole team and all his friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d David said swiftly and bluntly. \u201cI could have handled what I said better, but I still hate him. Nothing excuses what he did. I really don\u2019t want to see him, but\u2026 fucking hell, I have no choice. This is fucked.\u201d David rubbed his face in frustration before staring out of the window again. \u201cI want shit to stop happening tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother silence. \u201cHey David\u2026 \u201c Tyler cautiously probed. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 look, I\u2019m just gonna say something, and you can take it for what it\u2019s worth, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d David asked as he eyed his brother sceptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you remember how when Fang went up to your room, how Markus split his lip and he was bleeding?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed. \u201cWell, after he\u2026 grew\u2026 he didn\u2019t have a split lip, did he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid cocked his head as he remembered the wolf standing over him. \u201cHey, you know what? I think you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d He abruptly scowled. His gaze shot towards his brother, his retracted lips barring a generous amount of teeth, \u201cWhat the fuck are you getting at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I\u2019m just putting it out there.\u201d Tyler said defensively. \u201cBut you know, if Markus is in a serious condition and all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck off Tyler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m just saying \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL DON\u2019T!\u201d David roared into his brother\u2019s ears, causing Tyler to flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake sighed as they pulled into the hospital\u2019s parking lot. There were plenty of open spaces at this hour, and Tyler ended up parking across from Fletcher, close to the emergency ward entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait here.\u201d Tyler said as he cut off the trucks engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you won\u2019t!\u201d David snarled in surprise. \u201cYou fucking got me into this mess, you\u2019re coming in with me. I\u2019m not going out there alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler flailed his hands. \u201cI have no reason to go up there. David, he\u2019s not my friend! You chose to play the part dude, this has nothing to do with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snarled at his brother as he heard Derek\u2019s door close behind them. \u201cFuck you!\u201d he spat as he opened the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d A rather fat, unattractive cow asked as they approached the reception desk. Her words were amicable but her tone was anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek leant on the counter. \u201cYes, we\u2019re here to see Marcus Fletcher\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist tilted her head forward. \u201cThis is the emergency ward, immediate family only. What relation are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m his father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have identification?\u201d The cow raised a single eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek was taken aback \u201cI was his emergency contact!\u201d he said as his hand retrieved his wallet. \u201cYou called me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow maintained her expression as he slid his drivers license under the window. She gave a brief, sceptical look at it before returning it. She looked at David. \u201cAnd you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid recoiled. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m his\u2026\u201d his eyes darted between Derek and the receptionist. He didn\u2019t want to say it. He wanted Derek to do the introduction, but the roo was preoccupied with putting his license away. David sighed dejectedly. \u201cI\u2019m his boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow stared at him a moment before she gave a quick snicker. Derek whipped his muzzle in her direction, giving her a cold, sharp stare. But if the cow noticed it, she showed no sign of caring. \u201cYou are allowed a brief visit, but after that you have to wait in the designated area.\u201d Her stern gaze shifted between the two of them before she spontaneously shouted \u201cCARA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Derek and David filched as she screamed the name. And then they were dead to her. The cow turned her attention to some paperwork she had splayed out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a long moment before a much more attractive nurse appeared behind the cow. She was a young, thin cougher, and if David was in a more normal mindset, he would have come up with a few things to say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake them to C fifteen.\u201d The cow said without looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougher exited the reception booth and addressed the two visitors. \u201cOk, if you\u2019d care to follow me\u2026\u201d she said as she started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougher led them down a corridor into a large, open room that was partitioned by countless curtains. She parted one of them and ushered the two of them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside there was a single bed and a lot of machines. The sight stopped David\u2019s breath. The overgrown roo was barely recognisable as he lay still on the bed. His muzzle was buried in a ventilator mask, and the rest of his face was black, bloodied and swollen. A disturbing array of machines beeped and flashed, connected to the roo through a messy network of wires. He was wearing only his boxers, exposing his bruised body that barely fit on the large bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank God\u2026\u201d Derek breathed out relieved. It was in complete contrast to how David felt. He gave the old kangaroo a shocked look. Derek looked at the nurse as he pointed to Marcus. \u201cThat isn\u2019t my son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougher blinked in surprise \u201cUm\u2026\u201d she said as her eyes darted between the two kangaroos. She quickly retrieved the clipboard attached to the foot of the bed and hunted through sheets of paper. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the father of Marcus Fletcher?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek scowled. \u201cWhat? Yes, but that\u2019s not my son, what the hell is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid opened his mouth dumbstruck. The nurse held a similar expression \u201cUh\u2026 well, this isn\u2019t Marcus?\u201d she asked nervously.<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Derek snapped. \u201cMy son\u2019s only half the size of this man! You\u2019ve got the species right, but that\u2019s it! Where\u2019s Marcus?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realisation finally hit David. \u201cDerek\u2026\u201d he began awkwardly. Oh crap, he thought. This was going to take some explaining. How could he not have considered this earlier? \u201cThat is Marcus.\u201d He said carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Marcus. I know you have good reason to think it\u2019s not, and no, you aren\u2019t going crazy. But that\u2019s him. Honestly, it\u2019s him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek gave a quick evaluation of the injured roo in front of him before wrinkling his nose in distain. \u201cI know my own son when I see him! What\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDerek, please\u2026\u201d David began as he shot a quick glance at the confused cougher. \u201cI\u2019ll explain it in a minute. But please, I\u2019m asking you, please trust me for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek shook his head softly as he mouthed words that never eventuated, but he didn\u2019t argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 ah, ok.\u201d The nurse interrupted. \u201cIt um, it says here that he\u2019s still in a critical condition. He has some severe internal bruising, and potential brain injuries. Unfortunately, we won\u2019t be able to find out exactly where he stands until his condition has stabilised. But the doctors have evaluated his initial scans and acted on them. For now, there\u2019s nothing that can be done but wait. I can leave you here alone for a moment, but he won\u2019t be able to respond to you.\u201d She placed the clipboard back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek looked at the injured kangaroo with painful confusion. \u201cThose are Marcus\u2019s boxers\u2026\u201d he mumbled to himself. \u201cShit.\u201d He said, as if finally believing that it could be his son. \u201cWhere are all the doctors?! Shouldn\u2019t they be here looking after him?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougher made a placating gesture with her hands. \u201cSir, I can assure you that if anything was to happen here, one of those machines will go off and this whole bed will be swarmed by them. But for now, there\u2019s nothing more that can be done but wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek nodded softly as he studied Marcus\u2019 busted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d The nurse said as she parted the curtains to let herself out. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she left. David stepped forwards to stand across the bed from Derek. The kangaroo looked up at him. \u201cThis\u2026 David\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake bit his bottom lip. \u201cLook, this is going to sound absolutely crazy, ok? But you can see for yourself.\u201d He gestured to Marcus. \u201cYou go to our matches, don\u2019t you Derek? Well, you must have noticed that I\u2019m bigger than I should be, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek stared at the drake a moment before shaking his head and shrugging. \u201cTo be honest, I did think that, but you\u2019re a big guy David. It\u2019s hard to tell. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the party, there was\u2026\u201d David trailed off. He wasn\u2019t about to tell him that his cock dispensed magical growth potion, but he decided that given his recent success rate for making shit up, it would be best to skirt as close to the truth as possible. \u201cThere was a special drink. It made us bigger. Marcus had some, and that\u2019s why\u2026 he\u2019s over seven feet tall now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek shook his head, the look of distain returning. \u201cOh, what are you talking about David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s Marcus. I\u2019m being honest here; I wouldn\u2019t make shit like this up. Fuck man, I COULDN\u2019T make shit like this up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek looked at his son again. He contemplated in silence for several breaths. \u201cWhat was this drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit\u2019s\u2026 kind of like a drug?\u201d David asked more than told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek\u2019s eyebrows rose in alarm \u201cWhat, like steroids?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d David said reflexively. \u201cI mean, no, but maybe.\u201d He mumbled, realising to his dismay that it probably wasn\u2019t an entirely inaccurate comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it made you two bigger?\u201d The kangaroo asked, cocking his head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded. \u201cYeah, and Fang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn one night?\u201d Derek insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn less than a minute, actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo waved his hand dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. \u201cLook, I know it shouldn\u2019t be. But you can see for yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek studied his son for a long moment. The steady rhythm of medical beeps was the only thing to break the silence. \u201cWhat happened? Who did this to him? Were you there?\u201d His questions came out fast and with purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suddenness and tone caught David off guard. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t there, that\u2019s why my brother drove him here. But it was Fang who beat him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek\u2019s brows furrowed in confusion but his eyes were hard. \u201cGreggory Nathaniel? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think he had much of a reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid anyone see him do it?\u201d The kangaroo quickly followed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Tyler was there. So was just about everyone else at the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The last time I saw him was when the two of us fled our house from him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe chased you out of your house? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake looked at the floor. \u201cHe\u2026 look, it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t know where he is now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo David. It matters. Tell me.\u201d The kangaroo\u2019s voice was hard and his expression was stoic. David suddenly realised that he wasn\u2019t talking to Marcus\u2019 father anymore. He was talking to a police officer. And had been for some time. Oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was suddenly very nervous. His eyes darted everywhere but on the kangaroo. He scratched his neck. \u201cWell he choked Tyler and almost broke his neck, and he tied me up\u2026\u201d He trailed off obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek didn\u2019t need to be a veteran police officer to read him. \u201cYou\u2019re still withholding something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. He scowled in annoyance. \u201cThere was some\u2026 abuse involved, OK? He tied me up and abused me.\u201d He had to fight hard to supress a tear. He kept his eyes on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood in a terrible silence that seemed to drag. When Derek finally spoke again, his voice held far more empathy. \u201cOh David. Why didn\u2019t you say any of this earlier? None of this has been reported, has it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake shook his head softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek sighed before saying</span></div></div>",

Me an' Tyler were planning on going to the shop,\" David replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I thought you were coming to visit Marcus?\" the older kangaroo said with a hint of suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we visited Marcus,\" David corrected. His heart stopped for a moment, wondering if Derek had uncovered his ruse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind I said anything. I'm-I'm sorry, David,\" Derek said as he approached the blue dragon and pulled him into a friendly hug, \"It's just all very hard to understand. But, I'm glad you came. It's good to know someone cares for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid reciprocated the hug and hoped for the moment to end quickly. When the kangaroo pat his back and released, David had to fight hard not to let out a sigh of relief. Derek held out his hand and David shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, if you see Greggory, call me,\" Derek said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek clenched his hand, squeezing harder than he meant to and David just looked at the older kangaroo shaking. Derek seemed to calm down before letting go of David's hand and saying, \"Yes, of course, call the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that,\" David said softly and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could turn the corner, Derek called out to him, \"Oh, and David? I don't know what you and Tyler were doing in that truck... But stay out of trouble, I might not be there next time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid lowered his head in embarrassment and picked up his pace, not looking back at kangaroo. He made his way through the labyrinthine white halls, desperate to escape. He mulled over Derek's words, but couldn't think of anything suspicious like Tyler had thought. When he finally did make it out, he breathed deep, enjoying the crisp night air stinging its way down to his lungs, glad that the scent of antiseptic was long behind him. He glanced around at the empty parking lot. Empty? David began to panic, he saw Fletcher's cruiser near the entrance, but Tyler's truck was no where in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna kill...\" David trailed off. What if Tyler didn't get rid of his 'little' accident? What if he's off somewhere growing? What if Tyler was bigger than him? His mind went through a million scenarios, all which ended badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on the curb, his head hung down, his posture slouched over. He began to reflect on what had happened over the last 24 hours and tried to make sense of his now incredibly messed up life. He looked down at his crotch and cursed at it. He stayed there, slouched over cursing at everything screwed up; Fang and his sociopathic tendencies, Tyler trying to sneak a 'taste,' hell maybe he did. He continued to grovel for what seemed like hours, the cold air biting into his skin. He couldn't tell what time it was. He looked back at the hospital and cursed at Marcus. \"This all that queer's fault,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's?\" a light voice came from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned around and his eyes met the young cougar's from before. Her lithe frame was covered unattractively by her scrubs and a wool jacket, though David uncouthly undressed her in his head. He shook his head a little, snapping back to reality, looking back at her face, one of her eyebrows raised in a questioning expression. \"Uh, no one. Carrie, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cara,\" she corrected. She smiled sweetly and sat down on the curb beside David. \"You know, visiting hours are over, but I can sneak you back in to see your boyfriend if you want. I'm sure the father would like some company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, I'm good,\" David said, shuddering at the thought of having to spend time with Marcus and Derek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" she said quietly, holding out her paw and gently comforting his. She continued softly, \"Look, I know it can be tough seeing a loved one like that but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Cara, Marcus isn't a loved one,\" David interrupted. The cougar was taken aback, a surprised expression across her face. There was an awkward silence between them before he continued, \"He's not my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, wait a sec, bud,\" she said, her tone completely changed, \"What was <i>that</i> in there then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda told Mr. Fletcher I was Marcus' boyfriend because he was too scared to come alone,\" David lied. Not through his teeth, but a lie nonetheless. \"I didn't plan for it to get this far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer demeanor softened and she spoke, \"That's sweet of you.\" She flashed him a small smile and he gave her a toothy grin back. Unexpectedly, she punched him in the arm playfully, \"Dumb, but sweet.\" She sat back and yawned, tired from her long shift. David, acting like, well, David, took the opportunity to fake a yawn back, moving one meaty arm behind Cara for an good old-fashioned yawn-and-reach. He gave her a goofy smirk and she just rolled her eyes but let him keep his hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm David, by the way,\" he said smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" she said with a hint of annoyance. \"Think everyone on campus knows who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go to the university?\" David said surprised. \"Me too, I play football,\" he continued, bouncing his pecs for her to see, oblivious to the fact that she wasn't impressed. \"What's your major?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nursing, if you couldn't tell,\" she replied, disbelief in her voice that she could be sitting next to someone with so much air in his head. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, science... I think?\" he pondered, not sure what exactly he was doing at university other than playing football. He kept his cool however, and flashed her another toothy grin, showing off his handsome jaw, \"So, I'm not doing anything tonight, and you're not doing anything. Why don't we do something together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's late, David,\" she said, yawning again for emphasis. A car pulled up, the headlights beaming brightly in the ill-lit parking lot. David squinted, but could make out a skinny Dalmatian boy at the wheel, probably some starving-artist type. David hated starving-artist types. \"Oh look, there's my ride,\" she said with relief, prying David's ham-hock of an arm of her. \"You want a lift home? I'll tell my <i>boyfriend</i> to sit you at the back,\" she said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, I'm good,\" he said, even more embarrassed than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself, stud.\" David couldn't tell if it was a sneer or her just being playful. Given that he was such a fine specimen of blue hulking dragon, he rationed he had charmed her enough for it to be latter, or at least, that's what David always tells himself. The cougar climbed into the passenger seat of the car, kissed the dog on the cheek and they were off, the cat giving David a single wave as they passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbandoned, David was smoldering. That was, until he saw a familiar pair of headlights approach from the distance. The truck unmistakably Tyler's. The blue drake clenched his fists. He was going to give Tyler a piece of his mind, though he probably had more fist than mind to give. He geared up for a confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until he saw the truck pull up closer. In it he saw his brother Tyler, the purple drake,...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David\u2019s blood froze as he saw Tyler thought the windshield as he approached. And then a second later, it boiled with rage. The purple drake was filling the cabin. For a brief second, he almost believed that it simply wasn\u2019t Tyler. But as the truck pulled up in front of him, there was no mistaking the driver as being a much larger variant of his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a square jaw and furious eyes, David snapped open the driver\u2019s side door as soon as the truck stopped. Tyler looked up at his brother in confused surprise, his mouth gaping. David\u2019s snarl tightened as he looked over his brother\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was recognisable, if somewhat more angular as well as simply bigger, but his body was not. Ripped bulging muscles clung to his wider frame as if he had spent most of his teenage years in the gym with David. His shirt was tight and ripped in several places, every muscle group clearly defined as the fabric stretched taught across him. There was at least half a foot of exposed flesh between the bottom of the shirt and the top of his tight pants, which were themselves practically bursting at the seams and riding up his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled angrily as he reached into the car and grabbed at Tyler. \u201cHey!\u201d Tyler cried out in a voice that sounded completely foreign to David, but he was otherwise helpless to stop his bigger brother from practically throwing him onto the asphalt as he was ripped from the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stumbled forwards before regaining his balance, his footsteps thudding loudly as they landed. He turned back to face David, his face a mixture of confusion and anger. \u201cWhat the hell man?!\u201d he cried out loudly in a voice so deep and foreign that even his own eye\u2019s widened in surprise at the sound of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible for David to tell how tall his brother was as he stood in front of him, as his own point of reference was all messed up. But at a very rough estimate, Tyler had to be nearly seven foot. His purple head only came up to David\u2019s neck, but that was still a major step up from his \u2018normal\u2019 height around his sternum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou filthy fucking traitor!\u201d David yelled at his brother with guttural fury. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t drink that shit! You lied to me!\u201d he curled his hands into fists by his side as he advanced towards Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beefy purple drake backpedalled as he held his hands out to calm David. \u201cThis isn\u2019t yours!\u201d he cried urgently. \u201cDavid, this isn\u2019t yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the blue drake snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t yours! I told you I cleaned it up. I told you I couldn\u2019t bring myself to drink that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit, you\u2019re fucking huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Tyler said, a distant smile briefly formed on his snout before it was quickly wiped away. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t drink your\u2026 stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d David spat. \u201cHow the fuck did this happen then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave an uneasy smile. \u201cWell, you know\u2026 it was, kinda mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was wondering to myself, how the hell would your cum manage to make people grow. And that got me wondering if it could be\u2026 genetic? That perhaps it was something I could do too, like a family trait and all. So I\u2026you know, I tried it out. Just to see how it turned out.\u201d His smile returned in earnest as he gestured at his body. \u201cTada!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head in exasperation. \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not lying to me?\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes abruptly narrowed as he arched his back. \u201cBecause I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m not.\u201d He said indignantly before sneering. \u201cAnyway, do you remember me sucking your cock? Or have so many guys done that tonight you can\u2019t recall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes widened in shock as his brother's words cut him. How could Tyler say that to him?! A heartbeat later, David\u2019s face contoured into a fierce snarl as he leapt forward and lashed out at his brother. \u201cFuck you Tyler!\u201d he roared as he half pushed, half punched his brother in the chest, sending him flying backwards into the truck behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truck jolted behind Tyler\u2019s mass as he hit it, and as he regained his composure, David saw an unprecedented fury pass over him. Tyler\u2019s eyes glinted as if they were about to combust, his snout snarled fiercely, revealing rows of long, razor sharp teeth. His own claws curled into fists as his biceps flared, preparing to launch himself fearlessly back at David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue Drake wasn\u2019t physically intimidated by the display, his own stance was ready to take whatever his still smaller brother could dish out. But emotionally, it was frightening that Tyler looked at him like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a moment passed, and Tyler\u2019s fury quickly faded. His eyes softened and his breath slowed. The last of the tension faded when his eyes darted away from his brother. \u201cI\u2019m sorry David. I got angry and said something stupid again. I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d he mumbled guiltily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t change his stance. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to suck my Cock. You could have put it in a bottle when you \u2018cleaned\u2019 it, or something.\u201d He said flatly, looking squarely into his brother\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. This was mine.\u201d Tyler repeated, looking earnestly into his brother's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t know if he believed him or not. It was a possible story, and his brother appeared to be honest. But Tyler was also clever. He had enough time to come up with the excuse, and could play the part convincingly if he wanted to. When they were kids, the little purple drake would always manipulate any situation to reflect poorly on David. He wouldn\u2019t put it past Tyler to be lying to his face right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake shook his head in frustration. He had no way to find out either way. \u201cLet\u2019s just go then.\u201d He muttered dejectedly.<br>\r\nThe truck\u2019s suspension groaned as the two heavy drakes squeezed themselves back inside. Their shoulders touched for one moment as David leaned slightly inwards to shift his weight to the side.. He scowled. The cabin was getting crowded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was clearly on a high with his new stature. After all it was what he had always wanted. The impossible dream. But David couldn\u2019t feel happy for him. In fact, it was quite the opposite. He was resentful .It had taken the blue drake years of hard work to get the muscles Tyler now sported for free. In a way it wasn\u2019t fair. It was a balanced dynamic before - Tyler had his smarts and academia, and David had his body and athletics.  Now Tyler had both. Where did that leave him? Jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pouted softly. \u201cWhy the fuck did you take off?\u201d He demanded petulantly to Tyler as they started to drive off. \u201cYou said you would wait for me, why did you leave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a guard\u2026\u201d Tyler replied, pausing to look around the vacant car park. \u201c\u2026Somewhere. And the parking lot is well lit, and the truck is surrounded by windows. Guards can see through windows in good light.\u201d He said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where did you go?\u201d David asked, still coming to terms with his brother\u2019s new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust around the corner. Where it was dark. Then I went to a gas station and cleaned up after the mess.\u201d Tyler shot David a knowing look as he shrugged. \u201cThere was a lot of mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t argue. The proof was in the smell. He rolled down his window as they pulled onto the street.<br>\r\n\u201cHow was the hospital?\u201d Tyler asked to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. \u201cTerrifying. But over.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to elaborate any further. Suddenly, he seemed to realise that they were heading in the opposite direction to when they came. \u201cWhere are we going now? Home?\u201d He looked at Tyler.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s only got a foot on you now, and I\u2019ve got a ton of new muscle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich you don\u2019t know how to use.\u201d David immediately retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tyler demanded, taking offense to the accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was pushing you around in the parking lot like you were still five feet.\u201d David said flatly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019ve never been in a fight before, and you\u2019ve only had that body for a few minutes, even if you had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve been in plenty of fights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting beaten up doesn\u2019t count as being in a fight Tyler. What are you gonna do when Fang starts using his teeth? Think about it man. This is serious stakes; this isn\u2019t a high school scrap. We\u2019re not fighting him. End of discussion\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave an annoyed grunt, but didn\u2019t soften his expression. \u201cAlright, what do we do if he is still at home then?\u201d he challenged hsi brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe run away and call the police.\u201d David said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave David a micking grin. \u201cReally man? That doesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d He goaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger flashed over David. \u201cWell nothing you\u2019ve said since we left the fucking hospital has sounded like you!\u201d he all but yelled at Tyler. He could never have imagined that one day he would have to talk his brother out of fighting Fang. Perhaps the purple drake had more testosterone in his system than he was used to. David sighed heavily. \u201cOne of us has to be the voice of reason.\u201d he mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted some payback is all.\u201d Tyler said defensively. \"Not just for tonight, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re being stupid.\u201d David replied  bluntly. The big blue drake may not have every light switched on in his head, but he knew that Tyler was blindly stumbling into his domain. There was no way the two of them could overpower Fang, and even if they could, it would come at a terrible cost. The wolf was the type who would likely fight to the death. Fang had already done more than enough tonight to get some serious jail time. It just wasn't worth Tyler getting hurt over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey David\u2026\u201d Tyler began in his cautious tone, alerting David that he was about to say something that he was going to hate. The blue drake closed his eyes as he braced for impact. \u201cWe could easily beat him up if we were bigger though, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groaned, burying his face in his palms. That\u2019s all he needed tonight. More shit getting out of control. \u201cNo, Tyler!\u201d He said firmly. \u201cGet that thought out of your head. It\u2019s not worth it. Would you seriously alter your body permanently just to win a fight with Fang?\u201d he asked his brother slightly despairingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frightening thing was, he honestly didn\u2019t know what his brother\u2019s answer would be anymore. He seemed barely recognisable. He unconsciously held his breath as Tyler looked at him stoically, as if considering the question. Suddenly, the purple drake started chuckling. \u201cWow, you really are the voice of reason here.\u201d He said with a hint of amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cGood, that\u2019s the sane answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them took the rest of the journey home in silence. David nervously eyed his brother\u2019s smile, which didn\u2019t seem to fade. It didn\u2019t help when more of his tortured shirt loudly ripped as he turned the wheel at an intersection. <br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take too long before the two of them found them parked out on the curb in front of their house. The lights were still on, and the door was still opened from when they left about an hour or so ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019s still in there?\u201d Tyler asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d David said, somewhat irritably. \u201cI can\u2019t see through walls either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cLook, he either is, or he isn\u2019t, right? If he isn\u2019t, then we have nothing to worry about and can go back to bed. If he is, then he might be waiting in ambush. If he jumps us, then I still say we can take him.\u201d Tyler said confidently to his brother, his newly meaty chest flaring out somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d David scolded Tyler. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this. If Fang is still there, and he ambushes us, then I want you to run back into the truck and call the police.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What about you?\u201d Tyler asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged. \u201cWith any luck, I\u2019ll be right behind you, and we\u2019ll run away again. Like we did the last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cNo, Last time we had the jump on him. If he ambushes us\u2026 that won\u2019t work this time around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake grimaced. He should have known that Tyler would analyse his plan and point out the holes he was trying to hide. \u201cLook, He only wants me, Tyler.\u201d David said. \u201cHe can\u2019t stop both of us, and he\u2019ll be after me. If I don\u2019t get back in the truck, then just drive. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, except you.\u201d Tyler said snarkily. \u201cThis is a shit plan David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet ME worry about me Tyler.\u201d David tried to reason. \u201cFang isn\u2019t going to hurt me badly. That\u2019s not going to help his cause any, is it? If you just get out of the area and call the cops, then they will come and stop it. Nothing\u2019s going to happen to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at his brother seriously. \u201cDavid, something\u2019s going to happen to you. You know something\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake sighed as he looked away. \u201cI told you to let ME worry about that Tyler. Just do as I say, and things will work out, OK?\u201d his tone was authoritative, signalling the end of the discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Tyler said reluctantly as the two of them exited the truck and made their way towards the open door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David squeezed his way in through the doorframe, careful not to make any loud noises or sudden movements. Tyler followed suit, not used to having to contorting his body like that. The purple dragon stumbled a bit, the floorboards underneath groaning with the sudden shift in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, Tyler!\" David whispered. He glared icily at his brother, the purple dragon looking back bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took his eyes off Tyler and scanned the mess around him. The light in foyer/living room was still on, illuminating the remnants of what looked like a rager. Cups were strewn across the place wantonly, empty bottles of liquor lined the kitchen counter, and most notably, the area around the couches had been demolished, evidence of Marcus and Fang's scuffle earlier. When he rounded the corner, the hallway was dark. He looked at Tyler and the purple drake nodded knowingly. The two beefy dragons made their way to David's quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid held his breath as he opened the door to his room. He winced at the agonizing creaking sound the door made. The room was dark and Tyler tried to peer over David's shoulder to look inside. The blue drake heard a shuffle inside and quickly felt his hand moving for the light switch. He braced himself for a sudden impact just in case. When the light flicked on, he jumped at the sight in front of him. Lying on the bed tied up was a vixen, a long streak of pink in her hair. Her eyes were wide open in fear and she muffled as she tried to scream, but her muzzle was tied shut with the same rope that was used to pin David earlier. The girl closed her legs and began to weep, her exposed body covered in pearly liquid slowly liquidizing and seeping into her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess?\" David said worriedly and made his way to her side. Tyler came in after, trading confused glances with the fox before he too made his way up to help untangle the poor vixen. David managed to untie the gag around Jessica's mouth, taking the sock that had been stuffed down her throat out. She gasped for air, finally able to breathe properly and she began to weep in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has Alli,\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid glared at Tyler, the purple drake having problems untying one of leg restraints. \"I thought you said you got everyone out!\" he hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stopped working on the tight knot, looked up, and growled back, \"Me too!\" He clawed at the bed in his frustration, his chest heaving as he vented his rising anger. He didn't know there were still people inside. He was angry at himself, but more importantly, he was furious at Fang. To think he could do something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not his fault,\" Jessica blurted out, snapping both the dragons out of their dazes, \"Me an' Alli locked ourselves in the bathroom. I was spilling my guts when we heard some sort of fight go down. Alli said, 'Don't worry about it.' So we just stayed in there.\" She began tugging at the ropes on her arms and David got the message. Tyler had managed to free one leg and was working on the other. As the two brothers worked to get her free, she continued, \"Everything went quiet, but I still wasn't feeling well. I was in the middle of hurling when there was this loud scream, it was almost inhuman. Alli turned off the lights and hid us in the shower. Next thing you know, the door's busted down and this huge black wolf ripped the curtains away. And... I don't know, there was screaming and kicking. Next thing you know, I'm here on this bed and he... he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Jess, we're here,\" David said trying to comfort her, though his voice had the hint of his growing rage. He managed to get one arm untied and went around to get the other, Tyler just looking on as he had already finished getting her legs undone. Jessica sat up and let her feet touch the ground, thankful for not being completely bound. David was bent over trying to get the last of the restraints undone when Tyler sat down beside the vixen, his large hand touching her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" she asked quizzically, the face before her looking so familiar, yet so different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler put a hand behind his head, the muscles in his arm bulging out as he did, the sleeve bursting open. \"Uh, Jessica, it's me, Tyler,\" he said sheepishly, \"You come into my shop with that t-rex girl, Alli was it? You're always with her when she comes to buy comics and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny Ty?\" she blurted out incredulously. \"No...\" She took a closer look, the handsome face of the purple drake looking back, a soft smile on his face as he blushed underneath his scales. It was him. She looked down at the blue dragon untying her hand, his muscles shifting as he worked. \"Okay, what's going on here, you're no longer tiny, and you, you're definitely bigger, and Fa-\" She stopped speaking and her eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the doorway was the largest wolf in town, the glint of his golden eyes gave away his malevolent intent. \"Well, well, well,\" he sneered, forcing his way into the room. He loomed over the three of them, his chest heaving and his dick bobbing. It looked recently spent, which meant Jessica's greatest fears had been realized. \"I see someone snuck a taste, or three,\" he snarled at Tyler. Tyler bunched his hands into fists and lunged at the colossal wolf. Fang just took the blow and flung Tyler into the far wall, the impact sending debris tumbling from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn haste, David took a sharp claw and snapped the rope holding Jessica down. The fox looked up at him and saw his mouth moving, \"Get Tyler and run.\" She nodded as she saw David stand up. The drake bowled into the wolf. He was definitely faster than his brother, and managed to knock the behemoth into the wall, creating just enough of an opening for Jessica to scamper towards Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pat Tyler on the cheek with desperation. The dragon didn't respond, so she slapped him hard. Tyler groggily came to. \"Uh, wha' happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" she said hurriedly, tugging at his meaty arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I have to help,\" Tyler replied defiantly, pulling his arm free of her's. He looked at his brother, a blur of blue and black as the two animals fought, snarled, roared and spat at each other in display of dominance. He balled his hands into fists again, ready for action, when he felt a sting in his cheek. Jessica had slapped him again, her teeth bared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit, Tyler! Whatever made you big, made you stupid too?\" she yelled. She pulled at his arm again and he obeyed, stunned by her display. They made their way of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snarled in rage. His prey had gotten away and he was furious. He turned to the blue dragon he had pinned to the wall, the drake's muzzle curled into a twisted smirk. He'd have to teach David a lesson. The wolf brought his fist to smiling drake's face. If anyone asked, he'd say David walked into his fist five, six, no, seven times. The dragon's blood was spilling out of his mouth, the damage near irreparable. \"Like that Davey? Thought you could suck yourself off and challenge the Fang?\" he sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang threw the defeated dragon to the floor face up, the large sack of meat bumping into the bed, sandwiched between it and the wall. The tyrant knocked the wind out of David by stomping on his abdomen, the drake giving a wet wheeze as dry air and his blood mixed in mouth. Fang knelt down, he knee crushing David's torso and brought one hand to the drake's neck while the other one tore at the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could only whimper as he felt Fang violate him again. His body no longer responded to his inputs. This was it. Fang was going to become truly unstoppable. He left a powerful grip wrap around his now exposed crotch and felt the shame well up as he felt himself getting pumped by the monster on top of him. Soon, his cock was erect, the sensation purely mechanical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You proud of yourself, Greg?\" David spat, not caring what Fang did to him anymore. Nothing could be worse that what the wolf was doing to him now. \"Proud to suck this cock?\" The wolf bared his teeth and leered at David's beaten face, globs of spittle landing on the dragon's muzzle. \"Heh, proud of what you did to Jess and Annie?\" David caught himself forgetting the t-rex's name, but the effect it had on Fang was the same. Fang squeezed at the drake's neck harder, making David cough and wheeze for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do what I want. I'm a god, you punk!\" the wolf roared. As David's eyes began to water from the lack of oxygen, Fang grinned, an evil sneer twisting his visage. Up and down went the wolf's paw, having to cover more dick than the big bad wolf remembered. David's pre sputtered out in torrents, the thick liquid painting the floor and Fang's powerful arm. Fang continued to use David, the drake trying hard to stave off his growing pleasure. He was on the verge of release when a loud noise came from outside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If David could breathe, he would have groaned. Despite the change in Tyler's voice, there was no mistaking it was him. What the hell was he doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang ignored the sound as he continued to work David\u2019s slick cock with his massive paw, his grip tight and his movements fast. David was getting close. He tried to deny his orgasm, but it was an impossible task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was was studying him, trying to read how close he was. David couldn't stop himself from cuming, but he could mask it for as long as possible. He put on his best poker face as his heart pounded furiously. He tried to keep every muscle in his body absolutely still, not giving the wolf any indication that he was crossing the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by fate, movements on the stairs further distracted Fang in that moment. His golden eyes widened as felt David\u2019s cock convulse as he came, but he had no prior warning. At once, David\u2019s whole body spasmed as he could no longer contain it. He ejaculated a hard load into air, the strand landing on his torso, stretching from his abdomen to his clavicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf growled in surprise, and instantly snapped his jaws around David\u2019s cock. The wolf\u2019s muzzle was warm and wet, and with his grip loosening, David couldn\u2019t help but whimper as the wolf sucked each subsequent load hungrily, grunting as he swallowed as much as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s body writhed as his orgasm finished, his pelvis instinctively thrusting in into the wolf\u2019s muzzle. But while he couldn\u2019t control his body, his mind was still working. In one movement, he pried a hand free and quickly scrapped it up his torso, collecting as much spilt cum into his palm as he could, before shoving it into his bloody snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnarling, Fang popped David\u2019s cock out of his mouth and struck him again, the blow landing on the side of his head. David saw a flash of white, and watched the room spin around him. He could feel the wolf\u2019s massive tongue lap up over his torso, recovering every last drop of what David had left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smiled as he picked himself up. The blue drake felt the cum in his stomach begin to numb his pain, a warm sense of calm spreading out over his body. His cock sparked to life again, and he eagerly started stroking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Tyler appeared in the doorway. Fang looked at him and giggled delightedly as he began masturbating. Even David had to smile. His brother looked so shiny, his purple scales almost seemed to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes shifted between David and Fang. Both were masturbating, and both were growing. Snarling, he charged into the wolf. Fang was easily twice his size, but he was in no mindset fight. He simply laughed as Tyler made contact, stumbling backwards as the drake pushed him towards the far wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gasped in wonder at the spectacle. The wolf left a smoky trail behind him as the purple drake shone all the colours in the world. It looked like a rainbow chasing away a storm. As the two approached the far wall, Tyler leant down to the wolf\u2019s knees and lifted him up and backwards, slamming him down into the wall. The plaster and weatherboard was no match for their combined weight and momentum, and the two were soon falling into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed as the two forms exploded into bees. The walls shifted around and, turning into a brilliant blue sky over a field of endless colours. He was flying, he realised. He was a bee too. It was marvellous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand wasn\u2019t beating his cock anymore. The jerking movements were simply his wings as he flew through the morning air, surrounded in an orgasmic aura. The various hues below him were flowers, he realised. He approached them eagerly. They cried out to him. They wanted him to pollinate them. He laughed giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed on a scarlet flower. The wavy stigma felt fluffy under him. He stated fucking it eagerly, breathing heavily as he did so. The flower cried out with him, and it\u2019s hue shifted into yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried out as he came, filling the flower with his seed. He injected his load over and over again, until it felt like his very organs had been ejaculated out of him. The flower thanked him. He cried with joy. He was spent, he was dying again. He laughed out as the world grew dark and cold, and the brilliant colours faded into black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up!\u201d  He eventually heard his brother hiss at him. David felt confused and weak as his eyes fluttered open. He whined softly as he saw Tyler looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he mumbled lazily as he tried to ground himself, the demented trip was still fresh in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, we have to go, we have to get out of here!\u201d Tyler said as he shook his brother\u2019s head roughly, his claws digging uncomfortably into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d David said numbly as his senses began to return. \u201cWhere are the girls?\u201d he asked as he groggily sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone, I untied Ali and I gave Jess the truck. We have to go now David, before he wakes up!\u201d he said as he tried to lift David up. The blue drake accepted the help as best as he could, stumbling his weight awkwardly as he rose. His muscles felt like jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leant heavily onto the wall as he stood. The plaster behind him creaked as his naked scales scraped across it. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back\u201d he said, looking at his brother. He looked shorter again. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call the police?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did!\u201d Tyler cried defensively. \u201cThey said all their units were busy, and they didn\u2019t know how long it would take for someone to show up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at Tyler for a moment. He suddenly realised that he felt terrific \u2013 there was no sign of Fang\u2019s beating anywhere on his body. He looked around the room. On the wall beside him, he saw a long, ropey mess he must have made when he was fucking the flower. The volume was incredible. The roof which rose just inches above his head, the tip of his snout lightly brushing the plaster as he looked up at it. Next to the window, there was a large hole in the wall that lead outside. He sighed and looked back down at Tyler.  \u201cYou still shouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head angrily. \u201cLook, let\u2019s talk about this once WE\u2019RE SOMEWHERE ELSE!\u201d he shouted as he grabbed David\u2019s hand, and started leading the lumbering blue drake out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait Tyler.\u201d David said as he ripped his arm free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the purple drake shouted impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to stay here.\u201d  He said firmly. \u201cIf this is where the cops are coming, then this is where it has to end. Otherwise Fang will just try and find us, or he\u2019ll start roaming the streets doing god knows what to god knows who.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stared at him incredulously. \u201cDavid, who knows when they will get here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d David said as he slowly shook his head.  \u201cAt least they\u2019re coming. At least no one else will get hurt.\u201d He looked down at Tyler. \u201cYou have to go. Quickly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhy are you bearing all of this on your shoulders?\u201d Tyler demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged. \u201cBecause I\u2019m the only one who can.\u201d He said, a feeble smile forming on his snout. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me Tyler, I\u2019m strong enough for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler folded his thick hands across his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a fucking copyright on taking a stand David, if you aren\u2019t leaving then neither am I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed irritably. \u201cTyler, that\u2019s stupid. I can\u2019t protect you from Fang anymore, you have to go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scoffed up at his brother. \u201cI\u2019m not a fucking princess David, and we aren\u2019t kids anymore. It\u2019s not up to you to protect me. I\u2019m not leaving you here alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snarled. \u201cTyler, there\u2019s nothing you can do to help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said that before I threw him through the wall too. And helped you get away the first time. Stop underestimating me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groaned loudly as he rubbed his forehead. \u201cTyler, you aren\u2019t a help. You\u2019re the opposite. You being here makes it worse.\u201d He said flatly. \u201cFang will either use you to blackmail me, or just get rid of you. Like he did with Marcus. He can\u2019t hurt me like that, he needs me. But he doesn\u2019t need you. You\u2019re nothing to him. And you\u2019re gonna get seriously hurt. You have to go. NOW.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked up at him with hard eyes and a clenched jaw, but his mind was working in place of his mouth. David knew his brother, and that this meant he was about to reluctantly concede.  But before Tyler could speak as much, a deep voice came from outside thought the hole in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should listen to your brother Tyler.\u201d Fang rumbled into the room, startling the two drakes. His impossibly large head was staring up at them, his unseen body apparently taller than the ground floor. His golden eyes were firmly on Tyler, open wide with an intense, feral viciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile widened as he turned towards David, flashing his enormous canines. \u201cDavid, hows about we make a nice little deal. You come on out here now without any fuss, and I won\u2019t kill your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave the wolf a long, hard stare before breathing heavily. \u201cFine.\u201d He spat at the wolf. He turned to his brother, scowling . \u201cJust go Tyler.\u201d He said angrily. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything. Deal with it.\u201d He turned around and left the room, arching his enormous frame under the doorway. Fang gave loud, deep chuckle as he walked away from the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was alone. He felt like shit. If David had a vocabulary, be would have called him a hindrance. And he was right. He wanted to help, but he was worse than useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned an eye on the sticky load that was slowly soaking into the wall behind him. There was an awful lot of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David stormed his way out of the house, not caring about property damage anymore now that his home was already wrecked. He took a small solace in the feeling of the brick and mortar crumbling around his frame on his way out. The lumbering wolf appeared around the corner, a wicked grin on his face as he rumbled deeply. The height difference was more than evident now as they stood on the same ground. Fang was simply enormous, towering easily over the blue dragon, muscles bristling, crowding each other for space, stretching the behemoth's hide taut. The beast had to at least be ten feet tall, a two feet advantage on David, the drake only coming up to the wolf's pectoral halfway, not to mention Fang was impossibly wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you could make it,\" Fang sneered, his lips curling viciously. The animal went to place his paw on David's shoulder. The dragon swatted the massive hand away in defiance. In retaliation, Fang clawed at David's face. David glared at the wolf, and pressed a hand to his stinging cheek, the gash spilling his fresh blood. \"You goin' back on your word, Davey?\" the wolf snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Said I'd come down without a fight, didn't promise anything once I got down,\" David spat back. The blue dragon put up a show. He may be... slow, but he knew Fang better than anyone. If there was one thing the wolf liked to do, it was pick a fight. It wasn't the smartest of plans, but it was a surefire way to make sure Fang wouldn't budge from the house until the cops came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can take this?\" Fang boomed, moving his arms into a double bicep pose, his inhuman frame bulging all over the place, the system of veins grotesquely visible through his fur. It was true, David couldn't hope to match Fang's prowess, not without another boost. The dragon looked at his half-erect penis and shook his head, trying to focus on distracting Fang. While Fang admired his own body, David took the opportunity to bolt. The wolf snapped out of his daze near instantaneously and chased his mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid ran to the backyard, avoiding the debris from Fang's fall. The wolf was in hot pursuit, crashing into David, the two tumbling a short distance. There were no more words exchanged between the two, just roars and snarls as they fought. Fang was focused on restraining this time, careful not to break the dragon's body before he broke the spirit. David struggled with all his might, his efforts barely able to budge the wolf. Fang pinned David effortlessly, the dragon thrashing violently for his freedom, but there was none to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel that? You're helpless, David. I own you. You. Are. Mine,\" Fang cackled maniacally, a wild glint in his eyes. The wolf let out a satisfied rumble, his thick cock pushing out of his sheathe, aroused by his own power. David looked on in horror and gave it one last go. The drake mustered up his strength and pushed hard. It didn't do much to the wolf, but it was enough to create an opening. The dragon rolled over and clawed his way to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood up and lowered his center of balance, ready for a fight. Fang rumbled in annoyance, but humored the dragon, he too stood up, rolled his vast shoulders and cracked his neck a couple of times, before glaring wickedly at David. The wolf casually walked up to the drake, his gait cocksure. David backed up a bit, knowing that whatever he was about to pull would be futile and probably was going to hurt... a lot. Still, David eventually stood his ground, taking a gulp of air as he saw the blackness surround him. Fang picked up speed and quickly punched David in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was sent sprawling, the impact knocking the wind out of him. He was right - it definitely did hurt. The wolf approached him slowly but surely. As David tried to pick himself up, Fang kicked him, the wolf's powerful leg knocking around the dragon like a rag-doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid lay face up on the grass, wheezing for air. His body wanted mercy, but his mind was made up. Before he could get up though, Fang loomed over him, rubbing a massive heel into the dragon's sternum. The sharp pain froze David in place and once more he was helpless. There was something terribly wrong with the way Fang was looking at him, the way the wolf was rubbing his enormous, yet still growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang?\" the dragon sputtered, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf licked his chops and grunted as a large spurt of his wolf-spunk spilled out onto David's neck and face. Fang began to massage his loins. David watched in horror and tried to move. However, Fang reacted by dropping onto the drake and straddling him by the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, don't do this!\" David said, his voice full of fear. Fang just smirked, just the reaction he was looking for. If he couldn't train his new bitch complacency through depriving freedom, he'd breed obedience into the dragon, literally. \"I'm not a fag,\" David whimpered, shaking his head violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you can't fucking stop me,\" Fang cooed, the words dripping with malevolence, \"I told you, you're mine. You're gonna be my little bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Fang tore David a new one, shoving his massive prick into David's ass. David cried out in pain and tears began to well up in his eyes. This what not what he had planned for, not at all. He looked at Fang, the monster was biting his lip as he continued to hump, enjoying the sensation of friction. Without lubrication, David was in a world of pain and he gasped, cried, and whined as Fang violated him, the pained noises only spurring the beast on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity for David, each thrust into his nethers broke his spirit more. He was about to submit when an eerie noise echoed through the air. Coming from the opening in the destroyed second floor was an unnaturally low moan. Both Fang and David froze, their eyes gazing back to the house. David couldn't make anything out, the darkness obscuring his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a sharp snap, the upper floor giving way to something and a loud thud thundered from the house, brick and wood sloughing off the house's frame, debris sent flying everywhere. The dragon and wolf continued to stare at the house, waiting for something to happen. Secretly, David was hoping it wasn't Tyler, hoping that it was just from the damage from the fight earlier. Though, he didn't quite connect the dots with the low moan. On the other hand, Fang was rearing for a fight, wanting to test his superior strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust began to settle, it was kicked up again. David went wide-eyed as a figure emerged from the cloud of dust. Fang too, was taken aback, not expecting to see what he saw. Tyler strutted out from the house, the purple dragon's hands were balled into fists. He rolled his shoulders forward with each step, trying to be intimidating. His face was twisted into a determined scowl. David almost didn't recognize Tyler's face, his brother's visage more angular, jaw squarer and brow more serious. Even less recognizable was his body, the purple dragon was enormous, possibly as large as Fang, maybe bigger. Tyler's muscles bulged with raw power and looked like they were nearly popping out of his hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from him,\" the new Tyler rumbled, his voice deep and commanding, so sure of his new-found power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang dislodged his member from David, eliciting a thankful moan from the blue dragon. The wolf's hackles were raised, his signature fangs bared. Fang was sizing up his competition, preparing for an alpha-brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two behemoths squared off, it became obvious that Tyler was larger, if not by much, maybe a couple inches at the most. Fang pushed Tyler, the purple dragon growled deeply as he took a step back from the force, but otherwise stayed his ground. The large dragon pushed back hard, sending Fang more than just a step back. Tyler snickered, enjoying the fact that he was the stronger of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler let loose a feral roar as he rushed forward,...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler lunged towards Fang, slamming his shoulder into the wolf's chest. In the same movement, he wrapped his thick arms around around him. Fang knew how to take a tackle. He stepped backwards to absorb the drake's momentum as he pivoted his body on contact, keeping his hands free. From that position he would have been able to take Tyler's balance and pry him free. But while the wolf was used to breaking through tackles, he wasn\u2019t used to the tackler being bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened in alarm as his feet lost touch with the ground, the drake lifting him backwards. The next moment, he was falling. Snarling, he quickly rotated his body in the air. He continued to shift his momentum as he slammed his side into the ground with incredible force, the topsoil around him flying into the night air as he compressed a small crater into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the momentum of the tackle and his own rotation, he rolled over, bring himself to his feet again in a smooth motion. Tyler looked up at him and snarled viciously, launching himself up at the wolf again before either had fully recovered their balance. This time, Fang was able to take the hit, and pivoting his body, he threw the larger weight of the drake around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler did not let go, however, and after a few steps he recovered his balance, and began using his own mass to throw the wolf around. Fang let out a feral bark as he felt the drake beginning to overpower him, responding by lashing out at Tyler\u2019s shoulder with his jaw, his long sharp teeth piercing the drake\u2019s purple scales as they sunk into his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler roared in agony as the wolf violently shook his head as he bit down hard. Tyler almost instinctively retaliated by snapping out at one of Fang\u2019s paws, his own set of sharp teeth sinking deep into the wolf's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang gave out a sickening yelp as he released his maws from Tyler\u2019s shoulder. The purple drake seized the moment to force the wolf backwards, sending him slamming into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first story brick wall cracked behind the wolf as he landed, puffs of lose mortar shoot out the seams as the entire wall depressed slightly inward. Fang stumbled forward again, lose chunks of shattered clay raining down behind him as he quickly regained his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants breathed heavily as they sized each other up again. Tyler's injured shoulder sagged limply by his side, whereas Fang made no show of injury as his hand bled freely. David groaned in panic as he watched on. Tyler should have kept the wolf close, he had used his extra mass to his advantage. But now Fang knew better. He wasn't going to let the drake wrestle him again. His stance was low and wide, ready to strike out at his brother with precision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast, Tyler stood awkwardly, his stance wide, but his feet weren\u2019t placed strategically. He held his fists vaguely upwards, his torso slightly bent. He looked like a ridiculously oversized nerd pretending to be in a martial art film. He had no idea how to fight. The wolf saw all this for himself. He smiled viciously as he licked his bloodied lips, just waiting for Tyler to do something stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to pick himself up. If he was going to be of any use, now was the time for him to step in. But as his body failed him as he lost his balance and fell again. He was battered and bruised, and the intense pain that he felt in his ass seemed to stem out over his whole pelvis, weakening his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could only watch on as his brother made his move. Stepping forward, Tyler swung his fist is a wide, slow arc as he lunged towards Fang. The wolf easily dodged the haymaker, and quickly planted a quick, powerful jab into his exposed abdomen. The contact caused a loud slap to echo through the still night, knocking the wind out of Tyler. The massive purple drake impulsively bowed over, and his head lowered, it met with the top of Fang\u2019s knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could only gasp as the brutal contact sent his brother lurching backwards. Fang was unmerciful, his movement fluid as he advanced, taking full advantage of Tyler\u2019s stunned imbalance. With the entire momentum of his hulking body, he slammed his elbow into the side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler made an ugly half moaning, half gurgling noise as he crumpled onto the grass with a deep thud, the earth giving way under his tremendous form. The black wolf breathed down on Tyler as the drake writhed slightly in a daze.  It was over. He began to chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he asked in mocked disbelief. \u201cYou throw one girly punch and hit the ground?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grunted as he sucked air hungrily into his oversized frame, his torso flaring with each breath. \u201cDon\u2019t you stupid fucking dragons get it?\u201d he spat, casting a fleeting glance over at David. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how big you make yourselves. You\u2019ll always be my bitch.\u201d He started rubbing his sheath with his uninjured paw. His pink cock poked his head out, and his fingers turned their attention on it. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to teach you both a lesson.\u201d He rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped forward, and looming over Tyler, slammed a gigantic black foot down on his chest. Tyler exhaled violently as the air was knocked out of him. \u201cNo!\u201d David shouted helplessly as the wolf started stroking his enlarging member over Tyler, the oversized pink rod rapidly engorging ominously in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked up at the wolf as he played with himself. He was dazed, but not debilitated. The way the wolf splayed his stance over him, his feet spread wide, exposing the his swinging oversized testicles. Was he serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one quick, fluid motion, Tyler arched one of his powerful feet, and lifted a foot into the air, slamming into Fang\u2019s groin with a sickeningly loud slap. The wolf lifted his 1500 pound body into the air as he made a\u2026 noise. It wasn\u2019t a cry, or a yelp, but more of a sharp, violent rush of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled backwards off Tyler, his feet fighting to keep his weight, but slowly his torso drifted lower until he finally fell to his knees. He doubled over, his hands clasping his damaged nuts in his hands as his whines became audible, his breaths short and sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed out in disbelief. Fang had no idea that was coming. Only someone who didn\u2019t know how to fight would think about pulling that move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler picked himself up ominously, and slowly advanced towards the kneeling wolf. David silently urged Tyler to throw an elbow at the wolf's head. But while the purple drake didn't know how to throw an elbow, he shared his brother\u2019s instincts. Curling his hand into a fist, Tyler struck the wolf in the side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang whined as he hit the ground stunned. Tyler kept advancing, and sticking his knee out, dropped his mass heavily down on the wolf\u2019s torso. The contact sounded like a hollow thud as the wind was knocked out of the wolf. He groggily lifted his claws up at the mass of purple drake that bore down on him, but was unable to do anything useful with them before Tyler slammed his fist down on his head with a loud crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf flinched at the contact as his head was knocked onto the grass behind him. Tyler lifted his arm up and struck him again, his purple arm striking the wolf\u2019s head into the dirt like a pile driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler!\u201d David cried out to his brother as his fist rose into the air again. \u201cTyler, stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive purple drake held his hand steady as he turned to look at him \u201cWhat?!\u201d He demanded in a loud, deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake lifted up a hand in a 'stop' gesture, his fingers splayed and stretched. He slowly curled them into a fist. \u201cKeep your thumb on the outside of your fingers. Otherwise you\u2019ll brake it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stared at him a moment before looking at his own fist. The wolf stirred below him. \u201cLike this?\u201d he asked David after he pulled his thumb free, letting it rest on the outside of his curled fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d David said and he slowly hauled himself to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked back down on the wolf, and slammed his new fist down on his bloodied head. He gave a sharp laugh. \u201cHey, you\u2019re right, that does feel much better. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward, positioning his snout just inches away from Fang\u2019s. The wolf\u2019s eyes were distant, but he still moved feebly, his stunned mind still trying to get free.\u201cWhat was that about showing me I\u2019m you bitch Fang?\u201d Tyler asked with a vicious, arrogant grin. \u201cI guess we have different styles. When you want to show your dominance, you slam your dick in their ass. I prefer to slam my fist into their face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he struck the wolf again, his curled fist a purple blur as it cracked wetly on the wolf\u2019s face. \u201cDo you like that Fang? Do you\u2026\u201d he struck the wolf again, raining a fresh blow with each punctuated word. \u201cLike. Being. My. Fucking. BITCH?\u201d he shouted the last word as his fist finally came to a rest. The wolf was still underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid limped over to stand next to the giants. \u201cI think he\u2019s subdued now.\u201d he said, resting a hand on the purple drake\u2019s uninjured shoulder. Tyler panted heavily as he looked at the wolf below him. It was hard to believe it was Fang. That he had just beaten him up, put him in his place. All the years of torment he had pent up inside of him, the helpless frustration. His breathed heavily as adrenalin flowed through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s blood froze as Tyler looked up at him. The drake\u2019s eyes were wide and hungry, his tongue licked the length of his snout, his teeth flashing behind his maniacal grin. Even if his face hadn\u2019t physically changed from the growth, he still wouldn\u2019t have looked like his brother. In that moment, he looked like Fang.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why don\u2019t we give Fang a taste of his own medicine?\" Tyler asked. David couldn't help but feel that the question was rhetorical. His suspicions were confirmed when Tyler began to stroke his prodigious length with a twisted sneer on his face as he eyed the butchered wolf. Fang's eyes flitted between the purple dragon and David, his gaze was panicked, almost pleading. The wolf made a sound, close to a whimper, but mixed with a hack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, don't,\" David pleaded to his now bigger brother, appealing to reason now that he couldn't use force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler whipped his head to look at David, his gaze was almost blank, as if he wasn't fully there, lost in his growing arousal. When Tyler finally snapped to, he grinned wide and furrowed his brow. \"You can't stop me. Nobody can,\" he said darkly as he turned back to look at the defenseless wolf, the yellow of the wolf's eyes trembling, but the body remained locked under Tyler's bulk. Tyler reveled in it, Fang's fear. After all these years of being the dumb jock's punching bag, after being punched, stomped on, beaten and broken both physically and emotionally; Tiny Ty's comeuppance was well deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, the police will be here any moment,\" David hissed. The way his big little brother's lips curled further at the statement sent a shiver down David's spine. Tyler's body was jerking, as if holding in his laughter. David grew more worried and backed off from his brother, the way Tyler was conducting himself scared the blue drake. \"If -if you... He'll grow if you do, Tyler,\" David added weakly, his voice uncertain now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn't look up at David as he began to laugh, his cackling boomed in the night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied,\" David said almost under his breath, disbelief that his own flesh and blood could betray him like that. Tyler glanced up, a wicked grin showcasing his bloodied fangs. The massive purple dragon began to stand up. Fang tried weakly to make a move as he did, but Tyler kicked him, almost too easily, in the chest, the wolf crumpling back on the ground. David winced as he watched Tyler's foot come down onto Fang's chest, a sickening crack rang through the air as Tyler splintered the wolf's ribcage. Fang let out a pained yowl. The wolf couldn't even bring his arms up to defend himself anymore. He was breathing laboriously, any more from Tyler and the dragon would probably kill Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler approached, he was so confident, no, not confident - arrogant. He lifted his chin high, the same cheeky, demented grin plastered to his face, the wild glint still in his eyes, his dick bobbing carelessly. \"So what if I did, David,\" he said smoothly, a velvety deep rumble coming out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied to me!\" David roared, his anger rising. The blue drake balled his fists, reason caving into raw indignation. He charged at his colossal brother, but Tyler was ready. The larger dragon copied what Fang had done earlier, lowering his gait, preparing for a counter-attack. David saw this, but he knew his brother wasn't a prize-winner of a fighter. But even then, to David's surprise Tyler didn't move as he swung at the larger dragon's abdomen. When the blow connected, the force generated a sharp thud - a well placed straight. The purple behemoth barely moved, only bending a bit. An annoyed grunt from Tyler and the stinging in his hand were the only signs to David that he had actually landed the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all you got, bro?\" Tyler bellowed, sounding more and more like Fang. He brought his thick arm down and grabbed David by the neck, effortlessly raising his older brother off the ground. Tyler rumbled deeply and grinned as he toyed with David. \"You're so small, David. I wonder how hard I have to squeeze to break your neck?\" With that, Tyler's grip tightened, closing off David's airway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler kept holding David off the ground and squeezing, drunk on his power. David felt his consciousness begin to slip. The blue drake struggled at first, but even he knew his place, or perhaps knew his time. If this is how he went, then he wanted no regrets. He whimpered hoarsely, \"I'm sorry, Tyler.\" Then, the world around him grew darker and he blacked out, not sure if he'd ever wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's words snapped Tyler out of his drunken stupor. The massive drake looked at the lifeless body of his brother in his grasp. His eyes went wide and he dropped David, the mass of blue dragon crumpling awkwardly to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?\" Tyler said weakly. He bent over David's limp body, kneeling into the dirt. He began to slap David's cheek gently, trying to bring his brother back to life. His motions became more frantic, hitting David's cheek harder and harder as he failed to wake the blue drake. \"No,\" he whimpered. He brought his fingers to David's neck, trying to find a pulse. Tyler let out a cry in frustration, unsure if he could feel anything, the padding on his fingers so thick his sense of touch was shot, not even able to feel the texture of David's scales. \"No, no, no,\" Tyler whined, his eyes beginning to tear, his voice cracking. He bent back down, trying to hear if David was breathing. Tyler was scared. Scared because he had no fucking clue what he was doing. Last he heard, Magic: the Gathering wasn't exactly high contact enough for first aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was trying to detect a hint of David breathing, he was looking directly at Fang lying on the ground. The wolf was trying to pick himself up. Tyler began to panic, still no sign of life from David, as he watched Fang get up onto his elbows, coughing and spitting out blood from his maw and returned the stare at Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave up in trying to resuscitate David, first he had to protect him from Fang. Tyler bolted upright as Fang began to stand up feebly. As Fang limped his way over to the two dragons, he was too busy looking at the sorry state of David to notice Tyler standing up, the drake's fangs bared. Still, he wolf continued to stumble forward, one arm holding his chest as he heaved loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?\" was all the big wolf could say. Tyler's harsh stance softened a bit when he heard Fang's words. Was that a hint of worry coming out of the wolf's mouth? The wolf looked at Tyler, his jaw slack, more shocked than anything. \"You killed him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Tyler retorted. He wouldn't have. He couldn't. Could he? He glanced at the wolf drawing nearer, he stomped the ground to make his mark. \"Stay back,\" he said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang raised his arms in front of him defensively. \"Woah, I know CPR. You want my help or not?\" Tyler was stunned, he looked directly at Fang's face, the wolf's expression seemed genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help?\" Tyler said incredulously. Then, realization hit the purple drake. His brow furrowed, he knew he was being played. \"Like you helped Marcus?\" he growled. His voice grew louder, \"Or Jessica? Or Allison?\" By the time he got to, \"Or how about the time you 'helped' rape my brother?!\" he was yelling at the top of his lungs. He looked at the wolf with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you did any better, Tyler,\" Fang said lowly, his voice more tender than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it!\" Tyler bellowed. He tried to put on a facade, show Fang that he was strong. But the heaving in his chest as the tears started rolling down gave away his weakness. Tyler began to openly weep, falling to his knees. \"Why are you trying to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone thinks I'm the bad guy,\" the wolf said to himself. He bent down over David, stumbling as the pain in his chest mounted. He leaned over and listened for breathing and checked for a pulse. He cursed under his breath. \"He's alive, but not breathing,\" he said softly. He brought his mouth to David's, pinched the nose and began to insufflate. After just a few short breaths, he had to get up and cough, the sound was watery, as if fluid was filling his lungs. \"You have to do it, Tyler,\" he groaned, exhausted from the effort, he fell down and lay on his side, holding his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stepped up to the plate. He copied what Fang had done, and attempted to breathe life back into his brother. As he continued, Fang started to talk, \"You know that Shakespeare guy? The one you had to read in high school? Goes around killing everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stopped for a second and looked up at Fang, cocking an eyebrow. Was Fang trying to quote Shakespeare, let alone remember something from high school? \"Macbeth?\" Tyler blurted, louder than he expected. Wait, why was he even talking to this guy? He went back to resuscitating David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang fell onto his back and stared up into the blackness of space. \"Yeah, that one. That's me,\" he chuckled loosely, hacking again as the blood filled his lungs. In a hushed tone he continued, \"I wanted that power, and when Marcus tried to stop me, I... I got mad, I don't even know why. I didn't mean to almost kill him.\" The wolf was holding onto his head, trying to sort out his thoughts. \"And when everyone looked at me like that, like I'm some sort of monster... What was I supposed to do? Be a pussy? Say, 'I'm sorry?' I've never apologized for anything,\" he said, bringing his hands over his eyes. \"I'm not good with these feelings things. Everyone expects me to be the douchebag, so I play the part... And when I got that power, it felt so good. I could beat anyone I wanted, fuck anyone I wanted. I fucking loved it...\" He trailed off with a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stopped again for a second. \"Yeah, I know what you mean,\" he said with a chuckle, not believing he could be bonding with Fang of all people. He looked back down and to his surprise, he could see David's chest rising and falling slowly. \"He's breathing!\" he blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, good job, bud,\" Fang said weakly, \"But, the truth of the matter is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler stared at the wolf for a moment. \u201cOh\u2026 no.\u201d he said, shaking his head slowly. Then, he scowled. \u201cNo! You\u2019re not touching him!\u201d he spat at the wolf, hunching further over his brother as if to shield him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang gave a weak chuckle. It quickly degenerated into a violent and bloody coughing fit, his face contoured in pain as every movement caused him agony. He slowly sat back up, sliding himself backwards to rest his back against the house. Once he was done coughing, he cleared his throat by loudly hocking and spitting a mouthful of blood. \u201cWhatever you say, Tyler.\u201d He said with complete resignation. He closed his eyes and rested his head against the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re the one in control now.\u201d He said softly, his breaths short and sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s words were anything but empowering to the purple drake. The truth was, he used to be in control, but then he quickly lost it. He threw it away. He was powerless to undo his own mistakes. Fang was dying, and they both knew it. Is that why he opened up? Were those the thoughts he wanted to leave the world with, the tragic confession of what lied behind the evil wolf? He had wanted to break the wolf. And now the wolf sat broken, waiting for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his brother, panic seeping in to his core again. \u201cDavid, wake up!\u201d he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid coughed as he breathed heavily, but his eyes remained closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, Please.\u201d Tyler pleaded, holding his brother\u2019s cheeks in his hand. Tears were streaming down his face. He needed his brother. He shook him again. \u201cPlease wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyelids stirred as he stared blankly into space, taking a while for him to find anything to focus on. He was shaking. He felt so cold. He had thought he was dying, and the blackness had closed in on him. It was terrifying. His heart still raced, his breath was still short. His body felt like it had slept for years. He focused on his brother in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler started sobbing as his brother looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry David.\u201d He cried, barely able to control his own breath. He leaned in and hugged him tightly as he bawled uncontrollably. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d He eventually managed to wail. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I fucked up, I\u2019ve fucked everything up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down Tyler.\u201d David said feebly, slowly raising a shaking hand to pat his oversized brother on the back. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine, it gonna be ok.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head \u201cNo\u2026\u201d he said as he pulled himself away from David. \u201cNo it isn\u2019t. Fang\u2019s dying, David. And it\u2019s my fault.\u201d<br>\r\nThe blue drake looked around as he lay on the grass. His eye caught the wolf as he sat against the house, his head rolled forwards, and his limbs curled tightly in his body. Blood was leaking out of his massive mouth, and his short, pained breaths rattled sickeningly into the night. He turned back to his brother, who\u2019s tears were raining down on him. \u201cNo.\u201d he told him firmly, lifting a hand to his face.  \u201cTyler, it\u2019s not your fault. You did what you had to, alright? Fang brought it on himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake bit his bottom lip and shook his head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t have to kill him. And I can\u2019t do anything to stop it. David, you have to save him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, leaving his hand on his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler breathed in heavily. \u201cYou have to grow him, he\u2019ll heal if you grow him.\u201d He pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid lowered his hand, his expression blank as he tried to read his brother. \u201cYou have got to be joking.\u201d He said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes became more desperate. \u201cHe\u2019s bleeding badly David. I collapsed his chest cavity. It\u2019s the only thing that can save his life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sneered in disgust. \u201cAnd it will also make him even bigger! Have you even thought this through?! You want to make him unstoppable again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head wildly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that David. He won\u2019t do anything, I know he won\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn\u2019t help but laugh in disbelief. He found nothing funny about his brother\u2019s comments, but it seemed a natural reaction to the insanity he was speaking. \u201cHow the fuck can you say THAT?\u201d he demanded angrily, his eyes hard and dangerous. \u201cAfter everything he\u2019s done tonight, how the FUCK can you say that?! Tyler, get off me!\u201d He pressed a weak hand up against Tyler\u2019s chest, the action was more of a gesture than a show of force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn\u2019t budge. \u201cDavid, he saved you, he saved your life. You were dying and I didn\u2019t know how to bring you back, and Fang showed me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked hard into his brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo then call an ambulance.\u201d He said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid look at him!\u201d Tyler pleaded. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough time for...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI owe that cunt NOTHING!\u201d David roared with as much strength as he could muster, interrupting his brother\u2019s pleas, and sending him recoiling. The two drakes looked at each other, only the sound of the wolf\u2019s death rattles piercing the silence. Tyler began to break down again under his brother\u2019s fierce glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what about me?\u201d he asked David, tears flowing down from his enormous eyes in a torrent.  \u201cIf Fang dies, then I killed him! That\u2019s at least manslaughter, I\u2019ll go to jail for decades!\u201d his voice trembled as he spoke, his words spluttering out of him in a blabbering torrent. \u201cDavid, I don\u2019t want to go to jail! I\u2019ve fucked up. I\u2019ve fucked up badly David, and shits gotten out of my control and there\u2019s nothing I can do to fix it. I know I\u2019ve done nothing to deserve it, and that it\u2019s not fair for me to ask you, but please David. Please! I\u2019ve done something stupid and I NEED your help.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David stared deep into the purple drake\u2019s eyes. That was where he saw Tyler. Behind the hulking mass of muscle, and the almost unrecognisably angular face, was his brother. The same five foot little drake he grew up with. Who he had shared a life time arguing, fighting, playing and getting into trouble with. The same Drake who he had always looked out for. Who now more than ever needed his big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes and sighed. Suddenly, all the aggression, the lies and the betrayals his brother had borne against him seemed to melt away. \u201cAlright.\u201d David said reluctantly, but reassuringly. \u201cCalm down Tyler.\u201d He said as he picked himself up. \u201cI said everything would be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler hugged him again, apparently unaware of how much extra strength he commanded as David felt his bones compress. \u201cThank you, David.\u201d He sobbed into his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll owe you this forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to tell Tyler that he was hurting him, but he couldn\u2019t breathe. By the time the purple drake released him, there was no point. He just stared at his brother and nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed as he turned to the wolf. Fang\u2019s head sagged forwards as he sat against the house, his limbs weak and lifeless as his short breaths wheezed out of his bleeding muzzle. His hulking frame still looked imposing. David half expected the wolf to jump up at him again in any moment, as if he was just waiting for him to walk into his trap. But as he approached, David saw the wolf for what he really was \u2013 broken and helpless. Dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slapped Fang on the cheek. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d he demanded flatly. The wolf gave no response. He pried one of Fang\u2019s eyes open with his fingers, but the large golden orb stared back at nothing, lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang convulsed again, another spurt of blood leaking out of his mouth as he coughed weakly. In spite of himself, David took pity on the wolf in that moment. He sneered in disgust, at himself as much as Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not responding.\u201d He said to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to try something!\u201d his brother cried back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groaned in frustration. How was he supposed to get anything down the wolf\u2019s throat while he was unconsciously hacking up blood? Scowling, he closed his eyes as his he placed a hand on his cock. He idly stroked the flaccid length, but there was little stirring in his loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be the least erotic situation he could think of. The mood was terrible, he felt obligated, not eager. The hulking bloody wolf that wheezed in front of him was a scene from a nightmare, not a wet dream. And his brother watched on intently, unconsciously biting his hand as he emanated tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Tyler, this really isn\u2019t doing anything for me.\u201d David said gruffly as he stopped jerking his dick. \u201cDon\u2019t stand there staring at me. Go around the corner or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake blushed \u201cSorry.\u201d He mumbled. He hurried off around the side of the house, the ground shaking slightly with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed and closed his eyes again, his hand stoking his cock again. He tried to think of something sexy. He imagined Jess, her tongue massaging his head, lapping it hungrily from all angles. He thought about how good it felt when she popped his head in and out of her mouth, her petite hand stroking the shaft as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock responded in his hands, the meat expanding in his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about how his hands flowed up her hips as he straddled her, filling her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock stood erect as his hand sild up and down its length, slick pre lubricating his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started grunting as he thought about how she would cry out as he drove his shaft deeper and deeper into her, until his balls were slapping against her soft fur, the sound of their bodies crashing together as they sped up, thrusting harder and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could feel his orgasm approaching. He opened his eyes and looked at the wolf sitting below him. With his spare hand, he tried to pry open the wolf\u2019s jaw as he continued to work his shaft with the other. Instinctively, Fang fought against the action, his jaw clamping shut. David scowled and bit his bottom lip as he felt himself crossing the threshold. With all of his strength, he forced the wolf\u2019s jaw down, and plunged his thick cock into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid cried out as he felt his head bury itself in the wolf\u2019s warm, wet mouth. With both hands, he grabbed Fang behind the ears and pushed the wolf\u2019s head roughly into his pelvis as he felt his balls clench. He thrust his pelvis forwards, and felt his head delve deep into the wolf\u2019s tight throat as he came. \u201cFuck!\u201d David cried as he injected his first load directly down it. Instinctively, the drake pumped his hips and the wolf\u2019s head in opposition as he slammed several more loads into Fang in a similar manner, the wolf\u2019s gag and couching reflexes convulsing around his head as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final lurch, David\u2019s muscles tensed as he shoved the wolf\u2019s snout hard into his pelvic bone, his head buried as deeply as it physically could. He held the position until he felt the last of his seed spill out, and breathing heavily, stepped back, his cock sliding back out into the cold night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the wolf. Part of him wondered what the hell he had just done, while the rest of him waited with baited breath. Fang wasn\u2019t breathing anymore, he noticed. It seemed that the brief but forceful choking session had been enough to put an end to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed. His heart raced as the wolf sat still. For the first time, David began to worry that it might not work. But as that through began to grow in his mind, he saw a weak smile curl up the wolf\u2019s face. Fang coughed sharply again, blood spurting out of his nose and mouth, as his whole body began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s relief was rather short lived, however, as he watched the wolf start to grow. Inch by inch, his ears slid further up the wall. His broad black chest expanded as he coughed unevenly, hocking up the remaining blood in his lungs. Between his convulsions, Fang was giggling. His eyes opened distantly, lazily staring at the sliver of pink flesh that spilt out from his sheath. The wall behind him groaned as he pressed his weight up against it, splaying his expanding feet out wide as he brought both of his hands down to grasp at his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rubbed his face with his hands. The good news was that it worked. The bad news was much the same. Fang\u2019s frame hungrily expanded into new space, his bulging muscles fighting with each other as they flowed ever outwards in all directions. The wolf laughed in delight as he worked his enormous stiff shaft eagerly with both hands, his paws slick with the pre that spilt out freely like a hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrick by brick the wolf\u2019s head rose as his torso expanded higher. Fang began to grunt as his smiling mouth opened wide, his tongue lolling and salivating as he loudly panted. His cock grew in his hands as each pump crashed down loudly. The wolf whined out loudly as he approached orgasm, his feet scraping across the ground as his body tensed, finally releasing the load that had been building in his expanding balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came in long, thick unbroken ropes that shot into the sky and landed on the ground and fence across the yard. Over and over again, he spurted his seed hard and far, each time the wolf cried out and jerked his body violently. David lost count after the sixth load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finally finished, the wolf sighed heavily. His hands flopped limply to his side, resting his enormous frame fully against the wall. He breathed deeply and contentedly, his tongue lolling from his smiling muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn\u2019t help but think that Fang looked completely innocent in that moment. The wolf looked happy, playful. It was impossible to think that it was Fang that lurked behind that face. But he knew that it was. And as he stared at the wolf, a full two feet taller than ever, it was hard for him to feel any sort of relief that he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid heard Tyler awkwardly approach him around the corner. He turned to face him. The purple drake was breathing heavily, staring wide-eyed at the gigantic limp of black wolf that rested so placidly against their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes were nervous as he looked at David, who said<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, I think you have a lot of explaining to do now,\" David said, staring daggers at his brother. The blue dragon tried his best to hold his anger in check, bottling his emotions. He was determined to give his brother a chance. The least Tyler could give him was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Tyler trailed off, the purple titan avoiding eye contact and crossed one arm to hold his elbow and bit his lip. David rolled his eyes; Tyler could pull the bashful look when he was smaller, but at his new size he looked extremely awkward. \"Where do I start?\" Tyler said softly, looking down expectantly at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about how you lied about your own little 'gift?'\" David snarled. The blue drake felt his lips curling into a disgusted frown, the thought of his own brother drinking his cum. It was bad enough that Marcus and Fang had a taste of him, but Tyler? Tyler was being awfully quiet, the purple drake absentmindedly playing with his arms, feeling over his muscles, trying to distract himself enough to not answer the question. \"Tyler? Answer me!\" David commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to get big so bad, David,\" Tyler said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the blue drake said, not sure of what he heard, cocking his head slightly to the side in a condescending gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, I wanted to be big okay?!\" Tyler blurted, his fists clenched, his eyes closed. The purple behemoth was visibly shaking, trying to hold himself together. He looked down and held his stomach, just remembering what he had done to get this far, to get this body - it sickened him. He continued grimly, \"You don't know what it's like being small.\" Tyler opened a hand then balled it into a fist, feeling the immense power stored in his muscle. \"You don't know what it's like being weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I know what it's like to feel small, Tyler. I've lived under Fang's shadow ever since high school,\" David rumbled. His patience was growing thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't!\" Tyler said louder, his tone more direct as he shook his head. \"It wasn't just people looking down at me. It's you and your friends, you all looked down <i>on</i> me, like you're all better than me.\" Tyler was gushing now, all the things he bottled to himself spilling forth. \"Even you, my own brother. You always looked down on me. Like I'm some sort of embarrassment to the family because I was so small,\" Tyler accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought that?\" David asked incredulously. He didn't realize Tyler thought so lowly of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah?\" Tyler said, softer now, not sure of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I didn't think my teasing had that effect on you,\" David replied softly, a little ashamed that he may have been the root of Tyler's darker side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers stood in silence for a moment, neither looking at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the girls?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't lie about that,\" Tyler replied flatly. Again, the silence that grew between them was stifling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler,\" David said emptily, not looking at his brother, \"Why did you lie about calling the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I thought we could take Fang on-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not what I'm asking,\" David interjected, almost hissing. \"Why did you lie about the cops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you wouldn't let me help you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't let you,\" David snarled, interrupting Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your problem, David! You never let me help you!\" Tyler roared, striking his fists down at air. The two brother's eyes met, each with a fierceness in their eyes that the other didn't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang. Would've. Killed. YOU,\" the blue dragon roared back, his words seething through his fangs. \"You lied to me about the cops. I could've sacrificed myself for NOTHING! How could you do that to me?\" At this point, David was no longer trying to mask his wrath. If he could wrack his brain for something to describe his feelings right now, he'd say he was disappointed. Disappointed in every sense of the word - he felt cheated, betrayed and most of all frustratingly sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was taken aback by his smaller brother's words. David had made the responsible decision, and Tyler had placed him terrible jeopardy. Tyler meekly replied, \"I wanted to protect you, David. I just wanted you to be proud of me.\" Tyler suddenly broke down, bringing his huge arms to his face, streams cascading down from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt his ire dissolve for his brother. No matter what size, his little brother had always been a crybaby. He walked up to Tyler and opened his arms. Tyler responded by pulling David into a bearhug and sobbing into his shoulder. David coughed a bit for air and Tyler loosened his grip a bit, muttering a wimpy, \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid held the back of Tyler's neck and stroked gently, a gesture their mother used to do to calm the little purple dragon when he was upset. David cooed, \"Shh. Shh. I'm here, Tyler. It'll be okay.\" The big purple drake sniffled and rocked their embrace back and forth, for once glad he had a brother like David. He began to giggle, the sound nasally from his crying. Here he was, probably the largest dragon to ever live, acting like a big baby; somehow, he found it funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, David,\" Tyler said, relief in his voice. He pushed gently at David and held him at arms length, smiling softly down at his older brother. David returned the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am proud of you, Tyler,\" David chortled, bringing a hand up to his brother's cheek and pinching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, David, stop!\" Tyler giggled. His smile faded and his gaze grew distant. He said softly, \"Why would you be proud of me? I tricked you into getting me huge and nearly killed you and Fang.\" David looked at Tyler's face as it began to contort again, the big lug on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey. Don't cry, big man,\" David said, rubbing his thumb underneath one of Tyler's eyes. He had said he was proud of Tyler, though he didn't know why, it was just something he blurted out. So when he spoke next, he let whatever came to his mind out, \"You screwed up big time, Tyler. But, at the end, you did the right thing. I know a lot of other guys who would've ran from their mistakes. You didn't. That's why I'm proud of you, bro.\" David smiled, partly because in his mind he pat himself on the back for coming up with something like that, but even more so because he knew he wasn't lying. Tyler's eyes lit up, the bigger dragon finally getting what he so desperately craved, not size or power, but recognition from his big brother, the guy he's looked up to his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the brotherly bonding was cut short by a deep mumbling. Both David and Tyler let go of their embrace and stared at the awakening wolf sitting by their former home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf came to, he yawned and smacked his tongue against the roof of his maw; a strange taste in his mouth, a mix of iron and something familiar. He looked around groggily, not really acknowledging that he was conscious just yet, the world around him one big blur. Was he dead? he thought. He didn't feel dead, the cold night air biting into his wet nose. He moved an arm, the massive muscles crowding each other as he did. Woah, he was never this big before. His heartbeat quickened as he marveled at his new-found strength. He felt strong, stronger than ever. His eyes began to focus, the blurs sharpening. Two dragons, both colossal, the smaller one blue and much larger one purple kept their distance. Fang realized he was alive, a grin forming on his face, one without a sneer or smirk, but a genuine, honest smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sat there, looking over himself, amazed at how huge he had become. The two dragons cautiously approached the gigantic wolf. Fang saw this in his periphery and instinct made him look up. He felt something grow in the pit of his stomach. A feeling he knew he shouldn't be feeling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wolf\u2019s heart started racing as soon as he saw David. It was a Pavlovian reaction. His loins flashed hot, his stomach churned lustfully. He wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly picked himself up, testing his newfound size and muscles as he rose higher and higher in front of the drakes. He stood twelve feet tall once he was fully erect. He stretched his body out in all directions, his joints cracking noisily as his body adjusted once again to his new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang began to chuckle, but paused to clear his throat. He was about to spit out the collection of fluid he hocked up into his mouth, but as he tasted it, he quickly swallowed it. His eyes went wide in delighted surprise as he felt the familiar warmth spread out from his stomach, causing him to let out a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giddily fell back on the wall as his muscles trembled underneath him, the contact relatively soft but still enough for the wall to crack and compress further inwards. His eyes glazed over as colorful noise clouded his vision, but ultimately didn't escalate further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid swallowed as the wolf inched higher yet again, his black pelt scraping noisily against the rough bricks it was forced against. Fang grunted his breaths as his chest flared out further than ever before, his joints creaking under the mountains of flesh that hugged them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sheath expanded as the tip of his manhood spilled out. Underneath, his enlarging balls drifted lower as his pelvis lifted higher. His tail slapped loudly against his thick thighs and the brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was over, Fang had added close to another six inches. \u201cHaha, excuse me. \u201c He laughed. \u201cI still had a little left over in my mouth. And throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drakes simply stared at the wolf with wide eyes as he tested his muscles out again, flexing his arm and fingers, feeling the restrained power within them. \u201cMy my David, you were generous in your portions weren\u2019t you?\u201d he chucked as he traced a hand over his mountainous pectorals. More of his cock spilled up out of his sheath, the weight beginning to weigh it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI needed to make sure of it.\u201d David said cautiously, unsure on how to take the wolf. \u201cYou were pretty much dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you brought me back, hey?\u201d Fang asked, an arrogant smirk creeping up his muzzle as he looked all the way down at David. \u201cWhy is that? Did you miss me? Are you ready for more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled at the wolf\u2019s words. His back arched as his hands curled into fists unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would Macbeth do if he got a second chance?\u201d Tyler asked up at Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s head turned to the beefy purple drake in surprise, as if he had already forgotten that he was there. His muzzle curled up in an amused smile as he decided to humour the drake. \u201cWell, If I were Macbeth...\u201d he said, gathering his thoughts  \u201cI\u2019d have learned a few lessons. I\u2019d do a better job second time around.\u201d He cast a discerning glance up and down the drake, a cocksure smirk plastered on his face. \u201cFirst off, I wouldn\u2019t let my bitch hassle me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe revelled in how the drake\u2019s face dropped. As if he suddenly knew how much shit he was in. \u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Tyler asked in dismay. \u201dNothing\u2019s changed, after what happened, and what you said? How can you go back to this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s sneer crept further up his muzzle, changing from arrogant to sinister. \u201cI told you Tyler. I\u2019m Macbeth. I want the power. I\u2019m the big bad wolf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Fang, you don\u2019t have to play the bad wolf anymore.\u201d Tyler pleaded desperately, already taking a step backwards even though Fang simply stood his ground. The wolf\u2019s cock pressed further out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage.\u201d Fang said quietly, as if to himself. \u201cAll the men merely play their parts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed. \u201cI think I was wrong when I said he wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d He said nervously to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s scowl hardened. \u201cI knew that as soon as you said it.\u201d He said flatly. The entire conversation had sailed over his head, but he had easily gathered the gist of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang turned his attention back to David. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked, taking half a step forward. David didn\u2019t budge. \u201cWe have a good dynamic going on here, don\u2019t we? You want your cock sucked, and I\u2019ll take your money. Win-Win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you Fang!\u201d David spat, his teeth flashing in the night. \u201cI\u2019ll never give into you.\u201d His words were unwavering, but his body longed to quake in fear. David stood over eight feet tall. But Fang was simply monstrous. Relatively, David was the same height to Fang now as what Tyler was yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on David.\u201d Fang rolled his eyes exaggeratedly.  \u201cLook, I get it. You like it rough. But this is getting ridiculous. Just look at you, there\u2019s just no challenge in it. This just isn\u2019t fun for me anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen that makes two of us.\u201d David snarled through barred teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sighed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like me David? I\u2019ve got the muscle, I\u2019ve got the size. You didn\u2019t mind too much when Marcus had a go. And you had no issue with letting your own brother have more than a few sucks. So what\u2019s wrong with me? Am I just too much for you David? Is that it, do you prefer being on top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like you because I\u2019m not a fucking fag!\u201d David shouted, taking a step forward. The wolf\u2019s semi pulsed just inches from his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Yeah, sorry I forgot about that bit.\u201d The wolf laughed with genuine amusement. He lifted his massive arms to cover his ears as he closed his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home! there\u2019s no place like home!\u201d He chanted mockingly. He smiled down on David. \u201cEven a pair of magic red shoes aint gonna make that one true David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, while the reference sailed over David\u2019s head, he had caught the insinuation. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think Fang, I\u2019m not a fag!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf chucked again, this time louder. \u201cWe all saw how you reacted when Marcus fished it out.\u201d Fang taunted. \u201cYou were right into it. Let him go to town on your cock, didn\u2019t you? You shoulda seen your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d David roared again. \u201cI told him to get off me! I Told you to get him off me! You just sat there and watched!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scoffed as he rolled his eyes again. \u201cYou really struggled with that one, didn\u2019t you David? You only had a foot on the scrawny little fag. Never stood a chance. He must have broken your neck, because you didn\u2019t do a damned thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told him to stop! I didn\u2019t want that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then why did you push back?\u201d The wolf asked with a manevolant glare. His question stabbed at David like a dagger, catching him off guard. Fang took another half step forward. David unconsciously stepped backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smiled viciously. His cock inflated more. \u201cTell me David, if you didn't want it, then why didn't you even try to push him away? You just pushed back into his mouth. You pumped your cock in him, and let him swallow all your cum. Like a fag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took another step backwards. Fang immediately annexed the surrendered ground. The wolf\u2019s gaze bore into the blue drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened!\u201d David shouted back at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Tyler.\u201d The wolf sneered without taking his eyes off David. \u201cBack me up here. You saw this too, right? How hard did David resist?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid broke from Fang\u2019s gaze to shoot a glance at his brother. Tyler recoiled at the question, his mouth hanging open as his own gaze shifted between Fang and his brother. There was a pause. Too long a pause to simply justify being caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler?!\u201d David exclaimed incredulously, his eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake shook his head, as if breaking himself from a trance. \u201cNo, David told him to get off.\u201d He said to the wolf without much conviction. David shook his head in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damage was done. David took another step back as he faced the wolf. Fang advanced. His fierce eyes sparkled in the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou pushed back with me, too.\u201d  Fang said with a sneer. \u201cWhen the big bad wolf had his mouth around you, you got yourself right up in there, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was walking backwards now, Fang following him in step. The wolf\u2019s cock throbbed as it reached out at him. David's eyes darted wildly. He felt so isolated, even his brother had abandoned him. He started to panic as he realised he had nothing to say to the wolf. \u201cFuck you Fang!\u201d he spat back. It was all he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang opened his arms out wide as he lead the drake further backwards. \u201cI ain\u2019t judging man, we\u2019ve all got our little secrets.\u201d He said with mock understanding. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to pretend for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt the fence abruptly press into his back, the steel sheets loudly protesting as they absorbed the momentum of his hulking frame. Fang stopped just in front of him, his enormous tongue licking his muzzle. He stood up straight as he arched his back. He slapped a hand down on his two foot long cock, the contact causing it to twitch hungrily as it spurt out pre. He began to work the shaft right in front of David, his hulking, ripped torso heaving as he panted. With his free hand, he lifted his elbow and flexed his bicep. The muscle bulged dangerously under his tight fur. \u201cDoes this get you blood racing David?\u201d He asked slyly as he moved in closer to David, black fur almost touching blue scale. \u201cAre you longing for some moar wuwfy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it Fang!\u201d David roared up at the wolf as he leant hard against the fence. Fang\u2019s hand noisily sild up and down his enormous shaft, the head rising just inches from his face. The wolf\u2019s musky scent was overwhelming. \u201cI\u2019m not into you!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David panted and turned his face away, trying to get the image of Fang working his immense cock out of his mind. But like a trainwreck, he couldn't help but look at the rod in the corner of his eye. He began to panic, why was his heart racing? The more he tried to calm himself down, the more excited he seemed to get. His mind was going foggy. What was wrong with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of dread washed over him as he felt blood feed its way into his flaccid shaft. He chanted to himself in his head, \"Please, please, please, don't.\" But sure enough, his rod began to inflate, the turgor pressure causing his member to lengthen and erect. He didn't want to look, the embarrassment building. \"This can\u2019t be happening,\" he told himself. \"I'm straight, I'm normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked down at the feeble blue drake and saw the half-erect shaft stirring to life. He let out a hearty, yet snide chuckle. The laughter only caused David to shrink his posture further. \"Admit it, faggot. You want all of this big bad wolf,\" Fang sneered. He reached out with his free hand and clenched David's jaw, forcing the blue drake to watch him pump his colossal meat. Fang moaned deeply as he felt his balls pull up, a fresh gush of pre spilled out of the tip of his shaft, arced through the air and landed on David's snout. The blue drake squirmed. The titanic wolf let go of David's jaw, the dragon backing off and sinking into the fence as he sat down on the grass, his shaft clearly fully erect from display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gay,\" David yelped, more to himself than anyone else.  With more force he said, \"I'm not a fag. This is just some sort of mistake. Hormones or something.\" He looked up, the wolf was lording over him, a sick grin on his muzzle. He hissed, \"Fuck you, Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been saying that a lot. Don't tell me you've got the big bad wolf on your agenda?\" Fang cooed. He stroked his cock harder, sending the steady stream coming out of his tip flying in all directions, splattering David in random patterns of pre. \"If you're not a fag, then why are you letting me paint you, huh?\" the big wolf egged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, back off, Fang,\" Tyler commanded from behind, \"He said he doesn't like you that way.\" The purple giant wasn't sure if he could take the wolf on anymore, but he didn't like the way Fang was treating David. The scene in front of him reminded him all too much of the days when Fang would corner him and use his physical prowess to intimidate the small purple drake. How Fang would use the fear of physical abuse to trap the little dragon as he tore Tyler apart emotionally bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His dick sure likes me that way,\" Fang said cockily, still looking hungrily at the cowering blue dragon. \"He doesn't want to admit it, but he's into dudes, big dudes like me. He's just too scared to admit that he wants to make me bigger. Isn't that right, David? You want this big woofy to hold you? Make you feel safe? I promise I'll protect you, even let you top me. You'll get me real big. Isn't that what you want, Davey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, stop!\" Tyler said sternly. The purple drake came up to the wolf and pushed him hard, able to send the wolf maybe a step back from his brother. \"Leave!\" Tyler roared. Fang just grinned menacingly at the purple drake. The gargantuan wolf took his massive arm and picked Tyler up, lifting him off the ground. The purple dragon felt helpless, reliving the moment the cruel wolf had done this the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang rumbled in amusement, this was just all too easy. He threw Tyler to the ground, the dragon gasping for air. He turned back to David who just sat there defeated. The big wolf felt his heart flutter a bit, a new sensation overcame his train of thought. There was the lust, that was a given, but underneath that, Fang felt something else. Chest tightening, head light, stomach in knots, the desire to have the dragon all to himself... Fang had never felt these things before. It couldn't be love. Fang has never loved anyone - could never love anyone - man or woman, other than himself. Then what was it? It gnawed at the edge of the wolf's mind, but he had more important things at hand. He shook his head, snapping back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" Fang said smoothly. The blue dragon looked up halfheartedly, his eyes distant, lost in thought. \"I'll give you 'til morning to make your decision. You're gonna feed me all that power, or you can live your life pretending that you don't want me,\" the wolf sneered. David just nodded absently before going back to sulking. Fang growled, annoyed he didn't get more of a reaction. \"Oh, and David?\" he said. The dragon looked back up, his gaze still fuzzy, broken. \"Here's something to remember me by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf began to stroke his thick member furiously. Grunting wildly as he beat faster and faster. The flow of pre increased before finally Fang was brought over the edge, the dam breaking as he unloaded his thick seed all over the blue dragon's face. David barely flinched as the first streamer hit him squarely in the snout. He was given no reprieve as Fang's cum doused him nearly continuously. Fang was howling in delight, the feeling of his dick spasming with power, shooting what felt like endless ropes of his seed all over David. By the time he was finished, David's upper body was thoroughly coated. Still, David remained stone-faced and reticent. But his dick was rock hard, betraying his true feelings for the little show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sighed happily before his shit-faced grin turned sinister and said, \"Ah, that's a good look on you, Davey. Remember, I'll be back to collect by morning.\" Fang turned around, his dick still jerking, though nothing fired out. He walked by the purple dragon, Tyler stunned by Fang's brazen display of lust. \"Later, Tyler,\" Fang said cockily, as if the purple dragon hadn't bore witness to his jerk-off session. Fang disappeared around the corner of the ruined house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler turned to look at his brother, David still slumped against the fence. He approached warily, not wanting to startle the blue, painted white, dragon. \"David?\" he probed. The beefy dragon in front of him didn't respond. As Tyler got closer, he noticed his brother's boner and the audible squishing sound underneath his foot, having stepped in a disgusting pool of the wolf's spunk. He bent down to wipe some of the sticky liquid off his brother's face. As his arm neared, David swiped the hand away, a scowl on his cum-stained face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone, Tyler,\" David grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Tyler was persistent, it was his turn to be the big brother. He swallowed his pride and sat down beside his brother, the thick liquid coating his ass and back. Tyler shuddered and let out a whimper. He placed a massive paw on David's shoulder and held it there, the slickness almost making his grip slip right off. \"David, are you ga-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" David replied before Tyler could even finish. He looked at his purple brother's eyes, the orbs soft almost wizened. He almost felt comforted by Tyler's gaze. He calmed down a bit before looking down, unable to look his larger brother in the face. He said softly, \"I- I don't know, Tyler.\" David was fighting back tears, he didn't want to show weakness in front of Tyler. Real men didn't cry. Real men didn't suck other men off. David reeled through his thoughts, thinking of all the paradigms of masculinity he ought to emulate. Being gay was definitely not one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed and squeezed his brother's shoulder slightly. \"I'm your brother, David. I'll always stand by you, no matter what you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure didn't stand by me when you strangled me nearly to death,\" David spat sarcastically. He wanted Tyler to be as mad as he was, but when Tyler remained even-tempered, he knew it was futile. \"Sorry, Tyler. I didn't mean it. It's just... I don't want to be gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler chuckled, his brother was truly bad at sharing his emotions - other than unbridled rage and the occasional brotherly moment. \"I don't think it's a choice, David.\" David nodded solemnly. \"Hey, maybe you're not gay, maybe... maybe you just like the size and power. Like how straight guys put posters of big bodybuilders in their rooms. Doesn't make them gay, right?\" The big purple dragon brings his hand over David's face and wipes off as much of the cum as he possibly could, shaking off the wolf-spunk over the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell me something you do know,\" Tyler said patiently. \"Did you like it when Marcus sucked you off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all blowjobs feel great-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah,\" the blue dragon admitted. \"I didn't want anyone to know, so I turned on him... The real reason I didn't want to see him at the hospital was because it was my fault. Fang may have beat him up, but it was my fault for growing him in the first place.\" David's eyes looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't say that, David,\" Tyler said gingerly, then blinked with realization. \"Did you... did you like Marcus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's a great dude. Smart, funny, friendly...\" David trailed off when he notices Tyler's cocked eyebrow. \"No! No, no, no. Not like that,\" he stammered, his cheeks blushing a deep shade of red, easily visible through his scales. \"I'm not sure if I even like guys,\" he added sheepishly, \"Maybe like you said, size and power, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler just sighed in response and shook his head. The two dragons sat in silence before the purple dragon spoke, \"Okay, enough about our crackpot theroies of your sexuality. Was it just me, or did Fang come on to you a bit strong? Not saying he's gay, its just... what are we are gonna do about him?\"</span></div></div>",

He\u2019ll fuck anything that moves just to dominate it.\u201d He looked at his treacherous cock, which stubbornly seemed to stay erect. Is that what it wanted? To be dominated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s going to happen when he comes back then?\u201d Tyler asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d David said in resignation. \u201cI fucking hate him. He\u2019s evil.\u201d He at least knew that much. His cock didn't speak for his affection. The blue drake buried his slimy face in his hands. \u201cBut how are we going to stop him now?\u201d he almost moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drakes sat in silence before David finally picked himself up. It was a slow, painful movement.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m gonna get this shit off me.\u201d He said as he scraped and flicked as much of the wolf\u2019s warm seed off him as he could. There was so much, it was almost a supernatural quantity. \u201cI\u2019m taking a shower. Are you coming in?\u201d He asked back to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t wait up as he wandered into the house and turned on the shower. The nozzle sprayed water directly onto his lower chest. It was quite an effort to get himself low enough to wash his whole body, the glass walls were a lot more restrictive than what he was used to. When he was clean, and he was sure he had gotten the last of the wolf\u2019s cum off him, he realised that he still felt dirty. He just stood in front of the shower head as the water crashed into and down his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he gay? He aked the question honestly of himself now. It was out there. He had to face it. Had he just pretended to like all the chicks he has ever been with, all the porn he had jerked off to over the years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Of course not. Women drove him wild. He dreamt about them. That was the honest answer. So why did he let Marcus get him off? And why did Fang turn him on like that? Was he just into it because it was taboo? That could explain why his blood ran hotter when he tried to look away, when he told himself that he wasn\u2019t getting turned on. Was he just curious? His whole life he had been the alpha, did he secretly long to wonder what it was like to switch the roles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised that the thought of being Fang\u2019s little bitch did kind of turn him on. He scowled at himself. Fang was the most evil, abusive asshole in the world. If we went off with him, he would be miserable. Maybe that was why it turned him on. The wolf dominating him. Being at his mercy. A part of him physically wanted it. Or at least wanted to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did he only feel this now? Was it always there, something he had subconsciously denied, but now it was out, he was powerless to contain? Or did the wolf just plant the idea into his head? He leant his head against the shower wall as he turned the water off. He just stood there in silence as his mind raced. Maybe he was overthinking it. Maybe he just liked guys as well as girls. Could it be as simple as that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out of the shower and dried himself off. He went to his room to find some clothes that may fit, but was met by the night sky as he opened his door. He looked at the debris that used to be his room, and quietly worried about the structural integrity of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo clothes then. He walked back down the stairs, but realised his brother was nowhere to be found. \u201cTyler?\u201d he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m outside.\u201d Tyler replied through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, David walked outside to meet his brother. \u201cWhy are you still out here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler raised a thick arm to scratch his neck awkwardly. \u201cI um\u2026 I can\u2019t fit through the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. That didn't surprise him. The purple drake was massive. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to stay here. I need to get away from the yard.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to the park, then?\u201d Tyler suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged, and the two set off on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how you asked how we could stop Fang?\u201d Tyler asked. David looked up at him, his expression stoic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing stopping us getting bigger.\u201d Tyler said slyly. Then his face dropped as he amended \u201cWell, you getting bigger, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's expression remained blank. He shook his head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what you meant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is!\u201d Tyler said, part in defence, part in accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, I\u2019m not yelling at you.\u201d David said calmly. \u201cBut I can tell you still want size and power. Not like Fang. In your own way. But you already have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked away form his brother as he shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want size and power. Not since I almost killed you.\u201d He said solemnly. \u201cBut you know, I don\u2019t feel powerful next to Fang. when he loomed over you like that... I don\u2019t want to get carried away, but I want to be able to fight if I need to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging around me and Fang all night, Tyler. I don\u2019t think you get it yet.\u201d He said. He looked around the neighbourhood as he articulated his thoughts. \u201cWhat\u2019s it called when a chick think\u2019s she\u2019s fat but she\u2019s not? Anxious\u2026ness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at his brother with an amused grin. \u201cAnorexia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, you have Anorexia with size. You feel you\u2019re small when you\u2019re huge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019m huge.\u201d Tyler said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid came to an abrupt stop. Tyler turned to face his brother. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake jumped as David slapped a hand on the purple drake\u2019s lower abdomen. \u201cTyler, this is about how tall your friends are.\u201d He said. the purple drake stared at his brother in confusion before looking at his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid moved his hand up to the bottom of Tyler's chest. \u201cThis is about how tall I used to stand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand moved up higher, towards the top of his chest. \u201cDo you remember Annie? She\u2019s this tall.\u201d David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Tyler looked at David in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie?\u201d David asked more than told. \u201cThe t-rex? Jess\u2019s friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Ali?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right yeah, sorry.\u201d David mumbled, slightly embarrassed. He didn\u2019t have a lot to do with her, but he probably should have known that by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eye widened as he belatedly absorbed what his brother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid lifted his hand to the bottom of his neck. \u201cAnd do you know what this is Tyler?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave a dumb grin. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s my throat Davey!\u201d he said with ridiculous exuberance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He realised that was the first time he had done that out of humour all night. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s also the roof to your shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s face dropped like a stone. His mouth opened, but nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took his hand off his brother. \u201cThere\u2019s such a thing as too big, Tyler. It has its problems. And I\u2019m not just talking about knocking your head on doorways. Remember your truck? You\u2019re never going to drive it again. You\u2019re going to break any chair you try and sit on. You can\u2019t even fit into the house. Think about that Tyler. You can\u2019t even fit into the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Tyler was stunned. He looked around him, as if only just realising how truly massive being over ten feet made him. They started walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I ever tell you that I\u2019ve had girls turn me down for sex because I was too big Tyler?\" David asked rhetorically. Or course he didn\u2019t. \u201cIt happens. You can be so big that you make someone uncomfortable; cause more pain than pleasure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d Tyler said as he blushed, as if after everything that had happened that night, talking about sex with his brother was still a source of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d David insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re massive. You\u2019ve already limited yourself in that regard. Any bigger, and you\u2019ll never have sex again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I get it.\u201d Tyler mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you do, Tyler. Because I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise, I get it.\u201d The purple drake said. David looked skeptically at Tyler out of the corner of his eye. That promise didn't mean as much as it should have. They walked the rest of the way in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u2018park\u2019 was just a green allotment at the end of their street, dotted with some trees and covered in grass. The two naked drakes sat down with their backs against separate trunks. David looked to the sky and closed his eyes. His mind was a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that Fang is an evil genius.\u201d Tyler broke the silence. \u201cI mean, any lug with muscles can be a bully, but Fang\u2026 he really knows how to beat you up psychologically. I remember this one time I was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Fang.\u201d David cut him off flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked ashamed, feeling stupid for bringing the topic up. \u201cSorry man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. He decided to smile. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to show you how to maintain a body like that, aren\u2019t I? I bet you\u2019ve never even seen a set of weights before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grinned, with relief more than anything. \u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of weights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid chucked. \u201cWe\u2019ll go into the gym together. There\u2019s a hell of a lot of bullshit bandied, even by experienced bodybuilders. I\u2019ll tell you what to look out for, and how to do things right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much longer do you think we have left in the night?\u201d David asked Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake looked at the sky and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s still black everywhere, so at least an hour, I guess. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged. \u201cI was just thinking that maybe we should\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

He said theatrically, \"I'm picturing my little big brother and his big gay kangaroo boyfriend holding hands and walking, the wind blowing through his boy-toy's fur as they nuzzle each other on the beach, and...\" Tyler trailed off, his growing laughter too hard to contain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew his brother couldn't see it, but David was blushing. He was following along, imagining all those things in his head. It scared him. Scared him because in the back of his mind, he sort of liked it. He always liked spending time the the kangaroo, he thought they were pretty good friends. Maybe he did like guys as much as girls and if he did, what better person than someone who's already close? But what if it was all just a phase? Did Marcus deserve to be just a phase?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would've liked to continue his train of thought, however his brother's bass-laden laughter was starting to become infectious. \"Hey, shut it,\" the blue dragon said, chuckling a bit himself as he stood up. He walked over to his purple behemoth of a brother. \"C'mere, you.\" He bent down and gave Tyler a noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop,\" Tyler giggled and pushed his his blue brother off. To his surprise, David fell back and landed on his butt, then Tyler realized he wasn't the little brother anymore. \"Sorry, I guess I don't know my own strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say. Oof. God, Tyler, you're strong,\" David said, rubbing the side of his naked ass. He looked up more serious than before and asked, \"What do you think of Marcus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sat back and replied, \"Honestly? From the times we've 'hanged,' he seems like the nicest guy out of your football friends. You know, the one that's not a complete ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? So you think he could be... you know... boyfriend material?\" David couldn't believe what he just said. Did he really say it? He looked at Tyler for a sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler just looked back at David, a warm smile creeping up on his face. He thought he'd never been really close to David before, always fighting and getting bullied. Maybe they were better brothers than he had originally thought. \"Hey, don't look at me,\" he chuckled and shrugged. \"If you really like the guy, I say go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks,\" David said, massaging the back of his neck with one hand. \"Means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dragons sat there, naked as the day they were born in an awkward silence. David finally spoke up. \"Uh, yeah. The girls,\" he said with a cough. He stood up and turned towards their street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they live in the other direction,\" Tyler called out to his blue brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was almost out of the lot when he said without turning, \"Yeah, I'm just gonna call Jess, see if they're still up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uh, I have Jess' number if you need it.\" David paused for a moment in his stride, sensing a nervousness in Tyler's voice, but dismissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, it's 'kay, I got her number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sat in the park by himself as he waited for his brother to come back. It wasn't long before David came back, his arm motioning for Tyler to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon let's go, I know where it is,\" David said. Tyler stood up and joined his brother on the sidewalk, trailing behind. The walked in silence until David chimed, \"So how'd you get Jess' number anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt his cheeks flush, glad that his brother wasn't facing him, \"I- uh, to get the truck back, she put her number in my phone. Which... probably got crushed when I grew.\" Tyler slapped his forehead and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed heartily, he knew something was up. \"You like her don't you?\" He spun around, a toothy grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That obvious?\" Tyler held himself, much like he used to do when he was small and shy. David nodded. \"You've gone out with her, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. But we've hung out a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" the purple drake sighed. \"Was hoping you'd know what she liked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you thought I was clueless.\" David smirked and rolled his eyes, \"That's easy, just do this.\" David brought his arms up and flexed his massive guns. He was surprised, he knew he was bigger, but the sheer definition his body now had astounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler blushed and copied, his pose not as confident as David's was. \"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, gotta show off those huge bi's, man. Like this. And crunch your abs, show everyone what ya got.\" David repeated the pose. Tyler copied him again, this time striking it proudly. David encouraged him with a, \"Yeah!\" Tyler smiled, and looked over his tensed body, seeing for himself just how powerful he had become. \"Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the next flex, Tyler mustered up all his strength. David's eyes went wide as he saw his brother's frighteningly huge body flex. If he truly was into size and power, his brother was a paragon of it. Luckily David didn't have the time to dwell on that though as Tyler raised his head and let loose a deep and guttural roar into the darkness; a roar like those of the ancient dragon's in fairy tales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, the big purple lug opened his eyes, realizing what he had just done. He looked down at David and saw his brother's empty stare right back. A couple of lights were turning on down the street, the neighborhood painfully aware of the ruckus the two were causing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should run,\" David whispered. At that moment, the two bolted at breakneck speed, their footsteps thundering across the ground. When they got close to the apartment, David collapsed onto a patch of grass, making sure to stay out of the lighted areas. He was laughing like a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we just did, that was incredible!\" Tyler panted as he sat down beside David, he too was giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally calmed down, David looked up at his brother and said, \"Just promise me one thing, Ty. Don't make a move with Jess, okay? She's been through a lot tonight, I don't think its appropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" Tyler replied, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... Hey, I think that's Jess,\" David whispered. He called out, \"Jess!\" He stepped a little into the light, and a small figure approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little pink and white fox's eyes went wide when she saw two massive naked dragon in front of her. Normally, she'd be fanning herself and whistling, but she knew these guys, and the were definitely not supposed to be like this. \"David? TYLER?\" she blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too, Jess,\" David chuckled. Tyler waved, standing behind David's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, jumbo and jumbo junior, I'm not letting you in until you explain to me, A) why little David and Tyler are playing together and B) how midget over there became the Incredible Hulk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid winced at her words, as did Tyler. The purple drake's thoughts articulated for the both of them; he knew Jessica could be... abrasive, but she was rarely this cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy Jess,\" David said. \"Just lemme explain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid told her about how his cum could make guys grow and later how they found out about its healing properties. How Marcus was the first to accidentally get a taste of it. How Marcus was sent to hospital and they went to visit him; though he conveniently left out the whole 'fake' boyfriend bit. How Tyler got huge and fought Fang after they had left. How Tyler took pity on the wolf and that's how they got into the dilemma they were in right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed. What a shitty explanation, whatever David had said, it blew right over her. She had stopped paying attention, only gathering a couple of details; the story told had just way to much bull to cipher through. \"So wait? You're gay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was taken aback, was that seriously the first thing to come to vixen's head? \"N-no... Jess, I like girls.\" He whispered a, \"too,\" under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just rolled her eyes and noticed Tyler's furtive glances at her. \"Yeah, and what are you looking at, cumrag? Suck off your brother enough?\" The big guy flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" David bellowed. \"You said we could come over, remember? Why do you always have to be so difficult, Jess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because!... Ugh, never mind blue Hercules,\" she said, her voice tired. \"I'm sorry for what I said. I'll let you guys in.\" She began to walk back to the entrance of the complex and the boys followed. As she swung the first set of glass doors open she paused and turned around. \"I can't believe Fang could do this to me and Alli... she's still curled up in her room. And Marcus, will he be okay? David, I'll let you and Tiny over there in on one condition:</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t get any bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d she demanded, folding her arms impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m big enough as it is!\u201d David burst out. \u201cFang\u2019s huge. He\u2019s like, 12 feet tall now. More than that. I\u2019d have to get that size before I could kick his ass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d Jess said, raising a single eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to live my whole life being 12 feet tall!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shrugged. \u201cWhy not? I thought you lived being strong and powerful?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"within limits!\" David said, unable to comprehend the foxes mindset. \u201cJess, I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox scowled. \u201cThen you\u2019re not coming in.\u201d she said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler inhaled awkwardly to cut through the tension. \u201cWell, maybe if you just got to my size\u2026 then the two of us could take him on.\u201d He suggested to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid flashed an angry look at his brother. \u201cAnd then what? You grew bigger than him Tyler. You won. And look where that\u2019s gotten us! It\u2019s not worth it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking Hell David.\u201d Jess interrupted with a short, humourless laugh. \u201cSince when have you talked like this before? You\u2019ve always gone on and on about how big and strong you are, flexing your muscles at anyone who'd look. What\u2019s happened to you? You really have turned gay, haven\u2019t you? What\u2019s happened to your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Tyler roared, his loud voice making both the fox and his brother flinch. \u201c We've only come here to check up on you. What the hell has gotten into you?!\u201d he demanded angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox\u2019s face changed from surprise to disgust in an instant. \u201cWhat the fuck do you think has gotten into me?!\u201d The fox spat back up at the towering purple drake, before turning her anger back on his brother. \u201cFucking hell David, I thought you would stand up for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe we should have just left you tied up then if we haven\u2019t been to your satisfaction.\u201d Tyler sneered contemptuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess\u2019s eyes slowly widened in unbridled fury, before she abruptly turned back into the house, slamming the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drakes stared at the closed door for a while afterwards. David shook his head. \u201cShe was just a bit rattled man. That was way too harsh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Tyler said in resignation. \u201cI got angry and said something stupid again.\u201d He looked at his brother. \u201cThough to be fair, she\u2019s guilty of that too.\u201d hum mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded and turned away, beginning the walk back to their house. Tyler followed him, his hands rubbing across his face. \u201cMan, though. I think I\u2019ve blown that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave a weak smile. \u201cMaybe, she can hold a grudge\u2026 but give it time, emotions are running high. Maybe we\u2019ll all be laughing about this in the morning.\u201d he said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at the sky. \u201cSpeaking of the morning\u2026\u201d he mused at the colour that was slowly forming in the east. \u201cLook man, we can do it.\u201d he said eagerly, getting in close to his brother. \u201cWe can beat him down, alright? We just won\u2019t get carried away with it like I did last time. We can stop him; you\u2019d just have to get a little bit bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. \u201cLook, Tyler. I know. But I don\u2019t want to, alright? I\u2019ve been saying it all along, it\u2019s not worth it. This is just getting out of control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler paused for a moment. \u201cLook, does it have something to do with you\u2026 you know, you having feelings for Fang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d David spat back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down man, I\u2019m not making accusations or anything. We\u2019re just having a conversation, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shifted his glare to the pavement in front of him. Tyler paused to let David speak, but continued when he remained silent. \u201cListen, you do know\u2026 even if you do want to be with Fang like that... you can\u2019t just keep feeding him. That\u2019s something that\u2019s never going to end. You want to talk about things spiralling out of control\u2026\u201d he trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid kept walking. The thought of the wolf expanding\u2026 it made his heart race. He sighed and shook his head to himself. This was fucked. His head was so messed up, he felt like he wasn't even thinking anymore. He was just walking numbly, a sickening sense of foreboding bubbling at the bottom of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, David, the sun\u2019s coming up.\u201d Tyler interrupted David's reverie. \u201cFang will be back soon. You have to decide now. If you\u2019re gonna fight him, then you need to prepare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, David didn\u2019t respond. Tyler pressed on. \u201cOr, I suppose, the third option would be to just not go home. I mean, there\u2019s no reason why we HAVE to go play his game, is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head firmly. \u201cNo, I have to be there.\u201d He said quietly but absolutely. That much he knew. He wasn\u2019t just facing the wolf \u2013 he was facing himself. That was something that he couldn\u2019t run away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen are you going to fight or submit?\u201d Tyler asked flatly. David closed his eyes, but was otherwise unresponsive. \u201cDavid, you have to answer that.\u201d Tyler insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled and turned on his brother. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know, OK?!\u201d He spat, barely keeping his composure in check. He stared hard at his brother for a moment before looking away. \u201cI just don\u2019t fucking know anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler put a comforting hand on David\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWell, I can help, if you care to listen to your brothers advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged. Tyler continued. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t care who or what you are. So long as you\u2019re happy, alright? But you just can\u2019t go with Fang like that. It will affect everyone. Hell, just look at the damage he\u2019s already caused. You would have to be selfish to make him even bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled to himself as he imagined the wolf growing. Tyler waited before continuing, not sure on what the expression meant. \u201cLook, David, you\u2019ve said that you like Marcus. And that makes sense. He\u2019s a nice guy. But Fang? He\u2019s a sociopath. You\u2019ve said over and over again tonight how much you hate him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do hate him.\u201d David mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why is this even an issue worth considering?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. He looked around the street, as if looking for inspiration in the morning light. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d He finally answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cNo, it's not complicated, it\u2019s simple. It\u2019s just confusing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled back up at Tyler. \u201cAlright, fine. It\u2019s confusing. So fucking what, it means the same thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head again. \u201cNo, it\u2019s an important distinction. If something\u2019s simple, then it\u2019s easy to work out. So you can tell that you\u2019re making a mistake even though you might FEEL confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes and sighed. His brother was genuinely trying to help, but he was finding no comfort in the words. In fact, they were making him irritated. \u201cGo away Tyler, please.\u201d he said without looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo David, you need me.\u201d Tyler said, placing his other hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder. He squared David as he looked down on him with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave Tyler a blank stare for a few moments before scowling. He roughly broke himself free from Tyler\u2019s grasp. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d he said defiantly. \u201cWhether I fight Fang or not, I can do it on my own. This is somethi...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it David!\u201d Tyler interrupted his voice loud and angry. \u201cWhat the fuck do I have to do to prove myself to you?! We keep having these talks, and I think were bonding and getting closer together, but we\u2019re not, are we? Nothing\u2019s changed. I\u2019m ten feet tall and that\u2019s STILL not enough to stop you from looking down on me!\u201d Tyler looked as if he was on the verge of tears. His body was shaking, his jaw quivering. His mood had snapped abruptly from one end of the spectrum to the other, and David realised that he actually felt slightly intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake sighed as he looked back at his brother. \u201cTyler\u2026\u201d he began. He couldn\u2019t handle Tyler\u2019s insecurities anymore. It was all too much. The conversation, the situation, the whole fucking night. He felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. He needed to be alone to think. \u201cJust fuck off.\u201d He said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he would later regret that as he said it, but he meant it. He wanted Tyler to fuck off.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTyler stared back at his brother with furious eyes, his jaw open and locked in exasperation. Slowly, he closed his mouth and slowly started to walk backwards. He shook his head in disgust as he turned around and stomped off into the night, his footfalls shaking the concrete. David just stood and watched his brother storm away. He didn\u2019t know where his brother was going, but he supposed it didn\u2019t matter. Sighing, he turned around and continued the rest of his way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the next half hour sitting on a couch in front of a TV he wasn\u2019t watching. A thousand thoughts were spinning in his head, a hundred emotions were swimming in his guts. Morning was breaking. He had to come to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Fang approaching the house. The 12 and a half foot tall, 2500 pound wolf caused the earth to thud under his feet as he walked up to the porch. A moment later, the door jolted violently as he knocked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me in Davey.\u201d The wolf boomed, his voice so loud and deep that the wall didn\u2019t seem to dampen it. \u201cNot even a brick house will stop this bad wolf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid opened the door, revealing...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was quite the sight. When David swung the door open, Fang's smug grin dropped. The wolf was greeted by another behemoth who was bending down, except this one was covered in blue scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised to see me?\" David sneered. A huge paw shot out of the door and grabbed at Fang's shoulder, forcefully pulling the wolf into the house, the doorframe forever ruined. Fang was on his knees, slightly disoriented from David's roughness. When he looked up to see David stooping over him, his enormous penis still erect from what must have been a recent load; a thick smattering on the far wall confirmed it. He couldn't believe how big the blue dragon had gotten, surpassing him in every category of big and his scales obscured less of the unimaginable definition that Fang's shaggy fur did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off, Fang began to stand, bumping his head into ceiling with a loud thud; he would've tried to make a point by bursting through to the second floor, but then he wouldn't be able to see what David was doing. The two behemoths squared each other off, both ready to tussle, circling around each other. It was David who made the first move, he rushed forward and pushed Fang, using the couch behind the wolf to trip him. The big wolf fell back and it was over. Before Fang could react, David was pinning him to the ground. Fang was seeing time move by in slow motion. One moment he was watching David raising an arm, the muscles flexing with disgusting power, and the next he felt a blow hit his jaw before everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fang came to, he groggily tried to hold his head. However, it became increasingly obvious that his arms were behind his back and they were tied. He sat himself up, and looked at his shackled feet, bound together with a generous amount of rope. It wasn't long before he noticed David sitting across from him, a determined grimace on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheapshot,\" Fang grumbled, cracking his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, my house, my rules,\" David rumbled, slightly amused that he had bested the wolf so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sighed, \"So what now? You gonna beat me to death like Tyler? Where's Tiny Ty anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... not here,\" David replied. He was worried about the big, er, little, guy. Tyler had always been... fragile, who knows what he could be doing. However, something was bothering him. \"You're awfully calm about this, Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came for an answer, David, not a fight,\" the wolf said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" David was stunned. Something was definitely off, it didn't sound like Fang was lying. The way Fang was looking at him was frightening; normally there was an air of arrogance, of smug superiority with Fang. The wolf before him had none of it, his face some sort of sick mix between sincerity and humility. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one who's been thinking about this encounter,\" Fang said softly, his eyelids half-open. \"C-can we talk, Davey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's heart stopped, things had officially gotten too weird. This isn't what he had planned for. He had expected Fang to bowl his way in and try to take command, not be such, for lack of a better word, pussy. And what was this shit now? Why was Fang calling him 'Davey' so affectionately... The dragon was thoroughly confused. Did- did Fang <i>like</i> him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang?\" David whispered, his voice nervous. \"Is there something you're not telling me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" the wolf replied solemnly, looking up slowly, his voice cracking as he continued, \"Think it's pretty obvious now, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why now?\" David bellowed, causing the wolf to flinch. He was so confused, none of this made any sense. \"No! You're lying to me, you got beat and now you're trying to worm your way out if it!\" David was yelling now. The dragon let out a mirthless laugh. \"You're pathetic, Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not lying, David,\" Fang roared. The wolf paused for a moment before repeating himself more quietly, \"I'm not lying. Now that Tyler's not here, I think I can finally tell you I really do like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Fang.\" David wasn't buying it, he couldn't. Could he? \"If you're not lying, then what was that bullshit out there, 'bout the big bad wolf out there, huh? You think I'm that stupid? You had no intention of coming here for a sob story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's hard to believe, but its true,\" Fang said, looking away in embarrassment. He chuckled softly to himself. \"I thought Tyler was with you, I knew the little guy'd be going nuts. It was a joke, Dave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid still held his suspicions, but had to admit, if Tyler was here, he'd be the first to flip. \"Yeah, guess he would,\" he chuckled too. He went silent and looked at the bound wolf in front of him. Could he trust Fang? \"I think you owe me an explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smirked and nodded. \"Yeah, I guess I do... I never really thought about it, but I've always kinda liked you. I got all those scholarships to all those big Ivy League schools, but I chose to go to the same one with you. We make a good team, Davey.\" David nodded in agreement and looked at the wolf's watering eyes. \"I tried to play it cool when I saw Marcus beating you off, but I couldn't let someone else take you away from me. And then I got out of control, I was mad that you didn't like me back. I asked you why you didn't like me. I meant it. Why don't you like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head, Fang still wasn't making sense. The dragon was still guarded. \"Fang, I don't think you get it. I hate you.\" His tone was ice. \"Hate you for what you did, how can you even think about trying to confess your love or whatever shit you're trying to pull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked visibly hurt and did something he hadn't done since he was small kid, falling of his bike, scraping his knees. He toughened himself up, put on the guise of a bully. But even that couldn't stop him from crying, even it was just a little. \"We're done then,\" he whimpered. \"Let me go, I don't want to see you. Ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not what David had planned for. Jessica had wanted him to make Fang suffer. He knew she meant physically abuse the wolf, but he had planned to make the wolf feel helpless, the same way Fang had made him feel. He never thought the wolf would do it to himself. Instead of feeling like a victory, he felt bad. \"Fang-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, let me go!\" Fang wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at the wolf with pity, got up and knelt beside Fang, the wolf's eyes closed in remorse. \"I'm sorry, Fang. I thought you were lying. I didn't know you felt that way about me.\" He bent down and started to untie the ropes binding the wolf's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fang's arms were finally freed, David looked up and nearly yelped when he felt the wolf's paws grab hold on him and pulled him into a kiss. It was short, but sweet, the wolf pulling off quickly and searching for a sign of a spark. \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was blushing. What did he think of it? He loved it. That one kiss drove him wild. He panted out, his heartbeat racing again. \"Uh, it was okay, I guess,\" he said bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smiled softly and nudged at the dragon. \"If you get my legs undone, maybe we can cuddle for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" David was smitten. Never did he think he could find Fang, the abusive sociopath of a wolf attractive. But here he was, no longer lusting for Fang's growing size or power, but the brooding misunderstood nice-guy underneath the rough exterior. He bent down and untied Fang's legs, the wolf flexing his toes, enjoying the freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was free, Fang jumped on David and gave him a lick on the nose. David returned the gesture by rubbing his snout against Fang's and held the wolf close, their colossal bodies rubbing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared up at the ceiling as he lay on his back, the wolf... his wolf, lying atop him, snoozing gently. He smiled. He didn't care what Tyler said, he knew Fang better than anyone. They had been 'buds,' but now they could be more. He knew there would be difficulties; Marcus, the girls, Tyler... But he found someone that liked him for him, not some size-queen. It just so happened to be a boy, but so what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost noon, the house alight with the sun's rays. David felt like he had finally found peace. He stroked the back of Fang's neck and felt himself grow weary, falling into a light sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen David woke, he realized he must have dozed off for just a moment, a bit of spittle leaking out of the corner of his mouth. He bolted upright when he noticed Fang was no longer slumbering on top of him. He turned and the pit of his stomach churned. Sitting on the far wall was Fang, his huge pink erection poking dangerously high. A pillar of flesh more gargantuan than ever. David could almost groan, he remembered the rather vivid growth session he had earlier. He was feeding the rare orphaned rainbow albatross chicks his crop milk out of his cock... and all he managed to feed was Fang's growing ambition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was lost in his wanking, his two enormous paws unable to cover even half of the length. The amount he had to have consumed to make him that large. David guessed 15 feet at least, there was no telling for sure. The wolf was just so impossibly huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was fuming. All this time, Fang was duping him. He had set out to embarrass Fang and it backfired. And now, David was the humiliated one, he had given himself fully to Fang, showed him true affection and none of it was real. Never again, he'd never fall for another guy. Ever. Again. He almost threw himself at the wolf, bent on killing Fang, when the wolf opened his eyes, smiled, and rumbled,\" You're up.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang eyed the blue dragon, he could see David's anger turn to fear. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were you, I'd start running, Davey,\" he sneered in between strokes, his trademark fangs glinting maniacally in the afternoon sunlight filtering into the house as his cock continued to pour an unnerving amount of pre all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid contemplated the wolf's words. Was he scared? To death. But there was a spark inside him. If he were sane, he'd run. But he's come too far. He looked over his gigantic body, he'd never live a normal life again, no girl or regular guy could ever take him; he's sacrificed too much. He thought back to him fighting with Marcus, Tyler and Jessica; he's lost too much. If David knew what conviction was, he had it, but in his own words he had stupid amounts of bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Fang,\" David said, trying to keep his cool, but couldn't keep a slight snarl from escaping. \"I'm not going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smiled with sinister satisfaction. \"So you've decided to grow me? Good call, Dave-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the dragon interjected sternly. He shook his head. \"No more growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you plan to stop me, runt?\" the bulwark of a wolf roared with laughter. \"I'm the most powerful motherfucker on the entire planet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know,\" David replied dejectedly. Fang's laughter boomed throughout the house. David felt defeated, when sudden realization hit him. A slight grin crossed his face. \"Yeah, but you know what <i>Greg</i>?\" The drake emphasized Fang's real name. \"At least I'm not a pathetic wreck like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused by the display of defiance, Fang took his focus off his cock enough to lift his head, crack his neck and smirk at David. \"Someone grew some balls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know you like 'em,\" David retorted, his smile growing wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf growled angrily at the remark. David's heart was fluttering, he felt like he was on a roll, felt like he might just be able to take Fang on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, Fang. You'll never have sex with anyone,\" David stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck cares? I've got the body of a god, I'll screw whatever, whenever I want,\" Fang snarled back, only half-caring as he worked his stiff shaft. It was true, he was just so magnificently large. Of all the things that grew, his cock grew the second most; the first being his inflated ego. Before he had tipped the scale on large, his dick reaching all the way up to his navel. But after his growth, it turned Fang from gifted to ridiculously over-endowed, his penis reaching all the way up to brush underneath his colossal pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think any of our friends'll still stand by you, after what they saw you do to Marcus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fag deserved it.\" Fang was scowling now, the dragon had gone from a minor amusement to a slight annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Jess? Or Alli? What'll happen when people find out you raped them?\" David pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, they'll never tell anyone,\" Fang growled. He was so close now. Did this dragon ever shut up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about when I tell the police you raped me?\" David said stone-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You serious?\" Fang replied, stunned. David remained stoic, but Fang's lips curled into a cruel sneer. \"You're more of a homo than that Marcus. Go ahead, bitch to the police, shows how much of a man you really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 'cause that's what you are, Fang. A man. Look at those guns. Flex those pecs, man. Stroke that alpha dick,\" David jeered, almost at the point of laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the wolf flexed a bicep and ran his tongue over it; squeezed his chest, the muscles bundling viciously; and gave his penis a hard tug, sending another cup of pre into the air. Fang then turned to the staunch dragon. David was sporting an erection of his own, his naked body unable to hide his arousal. \"Yeah, you like that, faggot? You like this big bad woofy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid would've scowled at his body. Yeah, he'd admit it, Fang's body was a turn on. The way the wolf overdid it with muscle and dick, it was kind of erotic. But, Fang himself? David would never forgive the wolf. Period. \"You wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, what a pity,\" Fang said mockingly, pouting. \"And after all that cuddling we did together? Tell me, Davey,\" the wolf sneered, relishing the way the dragon gulped when he said his name, \"How much did it hurt? To know that you were being led on? To think I actually liked you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside David snapped. He lost his cool. He balled his fists in rage and charged without thinking. \"Shut the fuck up, Fang!\" he roared. Even when David's fist connected with the wolf's face, Fang never stopped his smug grin. David had given everything he had in that punch, and though it hurt, Fang didn't let it show. David had fallen into his trap, the wolf quickly grabbing a hold of the smaller dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid yelped as Fang threw him onto his stomach. Before he could push himself up, the huge wolf was sitting on top of him. He could feel Fang's enormous ballsack rubbing against the scales on his back, each feeling almost like a large industrial sackful of flour. The dragon was glad Fang could no longer see his shaft, the wolf wouldn't have the satisfaction of knowing just how much this was turning David on. Despite his growing arousal, David remained adamant, trying hard not to telegraph his weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was jerking himself off furiously on top of the dragon, bucking his hips, feeling his balls rub against his prey. His tongue lolled out of his mouth, his own arousal at an all-time high. He would've cum if it weren't for David's incessant banter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you like stroking your cock all over me don't you?\" David snapped, \"You trying to make a statement? Calling me a fag? Why don't you stop flashing your dick in front of me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, Matthews,\" the wolf growled. He then huffed, \"I'm close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would I care?\" David questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said shut it!\" Fang roared. As he did, he felt his balls clench as his first wad made its way up his shaft, the cum exiting at torrential volumes. Fang's length was so long, it wasn't until the next pulse that the previous jet would exit his dick, a continuous volley erupting from his tip as he moaned and howled. Every jet hit the ceiling with frightening velocity, sending the spray raining down over the pair of giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rode out Fang's orgasm in stride, trying hard not to moan with the wolf as he was painted with cum. This confirmed it, David definitely liked getting dominated by the big wolf. However, he knew better than to let it show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang continued to stroke his hard length long after the last of the volleys of cum ended, enjoying the haze of his afterglow from his most intense orgasm yet. However, David wouldn't let him have his satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I think, Fang?\" David coughed, spitting out the salty substance the oozed in from his lips. \"I think you like me more that you'll admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf just grunted and continued to massage his member in response to the dragon sandwiched by him and the floor, as if he didn't care what David said, or at least was trying hard not to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pressed on. \"When I healed you, you smiled. Like you were thinking of something nice, like you were actually happy.\" The dragon could feel Fang's tenseness. He knew he had the wolf. \"And you know, I've never seen that smile before Fang... Except one other time. You wanna know when?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause, just enough for Fang to swallow nervously. \"When?\" he whispered, trying to keep his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's smile turned wicked. \"When we were cuddling. I saw that same smile.\" The dragon could almost laugh in sick delight, but he let that sink in, relishing in the silent response of the wolf. Maybe he'd make this wolf suffer after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the wolf didn't respond at all, David continued, \"How much does it hurt, Fang? Or should I say, Greg? To know that all you have left is your size and power? To be miserable every fucking day of your life?\" The dragon turned his head so that he could see Fang's face. The wolf tried to maintain his grimace, but the signs of nervousness were there; averting eye contact and biting his lower lip. \"You could've had me, Greg,\" David said more softly. \"You just didn't believe that someone could actually like you. So you chose my dick over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang got off of David's back and stepped back. He laughed. David couldn't tell if it was forced or not. \"You think I actually like you? You've got it all wrong. Didn't think you were so desperate for this hunk of wolf,\" Fang sneered as he kicked the dragon in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, David felt a twinge of fear. What if he was wrong? What if his hunch that Fang was hiding his feelings wasn't true? It was time for the ultimate test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid picked himself up and looked at Fang. The way the wolf was eyeing him, he knew that he had rattled him slightly. David looked down at his semi-erect shaft and began to pump it, bringing it back to full hardness. Fang's jaw went slack as he watched David jerk off in front of him. David just smirked as he approached closer to the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say it again, Fang. You're pathetic. All you want is muscle. You want it so bad? Well here, take it!\" David said and thrust his pelvis forward, now so close to Fang that his dick briefly brushed the black fur. \"Call it a charity case. You better get sucking, 'cause let's face it, you're <i>nothing</i> without it.\" David knew he had won. If Fang chose to grow, he'd be humiliated, a man of weak indulgence. If he chose not to grow, well he wouldn't be growing, would he?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh, Davey\u2026\u201d The wolf said bemused, laughing softly as he shook his head. The blue drake smiled triumphantly as he watched Fang struggle with the situation, the wolf\u2019s golden eyes shooting between David\u2019s face and cock. He had Fang cornered, and the wolf knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d David barked impatiently as he continued to work his shaft, hiding the fact that he was actually quite enjoying it. Not just the masturbation, but also the feeling of some dominance of his own. \u201cThis is the only thing you want, isn\u2019t it? Your life\u2019s ambition? Suck my fucking cock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s breaths slowed as cocked his head, eying David\u2019s shaft. Then, with a smirk, got on his knees in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn\u2019t help but let his face drop suddenly. He honestly didn\u2019t know what he expected to happen, but he was still shocked as the wolf grabbed hold of his rod. Suddenly, he realised that he was about to get a blowjob. His heart started to race, his thoughts got drowned in an adrenalin rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang gave an amused laugh as he looked up at David\u2019s uncertain face, the drake\u2019s jaw hanging open as he breathed heavily. If the wolf felt humbled in any way by his own actions, it certainly didn\u2019t show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stooped so sharply under the low ceiling that he practically folded his massive frame over Fang. The drake licked his lips as they stared at each other in silence. Well? What are you waiting for?\u201d He demanded, though there was a trace of anticipation in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gave a big, toothy grin before he slowly gave David\u2019s cock a slow, purposeful lick. The drake could only partially prevent a gasp from escaping his lips as the wolf\u2019s wet, rough tongue slid across his head. Fang gave a menacing chuckle as he started dragging his tongue slowly back over it again. David breathed unevenly as the constant flow of pleasure drove him wild. But it wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the one in control here, after all. David scowled, and biting his bottom lip, reached behind the wolf\u2019s ears, roughly grabbing two handfuls of his pelt. With one movement he forced the wolf\u2019s head down the length of his cock, and with a second movement he thrust his pelvis into the wolf\u2019s mouth. David grunted as he felt his head burry itself deep inside the warm, wet and tight muzzle, the wolf\u2019s jaw stretching so wide that his teeth only lightly brushed the black slab of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmn, yeah\u2026\u201d David said, only half strategically. \u201cYou fucking need my cock don\u2019t you bitch?\u201d he panted as he thrust himself into the wolf again. \u201cLook at how pathetic you are\u2026\u201d he said through barred teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re just a fucking bitch, Fang. A faggy fucking bitch, and you know it!\u201d David said, his voice steadily growing more aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf just chuckled through a mouthful of cock. David shifted his stance, splaying his feet further as he forced the wolf\u2019s head up and down his length. A feeling of retribution swept over him. He was fucking the wolf. After all the abuse last night, he was fucking dominating him. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of doing this earlier? He had what the wolf wanted. He had the leverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned again as he started to speed his thrusts up. He bucked his hips roughly into Fang\u2019s mouth, his low balls swinging into the wolf\u2019s chin. He was abusing Fang, but the wolf oddly didn\u2019t seem to mind. In fact, he worked his large tongue over the black rod that rammed through his maw, sucking the constant spurts of pre down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grunted with each breath, as he bent over the wolf more. Everything about the situation felt good. Better than good. He felt the cieling plaster at his back begin to fracture and rain down over them. Deeper and faster he pounded the wolf. Fang\u2019s breath grew uneven as David\u2019s cock started sliding down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake simply stopped thinking as he felt his orgasm build. His balls slammed loudly against the wolf with each violent thrust. He felt Fang\u2019s hot breath blow against his lower abdomen as the wolf\u2019s snout slammed into his pubic bone again and again. David roared out angrily as he felt himself start to cum, his fingers tightening around the handful of pelt they both grasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Fang showed that he wasn\u2019t simply some mindless cock-guzzling machine. Placing one hand on David\u2019s shaft, and another onto his abdomen, he fought against David as he tried to bury his cock, and with superior strength, won. David cried out in a mixture of ecstasy and frustration as the wolf forced the drake\u2019s cock to sit at the end of his muzzle. David spurted load after load into the wolf\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised all too late that the wolf wasn\u2019t swallowing. Once his mouth was full, Fang simply popped the drake\u2019s cock out of his mouth. While David continued to cum aimlessly, Fang grabbed the drake from the back of his knees, and with tremendous force, lifted the drake up off the ground as he forced him backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid broke through the ceiling entirely as his feet lifted off the ground, his bare back bursting through splintering floorboards. Nothing provided his body any resistance as he gashed a gaping hole between the floors. The next moment, he was falling backwards. David had the wind knocked out of him as his torso slammed onto the living room carpet, the concrete slab shifting underneath as it cracked and splintered. He say there stunned, unable to move, think or breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebris from the floor above rained down on his body heavily. He didn\u2019t notice the wolf loom over him until an oversized black paw grabbed hold of his jaw. Fang roughly placed his muzzle over David\u2019s snout, and before the drake could react, spat the mouthful of cum into his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake spluttered as he felt a sliver of his seed slip down his throat and into his lungs. The wolf roughly slammed David\u2019s jaw shut with one hand, and blocked his nostrils with the other. David struggled to come to terms with what had happened, and started to panic when he realised that he couldn\u2019t breathe. His torso convulsed violently as he tried to cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had only one thought as he tasted the thick, repulsive liquid in his mouth. Don\u2019t swallow. He couldn\u2019t get any bigger. This couldn\u2019t keep happening. He fought in vain against the overwhelming wolf that bore down on him. Fang stared at David wildly as he spat what was left in his mouth onto him. \u201cYou stupid, fucking Dragon!\u201d he roared, his teeth flashing menacingly. \u201cYou can\u2019t win this game!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to kick the wolf above him, but his efforts ere futile. The wolf was rock hard, and there was no room to gather any leverage. Fang pressed down on him harder. \u201cWhat the fuck did you think was gonna happen, bitch?!\u201d the wolf spat, almost incredulously. \u201cI TOLD you, give me what I want, and I\u2019ll give you what you want. Did you think presenting your cock would put me off?! You\u2019re too stupid to fight me, David. Too fucking stupid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s heart raced as his body craved air. His writing against the wolf began to grow more frantic. He tried to force the cum out of his mouth, but the wolf held him so tightly that he could only manage to dribble a small flow from the corner of his mouth. It wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cSwallow now. Be a good boy.\u201d The wolf said with a rough, guttural voice. He started laughing mirthlessly.  \u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking? Yeah, I\u2019m gonna get fucking massive. Far too big to fit into society. And I\u2019m taking you with me! I\u2019ve got a growing appetite Davey, your little balls have to keep up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes. No. He was not going to swallow. Even if he suffocated himself, he was never going to swallow. A single tear forced it\u2019s way out of his eye. He should have listened to Tyler. His brother was right, and when he tried to help, David just chased him away. He knew that Tyler would have been useless. But as his heart raced faster and panic overwhelmed him, he wished that his brother was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI love how you resist me.\u201d Fang cooed above him. David suddenly felt the wolf\u2019s hot, stiffening rod press against one of his thighs. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be half as fun if you just submitted to being my little bitch.\u201d He sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s blood pressure was at bursting point as his movements became involuntary. \u201cCome on, not much longer now.\u201d The wolf cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man doesn\u2019t drown without lungs full of water. David swallowed. He didn\u2019t mean to do it. It was instinctual. He felt despair rise in him as his seed tracked down his throat. With his mouth empty, he desperately tried to suck in air through his teeth. Fang shouted triumphantly as he let the drake go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sucked in air violently as soon as he was free. His lungs burned and his heart thumped. He trembled as he closed his eyes. He felt the familiar calm spread through his stomach. \u201cNo!\u201d he managed to moan between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang just laughed in pure delight. The drake\u2019s cock twitched as it came to life. David opened his eyes and instinctively placed his hands on it. The black wolf above him started shifting colours. David was growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang tore David\u2019s hands off the engorging black rod. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d David said as he started to smile. The wolf was multiplying. There were five multi-coloured wolves leaning over him, and they all lowered their heads over his cock.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David woke up, a wonderful sense of well-being pervading his entire body. However, that feeling was short-lived, the sickening feeling of dread crept into his stomach and an intense heat and pressure pressed down on him. He knew he had grown, he could feel it, the tenseness in his muscles, the way his back dug into the floor, the swell of his chest as he took his first conscious breath. And if he grew... if by his last lucid moments were any indication, Fang must have grown to titanic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally decided to open his eyes. The instant he did, he wished he didn't. That heat and pressure were of course emanating from Fang himself, the wolf convulsing right on top David as he looked on in horror. He realized Fang was just starting to grow. The wolf must have stumbled forward after sucking off David's new improved load, collapsing right onto the dragon. David's view was currently at eye level with the wolf, his hot rank breath beating into David's muzzle. The dragon realized he must be just as big, if not bigger than the wolf at this moment, their noses almost bumping into each other and Fang's toes curling up on David's shins. He would've guessed he was about a foot taller than Fang, but didn't have the space to thing as he heard the wolf on the verge of giggling, his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat scared the dragon the most was that haunting smile plastered on Fang's face. The same innocent smile when he was healed and during their little 'cuddle' session. What was this Fang? Some sort of freaky reverse Jekyll and Hyde? David didn't have much time to think it over as that sweet smile turned into a grimace. It had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang clenched his eyes harder, never once opening them. The wolf grunted as his bones began to pop, shift and redistribute themselves. But even that couldn't stop the half-conscious wolf from enjoying the sensation, his child-like smile returning, his tongue lolling out to the side. \"Yeah,\" he rumbled, breathing heavily into David's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dfragon could feel Fang shifting on top of him, the wolf's face remained opposite to his, but he could feel the muscle on top of him expanding, feel Fang's toes tangling with his, and then his feet were scraping along Fang's shins. But the wolf didn't just grow taller, no, he was getting thicker as well. So much beef was being pushed into the wolf's form, it almost looked grotesque to David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's new weight was starting to get uncomfortable for David. It started off bearable, the wolf lighter than him, but this sheer bulk on top of him was building so quickly, almost painfully. However, Fang didn't share in David's discomfort. Instead the wolf began to thrust his hips, grinding into the dragon below him. Whatever he was feeling and thinking, he was clearly enjoying himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang let out a deep bellow. David's eyes went wide as he felt Fang's dick surge along his abdomen. The thick shaft was pushing against his own hard-on, still not soft from his own recent orgasm. He knew instantly that Fang's was bigger. David guessed that he should've been ridiculously endowed as well, feeling his own shaft being pressed into his upper abs. But Fang was now quickly dwarfing him. And if the wet rod grinding along his torso and the heavy nutsacks invading the space between his thighs were any indication, Fang was growing in every department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid yelped as the wolf grabbed a hold of him. Fang was delirious, lost in a mix between reality and his deepest fantasies. The wolf rolled over onto his back, bringing David with him. While the dragon was relieved that the wolf was no longer crushing him with his entire body, he was a little less enthused by the tight bearhug the wolf had on him now. David tried to look back at what Fang as he felt one paw brush against his stomach. The giant wolf's hand stuck in between his legs and fished out a monster of a cock. The pink head turning an angry shade of red. Holy hell, David thought to himself. The wolf let go of his cock, the thick long member came cashing down onto David's exposed back and the dragon couldn't help but jump a little from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was horrified by Fang's continued growth in his nethers, the pink tip of his penis just seemed to grow thicker as it convulsed, oozing pre on the same section of David's back even as the wolf's pelvis grew further and further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nearly jumped again when he turned back to look at the wolf's face, when he felt his cheek brushing against Fang's, the wolf desperately hugging onto him as he bucked wilder and wilder. The wolf moaned into his shoulder as his tension mounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was sick to his stomach. He should be aroused right now, this is what he wanted too, wasn't it? To be dominated by the hunkiest wolf of them all? For Fang to show him some affection? But, he hated how he was being used, how he thought Fang had more pride than that. He was so certain Fang would've turned down the offer. And he hated being wrong. Was it worth it to see Fang grow like this? He didn't know anymore. David didn't know anything anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost. He'd screwed up his own life; he'd never marry, never being able to have kids... or maybe be the big gay uncle for Tyler's kids. He'd never drive a car, go to work, wear clothes. No one would hire him. He'd never get to hang with his buds... especially Marcus... David was fed up, he just wanted to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world just seemed to slow down to a crawl as he did. He looked to the wolf beside his, watched the wolf clench his eyes shut, scrunch his nose, bare his teeth and drool over the blue shoulder. And for once, David didn't care that he was being used. Fang had already won, there was no point in lamenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took his stiff arms from his side and wrapped them around Fang's broad chest, or at least most of it, Fang had just gotten too big for him. He knew the wolf had stopped growing by now, the muscles underneath flexing and unflexing, but no more spurts of growth. It didn't matter to David though. Judging from Fang's body taking up most of the living room on his back, David guessed the wolf had to be twenty feet tall, twice as tall as his little brother and more than twice as wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly, the tripping wolf reciprocated David's actions, loosening his death grip on the dragon, even bringing one hand behind David's neck and stroking gently. \"Davey,\" the wolf moaned, almost adoringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should've excited David, turning him on even more knowing that Fang might just like him back after all. That somewhere deep down in the darkest recesses of Fang's twisted heart, there was some interest for the blue dragon. It should've, but it didn't. David just didn't care anymore. He didn't just give up on his hopeless situation, he also gave up on ever bringing this sweet innocent puppy out of the callous narcissist. Fang was just as much of a lost cause as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was so lost in his despair that when Fang began invading his mouth with a kiss, he didn't fight back. He didn't fight, but he didn't join in either, he felt like a bystander to his own body. He did nothing, the kiss went unrequited. He felt the wolf moan deeply into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was when Fang began to cum. He practically howled into David's mouth, going wild with his kiss, slathering his saliva over David's lips as his cock slathered the room with his seed.When Fang broke the kiss, he was still mid-orgasm as he groaned, \"Oh, Davey.\" He kept crying David's name, mixing it with obscenities. Maybe Fang really was telling the truth earlier on about his secret crush on him, David knew the best lies were often the closest to the truth; or it could just be circumstance, the dragon just being the catalyst for what Fang really wanted, size and power. Whatever the truth was, it still wouldn't have brought David any solace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang came for an inordinate amount of time, he dick spewing wad after thick wad of his jizz all over the place in a near steady stream. When he was finished, his grip on David all but disappeared, the wolf still hanging onto the dragon, but with no force. The dopey, puppy-like smile returned to his face and he licked David's snout absentmindedly, as if he was grooming the drake. Some of the saliva went into David's nostril, tickling just enough to make him give off a light sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's golden eyes shot open. His look of well-being and bliss melted off his face. The adorable smile on his face turned into a shocked expression, his jaw slack. The wolf was in the middle of a oh-shit-this-really-is-happening moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething sparked within David. The dragon had all but lost hope, but when he saw the confusion and what looked like terror on Fang's face, hope was reignited. Whether he still harbored feelings for the wolf, he didn't care. He could win. Fang had just given him all the leverage he needed. He just needed to anticipate where the wolf would go next. David felt like he could smile wickedly. He didn't know if he was, he was just too focused on poor Fang's shocked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to make the wolf squirm. Just how shameless is the wolf?</span></div></div>",

The drake was sent rolling off the high peaks of the wolf\u2019s chest and into the wall, the bricks bowing dangerously as they absorbed his almost overwhelming momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid came to rest on his back. There was not much room between the two overgrown forms. Fang shifted his own frame, laying on his side to face David. His massive body stretched from one end of the living room to the other. If he was in any other position, he would have been spilling out of the room in all directions. \u201cCome on now Davey\u2026\u201d Fang growled, the trace of a nervous smile curling his lips. \u201cI thought I made it clear that I\u2019m not into that faggy stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared vacantly at the hole in the ceiling above them. \u201cYou grabbed me, Fang.\u201d He said simply as he closed his eyes. He knew Fang. If he was aggressive, then the wolf would go on the counterattack and close himself off. David was far from clever, but even he had been able to see the signs. It was time to give the wolf enough rope to hang himself, just as Fang had done to him last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang gave a booming chuckle, his voice now a formidable force in itself. \u201cI thought you were a talking blanket.\u201d He said, a smug grin plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shifted his gaze into the wolf without moving his head. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d he said stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, alright then.\u201d Fang chuckled. \u201cWhatever you need to think David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not the one lying to myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s smile only grew wider. \u201cWith no respect due Davey, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve shown that you are particularly good at detecting lies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pursed his lips, as if contemplating the thought. \u201cNo\u2026 actually, I think I have been. You\u2019re lying now, and I know it.\u201d He wasn;t making an accusation. He was simply stating a fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, Davey.\u201d Fang laughed derisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. \u201cYou cried out my name.\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cWhen you were on your trip, you held me and cried out my name and kissed me. You knew it was me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sneered. \u201cI also fucked a blanket while I fell down a waterfall of ink. It doesn\u2019t mean much, does it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes again, and placed his hands on his torso. He looked as casual as if he were simply relaxing on a beach. \u201cNo, the trip doesn\u2019t. But the name does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, is that what you want from me Davey?\u201d the wolf asked, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cYou still want me to love you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then you\u2019re gonna keep fighting me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. Finally the wolf smiled proudly. \u201cHeh, it\u2019s taken a while, but I think I\u2019ve finally broken you in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d David sighed.  He rolled his head over to Fang. \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d he asked stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a wild fucking guess.\u201d The wolf said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded slowly, his gaze distant. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt might.\u201d Fang dismissed impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn now Davey. Just let me know if you need a hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid started to wonder. He had been so certain that the wolf was running from the truth. But Fang had given him nothing. It was as if the wolf really was a one dimensional sociopath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes as he reluctantly obeyed the wolf. He slowly grabbed hold of his half-masted black cock and began to work it slowly without much motivation.  \u201cFang\u2026?\u201d he asked cautiously. The wolf acknowledged him by raising an eyebrow and pointing his ears forwards. David looked deep into the wolf\u2019s eyes.  \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to an Ivy league college?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question frightened the wolf. It was gone in an instant. But it was there. Fang\u2019s eyes widened and his face pulled backwards. The expression shifted almost seamlessly into a contemptuous sneer. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other for a moment, the silence only interrupted by the sound of David\u2019s hand sloppily running up his shaft. \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d Fang eventually dismissed with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded knowlingly. His heart raced. There was no doubt now. The best lies were indeed the ones closest to the truth. \u201cI just needed to know, I guess. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's smile turned bemused. \u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot lying again.\u201d David said simply, turning his attention to his cock. It was still only half erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could feel the wolf staring at him. \u201cDavid, I\u2019m not gay.\u201d He said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you are, Fang.\u201d David said as if he were commenting on the weather. \u201cYou just can\u2019t admit it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gave a short volley of mirthless laughter. \u201cCareful now Davey, I'm not in the mood. You might start pissing me off soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore Fang.\u201d He said stoically. \u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen shut up and fuck yourself.\u201d The wolf snapped back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid continued to work his cock. Now that he knew the truth behind the wolf, he felt a sense of power. \u201cYou also said you didn't care about being bigger, because you\u2019d fuck anything you wanted.\u201d David mused distantly. \u201cBut of course, I\u2019m the only thing big enough for you to fuck now. And you\u2019re the only thing big enough for me. I think that was your plan all along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled under his breath. He slowly shifted his weight to place an oversized paw on top of David\u2019s ripped chest. He leaned in and hovered his cold, snarling face over the top of the drake\u2019s. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your magic potion, you would mean NOTHING to me.\u201d The wolf rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked straight up into the wolf\u2019s hard eyes. \u201cAlright, I admit it now Fang. I don\u2019t care. You turn me on. And probably always have. Perhaps in an alternate storyline, we could have been\u2026 you know, together. But you kept lying to yourself; you kept pushing me away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf closed his eyes as he took a calming breath. By the he had opened them again, he bore a more familiar smirk. \u201cI\u2019m right here, David. I have you exactly where and how I want you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You told me you would give me what I wanted if I gave you what you wanted. I gave you that Fang. This morning. But you couldn\u2019t handle it. I faced my demons, you ran away from yours.\u201d David said. In spite of himself, he felt a tear force its way out of each eye. \u201cI loved you, just before. In spite of everything. And I know you loved me back. But you had to push me away. You couldn\u2019t face yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sneered contemptuously. \u201cI\u2019m bored now David.\u201d He said, flashing far more teeth than he needed to. \u201cStop distracting yourself, and focus on the task at hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid cocked his head slightly as he stared defiantly back at the wolf. \u201cYou\u2019re gutless.\u201d He said stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang breathed in through his nose as he grimaced contemptuously. Then, in a violent flurry of movement, he leaned down on David and rose a fist into the air, before crashing it down again on the side of the drake\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could feel his snout fracture as it got caught between the unimaginable force of the wolf\u2019s fist and the hard concrete slab. He groaned as he felt unprecedented pain shoot though his snout. Dazed, he spat out several teeth and a mouthful of blood. He knew that his gums had collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you to shut up!\u201d Fang roared down at him, his fist hovering threateningly above the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the pain, David chuckled weakly. He spat another mouthful of blood onto the carpet beside him. \u201cThis is why you lash out. You think you can beat the gay away.\u201d he laughed up at Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s eyes burned down on the drake. His hovering fist trembled for a moment before it uncurled. Roughly, Fang grabbed David by his neck with both hands. Scowling with effort, the wolf throttled David as hard as he could. The drake choked wetly as he opened his bloody mouth in surprise. \u201cI could kill you right now\u2026\u201d the wolf grunted with quiet fury. \u201cAnd the only thing I would regret is that there would be no more growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed David\u2019s throat for a moment longer, before releasing him. The wolf abruptly turned his back on David, and grabbed the drake\u2019s erect rod with his own paws. He growled softly under his breath as he roughly milked David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid breathed in heavily, struggling to process his thoughts, his pain and his increasing pleasure. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how big and strong you get on the outside.\" David said calmly, putting up no physical resistance as his body shook from Fang\u2019s efforts. \"But you can\u2019t outgrow your lies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang whipped his hulking frame back towards the Drake. David witnessed the most terrifying vision he had ever seen. Fang wasn\u2019t furious. He was simply wild. There was a feral force acting behind those eyes. The cold, calculating wolf was nowhere to be found. \u201cI TOLD YOU TO SHUT THE FUCK UP BITCH!\u201d he screamed, his booming voice somehow shrill and piercing. David couldn\u2019t react before Fang started raining blow after blow down on him. The Drake had the sense knocked out of him by the second or third punch, but the wolf kept going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s face collapsed under the relentless force of the wolf, the concrete foundation cracked beneath him. But while David saw nothing but endless white flashes, the Drake didn\u2019t black out. He moaned some time later. All he could feel was an overwhelming torrent of pain as his face leaked blood like a faucet. He heard only a muffled ringing in his damaged ears. He slowly tried to open one of his swollen, blood-soaked eyes. It took a long time to focus, but when he did he saw...</span></div></div>",

The big wolf was hunched over him weeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's eyes were held shut as the tears came down. He tried in earnest to wipe them away with his almost comically large paws, but that didn't stop the drops from pouring out. If David could, he'd be chuckling right now. Not out of spite, but because of the oddity of the situation. How long had he known Fang? And this was the first time he'd ever seen the wolf crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith effort, David weakly brought one arm up. With a finger, he lightly bumped Fang's nose. The wolf's eyes shot open and looked down. Though he was bruised and beaten, though his face was barely recognizable anymore, David was smiling. He did it. Though it cost him a normal life, and heck almost his life, period, he had gotten the rough and tough Fang to come out of his shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not completely. Fang turned his head away and between a hiccup and a cough, he growled, \"I'm not crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many things David wanted to say. Some good, some bad; some to congratulate, some to scold. There were questions that needed answering. But David settled for a wheezing chuckle. The light laugh descended quickly into fit of coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang began to chuckle softly too, his breathing a bit ragged from trying to hold his tears in. \"I'm sorry,\" the wolf whimpered. David tried to reply, to accept the wolf's apology, but a weak groan came out that sounded like a questioning, 'Hmm?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, 'I'm sorry!'\" Fang roared. David winced as the Fang's claws dug into his wrist. Fang noticed and backed away, suddenly afraid of hurting David. The big wolf sat cross-legged and curled up. \"I'm sorry, David,\" he repeated quietly, sobbing into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grunted, trying to get Fang's attention. The wolf looked up with weary eyes. David nodded and tried to smile, but stopped when the pain was too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang held out his paw, so cautiously it was if he was expecting David to swat it away. Instead, the dragon grabbed hold and squeezed tightly. Fang wiped away the last of his tears and also tried to smile, but stopped when his lips quivered too much. \"Did you mean it, David? That you... loved me?\" David looked up, his swollen eye barely able to make out the features of the wolf's face, but he could tell the sneer, that constant fierceness, Fang always had on his face was gone. Instead, an inkling of that innocence he was searching for was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded slowly. There was no pretension, he indeed had loved the big wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... still love me now?\" Fang asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf David was smiling, he sure wouldn't be now. Honesty had always been a virtue for the blue dragon, or perhaps he was a bad liar by virtue. Either way, he didn't respond. No, he didn't love Fang. How could he? After everything the wolf had done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang seemed to get the drift. He looked away and closed his eyes. \"Yeah, me neither.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, David tried to avoid pity parties, he had enough recently with Tyler. But, seeing as how he was stuck with a body that could barely respond to his commands, he was stuck with the wolf. If he could roll his eyes, he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang seemed to be perceptive of this, he was about to speak when he choked on his words. \"David... Davey? I know you don't want to hear what I gotta say... but I need a friend right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed odd to David. Fang and him had been 'friends' for as long as he could remember. He had started the 'Fang' thing, being the first to call Greggory Nathaniels by the moniker. The two of them ruled their high school and dominated the football fields at their university. And through all this, he never really considered Fang a good friend, just two buds, but not someone he'd go to if he needed something, only inviting the brute to events out of fear of getting on Fang's bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid jerked when he felt Fang's paw suddenly grab hold of his semi-hard cock. \"Shh, it's okay. I know you don't wanna grow. But, I can't look at you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid wanted to scream. He squirmed, but Fang had no problems restraining him. Not only did he not want to grow, but he wanted Fang to understand that even though his cum was a cure-all, the wolf shouldn't be using it to solve all his mistakes. He wanted Fang to realize his actions had consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold still,\" Fang said with a stern growl. Eventually, David gave up, Fang was just too strong for him, especially in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang propped David against the wall, the structure of the house groaned in protest but held. David watched groggily as Fang worked his shaft harder, determined to make the drake cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared, David,\" Fang said flatly. \"I can't be gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snorted, more in amusement than anything. He wanted to say, \"Yeah, that's what I kept telling myself, but look at us, Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, David,\" the wolf snarled.  When he got no response, he folded his ears and looked downcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt a bit of shame. Fang really wanted to get closer to him; opening himself up, leaving himself vulnerable. And all David wanted was for him to shut up and get this growing over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt a wave of his pre splash out, and Fang took it as a good sign. The wolf smirked and looked at the drake's cock and gulped. He brought his mouth down and began to work David's shaft in earnest, even going far enough to activate his gag reflex a couple times, his stomach heaving as he did, but luckily nothing came up. David had to admit, it was kind of hot how far Fang was going to get him off, and though the wolf was trying to open up to him, he thought this was a much better application of the wolf's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was close, he knew it. He brought a hand up and tapped Fang on the shoulder. The wolf looked up and dislodged the cock from his mouth. Fang held David's cock firmly in one paw and his head gently in the other. David felt himself slowly being bent to bring his penis to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid opened his mouth, the exertion hurt, but he sucked it up and sucked down on his own dick. Fang began to rub the dragon's shaft vigorously. It didn't take much, the rubbing and the prospect of being able to suck himself off, it was just too much. David came. And as he did, he felt the warmth spread throughout his body. He could feel his body reconstructing itself, his eyes no longer swollen, his gums un-tearing, new fangs growing out of them. In moments, David was complete again. And in a couple moments, he'd be so much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his trip began, he watched Fang come in for a quick kiss and mouth, \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around him swirled. David couldn't help but giggle, never feeling so alive. When he looked down he saw Jessica. Not really Jessica, but a radiant vixen that burned a stunning white with a streak of literally hot pink light emanating from her backside. She was bobbing up and down on his dick. How all of him fit into her, he didn't know, nor did it occur to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon tiny, pick up the pace or I'm leaving you for Tyler,\" the fox giggled, a slightly smug sneer on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took it as a challenge. He thrust hard into the fox, causing her to gasp, a swarm of rainbow colored stars spewing out of her mouth. David closed his eyes and bellowed, \"Like that, Jess? Tell me how much you like it, bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it a lot, babe.\" David's heart stopped for a moment. That wasn't Jessica's voice. He opened his eyes and stared directly into those a gigantic kangaroo. The roo was huge, as big as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus?\" David giggled, partially out of astonishment, but mostly because of the bubbly feeling growing in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the ruby red kangaroo made of rubies replied. \"Thanks for growing me. I'll put these to good use,\" he said with a charismatic wink, flexing his bicep and giving David a toothy, but honest grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tripping dragon gasped loudly and moaned for the kangaroo to continue as he grabbed a hold of both their cocks and rubbed them at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid roared to the heavens, \"Marcus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus?\" a deep voice bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked down, only to have to look back up, way up. A smiling wolf was looking back down at him, his pelt swirling with the blackness of the outer cosmos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you could forget me?\" the wolf smirked. \"No touching, Davey. Just watch.\" And with that, the wolf began to flex it's enormous muscles, moving into pose after pose. Of everything he saw in the trip, this was the most erotic. David knew he was shooting. There was no doubt as the world began to fade to black, the giga-Fang encompassing his entire vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen David awoke, he heard moaning. Fang. His eyes opened wide. He felt so big now, so strong. As his eyes focused, he saw Fang at eye level, the wolf's eyes were closed and he was smiling with his tongue lolled out - the face David had fallen in love with. Which only meant that they had to be the same size. No, his back was against the wall, and he could feel the wolf sitting on his lap, he was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his abdomen being splashed with a hot liquid. David chuckled, he knew Fang would be growing soon. The wolf could never resist his cum; something about that turned him on. But when David tried to move, he felt a strange sensation on his shaft. Looking down, he nearly gasped when he saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David bit his bottom lip \u2013 his thoughts were equal part \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d and \u201cfuck yeah!\u201d This was not how he expected to wake up, but the wolf was just so fucking tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was racing \u2013 even though he had only just came, he had the urge to go again. There was a part of him which wanted to simply pin the wolf down underneath him and go for it, to hell with the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Fang\u2019s growth quickly ended those thoughts. The wolf moaned again, and unconsciously hugged David tightly, pressing his enormous erection into the drake\u2019s chest. David gasped as he felt it splash another large spurt onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt Fang start to get heavier on his lap. He watched Fang\u2019s snout and then neck rise above his eye level, feeling the wolf\u2019s fur graze against his naked scales as he expanded in all directions. Fang growled happily as he started rubbing his cock up against David\u2019s chest, the movement causing the drake\u2019s own cock to rub against the wolf\u2019s expanding bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid panted as he deposited his own spurt of pre into the wolf. Although he longed to be in a position where he could input his own thrusts, he nevertheless felt himself start to build to an orgasm. On one level it seemed all he wanted to do, but on another he was secretly terrified of the outcome such a thing would cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course only gave the situation a greater sense of taboo, which only aided to his excitement. He started licking the wolf\u2019s torso as it rose in front of him, the black fur soft and warm on his tongue. He felt a hot, wet pressure build under his jaw, and to his shock, realised that it was the wolf\u2019s cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid recoiled his head as much as he could, but this only caused the wolf to unconsciously press it harder against him. David decided that he may as well try it. Tentatively, he opened his mouth and gave the cock an exploratory lick. The taste repulsed him, and he reflexively recoiled. But the wolf grunted as he giggled, his tongue salivating as it lolled. David took that as a sign of approval and started licking it properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, his heart froze. Fang was quickly approaching the ceiling. The first floor ceiling. The wolf giggled and moaned as hid cock leaked pre continuously like a hose. David struggled to breathe as the fluid lathered his snout, but he kept licking the expanding head as it rose in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang started snorting as he absently stepped up his grinding. He had finally stopped growing, his ears hovering just below the ceiling. David moaned under his own uneven breath. The wolf bore down on him with uncomfortable pressure, but that seemed only a minor distraction. He closed his eyes, losing himself in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could get his own load out, the wolf started howling. David felt the wolf\u2019s heavy testicles clench up in his lap, as Fang\u2019s oversized cock began to spasm, and a moment later the constant flow of pre was replaced by a roaring surge of seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid moved his head out of the way, but the wolf came with such force there was nowhere he could go to avoid the torrent fully. He could hear the flow of cum spurt out of the cock next to him, the fluid escaping with as much force as a small firehouse. The seed hit the roof and walls and began raining down on them both, quickly drenching them and the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as the stream began to slow, David felt the wolf\u2019s balls clench again, starting the cycle anew. Seconds turned into minutes and Fang continued to cum. They were soaked as hot fresh seed flowed down them in torrents, the thick puddle on the floor turning into a shallow bath. David couldn\u2019t help but laugh. It was utterly ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the enormous wolf cock eventually started firing blanks, and the rain stopped. David breathed hard as he looked around him. His house was ruined. He realised that he was looking into the spare bedroom, his own head easily clearing the demolished first floor ceiling even as he sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, I\u2019m a monster.\u201d He said softly to himself, the extent of his size slowly sinking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d The wolf rumbled above him. Startled, David looked up at Fang, his heart freezing as if he felt he was busted with his cock in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looked back down on David with nervous apprehension. After all, it was him who put them in that position. The two of them looked at each other for a tense moment. David felt the wolf\u2019s heartbeat around his cock, and the wolf felt the same from David. Neither one of them exactly sure what they wanted to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Fang grimaced and pressed against David, signalling that he wanted his distance. David reciprocated and tried to help the hulking wolf off his lap, but the task was a far greater one than it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Fang been standing, he would have been over twenty five feet tall. David wasn\u2019t all that much shorter. And because the two of them sported hulking frames, the living room was simply too small for them to manoeuvre. Fang hit the far wall as soon as he had leveraged himself off David\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid winced as his cock was pulled on an awkward angle under the wolf, the space between them not enough for his member to pop free. The two of them wiggled awkwardly, trying to free as much space as they could, but it wasn\u2019t until David grabbed and painfully bent his erect member before it finally dislodged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cso, um\u2026\u201d David started, clearly embarrassed with the situation. \u201cHere we are, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked at him blankly for a moment, before sighing heavily and looking away. The wolf\u2019s breath was enough to start a short, powerful draft in the space they had forged themselves, sending smaller debris flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid swallowed at the simple and inadvertent show of power. He could acutely feel Fang\u2019s wet, soft fur pressing up against him as they sat compressed into each other. His erection still throbbed up against his chest. He had rarely felt this horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I really call out your name?\u201d Fang asked softly, still averting eye contact. \u201cBefore, when you were on top of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at Fang. \u201cYeah, you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was dreaming about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged. \u201cYeah, I figured that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause. Eventually the wolf looked up at him with blank eyes. \u201cYou called out Jess.\u201d He said solemnly.<br>\r\nDavid grimaced. \u201cWell, yeah...\u201d he began carefully. He didn\u2019t love the wolf, and he had no intention of asserting otherwise. But regardless, he still felt as if he should feel guilty of the fact. \u201cI\u2019ve had this thing for her, for like, years. I guess it\u2019s in there pretty deep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was stoic. \u201cThen you called out Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt his face drop. \u201cYou were there, too, didn\u2019t I call out your name?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf nodded slowly. \u201cYou did, but it was\u2026 it was different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid suddenly realised that he had nothing to be ashamed of. \u201cWell what the fuck did you expect, dude?\u201d he asked irritably.<br>\r\nAnother awkward pause followed. Fang eventually looked back at David, his lips curled up in a bitter smirk. \u201cWhat makes a man, Davey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d David asked, not processing the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d Fang shrugged. \u201cWhen it\u2019s all over, and they\u2019re summing you up in a eulogy\u2026 how do they define you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Fang. Why are you talking like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never think about this stuff?\u201d the wolf asked, raising his eyebrows. \u201cI wish I was more like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled and looked away. He closed his eyes as Fang continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk about how you could have lived. They don\u2019t talk about your thoughts, or your secrets. They talk about what you did with your life, don\u2019t they? What you achieved, how you treated other people\u2026 They define you by what you\u2019ve done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds fair to me.\u201d David muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sighed; disappointed that David was treating his thoughts with such disdain. \u201cIf my actions define me, then it\u2019s too late, isn\u2019t it? I can\u2019t undo what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve already defined myself. I can\u2019t stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at the wolf with hard eyes. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re not happy then do something about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shook his head. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t change what I\u2019ve done. So I can\u2019t change what I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the future, I mean.\u201d David said, feeling his patience slipping further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang kept shaking his head. \u201cThe past is still there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what?\u201d David demanded. \u201cYou think you have to keep acting like a dick? Just fucking stop it. You aren\u2019t happy. You just said that you don\u2019t even love yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not meant to.\u201d Fang replied immediately. \u201cI\u2019m not meant to love. I\u2019m not meant to be loved.\u201d The wolf dropped his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not meant to care, or be open with others. I\u2019m certainly not meant to be gay. If I was, then I would have done things differently. I would have defined myself differently. But I didn\u2019t. So I play the part. I\u2019m trapped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at the wolf. He didn\u2019t know how to take Fang. On the one hand, it seemed as if the wolf was genuinely opening up to him. But on the other, what Fang was actually saying just seemed so\u2026 stupid.  \u201cJust stop acting like a cunt.\u201d David said flatly, shaking his head disapprovingly. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that, Fang. For fuck\u2019s sake, just\u2026 grow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked at David in silence. Eventually, he said\u2026</span></div></div>",

The silence that followed his question was brutal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to think; a dangerous prospect. When he just drew blanks, he shrugged and looked back at Fang. \"Nothing,\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" the wolf hissed. \"But I.. you... What the fuck do mean 'nothing?!'\" Fang's fists were balled, if he wasn't trying to control himself, he'd already have taken half of David's face off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smiled and shrugged again. \"You want a friend? I'm being one.\" Fang was seething, a deep rumble reverberating in his throat as he stared daggers at David. David on the other hand, just kept himself composed, a soft smile on his face. \"Just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang blinked. Relax?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid reacted to the wolf's stunned face with a chuckle. \"Yeah, relax. Just... take a step back for a sec. When I'm really fucked, it's something I like to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sat back and stared at David, trying to empty his mind. The more he tried to calm down, the more frustrated he got. \"This is stupid. It doesn't solve any of my problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point, dumbass,\" David said, rolling his eyes. \"You think you have solve your problems. All by yourself.\" David puffed out his chest, even surprising himself just how much his pecs spilled out with a simple flex, and pointed at it with a thumb. \"You got a friend now, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that supposed to help?\" Fang grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you think too much, Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you don't think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" David said, punching the wolf on the shoulder playfully. Fang looked at the spot where the dragon had hit him. He had just tried to insult David, but the dragon didn't see it like that. The more he thought about it, the more he wanted to laugh. He didn't know why, it just came bubbling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang began to giggle. What was this feeling he had in the pit of his stomach? He looked at David, the dragon giving him a concerned look. He calmed himself down and muttered, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" the dragon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. For putting up with me, I guess?\" Fang looked down before continuing, \"None of the other guys treat me like you do, they all try to fight back, run, or suck my dick... uh, figuratively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's called being a friend, Fang,\" David chuckled. David didn't understand what he was feeling right now. On one hand, he was ecstatic to getting to know this softer side of Fang's, on the other, he wanted to keep himself distant, lest he fell for the wolf, something he promised himself he would never do again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. Maybe what Fang said held more merit than he anticipated. Is that why he didn't want to love Fang? Because of what the wolf has done? It wasn't fair for David to tell the wolf that his past didn't mean anything, when it was the exact reason he didn't want Fang. Any other giant-sized gay dude would be slobbering at the chance to have that hunk of wolf all to themselves. To comfort the lost, confused puppy inside that ridiculously built and endowed body of Fang's. Especially when it was painfully obvious the wolf was crazy for him. He realized he hadn't forgiven Fang yet; for fucking over his life, for hurting his friends and his brother, and heck, hurting him. And no matter how much he wanted to, he couldn't bring himself to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang,\" David said quietly. The wolf looked at him, their moods both somber now. \"We're friends now right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" the wolf stammered, not sure where David was going with this. In the back of his mind, Fang wanted David to come back to him, to love him again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking of what you said. About no one loving you,\" the dragon said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's heart was racing. Could David want him back? He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was short-lived as he watched David shake his head. \"Not like that, Fang. I... I do love you. Just as a friend. You said you weren't meant to be loved, or love. But you gotta stop lying to yourself. You are what you are, aren't you? And what you are...\" David leaned forward and began to tickle Fang's stomach. \"Is a big softie, with a killer bod who any guy would be lucky to have as a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you mean it?\" the wolf laughed, pushing David's hands away. When he looked at David, he still felt the lust, the desire to be with the dragon. But at the same time, he was just happy to know him, to be a friend. It was an unusual feeling, but Fang almost felt safe with David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid chuckled and nodded. \"Of course I do, bud. Look, you said you've already 'defined' yourself to be this huge jackass. But talking with you now, it's kinda nice. You're not a bad guy to actually just hang with, y'know? And all those things you said you weren't meant for, those are the things you want in life. Some things change, Fang, but I know you've never been one to not fight for the things you want. Definitions change, Fang. It's never fast, but it happens. Just take it one step at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang could feel a tear welling up in his eye, and he quickly wiped it away. \"One step at a time, eh? Where'd that come from?\" The wolf chuckled, \"You really know how to butter a guy up, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, so I've heard.\" David shrugged casually and chuckled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang leaned back, debris falling everywhere from the sheer mass the wall was trying to hold. Maybe he wasn't trapped after all, he could change right? He did it for David, but the dragon was special, he didn't know why, but even though he knew his feelings were unrequited, he was still crazy for David. He didn't know how he should feel. On one hand he was glad that he had a heart to break, on the other, he was heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut feeling was a start. David was right, he always got what he wanted. And he wanted to change. But more than anything, he wanted David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked down at David's cock, the shaft hadn't gone limp after all this time. It excited Fang, knowing that David might also be covering up feelings. Fang licked his lips. He wanted the drake for himself so badly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat?\u201d David asked dumbly, his eyes firmly on the shaft the wolf was holding. He had started to pull the wolf away, but he simply froze under the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI beat him up pretty badly.\u201d Fang said, a slight hint of remorse in his voice. \u201cSomething inside me snapped. It was like how I\u2026\u201d The wolf trailed off, hesitant to finish the sentence. \u201cIt was like how I beat you up, just before.\u201d He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s body was still tense under the wolf\u2019s touch. He swallowed and nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen him in the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Fang asked his eyes widening in surprise. Fang quickly became self-aware, and with a faint shake of his head feigned composure. \u201cOh\u2026 well, how was he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs bad as you probably think he is.\u201d David said flatly. David looked back down at the grip Fang still had on his cock. He didn\u2019t know if he wanted the wolf to let go or start jerking him off\u2026 but either seemed preferable to the suspense. \u201cHe was unconscious and connected to machines and shit. But how the hell are you going to do anything about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang cocked his head the question. \u201cAre you serious? Dude, your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d David cut off, his raging hormones making it sound more aggressive than he intended. \u201cI mean, how are you actually going to do this? Say you get a mouthful of my\u2026 stuff. What, are you just gonna go walk through the wall, to the hospital and give it to a nurse with your recommendation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang blinked at David. \u201cWell\u2026 \u201c he began, but quickly realised he had nothing. \u201cFuck.\u201d He swore under his breath as he finally let go of David\u2019s shaft. The enormous black rod twitched, feeling suddenly cold without the touch of the wolf\u2019s paw. David sighed and relaxed as Fang sat back against the far wall, though he would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang stared at the ceiling that stood just a foot or so above his muzzle. \u201cWe could give it to someone else, like Tyler? Or Jess?\u201d he asked tentatively with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s mood immediately darkened at the mention of the fox\u2019s name. It brought Fang\u2019s crimes back to the forefront of his mind. \u201cYou\u2019d do well not to have anything to do with her ever again. Or her friend.\u201d He said with a low tone, deciding not to risk getting the t-rex\u2019s name wrong again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang didn\u2019t seem to pick up on the significance of the drake\u2019s comment as he waved an impatient hand at him. \u201cWhatever, my point is that someone else could do it. We don\u2019t have to go there ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid thought to himself for a moment. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked the wolf, reconsidering his initial position. Fang cocked a suspicious eyebrow as he waited for David to continue. \u201cI mean, are we just going to sit here the rest of our lives? We\u2019re going to have to get out of here at some point, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scoffed. \u201cYeah, but not for this, surely?\u201d he looked at David as if he were an idiot. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like you said, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re going to attract attention. This is the sort of shit which will get on the news. People will be asking questions. They will want to know what happened. Don't get me wrong, fuck them all. But we won\u2019t be able to fit into the hospital, let alone sneak Marcus anything. We can do all that later, but not before we do this. I mean, isn\u2019t it a bit obvious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked out of the spare bedroom window. It was getting late in the afternoon. But there was a foreboding about the street outside, and it wasn\u2019t just because everything looked frighteningly small. The scene was very much out of reach for the time being. He suddenly felt trapped in the tight, dilapidated space he shared with the wolf. \u201cYeah thanks to you.\u201d David almost whined. \u201cFuck it Fang, we can\u2019t even go and visit the fucking hospital. Why did you do this to us? How the fuck are we meant to live our lives? What were you thinking?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, before you said I thought too much.\u201d The wolf smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you Fang!\u201d David spat, his fury escalating at the wolf\u2019s casualness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Fang growled, his eyes suddenly hard. But his expression gradually melted under David\u2019s glare, and he lowered his eyes as his shoulders slumped. \u201cThis is what I was talking about earlier. I can\u2019t undo what I\u2019ve done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes and tried to calm down. He had worked himself up, and he was shaking anxiously. He took several deep breaths as he tried to step away from the situation. With one final exhale he opened his eyes, his mind blank.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Tyler, anyway?\u201d Fang asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d He said as he stared distantly at the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, does he have a cell or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid paused before shaking his head. \u201cNot on him. He was naked. What difference would that make anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang gave David a playful smile. \u201cYou have a phone in the kitchen, right?\u201d he asked as he shifted his frame, reaching one of his massive arms into the kitchen doorway next to his knee. He poked his tongue out as he carefully fished around the other side of the wall, before smiling and retrieving the tiny cordless handset. He sat back up and held it to his face, squinting at the buttons as he carefully pressed one with his fingernail.  \u201cHeh, it still works.\u201d The wolf smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, now all we need is someone to call.\u201d David said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat numbers do you know?\u201d Fang asked, looking up from the tiny handset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled. \u201cOff the top of my head? None, they\u2019re all on my phone, and good knows where that is now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang stared blankly at the wall behind David before turning his attention back to the phone, and carefully started punching in numbers with one of his fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d David half queried, half demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScott.\u201d Fang said, referring to an old high school friend of theirs that had dropped out of college the year before. \u201cHe still lives with his parents. I\u2019ve called this number since I was a kid.\u201d Fang said as he lifted the tiny handpiece to his giant ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched the wolf sceptically, silently wishing that the wolf had consulted him before doing anything. The last thing he wanted to add to this situation was old friends. Fang abruptly jerked his head as his phone call was answered. \u201cIs Scott there? It\u2019s Greggory Nathaniel.\u201d He rumbled, his mouth nowhere near the handset. There was a pause. \u201cGreggory Nathaniel\u201d he repeated. He blinked slowly, clearly growing impatient. \u201cGreggory Nathaniel.\u201d He repeated again, his voice soft but aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes at David. David stared daggars at the wolf as he waited patiently. \u201cScott\u2026 listen man, I was just after Jessica Hallows\u2019s number. I know you have it.\u201d The wolf spoke as softly as he could. Anger flashed across his golden eyes. \u201cFang.\u201d He snapped. There was a pause before he snarled. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking care, just give me the damned number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rolled his eyes. Fang was the way he was because everyone let him get away with it. There was no surprise that the wolf was quickly reciting the number that was being read to him. As soon as he had finished, he hung up the phone without so much as a goodbye and began typing the numbers in, reciting them under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t seriously calling her? What did I just fucking say?!\u201d David snapped at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shook his head as he held the phone out to the drake. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do the talking man.\u201d He said defensively. \u201cJust speak softly and hold the phone away from you when you talk. Otherwise they can\u2019t hear you because it sounds like you\u2019re shouting, apparently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took the phone, staring at it sceptically. Why were they calling Jess? The last thing he wanted to do was haul her over here next to an oversized version of the wolf that had raped her the night before. And that was even assuming she would agree to come over. What motivation would she have to do them any favours, let alone one of this magnitude? This was a stupid idea. David decided to hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he brought the phone in close to him to fiddle with the end call button, he heard Jess answer on the other end. \u201cHello?\u201d a faint voice called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid flinched and quickly brought the phone to his ear. \u201cUh, hi Jess, it\u2019s David.\u201d He mumbled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jess demanded on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSofter!\u201d Fang hissed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s David.\u201d He repeated, speaking as quietly as he could without whispering. His voice wasn\u2019t THAT loud, was it?<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause on the other end. \u201cDavid Matthews? What the fuck is up with your voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave a wry smile. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted me to get huge. So here I am.\u201d He said, gesturing weakly at his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you kick Fang\u2019s ass?\u201d Jess demanded impatiently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, a bit.\u201d David said as he looked up at the wolf. \u201cBut a lot of stuff has happened since then. Listen, I was hoping you could do a favour for me? It\u2019s kind of a big one, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jess\u2019s tone was one of incredulity, rather than inquiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to take something to the hospital to give to Marcus. But you can\u2019t let anyone see you give it to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess gave out a sharp, mirthless laugh. \u201cYeah, right. Why don\u2019t you get Tyler to be your drug mule?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s eyes widened. He began to wonder how the hell she had managed to jump to that conclusion when he remembered that he had already explained everything to her the night before. David sighed into the headset. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess paused again before replying\u2026</span></div></div>",

No. We're shopping for clothes. You know how hard it is to get designer stuff that fits a 10 foot tall fatass like Tyler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid heard someone rumbling in the distance over the phone. \"That Tyler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess sighed into the phone. \"Yeah, he's complaining it's too tight. He also apologized to me for eating my entire fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid genuinely laughed. \"Hey, he's a big guy now, needs his food. And don't get him designers, costs too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I'm going to be seen with him, he better look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of David's heart sank and paused for a bit. \"So, you and Tyler, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Ew, no way would I date the nerd. He's just, uh... hired muscle.\" Her dismissive tone was a dead giveaway. If he could, David would facepalm, Jess always had a weird way of saying she's into a guy, though maybe not as weird as Fang. Though unlike Fang, she wasn't really trying to hide anything. In a hushed tone he heard her say, \"Okay, but just between you and me, since I'm your fag hag now, I have to say, you have good taste in men. I won't judge you doing it with your bro, but whoa, you made him <i>hot</i>, especially down-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, okay, Jess, too much information,\" David said, his cheeks burning madly. \"Can you just put Tyler on... please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you're no fun. Honestly, I'm just glad you kicked Fang's ass to kingdom come,\" she said as if it were fact. David on the other hand chuckled nervously. \"I'm in a good mood now. Just don't kill the guy, save some ass-whoopin' for me. I bet I can hit him harder than you do, fairy-cakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah... sure thing,\" David said, looking at Fang. The wolf cocked an eyebrow as if to ask, 'What's happening?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaaay, passing it off to Tyler now, ciao bella my prima donna of a dragon, mwah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf David had hair, he'd be ripping it out right now. Sure Jessica could be abrasive, but she transitioned into aggravating when she was happy... or mad, or... just about everything other than neutral on the emotional spectrum. Did Tyler tell her about him liking guys? He knew she had her suspicions, but to be full on derisive... David sighed, realizing it didn't matter if Tyler told her or not, it was Jess he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was interrupted by the sharp noise of the phone being tossed around as another person picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" The voice was deep and resounding. David let out a sigh of relief, it was his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me Ty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David? What happened to your voice?\" Tyler blurted, not believing what he was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same thing that happened to yours when you grew, duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not mad at me?\" the purple drake whispered into the mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad? Why would I be mad at you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause before Tyler spoke up. \"You know, you didn't want me around you, so I thought-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just protecting you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you protecting me!\" Even at his new size, Tyler could still whine like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid chuckled before calmly responding, \"Yeah, I know, bro. But, I'm your big brother. Trust me when I say big.\" David snorted, looking over his body. \"I'll always try to protect you, no matter how much you hate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon looked at the wolf sitting across from him. Fang made a gesture of pretending to stick a finger down his throat and retching. David responded by squinting at Fang, shaking his head and sticking his tongue out. They were both smiling and David was kind of glad Tyler didn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Tyler said. \"So uh, how've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, Tyler,\" David chuckled, \"Stop beating around the bush, I know you want to talk about your score with Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... I dunno if I'd call it a score...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I was just talking to her, she totally thinks you as her boyfriend-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid cut himself off when he looked at Fang, the big wolf shaking his foot impatiently. The wolf mouth, \"Any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, Tyler, uh, when you're done shopping with Jess, can you drop by our house? I sort of need your help. It's about that thing you said about Marcus... about healing him,\" David said, trailing off at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me, to bring your cum to Marcus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Fang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang's alright. He won't bite anymore, I promise.\" David stole a glance at the wolf, the lupine ears trying hard to eavesdrop, but seemingly failing to pick up Tyler's half of the conversation, all he knew is that they were talking about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I believe you,\" Tyler sighed. \"So, you want me to sneak your 'stuff' in and feed it to Marcus? What should I do then? Bring him over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed, \"As much as I'd like that, I don't think he's ready. I mean, yeah I like him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I get it... So what happens if this all works out? Fang goes to jail or something and then you and Marcus ride off into the sunset?\" Tyler said with a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. But...\" David paused and smile wryly, \"You forgot about you and Jess. You guys make a cute couple too. Though, not as cute as us. What was it, me and my boyfriend walking along the beach, my snout nuzzling into his fur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was hysterical. \"Wow, when'd you get so gay, David?\" The two brothers both shared a moment over the phone. That is until there was a shrill voice coming over Tyler's end. \"Uh, okay, gotta go, bro. Jess is mad cause I'm using all her minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was good talking to you, Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" David ended the call. The blue dragon sat back and smiled. He was happy, Jess seemed to be in a good mood, he didn't burn a bridge with Tyler, heck he;d get to show off to his brother soon. But that's when concern set in. He didn't tell Jess or Tyler about Fang being larger than ever. Or the fact that healing Marcus was the wolf's idea. A wave of fear washed over him. Sometimes he wished he thought more before shit like this happened. Sometimes, he wished he wasn't an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse when he looked at Fang, the wolf's eyes had a glint in them. Soon that edging fear turned into full-blown terror as Fang's arms gripped his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's true,\" the wolf said. When David looked up at Fang's face, he was shocked to him smiling. \"You like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid furrowed his brow. \"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so dumb sometimes, Davey. Talking to Tyler about wanting me as your boyfriend, when I'm sitting right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization struck David yet again. \"No, Fang, it's not what you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's okay, David, you're wrong. I'm totally ready. I'll do better, I'll change for you.\" The wolf pulled David in closer, their chests bumping into one another, the wolf resting his head on the drake's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was stuck in a rut. Fang had completely misinterpreted his conversation with Tyler, only hearing what he said to his brother. And there laid the dilemma, He'd either have to play along to the pretense of liking Fang romantically, and David knew how bad he was at lying... or he'd have to crush this giant's heart when he's in such a fragile state. If the wolf found out he liked Marcus still, who know's what Fang would do, how far would his destruction spread in a fit of anger and jealousy? If he didn't play this properly, he could risk undoing all the progress Fang has made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf continued of his hopelessly hopeful banter. \"...And if you want to go to the beach, we'll do that. Fuck everyone else, if you want to stroll down the beach with me, then we'll do it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang,\" David said sternly. The dragon bit his tongue and tried to clear his mind, saying the first thing that popped into his head.</span></div></div>",

When David\u2019s brain was switched off, there was always another organ willing to fill the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scoffed, smiling eagerly as he looked down into David\u2019s eyes. The drake didn\u2019t have much time to react before the wolf pulled him in, his larger muzzle almost enveloping David\u2019s snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared wide eyed as he felt the wolf\u2019s tongue pry his jaw open. Fang roughly traced his enormous paws over David\u2019s back as he pulled the drake tightly into his body. The two of them didn\u2019t have much room to move, and the position of their legs made the embrace awkward, but it was more than enough to get David\u2019s heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned his frame forwards into the wolf, closing his own eyes as he returned the kiss. The two giants breathed unevenly as they invested all their energy into the kiss. David traced his own claws over the wolf\u2019s torso, the soft fur contrasting with the hard iron muscles that lay beneath it. The scent of the wolf was the only thing he could smell. In that moment, Fang consumed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock raged as hard as ever, the head tingling softly, yearning for a piece of the action. It found some a moment later as the wolf\u2019s own erection knocked against it, and together they spurted each other with pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang broke from the kiss first, and with half open eyes started licking David\u2019s cheek. The drake panted heavily as he felt the wolf\u2019s tongue lap against him. He noticed that there was debris falling around them, apparently they were obvious to the damage they were adding to the house. But David couldn\u2019t care. He tried to rub his face against the wolf, but Fang had already started working his way down his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just watched in hot anticipation as the wolf rounded his attention to his chest, and then jumped the gap to the tip of his cock. David gasped as he felt the wolf\u2019s tongue lightly work his head. The wolf released one hand from David\u2019s back to work his ebony shaft. David couldn\u2019t help but cry out. He was by no means a novice when it came to sex, but it had seldom felt this good. David bit his bottom lip as he felt the wolf\u2019s mouth close in over the sensitive flesh once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis felt so good, and yet so wrong. Why? It wasn\u2019t actually all that bad, was it? He may not actually love the wolf, but if Fang was true to his word about wanting to change, then he\u2019s have no reason not to love him anymore, would he? And if Fang didn\u2019t change\u2026 well then, that\u2019s his own fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after all, he had never actually spoken to Marcus about anything. Sure, the kangaroo had given him an unsolicited blowjob, but he was drunk. Everything else between them only existed in David\u2019s head. What If Marcus had no such interest in him? It was kind of arrogant for David to assume that Marcus liked him in that way, wasn\u2019t it? So what was the point of holding back for something that might not exist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was always the possibility that he was just being shallow. The wolf turned him on, now more than ever. And it didn\u2019t hurt that he was right there next to him, when David was just so damned horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang started to lift his head up and down over David\u2019s cock, working the head with his tongue as he swallowed pre. \u201cOh, shit\u2026\u201d David said under his breath as he stared at the wolf\u2019s head. This was a mistake. He was making a mistake. But he couldn\u2019t stop it now, even if he wanted to. And he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid reached over the top of the wolf\u2019s back, and tried to pull himself up on his knees. He wanted to actively fuck the wolf\u2019s mouth again, but as he felt his shoulder tear through another piece of the ground floor ceiling, he resigned in frustration. He settled with resting a hand on the wolf\u2019s soft head as he whined at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf chuckled to himself as he tried to take more and more of the drake\u2019s length in his mouth. \u201cFuck, Fang\u2026 I\u2019m gonna cum!\u201d David moaned. He tried to force the wolf\u2019s head away from him, but he may have pressed down on it further. The wolf growled playfully in response as he continued to work the drake\u2019s cock. David closed his eyes as he felt the pressure build. \u201cUngh, Fang\u2026\u201d he whined as he felt himself cross the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snarled wid-eyed as his claws dug into the wolf\u2019s pelt. He spasmed violently forwards, one of his feet extending through the far wall into the yard outside.  His cock exploded into the wolf\u2019s mouth, the sudden pressure so great that it shot out of Fang\u2019s nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s eyes went wide as he coughed in surprise, but he didn\u2019t pull his head away. \u201cFuck!\u201d David roared as he jerked his massive frame roughly, sending an elbow through the kitchen wall. It was the most intense orgasm he had ever felt, and just as it was beginning to fade, he felt his balls clench, and the pleasure started anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang had gained some composure, and instead of swallowing the load in uneven gulps, simply managed to let as much as the stream flow down his throat as he could. However, soon even he couldn\u2019t keep up with all of it, and he was forced off the drake\u2019s shaft coughing and retching. David continued to cum on the wolf\u2019s chest for a few more moments before he finally ran dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked up at David with glazed eyes and started to giggle. \u201chehe, I\u2019ve shint an abou\u2026\u201d he trailed off as he slurred his gibberish, resting his head affectionately against David\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared wide-eyed at the wolf, the two of them panting heavily. David could feel the wolf start to press against him harder as he grew. David swallowed. He was pressed up hard against the wall, and didn\u2019t have any confidence that it would fully bare his weight, let alone that of the growing wolf as well. He tried to push the wolf away from him, but fang unconsciously fought the movement, wanting to get nearer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith closed eyes, Fang traced his massive paws up David\u2019s arms and neck, stopping when they both held a side of his head. The wolf held David a moment, his mouth wide open, his tongue draped over the end of his muzzle. And then, with a mouth doused in cum, he leant in and kissed David. The drake\u2019s instincts fought against the kiss, he didn\u2019t want to get any bigger. But the wolf was uncompromising, and they were soon in another passionate embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang rumbled as he rose higher above the drake. David could feel the wolf start to loom down over him. He held the wolf by his shoulders, and could feel the slabs of muscle swell in his grip, even as they dragged his hands further higher. David would have fallen backwards were it not for the thick tail between his legs that helped stabilise him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt his own warmth spread through his body as he swallowed the wolf\u2019s kisses. It wasn\u2019t enough to send him on his own trip, but he could feel a renewed surge in his loins, as well as the floor underneath him start to pinch against his expanding frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as David grew, Fang never stopped expanding relative to him. David was quickly knocked back into reality as he heard a crunching noise above him. He opened his eyes, and started as he saw the enormous wolf rise up into the attic, bringing a barrage of plaster and wooden beams down onto them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second crash came from below them as the wolf\u2019s hips pressed into the kitchen, demolishing what was left of the wall. A pipe burst in between floors, causing a sudden spurt of water to burst down onto their torsos as the wolf continued to expand, ploughing into more space, hollowing out the insides of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expanding wolf was also pressing against David, forcing him into the front wall with increasing stress. He felt the brick wall begin to buckle under his weight. The drake was panicking. Fang was about to burst through the house.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut just as he was beginning to think that the walls wouldn\u2019t hold anymore, the wolf\u2019s growth stopped. David didn\u2019t dare to move, pressed in all directions. He sat in a pool of cum and debris, a single foot poking into the yard outside as the wolf unconsciously masturbated next to him, his elbow rhythmically poking him painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled. Why the fuck had the wolf swallowed? He was meant to be trying to change, but he still obviously had the urge to take ever more size and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a moment, the drake sighed. Could he really blame him? After all, David had himself acted on impulse. And damn it, he bet he would be willing to do so again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes tightly. What the fuck was wrong with him? Sure, he had got a bit of his own cum, and a renewed libido was just one of the effects he had come to expect form that. But the growth was also changing them. The two of them were cumming longer and harder, and their genitals were growing bigger than the rest of them. It was like they were turning into some kind of sex gods. And so far, they hadn\u2019t really been using the power with any sort of responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to relax as the wolf pressed down on him. Fang wasn\u2019t waking up immediately after his trip. Despite the awkward shape he was forced to contour his body in, he was content to simply sit there, holding David closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed.  He knew Fang had some strong feelings for him. But David wasn\u2019t reciprocating them. Yes, the wolf turned him on. But aside from that, David just felt\u2026 numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost track of time, but eventually David started when\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler made his way up to the house. So much has changed since last afternoon. Back then, he had parked his truck into the driveway, hopped out of the driver's seat and scampered his way to the front door, eager to check the status of his orders online for his hobby shop. He smirked, it all seemed to different now. He looked at his paw, and trailed along the meaty arm, drinking in the network of veins feeding the raw power that now coursed through him. He was complete stud, and he walked like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't because he was cocky, well, not completely, it just felt natural to sway his shoulders one in front of the other as he walked, showing off his statuesque upper body. It didn't help that the outfit Jessica had picked out for him accentuated his brawny physique, just a simple white wife-beater covered by a striped short-sleeve button-down, complete with none of the buttons done, a pair of shades hooked onto his undershirt, straddling the valley between his overdeveloped pecs, and the largest pair of jeans she could find for him. If Jess's goal for Tyler was to make him look like the alpha douchebag on campus, she had succeeded; something that made Tyler just a little self-conscious but proud at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler approached the porch, he got excited. He couldn't wait to see his brother standing triumphantly atop Fang's crushed body. He hated the wolf for almost killing him, playing him for a sucker with that Shakespeare crap, threatening David, but most of all: for raping Jess. It was a major damper on his attempts to get closer to her. He remembered David telling him that she was into him, but if that were true, it didn't really show. Sure the vixen would hold his hand as she pulled him across the mall, and sure, he could tell she looked over his buff bod every once in a while, catching her blush when he bounced his pecs for her. But every time he'd try to get closer to her; hug her, a peck on the cheek, or even just wrapping his arm around her, she'd push him off. He didn't feel like he was Jessica's boyfriend, he felt like he was her guard dog. Just a big brute to stand next to her so other guys won't try to mess with her. And it made sense, after what Fang did to her? Who wouldn't want a bit of security? And that made Tyler seethe. He cracked his knuckles as he approached the door, he was going to enjoy messing with a dethroned Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twisted the doorknob and his snide attitude instantly melted. He didn't have to look inside, the door was barely open a sliver, before a wave of strong musk flooded his olfactory senses. It was revolting. Tyler almost felt himself gag and puke when it first hit him. That's when he got a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He feared what he would see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake held his breath, lowering his head so he could peer into the expanse of his home. What he saw scared the living daylights out of him. At first it just looked like a large mass of black fur. But then he noticed that black fur was so defined. Tyler gulped and forced his way into the house. That's when he got his first good look at what Fang had become. The behemoth of a wolf had his damn eyes closed, his body destroying their home, his head pushing all the way into the attic. He was lost in what must have been one heck of a wet dream, a pillar of flesh jutting out his crotch, past the first floor ceiling, swaying pendulously and twitching ever so often as it oozed pre all over the black canine's sternum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's body was chiseled, proportions larger than any Greek god, arms that put Hercules to shame, a broad torso to topple over Zeus himself; Atlas held the world on his back, Fang looked like he could do that with one hand tied behind his back. It didn't help that a broken pipe accentuated the deep crevices of the wolf's killer set of abs. Tyler wouldn't admit it, but he was extremely jealous of the wolf's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned is head, only to see his brother looking down at him. The blue drake's eyes probing for a reaction. What did Tyler think? He didn't know yet, he was too busy looking at just how big David had gotten too. He looked like a Fang in training, just less bulky over all, and definitely not as stupidly endowed, but holy hell, Tyler thought, David way overdid it. Fang must be over 35ft tall, just way too big. And his brother? The behemoth blue dragon could top up over 20ft easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler? You okay?\" David said softly. Though to the purple drake it came out as a bass-laden rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler wanted to be mad. David grew Fang. He fucking grew FANG! But despite all that, he couldn't get mad at his brother. At the end of the day, he knew his big brother would always made stupid mistakes, and he was sick of having to point them out. Tyler sighed and shook his head, \"I'm fine, bro. But I can't say I approve of what you've done to the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let out a sigh of relief, Tyler seemed to be taking it well. \"Yeah, I- we got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler couldn't help but hiss at the sound of 'we.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I thought you were against growing Fang. He's a psychopath, David. He's using you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" David interjected, looking sternly down at Tyler. \"He's not the one using someone... I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tyler said abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's complicated. Fang... Fang loves me, Ty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he doesn't, that asshole only loves himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what he wants you to think. In reality, he's just scared of everyone figuring out he's not all that much of a tough guy. You should see it Ty, he can actually be pretty sweet,\" David said, almost remorsefully. It was true, Fang could be a big softie if he wanted to, and that made David feel really guilty for just using him for sex. Sure, Fang wanted the growth and power, but he also wanted David. The blue dragon on the other hand just wanted to bust a nut, and Fang was the just the hottest thing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's tricking you, David,\" Tyler's vehemence was growing. \"I can't believe you can be so stupid. Forget about healing Marcus, we need to take care of Fang. Now.\" Tyler's tone was assertive, trying to be commanding. If David wasn't the older brother, he'd probably have followed the purple drake's authoritative command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Tyler... Healing Marcus was Fang's idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Tyler roared. \"Don't lie to me, dude. That's not funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. I'm telling you, Fang's changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rubbed his temple. \"So you grew him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He grew because... some of it was him. But most of it was me. I got carried away by the prospect of seeing him get huge. I know, it's wrong. And to make it worse, I'm just using him for sex. He thought we were talking about him on the phone, about him being my boyfriend, not Marcus. You should've seen him, he was like a pup on Christmas morning. I couldn't tell him that I don't love him back, that I still hate him for what he's done to all of us. But he needs me, Tyler. I'm trying my best just to be his friend., but all I do is use him to fulfill some sick fantasy of mine.\" David started to tear up a bit, ashamed of what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sighed and looked at the slumbering wolf; he knew David was telling the truth, that's what he liked about his brother, you could always count on him being stupidly honest. However, something didn't seem quite right. He glared up to look at Fang's face. \"Hey, Fang, you can stop pretending to be asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's golden eyes opened, half-lidded, looking down. His ears folded back and he whimpered. \"Yeah, you caught me, Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gulped. Fang was awake? \"Fang, babe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me that, Davey- David,\" Fang said solemnly. He smirked and chuckled mirthlessly. \"Congrats, you managed to outwit this wolf for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, no! I didn't mean to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up, David.\" Fang looked defeated. \"Just... shut up,\" he repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sat back, the wall started to cave and the whole house groaned in protest. He felt so rotten. And worst of all, Fang looked mad. He could have caused Fang to turn back into the cold, evil wolf he knew Fang didn't want to be again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf let out a low growl and stared hurtfully at the two dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was right...</span></div></div>",

He raised his hands and started pushing against the walls that surrounded him, shifting his sprawling legs to find some leverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house started falling down before the wolf could actually burst out of it. David felt the wall to his back crumble as the roof above imploded. He had only one thought in his mind as the debris started raining down everywhere. With one desperate movement, he grabbed hold of Tyler and pulled him in, rolling his broad blue back over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe falling rubble couldn\u2019t pierce his thick hide, but they should as hell bruised the flesh underneath it. The sound of destruction was deafening. One particularly large wooden beam struck him on the side of his neck, Dazing David as he sensed the wolf rise in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they were outside. It seemed like an abrupt shift, one moment the world was falling down on top of them, the next David could feel the sunlight start to flood his frame. There was a slight breeze in the air as things started to settle, the sound of crashing debris growing softer and more dispersed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, David craned his neck to peer at the scene. The far wall of his house still stood, a fraction of the surrounding walls and roof still tenuously attached. But the rest of it was gone, collapsed in a pile of rubble around them that gradually diffused across the yard and into the rest of the neighborhood. A pair of thick, towering feet rose from the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf towered above everything but the tallest trees. His stance was wide, his back arched as he stretched his hands out wide, his muscles bulging with raw power. His chest was solid and unimaginably thick. But filling the scene above David was a ridiculously long and thick cylinder of pink flesh swayed out from his hips, complimented by two enormously heavy testicles swinging low, weighing on the wolf\u2019s scrotum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snorted as he looked down on them. \u201cIt feels good to finally stand up again David. There\u2019s so much more power behind it. Go on, try it yourself. Get the fuck up!\u201d The wolf sneered, slamming a massive black foot into David\u2019s shoulder, sending the two drakes flying across the front yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shattered the concrete sidewalk as he rolled onto it. Alarmed, he shot a frantic gaze at Tyler. His brother was alright, he had already found his feet, and was slowly backpedalling form the towering wolf, intense fear plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked up at the wolf and swallowed. It wasn\u2019t just his size that terrified him. It wasn't the familiar cocky smirk. It was his eyes. They were intense and bloodshot. The wolf was crying, his enormous frame trembling as he hulked over him. The cocky words, stance and expression were just his veneer, a shield that masked the raging cauldron that lay underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang, just calm down, alright? We can sort this shit out!\u201d David cried up at him desperately as he got to his feet. He realised with alarm that he barely stood above the wolf\u2019s massive erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smiled as he shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing TO sort out. You said so yourself, you hate me for what I\u2019ve done.  I can\u2019t change a damned thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Fang, don\u2019t do it for me dude, do it for yourself! You\u2019ve\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLETS NOT!\u201d The wolf roared down on David, causing the drake to cower as his voice shook nearby trees. Fang licked his lips as he struggled to find some composure. \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that anymore. Back to plan A, David. You want to use me for sex? Well, I\u2019m fine with that. You use me, I\u2019ll use you. It\u2019s like I said. Win-win. That\u2019s the only dynamic we\u2019re gonna share.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head, unable to find words to counter the wolf. \u201cBut what about Marcus then?\u201d he finally blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf began to moan, but managed to morph it into a sharp laugh. \u201cFuck Marcus!\u201d he spat. \u201cDo you think I care about some faggy Kangaroo? I\u2019ll bury him myself if I see him again. I don\u2019t want him distracting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned to his brother. Tyler was ridiculously small. The purple drake didn\u2019t even stand halfway up one of the wolf\u2019s thick thighs. He started to panic \u2013 what if Fang hurt Tyler just to get back at him? \u201cRun, Tyler!\u201d David shouted at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang chuckled mirthlessly. \u201cYes, run Tyler. You don\u2019t want to know what I\u2019m going to do to you if you don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took another step backwards, but was otherwise defiant. But before David could press the point, Fang advanced towards the blue drake. \u201cYou say you hate me David?\u201d he growled, crouching down. \u201cHate is a pretty strong word. I mean, once you hate something, you have nowhere left to go when it gets even worse, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf cocked his head slightly, his face void of all expression. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you reasons to truly hate me. This is just the beginning you tiny blue fuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the wolf swooped David up with one hand, slinging the drake over his shoulder. It all happened so fast, David couldn\u2019t even fight back as he felt himself hurtling through the air with incredible force. He was folded over one of the wolf\u2019s broad shoulders by the time he had recovered his orientation, a massively thick hand restraining his hips, locking him in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut him down Fang!\u201d Tyler cried out desperately as Fang started to rise back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Tyler. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Fang laughed down on him. Again, the wolf wiped his face clean of expression as he cocked his head slightly. \u201cDo you know how far I can punt?\" he asked the drake curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang half-skipped forwards towards the purple drake, his left foot slamming down onto the ground below. His right foot kicked up and began to swing towards the purple Drake. The world seemed to go into slow-motion as Tyler stared in terror at the enormous black paw that accelerated towards him. No, he realised. The world wasn\u2019t slow, the enormous wolf was. Not in raw figures, his foot advanced like a speeding train. But relative to his size. Tyler was able to dive out of the way as the black furry pillar flew through where he used to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlippery cunt, aren\u2019t we?\u201d the wolf sneered down at him, clearly frustrated. Tyler backed up into their yard as the wolf turned to face him again. The purple drake was terrified as the wolf took another step towards him, his enormous paw sinking through the asphalt as if it were an eggshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler darted his gaze between the wolf\u2019s eyes and his feet. The wolf squared his stance on Tyler, his big black paws splayed across the front of the yard, boxing the drake in. Fang sneered down on him contemptuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done this without you, you know.\u201d The wolf smiled down at him, sniffing loudly. \u201cYou really got in David\u2019s way, really fucked him over. How many times did I wake up to you holding David up, crying like a bitch? All that time wasted on you being such a fucking prima donna. I bet it was your idea to bring him back last night, hey? Am I right Tyler? You wanted to fight me, you wanted to prove yourself. You threw your own brother to the wolf, just for a bit of self-gratification, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake shook his head, his mouth moving but no words came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang started laughing. It started off somewhat genuine, but seemed to degenerate into soft sobs. With another sniff, the wolf regained his cocksure smirk. \u201cTyler, I\u2019m a psychopathic wolf, because that\u2019s how I act. I\u2019ll let you think about why you might be a useless, selfish sponge who sucks the life out of everyone around you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stared at each other in silence before the wolf suddenly waved the fingers on his free hand at him. \u201cToodles!\u201d the wolf said with exaggerated cheerfulness, and turned to walk away, the blue drake still slung tightly over his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pressed his arms against the wolf\u2019s back, trying to pry himself up so he could see his brother as they walked away. Tyler stared back up at him as he idly moved his bulky frame, his eyes wide and urgent. But he knew he was helpless. The distance between them quickly expanded, and they were a street away after just half a dozen of the wolf\u2019s footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid moaned. This was all his fault. He could have stopped this, at several points. But for his own selfish reasons, he didn\u2019t. All he had done was increase the physical gap between the wolf and himself, as well as give Fang even more motivation. How many people could the wolf hurt now? He couldn\u2019t think about what would happen next \u2013 it was simply too terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang, I want you to change.\u201d David said, trying in vain to turn around as he addressed the wolf. \u201cAlright, I don\u2019t love you. But I\u2019m still your friend, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, don\u2019t bother.\u201d Fang chuckled bitterly. \u201cYou\u2019re getting all cocky now. But lemme just say that what happened back in the house, when I said all that stupid shit? That was because of my own fucking weakness, not because you were some mastermind playing me. I won\u2019t do that to myself again, so just stop embarrassing us both.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid swallowed. Resigned, he simply flopped his torso down over the wolf\u2019s back, just watching the road pass underneath, a deep paw shaped crevice piercing the asphalt with each step the wolf took. David could tell where the wolf was taking him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison was jogging along the campus grounds, enjoying the scenery, waving at a couple of friends from class as she passed by. Jessica was right, she always was. Earlier that day, you wouldn't be able to get this t-rex out of her bed. Her world had crumbled around her, all she could think about was the hot breath of the man that raped her beating down on her face. Fang was a monster no doubt. She remembered the screaming, the pleading, but most of all she remembered the hungry look on his face. And when he came in her, there was no joy in his release, she was nothing to him, just a tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that made her feel dirty. That night she didn't sleep, she just curled up on her bed, sometimes feeling sorry for herself, sometimes cursing Fang, sometimes weeping, and occasionally getting up to take a shower to try and rid herself of the damn'd spot that forever stained her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings only got worse when Jess brought Tyler in that morning. Alli always had a crush on the little guy, he was smart, funny and most importantly into geeky stuff like her. And he looked stunning when he saved her, he was like a hero to her. She knew he had gotten bigger somehow, but when he sauntered in, her eyes went wide. That was definitely not the Tyler she remembered. The guy was huge, bigger than Fang. Not to mention, the purple drake was handsome. And that stirred her loins, which only made her more ashamed. How could she even feel like that for a guy when she had just been raped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't bring herself to look at the naked dragon as he perused her clothing for something unisex and large enough for him to wear out with Jess. Her mood was further marred when she saw her best friend looking over Tyler like the way she always did with big guys; like a predator. Alli was usually okay with this, but this was Tyler, her mad crush ever since she visited the shop for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, Jessica was right, she had every right to lead a normal, happy life. Now that Fang was taken care of, she could enjoy the simple pleasures of life again, or at least that's what she tried so hard to tell herself. Deep down she still felt the dirtiness from Fang's harassment, she still felt the loneliness from losing out on Tyler. But Alli was always the optimistic type, life was looking up, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she tried to get back some normalcy in her life. And that included her daily jog. She missed it in the morning, her depression was in full swing back then, but she was determined to get the exercise now, to lose just enough weight to get her huge boobs smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way though the scenic trails around the university. It was actually one of the major selling points for her to come here in the first place. Something about this trail was so serene. She made her way past some of the older buildings on campus. she always found it curious that they chose to mimic the neo-Gothic buildings you found at more well-known colleges. Considering that the university wasn't built too long ago. She made her way to the student center, and that's when she heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was... screaming on campus? Not only screaming, but the ground underneath her was shifting. Oh, God. Was it an earthquake? No, it couldn't be, the tremors were so rhythmic, it felt more like the footfalls of a giant. She stopped jogging and curiously turned the corner. She wanted to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a clear view of the football field and standing on top of it was the veritable giant of a black wolf. Slung over the giant's shoulder was something blue. Instant, Alli's mind raced, she couldn't believe what she was seeing. It had to be Fang, it had to be. And that blue thing must be David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn't be happening. Alli began to hyperventilate. This just could not be happening to her! Normally when people describe themselves as hyperventilating, they don't mean actually hyperventilating. Alli was actually hyperventilating, her head became light as she collapsed to the ground. She felt a pair of strong hands lifting her up. She looked up to see her savior, secretly hoping it was Tyler. Instead she came face to face with a wolf. Her blood froze for a moment, but realized if that was Fang on the football field, then this guy couldn't be him. In fact, once she calmed down she realized the guy looked nothing like Fang, he was way shorter and slimmer than the evil wolf ever was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you scared me Ryan,\" she blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Allison,\" the wolf replied. She knew the guy, he was that swimmer that sat at a bench on the other side of the lab during their analytical chemistry course. The class was pretty small and Alli made it a case to at least get to know everyone. She looked up and gave him a curt smile, one which he returned. \"C'mon, let's get you outta here, I don't think its safe for either of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just sit me up, 'kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lemme call my friend Jess. She-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you can talk to her about it later, right now, we are in so much deep shit, we need to leave. Now,\" he said through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, just go, I'll catch up with you in class... if there's a class to go to on Tuesday, 'kay?\" she said to him. She was already fishing out her phone, the tears already coming down her face. The realization that Fang was on the move. That Fang could hurt innocent bystanders again. And for once in her life, she had the guts to stand her ground. For once, she was mad. Jess was right, she deserved to live a normal, happy life. And Fang could never exist in such life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Alli. I don't want to see you get hurt,\" the wolf pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't. Now go, you big goofball.\" Despite the smile on her face, she was still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan took it the wrong way, thinking she was trying to sacrifice herself to save him or something. He came in for a light hug. \"Hey, c'mon, I'm not worth risking your life over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... aren't you doing some sort of martyrdom thing... or something, trying to save my ass?\" he said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she replied, not really understanding what he meant and she came off almost as being bitchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey wolf blushed deeply, realizing his mistake. \"Oh, uh, okay... well, mind if I keep you company? Y'know, just in case I need to save you, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison giggled, was this guy really trying to come onto her at a time like this? \"Okay, Clark Kent, you can stay.\" The wolf sat beside her cross-legged on the concrete as he watched others fleeing from the scene. Allison's smile dropped slowly. The guy was cute, but she had more important things at hand. She looked on at the giants on the football field, she'd be watching them carefully, she didn't want to get hurt, but she couldn't believe anything other than her own eyes from now on, if Fang went down, she wanted to be there to confirm it. She brought her phone up and clicked a number on speed-dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Fang was having a field day with nothing other than the outdoor football stadium. He threw David onto the turf, his blue buttocks crashing into the fake grass. The titanic wolf took one of the massive floodlights and tore it out of the ground, the electricity arcing through the air as the cables snapped. He brought the lights towards the stands and started to smash the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All these fucking years wasted at this nobody-college. Fuck!\" Fang roared, swing the now destroyed lights with one hand and wiping his tears with the other. A string of snot was coming out his nose, to which he also wiped away as he looked down on the cowering dragon beneath him. \"It's all your fault, I could've been a star at a big-time school, instead I ended up here with nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to stand back up, but a giant black foot came crashing into his chest, the heel grinding into his stomach as he laid pinned to the ground. \"Fuck, Fang. You chose to come here, not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask you to talk, did I?\" the wolf snarled, his spit raining down on David's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo, you destroyed the football stadium. Good fuckin' job at getting me to hate you more, Fangy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, good one, Davey,\" the wolf sneered back with equal contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid replied softly, this time trying to be gentle, hoping to coax the 'nicer' Fang out, \"Look, Fang, I know you're hurt, but please, don't do this. I didn't mean I 'hate' hate you. I just couldn't forgive you at the time. But you were changing and I want to forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf growled loudly, having to wipe a couple more tears away as he began to sob. He composed himself quickly. Forgiveness? Forgiveness was for the weak, he wasn't weak, he'd never give in to David's weakness again. Fang smiled, looking around, and found just what he was looking for. \"Oh look, Davey, a friend.\" The wolf kicked at the stands, revealing a cowering bear hiding underneath. \"Rick, you fatfuck, so nice of you to join us,\" Fang chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear tried to run, but after weeks of not going to football practice, he was woefully too slow to escape even Fang's sluggish snatch at him. The wolf brought the bear up to his face and smiled darkly, even through his heaving, having no more tears to cry, he was menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rick, did you pee yourself?\" Fang chuckled. He turned his gaze to the dragon. \"You know, David, you can save him. All you have to do is make me go on a trip before I kill him. Even then... no guarantees.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang lifted a foot up high in the air, and brought it slamming down onto the turf below it. His paw sank several feet into the soil as the ground shook, causing the damaged bleachers to rattle loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid picked himself up. \u201cDamn it Fang! You\u2019re like ten times the size of me! If you want it, just come and take it! You don\u2019t have to bring Rick, or anyone else into this shit!\u201d he shouted angrily up at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis outburst was met by the wolf\u2019s foot again crashing into his chest, knocking the drake down and forcing the breath out of him. Fang smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point anymore though, is it David?\u201d he asked with a cocked eyebrow, his eyes still raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the drake asked with genuine confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang laughed as he shook his head. He leant down and placed the bear into the crater he had just made. The fat bear didn\u2019t completely fit in it, but it served as a depressed place for him to sit. \u201cHey Rick, don\u2019t try and waddle out of there now, or I\u2019ll fucking eat you, K?\u201d Fang growled malevolently at the frightened bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was shivering, unable to process what was happening around him. He didn\u2019t seem to respond to the wolf\u2019s words, he just shifted his gaze between the giant drake and the more giant wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang stood back up, dusting his hands off as if admiring some sort of handiwork. \u201cWhat do you say, David? I bet you a keg of your choice; the bear will pop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang, fucking hell, you win OK?!\u201d David called back up at him, not bothering to pick himself up again. \u201cI\u2019ll save him! You can get it any way you want, just tell me what you want me to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smirked down at the drake. \u201cSuck yourself. You get the first shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s face dropped. \u201cWhat? You said YOU wanted to grow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I do. I\u2019ll take the follow up. As you said, I\u2019m like ten times the size of you. Your first wad ain\u2019t gonna do shit to me like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head in disbelief. \u201cNo, please Fang. Please, do whatever you want with yourself, I won\u2019t fight you. But don\u2019t change me any more. Please, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang angrily shook his head and snarled. He shifted his gaze towards the bear as he lifted one of his feet high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALRIGHT FANG! ALRIGHT I\u2019LL DO IT!\u201d David cried out desperately as the wolf\u2019s foot passed it\u2019s arc. David could only watch in horror as the foot accelerated downward over the bear. He couldn\u2019t watch, but he couldn\u2019t look away. In the last moments of the foot\u2019s descent, it skewed it\u2019s course forwards, slamming just inches into the turf in front of the bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit\u2026\u201d David said, realising that he was somehow out of breath. The wolf didn\u2019t squash the bear, but he didn\u2019t chicken out either. His foot was coming down directly on top of Rick, and he had only just changed his aim after David had agreed to his demands. Had David called his bluff, or been indifferent to the bear\u2026 he had no doubt that the bear would be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of what Fang had done came flooding into his head. What he had done to Marcus, what he had done to himself back at home. What he had done to the girls, and what he had tried to do with Tyler. He knew that the wolf was cold and ruthless, but he had always assumed that even Fang had some sort of a limit. But that assumption had come crashing down with the wolf\u2019s foot. Whatever might lurk beneath the wolf\u2019s cocksure fa\u00e7ade, Fang had no inhibitions with murdering people to get what he wanted. There were no limits. And now coupled with his overwhelming power, the potential devastation was literally unimaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick stared at the giant foot that was planted in front of him for a long moment before he began to sob. Not the quiet, convulsing type of sobbing, but the loud, painful sobbing you would expect to hear from a child who had grazed it's knee.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell?!\u201d Fang demanded angrily down on David. The drake flinched, and breaking from his shock, stared back up at the wolf blankly.  \u201cAny chance you\u2019ll follow through?!\u201d Fang demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid climbed to his knees, nodding profusely. \u201cYes, Fang. Just let Rick go. Let him go and I\u2019ll do anything you want, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Fang angrily shouted down at David, hurtling ropes of spittle onto the drake. \u201cYou have no fucking leverage! If you even try and make a deal with me again, I\u2019ll fucking squash this fat cunt, take what I want from you yourself, then go and hunt down your fucking brother. And then Jess. And then Marcus. You think you care about fat rick here? I\u2019ll take you to the fucking bottom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared back up at Fang numbly. That way the wolf had used those names... it was more terrifying that he had imagined possible. How could he have let things get to here? Suddenly, he saw himself facing an ethical dilemma. Sure, growing the wolf again would save Rick, and whoever else the wolf decided to target after that\u2026 but at what cost? The wolf would grow stronger, more powerful, and then do it all again. What would happen if next time it wasn\u2019t Rick under the wolf\u2019s foot? What if it was the entire campus? And then after that, the whole city?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGET GOING!\u201d Fang roared at David, his whole body shaking with fury. The drake knew this was his last warning. Either he started co-operating, or the wolf would start spreading his wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slowly brought one of his claws to his flaccid ebony cock. It didn\u2019t matter anyway. Even if he defied Fang, the wolf would just take it anyway. There was nothing stopping him getting bigger, they were beyond any point of return now. If David could somehow control, or at least limit the amount of damage Fang caused, then he had to take the opportunity. And who knew\u2026 maybe something would happen to stop the madness. Maybe he could even convince Fang to open up again, as unlikely as it seemed. He had done it once beyond all odds, after all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snorted once David started masturbating. He turned around angrily, pacing across the field, his hands touching his face and neck in frustration as he did so. Every footstep the wolf took tore up the synthetic turf a little bit more, and it wasn\u2019t long before the ground was a rough mess of dirt and plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming sound of the wolf\u2019s footfalls was punctuated only by the loud wailing of the bear. \u201cFUCK!\u201d the wolf swore loudly after several minutes, turning his angry eyes on the fat bear. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t stop crying I\u2019ll just kill him to shut him up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, just hold on!\u201d David called up at the wolf, trying to placate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf rounded on the drake. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking you so fucking long?!\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid realised that he wasn\u2019t actually getting anywhere. He barely even had an erection. Nothing about this situation turned him on in the slightest \u2013 it all horrified him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, alright?! You\u2019re heaping pressure, and Rick\u2019s crying, it hard to get off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf rolled his eyes and turned his head away, groaning in disdain. \u201cFucking hell David. Do you need some inspiration? Need something to take your mind off the problems of the world?\u201d he taunted down on the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thoughtful smirk appeared on the side of his face. He grasped his thick sheath with both hands, coaxing the tip of his pink flesh out of its hiding place. \u201cIs this what you need to get off David?\u201d the asked bitterly as he kneeded the soft flesh between his hands, his length rapidly expanding as it spilt out into the daylight. It wasn\u2019t even half erect before it started leaking it\u2019s clear fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musky scent hit David abruptly, and in spite of himself, the sight of Fang\u2019s rod adding foot after foot to its length did make his own erection finally fill out. Fang let out a rumbling chuckle as his hands started stroking the length of the pink shaft.  \u201cI\u2019ll race you, David. If I win, then I\u2019ve got a special punishment for you in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t like the sound of that. And he didn\u2019t like the look of how the wolf\u2019s length twitched under his grip. Fang had the head of his cock pointed squarely at David, an endless flow of pre spilling down onto him as the wolf worked the shaft roughly with both hands. The wolf grunted as he looked down on David, smiling at the amount of fluid he was dumping on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if Fang wanted to give David a distraction from the world, then he was doing a good job. The wolf filled his senses. Fang towered before him, obscuring his vision. The wet strokes and grunting breaths of the wolf seemed to drown out any noise Rick was making. And it was hard to focus on anything other than the shower Fag rained down on him. David let it all turn him on. He had no other choice, really. Fang hadn\u2019t came since his last growth spurt, so he would have to have been pent up. If this really was a race with real stakes, then he didn\u2019t have much time.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't risk having Fang give him a 'special' punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smirked, deep down Fang would have thought the scene before him was incredibly hot, and in fact it was, the little bitch in front of him taking his pre-seed, slathering it all over him like the cum-slut he always wanted David to be. But he knew better, letting David in was the biggest mistake of his life, and he'd never let the dragon hold sway of his emotions again. That included lust. The wolf closed his eyes and focused on his career ahead of him, he was going to kill, he knew that, whether it was everyone on campus, or even the whole city, or perhaps he'd be more surgical with his murder, just killing everyone David loved; there would be blood. How he could hold someone's life in the palm of his hand, and so easily snuff it, it turned him on, the wolf gushing more pre than ever onto his dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was trying desperately to keep up with Fang, but the wolf's giant pink member was turning an angry shade of red. He knew he was going to lose. The big wolf was biting his lip already, close to orgasm. David gave up and just watched Fang continue to stroke himself to the finish, he wanted to see if there was any semblance of that dopey grin he had become accustomed to Fang's face when the big guy came. If Fang did, he'd know there was hope yet, that Fang could still be saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was nothing to see, as the wolf came on top of him, he watched the wolf's face contort into a determined grimace and then into a sick smile; a smile he knew all too well. The old Fang was back, and there was nothing David could do about it. David laid back, knowing the end was coming. Everything around was being covered by the wolf's seed, including him and Rick. He looked at the bear, his friend trying desperately to cover his face as torrents of the wolf's spunk rained down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang went on for minutes, his cock spewing endless amounts of his seed everywhere. It felt so good, Fang knew it was his largest yet, and he knew he'd be blowing even larger wads to come. When Fang's orgasm finally came to a stop, he didn't bask in his afterglow, there'd be time to celebrate his victory afterwards. Right now, it was time to make David pay. The wolf smiled down at the dragon, David still had an erection. Perfect. \"You lose, Davey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon nodded solemnly, not looking back at the wolf. Fang moved forward, stepping past the tiny bear stuck in a foot-crater, and got on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Can't get yourself off in front of your wolfie?\" Fang sneered. \"Do I have to do everything around here, Davey? Are you so fucking useless you can't even stroke yourself off anymore?\" With that the wolf began to pump David's shaft, the dragon let out an audible low moan. David couldn't fight it, he wanted release, but he lacked the motivation to do so himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf continued to stroke hard, not caring how much he abused David's length. When the drake let out a sharp gasp, he knew it was time. Time to set his little punishment into action. The first wave of cum came spurting out of David's cock. Instinctively, the dragon tried to bend his head down to suck himself off, but Fang didn't let him. At least, not for the first spurt. The wolf cupped a giant paw to the tip of David's shaft and collected the first of many loads into his free paw. The rest he let David clamp down onto his shaft. He needed his dragon bigger if he wanted to grow to truly god-like proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David sucked himself off, the evil wolf turned to the fat bear sitting on the astroturf. \"Rick, look at you, such a weak, pathetic excuse for a man.\" Fang raised his hand covered in David's spunk and grinned wickedly. He grabbed the bear with his other hand and brought the palm of his cum-soaked hand to Rick's face. \"But I can changed that, Ricky. Just call me your god, and I'll make you a better man. Or I can crush you, right here, right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear panicked in the wolf's grasp and nodded before quickly blurting out. \"You're my god, Fang.\" More out of fear than actually believing the words he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Fang cooed. \"C'mon Ricky, lick it. Baby's gonna need to drink his milk if he wants to get big and strong like his daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear grimaced, but obeyed. He wanted to live, and if that meant sucking it up and guzzling the dragon's cum like a faggot, so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was surprised at how much the bear had to lick off, for just one spurt, David had creamed an awful lot, the bear had to take multiple mouthfuls just to lick the paw clean. When he had finished, the bear started to groan, his eyes rolling back and Fang could feel the fatty's erection poking through his jeans. \"Oh, Ricky? You there?\" When all he got was Rick's moans as a response, Fang grinned wickedly. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd admit, maybe he gave the bear a bit too much of David's spunk to work with, but he needed the bear sedated for the whole thing; he couldn't risk Rick trying to escape when he went down on David's improved cock. David on the other hand had just finished blowing his wad into his mouth, the dragon's eyes were already going hazy, but was still lucid for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could see Fang approaching him, the black fur was beginning to peel off, leaving only the wolf's shaved pelt on as it shimmered. He couldn't help but laugh, Fang was just so smooth and his muscles so shiny. In his hand there was a teddy bear. \"Is that for me?\" he cried out like a child. The big wolf nodded, that kind smile David knew Fang had in him, and handed him the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid played with the teddy bear in hand. Was his teddy growing? He giggled at the prospect, that was ridiculous. Teddies don't grow, silly. Something naughty came into David's mind, as if some dark voice was suggesting it. He wanted to show his new teddy bear his dick. With the little bear filling his paw, he began to stroke his still hard erection. He made the stuffed animal hug his dick as he began to mash the toy into his shaft, squeezing at it. He giggled, \"Do you like that, teddy?\" David felt his orgasm build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally blew, he squeezed the bear tight onto his shaft. \"Hold on teddy,\" he moaned. He came and came and came, his shaft bobbing up and down. As the world came crashing around him, he looked at his little bear, bringing it close to his chest as he snuggled it, kissing it on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen David started to come to, the first thing he saw, or rather felt was Fang's enormous body thud onto the ground, the shockwave bouncing David off the ground for a moment. He knew what that meant, Fang was going to be growing soon. And judging by how much the dragon had grown himself; he guessed he had to be pushing 30ft, he was still smaller than Fang; he could only guess how big the wolf would grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's not what got his attention. On his chest was the largest bear he'd ever seen. Was that Rick? The fat bear had transformed into a veritable stud, what was once flabby was now ripped, only a trace of the bear's clothes still clung to his massive frame. Rick had to be the same size as Fang was before this all started, in practically every department, from his height to his massive physique to his rather large endowment. It would've been a sight to behold, if David wasn't so much larger than the bear and if Rick was showing any signs of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick?\" David gasped. He nudged at the bear on top of him, but got no response. He picked the bear up and held the fuzzy brown muzzle to his ear. He couldn't hear a damned thing. Did he- did he kill Rick? \"Rick, please, wake up.\" He shook the muscled, yet tiny bear in his hands, the tears starting to roll down his cheeks. \"Goddammit, Rick, wake up! Fuck you, Rick, wake up!\" He realized it was futile, even if Rick was still alive, he was in no condition to respond. Was this Fang's punishment?  Was this what the wolf wanted? For David to kill somebody? To make him a murderer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the bear gently down to his side, stroking Rick's brow apologetically. He turned to the convulsing wolf lying on the ground and bore his fangs. He approached Fang, his anger rising each inch he neared. He looked at down at Fang, the wolf writhing on the ground. The wolf couldn't hide it, that gentle smile had surfaced again. For a second, David felt his resolve melt a bit, but quickly composed himself. He knelt on the tripping wolf, straddling the black expanse of Fang's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid brought one hand up and swung it down swiftly, slapping Fang's face hard, the impact resounding throughout the whole campus. He wolf just giggled in response, too lost in his trip to counter accordingly. This enraged the dragon and soon David was pounding on Fang's chest like a crazed ape. \"Fuck you, Fang. You made me kill Rick. Are you fucking happy now?\" His beating seemed to have no effect on the now expanding wolf. David began to dry heave, he wanted to cry, but something else boiled within him. He looked at the growing wolf, looked at Fang's happy grin, and he burned with conviction as he said stoically:</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sorry Ali, he told me that the wolf was taken care of. I didn\u2019t know he was lieing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Allison said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Tyler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison\u2019s heart sank at the name. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t seen him if he\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe went around to their place just before. Are you sure he\u2019s not around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. He could be anywhere I guess. But I don\u2019t see him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a phone\u2026\u201d Jess groaned. \u201cHey, call me back if you see him, alright? I\u2019m gonna go check their house, or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Allison said, sounding more deflated than she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t stick around babe, it\u2019s no good for you. Come home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I need this.\u201d Allison said with conviction. That sounded\u2026  odd. Was that an odd thing to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward pause signalled Jess\u2019s tacit agreement. \u201cWell let me know if something changes, alright?\u201d Jess said before quickly adding \u201cOr if you see Tyler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee ya.\u201d The fox said as she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo um\u2026\u201d Ryan began, a single eyebrow raised as he watched the giant wolf cum over the drake and bear in a seemingly endless torrent. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"here\" was behind a window in the science faculty building. It wasn\u2019t the best vantage point; it was a fair way back and the bleachers obscured half of the playing surface, but she figured they were reasonably safe for the view it offered them. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here for some closure\u2026.\u201d Allison began stoically, not wanting to delve any deeper. \u201cAnd you\u2019re here to fight one of those things if they come after me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh...\" the grey wolf snickered nervously. \"I'll try, but you'd better run as well, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison couldn't help but smile. She pointed at the drake. \u201cSee the blue one? That\u2019s David. He\u2019s the good guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured that from what they were saying.\u201d Ryan said. The giant\u2019s voices were booming, their conversation clearly audible. \u201cThat\u2019s Fang, the quarterback, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison nodded quietly. Fang wandered over to the bear with a handful of cum while David sucked himself off. She thought she wanted to see what was happening, but she could never have imagined this. She felt extremely awkward and embarrassed. What did Ryan think of her wanting to be here, watching this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is very unusual, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ryan began, his tone casual but with an element of mundane excitement, as if he had cracked open an egg with two yolks. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not really something you\u2019d expect from a typical day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shook her head softly. There was an awkward silence as the two of them watched on. David roughly ground the bear into his erect cock. Rick\u2019s clothes had burst open, revealing his own erection as his body bounced up and down the drake\u2019s length. When David started cumming, Fang leant over and started sucking David off. All of this action unfolded in a sea of the wolf\u2019s semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it just me, or is all of this um\u2026\u201dRyan began awkwardly, breaking the silence. \u201c...a bit gay.\u201d He finished delicately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison couldn't help but laugh so abruptly and hard that she snorted as she inhaled. Mortified, she covered her mouth and looked away, feeling her face blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan giggled quietly in response. It was a warm giggle, clearly not aimed at the dionsaur\u2019s expense. \u201cI probably sound like a douche, but that was kinda cute.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison began to shake her head, when suddenly the two of them jumped as the earth boomed. Allison stared at the field with wide eyes. Fang had fallen over. One moment he was giving David a blowjob, the next he was laying on the ground. Was he defeated? What happened? Her heart started to race. Damn it, why did she look away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it soon became clear that the wolf wasn\u2019t defeated. Instead, she started to tremble as Jess\u2019s comment about not letting Fang get over David\u2019s dick started to gather context.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are they growing even bigger?\u201d Ryan asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll save you, Fang. I know you're in there somewhere, and I'll save you.\u201d David said stoically to the unconscious wolf. He was being completely irrational, and he knew it. But it was the position he took with steadfast assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid wasn\u2019t lying when he told Fang that he cared about him. They had been friends for almost half of his life, and while their friendship it certainly wasn\u2019t typical or without its strains, David couldn\u2019t simply wash his hands of Fang. Particularly since now he had established himself as the major stakeholder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was not good at reading social cues. Tyler was right when he called him oblivious. But for some reason, he knew more about Fang than even the wolf seemed to. Fang had been living a lie. Not just to others, but also himself. He buried everything that didn\u2019t fit into his persona deeply within him. He had stayed in town just for David, because he wanted to be around him. But the wolf probably didn\u2019t even realise his own motivation. That would explain a lot. Why he had framed his life around being with David but never made a move. Why he had told David that he was scared when he realised he might be gay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang hated himself. It was probably that hate that drove him to hate others. It was a degenerating feedback loop. Fang was always an asshole, but he had never raped anyone before last night. And he was never homicidal until today. He was trapped in a spiral of self-destruction, and god help the world as he neared the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was only wolf\u2019s love for David that could break it. If David could somehow convince Fang that he cared for him, then there may still be a chance that the wolf could be saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was next to impossible. Because David was smaller than the wolf, everything would be viewed through the prism of dominance. His words wouldn't appear honest to Fang, they would merely be desperate cries for mercy, pathetic attempts to manipulate the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing he could do or say that would get through to Fang. He had that chance. Fang had not only opened himself up to advice, he had actually openly canvassed David for help. But David took that opportunity and twisted it a hundred and eighty degrees. A \u2018normal\u2019 person could react with hatred when heartbroken. What hope did the wolf have when hate was all he knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had to get bigger than Fang. It was as simple as that. If he could put himself in a position of power, and use it to help the wolf, then it would speak a thousand times stronger than mere words alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the wolf expanded under him, David knew that now was the time to act. He traced a finger down the valley of the wolf\u2019s heaving chest as it expanded. David\u2019s ebony shaft was swelling before he started stroking it with his free hand. Nothing could turn him on like the sight of the growing wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s growth was loud. It wasn;t just the sounds of cracking and popping sinew and joints, or the strained stretching noise his skin made as his pelt struggled to accommodate his expanding form. The wolf was literally tearing up the earth as he expanded. The parts of his body furthest away from his centre of mass advanced over the playing surface at a seemingly accelerating rate, his feet cutting deep trenches into the dirt, the scars widening as they went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he would normally be ashamed, the sight and sound of the expanding wolf was more erotic than any porn David had browsed. In no time at all he felt himself nearing another orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quickly turned his cock onto his own mouth, his jaws struggling to take his now massive girth. He moaned in pleasure as he came, struggling to keep up with the quantity of seed his loins was serving. He wasn\u2019t very efficient, there seemed just as much seed bursting out of his mouth as there was going down it, but it didn\u2019t take long for David to start feeling the familiar warm calm spread over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, he felt his groin surge with renewed vigor. This time, however, was different. He was already cumming, and the new surge seemed to flow directly into escalating his orgasm. David moaned again, in a delighted surprise as he felt himself cum harder. He felt as if he was spinning. The world around him seemed to disappear as he imagined himself as a dragonfly, curled up into a rig, sucking his own tail with orgasmic results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColours swirled around him as he spun faster and faster. He came into his mouth, which flowed back into his groin, causing to cum harder into his mouth. Each spurt lead to a new, greater spurt. David could hear the colours as they raced around him, faster and faster. He tried to giggle, tried to laugh, but his mouth was full. He had no thought for stopping, no thought for anything but the increasing waves of pleasure that pulsed through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, in the real world\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler sat by the rubble that was once his house sulking. Was he really a sponge? Did he really depend on others that much? No, he could be independent, he was smart, he knew how to take care of himself. Yeah, that's right, Fang. \"I am not a sponge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler immediately realized just how stupid that sounded out loud. He looked around with a slight blush on his face, hoping that there was no one within earshot of what he had just said. The neighbours had come out in full swing earlier, asking him questions. Questions he didn't have answers to. Questions like, 'Who are you?' How was he supposed to answer? 'Oh hey, everyone, it's just Tiny Ty from next door.' If anyone asked, he was the dragon brothers big bodybuilding cousin, Tyrel. He couldn't believe he couldn't think of better name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most important question swimming in the purple drake's head was, 'Why aren't you doing anything?' And that made Tyler mad, he wasn't useless, but he hadn't made himself useful in any way. Not last night, throwing his own flesh and blood to the wolves... er, wolf; and definitely not this afternoon, letting David's pretty little lie out of the box. So why wasn't he stomping his way off, following the trail Fang had left behind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Tyler already knew the answer. He was fucking scared. Every time he tried to help, David got hurt. Fang was right, Tyler was always either bitching or crying every time the wolf had grown. He was scared to fail his brother again; all because he was too weak, first physically, then mentally. He sighed. He was a failure. Fang was right, he was good for nothing sponge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt himself getting wrung out, tears streaming down his face as he felt sorry for himself. He saw a familiar truck careen into his view, the tires squealing loudly as the vehicle zoomed along the street at full throttle, swerving in and out as it dodged the craters left behind in a giant's wake. The drake dried off his tears and put on a stoic face. The truck came to abrupt stop right in front of him, the window rolling down to show the vixen inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerd-Hulk, gonna need your help,\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler hated the way she treated him, calling him names and such. Besides, Bruce Banner was a nerd already, so that just made Tyler the Hulk. Period. She'd never get it. He grumbled, clearly in no mood to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said move it, fatass!\" she shrieked, blaring the horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Jess, what the fuck's your problem?\" Tyler growled, staring intensely at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica didn't like the way Tyler was looking at her, there was ire inside his eyes, something she remembered seeing in Fang's when he raped her. Still, she pressed on, \"We're going to campus, hop in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? I'll never fit-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The back, doofus, this is a pick-up ain't it? God, and here I thought you were the smart one,\" she said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" Tyler snarled. This girl was just so difficult sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the old adage about female drivers. Tyler always knew Jess was... unique. And her driving was definitely a part of that... uniqueness. The drake held on for dear life as the vixen sped through red lights, swerved to avoid pedestrians and drifted her way through turns. The dragon nearly stumbled out and puked his guts by the time they reached the university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica casually stepped out of the truck and walked up to the recovering Tyler, slapping him on the back. \"Hey, c'mon,\" she said lightly. This aggravated Tyler to no end. How could she be so damn chipper at a time like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't follow her and when she noticed him not crawling behind her, she turned around to see Tyler standing there with his arms crossed over his meaty chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we, Jess?\" Tyler said softly, his eyes looking down at her intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now... Tyler,\" the fox replied, using the dragon's name when she couldn't think of anything witty, or at least witty in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I need to know. Do you even like me, Jessica? Am I even your boyfriend? 'Cause you don't treat me like one if I am.\" he questioned, genuinely seeking the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled and came up to Tyler and beckoned him to lean down. The big lug blushed and did as she ordered. She began to lean in for a quick kiss on the cheek. Tyler felt the tension rising, so Jessica did think of him as a... boyfriend? He didn't get a chance to think about it, instead of a nice sweet kiss, he felt the cold hard slap of Jess's paw crash against his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, what the fuck, Jess!\" Tyler roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen grabbed a hold of the wincing dragon's head and forced him to stare at her as she glared back at him. \"Let's get this straight, nerd, you got a hot bod, and there's no denying what kind of sexy things I'm thinking of doing to you in the future. But if you even want to think about getting a piece of this, you're gonna have to work for it. Now go.\" Jessica pointed towards the general vicinity of the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grumpily agreed, but then a naughty idea came into his mind. There is no greater form of flattery that mimicry, right? Tyler mirrored what Fang had done with his brother, he grabbed at the vixen and slung her over his giant shoulder. The girl was kicking and screaming for him to let her go as he casually sauntered onto campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Tyler's gait suddenly changed when he saw what had unfolded on the football field. It was complete wreck. What truly scared him was the wolf. Fang was titanic, the expanse of the wolf's body covered three 5 yard markers, making him at least 45 feet tall. But the most frightening sight was what his brother was becoming. The gigantic blue mass was curled up onto itself, sucking the everflowing gush of semen coming out of its dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gently placed Jessica down onto the side, not even looking back at her, the fox was irate, as he dashed off towards the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived, the situation was quite precarious. Was David ever going to stop cumming? Could Tyler risk his own safety to stop his brother from continuously feeding himself. If there was any time to shine, it'd be now. Tyler huffed in preparation. Today, Tyler was going to be a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler began to jog forward, he noticed something on the ground besides the two behemoths. On closer inspection, it wasn't an object, rather it was a person. Tyler approached cautiously. The guy looked huge, the bear was sprawled face-up. To a giant, the guy could look like he wasn't moving, when really, he was breathing slowly, his tongue lolled out as he began to ejaculate hands-free. Tyler rolled his eyes. He went up to this big lug and tried to pull him away before addressing David. However, it was proving too difficult, even for his pumped physique to pull the bear away. Eventually, he gave up, soon the guy'd wake up anyways and flee, Tyler thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler threw the bear to the ground and continued to make his way to the giants. He had asked just how gay David was now earlier over the phone. Well, it's not gay until the balls touch, and Fang's and David's enormous sacks were colliding into each as the lay there, David half splayed on top of Fang as if he was sitting on Fang before, but fell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at Fang. How could this guy still be in the middle of his trip? The wolf was idly stroking his member, sending waves of potent pre-cum everywhere. And David, David was becoming unwieldy. Tyler knew Fang had stopped growing, but David? The dragon almost looked the same size as Fang already, even if he were to stop it now, the residual effect would be more than enough to make David the larger of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was David doing this? Was he sacrificing himself? Was he growing large enough to take Fang on? Tyler didn't know, but what he did know was, that no matter what David had planned, he should be more than big enough to accomplish the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to get his brother to stop... Tyler started to climb up onto his brother's thick chest, the slime from David's constant orgasm made the effort quite difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was going to be a hero, his brother would praise him endlessly afterwards for lending his support in the battle against this new Fang. He had no doubt about it. The purple dragon stopped himself for a second, realizing he was being selfish about it, this was for his brother, not him. Even if he didn't know what was his brother's true intentions were, he was here for David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith grim determination, Tyler wedged his meaty frame between David's abs and cock. Then, he planted both his feet onto the shaft and began to push. Slowly, but sure, the slickness caused David's mouth to dislodge from his cock. The blue drake continued to grow and spew his seed onto his face and the grounds behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler faintly heard a gurgling sound. Peering over his brother's shoulder as David continued to cum, he could see the bear, desperately trying to stand up, flailing his thick arms. But the heavy wads landing on him were simply too much, the pressure from above too great as the bear was pinned to the ground by cum fire. Tyler winced, it looked like the guy might just drown in his brother's cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Tyler also heard a rumbling behind him. Fang was waking up. Tyler turned around and saw a pair of golden eyes looking back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cthe fuck is\u2026\u201d Fang mumbled to himself as he groggily began to stir. His gaze darted between Tyler and the growing blue dragon that partially lay on top of him. His eyes were wide as he processed the scene \u2013 David had somehow grown bigger than him, and was still growing, his enormous ebony rod ejaculating unprecedented amounts of cum into the air like an oil well. \u201cFuck you!\u201d he roared at the purple drake, incorrectly attributing the turn of events to be somehow his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was petrified. He knew that the wolf was bigger than ever, but he looked a hell of a lot more intimidating up close. But if Tyler was ever going to be of use, then now was the time. In spite of the fear, Tyler squared his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m not a fucking sponge!\u201d he roared back at Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler Launched himself off his brother\u2019s abdomen, throwing himself at Fang\u2019s head. The wolf's head was too heavy to turn it away in time; instead Fang could only reflexively blink as Tyler put all of his force behind a single powerful blow to the wolf\u2019s wet snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang grunted in pain as he recoiled, his head slamming back onto the earth behind him with a thud. Tyler wasted no time in following up, crawling over the wolf\u2019s face to wrap his hulking hands around Fang's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis move proved substantially less effective however, as Tyler quickly realised that the wolf\u2019s head weighed about as much as his whole body did. Fang\u2019s enormous neck muscles began to show their true strength as Tyler was thrown about as the wolf tried to shake him off. The purple drake held on, riding the wolf\u2019s head like a raging bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t sense the wolf\u2019s paw approach him until he found his body enveloped in it. Tyler had the air squeezed out of him as the wolf roughly grasped him. He was ripped from the wolf\u2019s face, and was abruptly disoriented by a sense of explosive acceleration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world moved in a roaring blur. He didn\u2019t know he was flying through the air until he felt the earth slam into his side, sending him sliding and rolling violently across the now uneven playing turf. It wasn\u2019t until he had come to a stop that he realised that the wolf had picked him up and thrown him across the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Tyler tried to stand, but his body felt bruised to the core. He stumbled on two frantic attempts, each time ending up with his face planted into the slippery fake grass. He was winded, though every cell in his body cried out for oxygen. He wanted nothing more than to simply lie there resting his injuries, but he knew that he was in peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Tyler looked up at the giant wolf, he saw that he was not being pursued. Fang was half crouched over David, his head darting between the two drakes as he struggled to decide where to commit his attention. His eyes were wide, his fear transparent. David was enormous, and still growing.  The blue drake writhed on the ground in ecstasy as he continued to cum, his cries and grunts steadily growing deeper as his body spread ever further across the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang knew that he had lost control of the situation. Growling in frustration, he turned his back on the purple drake as he lunged after David\u2019s cock, desperate not to fall further behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler finally managed to pick himself up, a sliver of air finding its way into his desperate lungs. He trembled in both fear and relief that he had lost the wolf\u2019s attention. Now he could run back to safety, and hope that his brother could stay bigger than Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, he stumbled towards the wolf. He didn\u2019t know exactly what drove him against his fears \u2013 All he knew was that he had to stop the wolf from growing. His hobble gradually morphed into a painful run as he approached the scene again with as much urgency as his battered body would allow. He had no idea what he was going to do once he reached him. Something. Anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud slapping noise echoed though the stadium as the wolf leant in over the growing blue drake. Fang had knelt down to force David\u2019s cock into his maw, and in the process, his large swinging nutsack had slapped into the blue drake\u2019s thigh, hovering just feet above the ground. Tyler remembered back to how he won the fight against the wolf the night before. Suddenly, he knew what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dove onto the wolf\u2019s testicles, crashing all of his momentum onto the firm but tender orbs. Fang winced and whined at the contact, the painful distraction causing him to snort David\u2019s cum form his mouth and nose. But his muzzle remained firmly planted over the head of the drake\u2019s shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler roughly sunk his claws into the single testicle in front of his head, and clung there, letting his bodyweight weight it down as he stretched his lim. The orb of flesh was almost half his size, just perfect for Tyler to sink his sharp fingers, toes and teeth into. And as he did so roughly, Fang\u2019s response was wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf yelped violently, his head flying off David\u2019s cock. Tyler could feel the wolf start to swing around, and when he saw a massive paw heading rapidly in his direction, he let go of the wolf, falling several yards onto the turf with a loud, wet thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang cupped his injured testicles with both hands. He inspected his injured groin carefully before he looking down on Tyler. While the wolf\u2019s whines were that of a self-pitying pain, his face was anything but. Fang\u2019s glare bore into Tyler, his golden eyes a burning furnace. They were wild, portraying a picture of mindless vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler picked himself up as the wolf shakily rose to his feet. Fang was clearly in a tremendous amount of pain, but the fury drove him onwards. Tyler swallowed. It suddenly felt as if he wasn't really in his own body anymore, that the sight of the forty five foot tall wolf that rose in front of him was just as scene from a movie. He knew he was in trouble now. A lot of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang roared at the drake as he started walking towards him, the first titanic foot slamming into the turf in front of him. The ground no longer seemed to be something on which the wolf stood, but rather it was something that tried to hold him up. The wolf\u2019s toes were almost lost to sight as they simply kept sinking into the earth as he bore his tremendous weight down on them. When the foot came up again, it had left a deep, cavernous scar on the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler kept backpedalling as the wolf advanced, thick ropes of cum slowly dripping from his snarling maw. Tyler knew that there was nothing but bleachers behind him, that he couldn\u2019t keep going in that direction. But the wolf had him trapped. Fang\u2019s stride was so huge now, that he was never any further than a few steps away from anywhere on the field, and was going to be able to make any ground far quicker than Tyler could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while the wolf could travel faster than the drake, he did so in slow, lumbering movements. Tyler kept his eyes on the wolf\u2019s feet. If he could avoid them, then he could escape. His eyes flicked briefly to his brother, who was still lost in the throes of the world\u2019s longest orgasm. \u201cWake up\u2026\u201d he pleaded under his breath as he took off, running around the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shifted his weight as he lifted a foot into the air. Tyler kept his eyes on it as it slowly rose and started to come down on top of him. Fang was trailing Tyler, the foot following him wherever he ran. Tyler had a plan. He was going to dive backwards at the last moment, before the wolf could recalibrate. He knew that he had only had one chance at this. When he judged the timing to be right, he leant against his run, planting a foot down hard to reverse his momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped. He felt the foot that bore his weight slide backwards on the slick turf as he pressed against it. He quickly regained his balance by shifting his weight to his other foot, but it cost him a second. A second he didn\u2019t have to spare. As he lunged forwards, he knew that it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the wolf\u2019s paw slam down on the lower half of his body, and a fraction of a second later it crushed him into the ground. Tyler immediately knew he was broken. He had no idea exactly what was wrong, but in that moment he knew. Time seemed to slow as a pure visceral perception of the world overtook him.  There were no thoughts, only awareness. It was all over. All he had left was his sharp breath and the moment that he existed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pain hit, it was overwhelming. To say it was the worst thing he had ever felt would be redundant. It wasn\u2019t the pain of shattered bones or crushed tissue. It didn\u2019t identify anything. It was just a wall of amorphous pain. Tyler let out a bloodcurdling scream as the wolf\u2019s paw sank further into the earth, dragging him across the grass as his lower half was buried deeper underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked down at the drake, his mouth open in wonder. Suddenly, he started to giggle, his mouth curling upwards in childlike wonder. \u201cHalf a dragon!\u201d he said giddily. He slowly looked around him, his eyes resting on the damaged bleachers. He started laughing at them, and stumbled towards them before he collapsed on top of David\u2019s enormous body. The wolf settled down, murring as he started to fervently masturbate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lay trembling violently, whining compulsively as he rested his head on the ground. A stream of cum flowed underneath him, pooling into the crater Fang had made behind him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So this was it, huh? Tyler never thought that this was how it'd all end. Crushed like an insect underneath the foot of a giant. Sure, he used to be scared of getting trampled by bigger people, but nothing ever came close to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake whined as he tried to move for the first time. He let out a deafening scream as he tried to roll over. Suck it up, Tyler, just suck it up, he told himself. He was a stud now, the big man on campus... well big man that could pass off as normal on campus. There was no room for this pussy shit of 'pain.' Tyler grit his teeth and willed his upper body to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had barely moved an inch when he collapsed back to the ground. The pain was too great, he couldn't ignore it. He'd never felt anything like this before, the last day setting knew records for what the drake knew; each encounter with this wolf just led to more and more excruciating pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tried to get up again, this time in one swift motion. It hurt, it damn well hurt. Tyler bit deep into his lower lip, a bit of blood spilling from the gashes he caused. He peered down to see the wreck of his lower half. Hey, they didn't look so bad, just, you know, a bone here and there jutting out of his skin... nothing Tyler couldn't handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, who was he kidding? This fucking freaked him out! Those were his legs - <i>his legs</i>! That's when Tyler noticed the amount of blood gushing out of his leg. That was a whole lotta blood. Tyler panicked, despite the sheer pain, he bolted upright. 'Please don't the femoral, please don't be the femoral,' he thought. Tyler felt himself getting woozy, hell, he didn't even know what the femoral artery looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay Tyler,' he told himself. 'You need to get to that puddle of cum and drink it. Just drink it. No biggie.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly edged his elbow towards the crater behind him. It was slow, it was arduous, but against all odds he did. Every time he got closer he'd have to sit up and pull his legs behind him; feel the shards of bone moving inside the crushed tissue, surprisingly, he felt no pain in his legs, just everywhere else on his body if he jerked the wrong way. But finally, he had reached his prize. He peered deep into the opalescent liquid sloshing in the foot-crater that once held his limp lower body.'Ha!' Tyler scoffed to himself, 'told you I could do it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he heard an eerily low howl burst from the side. Fang was cumming all over David's chest, the prodigious pink shaft grinding into David's as the blue drake still came and still grew. Tyler couldn't believe how big those two were getting. He turned back to the puddle and had second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was right, his life was perfect as it was. He had a hot bod and an even hotter babe. He dreamed about making it on the football team, replacing Fang as the star quarterback, the girls squealing in the crowd as he would saunter into the stadium. If he grew again, he might not have the chance to have all of that. That dream life, his dream body, his dream girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right, bleeding leg,' Tyler reminded himself. Tyler was no statistician, or even a math major in general, but it didn't take a stats course to realize that the chances of living out his dreams would be zero if he was dead. He reached down and scooped up a handful of the thick cream. Bringing the ambrosia to his mouth, he winced at the thought of David's foul tasting seed. But, beggars can't be choosers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid oozed down his throat and Tyler returned to the source over and over again, determined to get fully healed. But he couldn't feel it. Where were the rainbows? The flying fish flying by his face? Where were the magical talking mushrooms growing out of the wall, asking him to lick them? He scooped up more, maybe it didn't start until he had enough to get fully healed? 'Yeah that's it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't working! 'Goddammit!' Tyler roared inside. He flopped onto his back, too tired to move any more, in too much pain to pursue the cum puddle any further. Why wasn't it working. He could feel his panic rising. Was he going to die? He looked down at the bleeding leg. 'I thought you only had minutes to live with a severed femoral artery,' Tyler pondered. Maybe it wasn't as bad as he thought at all, it's been a couple minutes, shouldn't he have passed out by now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler flicked his tongue in annoyance, what was he going to do? That's when he tasted the cum left in his mouth. This tasted nothing like David... He turned his head to look at the giants. David was faced the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Tyler said out loud, more of a groan in disbelief than anything. He fucked up. This wasn't David's miracle juice, this was Fang's cum. He had just guzzled mouthfuls of the evil fuck's cum. Tyler tried desperately to spit it out. There was no way Tyler could get over to some of his brother's cum, he was royally fucked. When Fang woke up, he'd be a sitting duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at the two behemoths tangled in each other's embrace. Fang was still cumming, but David had finally stopped. Even though the bi blue drake was at peace, Tyler could see the massive rise and fall of his brother's chest as he breathed, every so often swallowing down some of Fang's cum. They had both stopped growing. Fang was ridiculously large as always, easily past fifty feet. Tyler felt almost proud for minimizing Fang's growth. David on the other hand... Tyler didn't know how big his brother had gotten, just way too big to imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was nuzzling into David's chest as his flow began to subside. Tyler thought it almost looked... endearing of the wolf. But he knew it was just a byproduct of the intense growth, right? What was even more strange, was the way his brother unconsciously held the wolf in his big embrace. If Tyler didn't know better, they looked like a couple... a very big, very buff couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, this is it,' Tyler thought with resignation. He was going to bleed out, die here. He fell onto his back again, too tired to check up of David's progress of waking any more. Tyler just wanted to sleep. He had done his job, played his part; he had helped his brother gain the advantage, Fang could be stopped now. Jessica would be safe now. It was time for him to make an exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know if he had slipped out of consciousness or not, he opened his eyes, a shadow was looming over him. Was he dead? Was this heaven?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he realized the pain he still felt all over his body was very real. Looking up he saw...</span></div></div>",

A topless grey wolf was busily wrapping his shirt around it. Tyler's confused gaze lifted up to a familiar t-rex standing behind the wolf. Allison bit both of her hands as she looked back down on him, her eyes tearing up. Tyler licked his lips. \u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh!\u201d Jess hissed at Tyler, clamping her paws around the drake\u2019s snout. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get you outa here, but don\u2019t wake any of them up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan quickly finished wrapping his shirt tightly around one of the drake\u2019s decimated thighs, and silently motioned to both Tyler and Jess for the drake\u2019s shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we\u2019ve got to get out of here!\u201d Jess hissed back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shook his head firmly. \u201cStop blood, then leave.\u201d He said, his voice soft but firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an angry grunt, Jess started pulling off Tyler\u2019s new striped shit. Tyler sluggishly helped her by lifting his arms one after the other to pull the shirt though. The purple drake moaned slightly, on top of the pain he felt whenever he moved anything, he was feeling woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan took the shirt and started wrapping it around the drake\u2019s mangled tail, the muscular strip of vertebrae bent at alarming angles. Tyler hissed as an incredibly intense sharp pain jolted up him as the wolf applied pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe vest, too.\u201d The wolf demanded. Tyler slowly lifted the undergarment off, his movements shaky and cumbersome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to\u2026\u201d Tyler began as he handed over the garment. He was about to tell Jess that he needed to get some of David\u2019s cum before the fox angrily cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you to shut up!\u201d Jess hissed at him, slapping him on the side of the head. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise how fucking loud you are!\u201d Her  tone was one of irritation, but she spoke from fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scowled, and not just because of the pain. What, she was angry at him now? Damn, that woman was all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake lay back as he quietly sulked. He was feeling weak, even keeping his torso upright was causing him strain. Once Ryan had made the most of what he had to work with, he signalled for the girls to help him drag Tyler to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the three of them struggled to move the beefy purple drake. Jess was more or less useless, and while Ryan was an athletic young man, he wasn\u2019t particularly big, or strong for his size. Most of the work was handled by Allison, the 8 foot and change dinosaur, who even for her size added a surprising amount of strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, progress was literally painfully slow. With great effort, they were only inching away from the scene, Tyler hissing under his breath as his mangled feet dragged over the uneven ground. It didn\u2019t take long before he pitched in with his own rescue effort, using his own weak arms to scuttle his body backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them several minutes, but finally the four of them were able to haul the crippled drake off the field. Tyler bit his bottom lip as he cried out in pain as his feet and tail started getting dragged up concrete steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until he looked up and saw the playing field that he realised that there was a third giant. Tyler groaned as he quickly pieced it all together. The light brown chunk of muscle that lay off to the side was the bear he was afraid would drown in his brother\u2019s cum. He must have really inhaled that stuff, because although the bear was dwarfed by the other two, he must have been a good twenty feet tall himself. Perhaps it was the blood loss, but a flash of jealousy coursed through Tyler. He suddenly couldn\u2019t help but feel he was missing out on some of the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need a hand?\u201d A voice called out to them from behind. Tyler heard running footsteps approach, but he quickly gave up trying to look at them. His body was feeling too tired to invest that much energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp us get him out of here!\u201d he heard Ryan instruct the voice. Suddenly, Jess\u2019s soft but useless hands were replaced by stronger, more rugged ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler whined as he was hauled up the steps with a much improved pace, causing his dragging feet and tail to start bouncing as they followed him up the hard and uneven incline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the drake was finally be dragged over real grass, he almost breathe a sigh of comparative relief. Once they were a subjectively safe distance away from the field, they came to a rest, the four of them breathing heavily from the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you OK sir?\u201d the unknown voice asked down on him as he stepped in front of the drake. Tyler squinted up at him. The first thing he noticed was the police uniform. The second was that the figure was a particularly tall horse. Lastly, he noticed that the world seemed to be swaying slightly now that he had come to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Tyler cried miserably back up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Jess interjected. \u201cWe\u2019ve called an ambulance, we just need to keep him alive until it gets here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait. I don\u2019t need an ambulance!\u201d Tyler objected. \u201cI just need some of my brothers\u2026 \u201c he trailed off. How on earth was he meant to finish that sentence in front of a crowd? He just needed some of his brothers cum? His brother\u2019s spooge? Semen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess sneered at him contemptuously. \u201cWhat, you think getting bigger will help here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it can heal me!\u201d Tyler cried out. \u201cIt heals you while you grow. I just need some. Some of David\u2019s, not fucking Fang\u2019s, and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt heals you?\u201d Jess asked flatly. \u201cWhat is this, miracle tonic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler couldn\u2019t help but chuckle weakly. \u201cYeah, I guess it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess shook her head. \u201cNo. No one\u2019s going back there, and besides, you\u2019re big enough already. I couldn\u2019t handle any more Tyler, if you get my subtext.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler would have blushed at Jess\u2019s blunt attitude, if he had the blood to spare. \u201cBut my feet\u2026\u201d he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill heal, and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Jess interrupted him. \u201cI\u2019ll come visit you in the hospital. I\u2019ll bring flowers and a balloon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that it can heal you?\u201d he heard the wolf asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I just said that.\u201d Tyler replied flatly, slightly annoyed that his conversation with Jess had been interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you need to drink some.\u201d The wolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jess demanded, clearly unimpressed that she was being questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf sighed. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t want to say anything earlier. You know, for the sake of propriety. But you\u2019re legs are fucked man. The first thing they\u2019re gonna do once you get to the ER is cut them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you know?!\u201d Jess demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re not a fucking doctor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shrugged. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m studying to be a surgeon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess visibly recoiled in what was probably going to be the biggest burn in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a surgeon?\u201d Allison asked in surprise. \u201cWhy are you in my chemistry class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s relevant to Pharmaceuticals, apparently.\u201d The wolf said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you done?!\u201d Jess demanded \u201cHow are we going to get back in there?! There\u2019s cops and everything now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone suddenly seemed to focus their attention on the horse that was still patiently standing with them. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue what you are talking about.\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019ve called for backup, but I don't have a handle on going on here.\u201d It was clear that he was overwhelmed by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler here needs to drink a mouthful of the blue drake\u2019s semen to fix his legs.\u201d Jess explained impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse blinked, but otherwise stood perfectly still. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble connecting the course of action with the outcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess rolled her eyes. \u201cSee those giants behind you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cThey got that big because of David\u2019s semen. It makes them grow, and also heals them, apparently. The football field is covered in it, in case you were blind and breathe through your mouth. So we need to recover some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse blinked again. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were expecting a rational explanation for THAT?!\u201d Jess demanded curtly, pointing her finger at the stadium again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse shook his head sternly, suddenly assuming the role of an authority figure. \u201cNo, no one\u2019s going back there now. I don\u2019t care what you say. It\u2019s too dangerous, just look at your purple friend here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess fumed at the cop in silence, before turning to face Tyler, her face suddenly flat. \u201cMy god, you\u2019re right. Why didn\u2019t I see that before? You make a lot of sense, and have convinced me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horses gaze shifted uneasily between Jessica and the others around them. He had a strong suspicion she was being sarcastic, but her tone seemed genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looked at Tyler for a moment before turning back to the horse, her eyes wide and pleading. \u201cBut can you please at least let us use your shirt to stop the bleeding, or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop looked at the drake uneasily. Ryan had done all he could with what he had, but there was indeed still more that could be done. \u201cFine.\u201d The horse said as he started unbuttoning his shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he handed over his shirt to Ryan, Jess bolted, making a run for the stadium. She was several yards away before he had even noticed she had moved. \u201cshit.\u201d He said calmly under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pink and white fox made her way across the field\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rick opened his eyes. Damn, he felt good. And then he looked down. Damn, he <i>looked</i> good. The bear idly rubbed a massive paw over his insanely large chest. He couldn't believe it, it was real! His hand slowly made its way down his ripped set of abs. He'd never had abs before. Everyone had called him a fatass, or fatty, or fatfuck. He tried not to let it show, but those names always cut deep. He tried to go to practice, but every time, Fang would get on his case. The wolf was the worst, slamming him into the lockers. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't get on Fang's good side. He was a football player, for Pete's sake, he thought that he would be the bully to someone, not a victim of it. Some of the other guys tried to comfort him, like Marcus, saying 'it's fine,' or 'dude, you're just big boned.' But he knew better. He was just an extra, someone to laugh at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now? Now he was something else; he was large and in charge now. He flexed an arm, watching in amazement at just how thick he was. He was a total stud, he bet he could get any girl wet just by looking at him now. Heck, he was getting hard himself, just looking over his own body. Speaking of which; Rick looked down again, this time at his glorious cock. The rod stood at full attention, bobbing into the base of his chest as he squeezed it against himself. He was the perfect specimen of a man, or at least that's what he thought to himself before he looked behind him to see the two biggest guys in the world slumbering one on top of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he jealous of their size? Heck yes, but he knew he had plenty already and he knew just how to get more. He licked his chops, the excitement of what a bigger badder bear would look like made Rick's mouth water. He didn't have to be a nobody anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just all too much. The size, the power, Rick needed to blow off steam. And now. He grabbed his dick with both his meaty paws and ran them along his length. It felt so wonderful, the sheer distance he had to rub now, used to the stub he was born with and now rubbing the godhood he was born to have. He looked at the dragon and wolf; Fang was snoozing lightly, and David was deep in his post-orgasmic sleep. Rick wanted to be their size. No... bigger. Nobody would laugh at him on the team any more, he didn't need pussy shits like Marcus to encourage him anymore, he'd make everyone cower before him. Not just anyone... Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear continued on his lust-filled train of thought, each time thinking himself even bigger, even stronger. No one would best him anymore. No one would think he was useless. As he rubbed harder, he thought, 'The only thing better than this would be a nice hot babe to share me with.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd luck would have it, there was one now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica ran as fast as she could. There was a crater up ahead from one of Fang's large footfalls. She started to turn, but the ground underneath her was slick and she lost her bearings. The arctic fox fell to the ground, a heap of the white gunk landing on her snout. She didn't know if this was good enough. Was this David's or was this Fang's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to stand up, but she felt a soreness in her her left hamstring. She cursed under her breath, she must have pulled it a bit too much when she tried to stabilize her fall. This was going to be a major pain. Still, she pressed on; Tyler needed her, she didn't want to see the big guy in a wheelchair the rest of his life. One, because that would that would be incredibly unsexy in bed, not to mention just walking around; she didn't want to it to look like she was just some big dope's caretaker. And two... Tyler was a sweet guy; easy to please, incredibly dorky and, while it lasted, delicious arm-candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed David's cum. 'Ugh, why does that sound so wrong?!\" she mused to herself. She trekked her way across the ruined landscape of the field, slowly this time, trying her hardest not to slip or pull her muscle any more than she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one 'little' obstacle in her way. At first, she thought she was seeing things, a big brown bear sauntering up to her with his thick cock in hand. Then she realized, she was in for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick loomed over the tiny fox, a dollop of his pre raining down on her petite frame. \"How ya doin' babe?\" he bellowed, flashing her a charismatic smile, taking his hands off his dick to rub them over his pecs as he bounced them for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, do I know you?\" Jessica replied. The guy looked familiar, like on the bears on the football team. It was either Burt or Rick, she knew that for certain, both of them blubbery to the core; except one had talent, and the other was sort of a loser. She looked at the bear's face, she had to admit, without all that baby fat, this guy was actually pretty handsome... or maybe that was just the muscles, at this moment she hated herself for being a sucker for big guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear looked visibly hurt, his smile disappearing. It was then he realized just who he was talking to. He looked down his snout at her, this was Jess, that girl who wouldn't stop going on about how unfit he looked. \"It's Chubs,\" he snarled, using the girl's favourite moniker for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was a bit surprised. This was Rick?! She wouldn't be lying if she said she found him attractive now, but the way he was acting reminded her of Fang. And that made her instantly place him in the do-not-want bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Rick-Rolls, I see you've been working out.\" The bear was slightly taken aback; was she complimenting him? Her sweet voice suddenly became more sinister. \"What are you up to? A tonne? Two? I guess that means you've lost weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear roared in anger before stomping towards the little fox. Normally, she'd be able to dodge at the swipe, but given the shitty condition her leg was in, she was easy prey. The colossal bear brought her up to his face and snarled, \"Nobody talks to me like that anymore. You understand, bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was frightened, but she stayed firm, she wasn't going to bend over to someone like Rick. \"Nice to see you lost your s-s-stutter when you talk to pretty girls, Chubs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sent the bear into a rage. He had all the power, he had all the strength, he had a dick that could split the earth underneath him if he so wanted, and this wench dare defy him? He threw her to onto his raging cock, the length as large, if not larger than her. \"Get stroking,\" he commanded. Jess tried to use the opportunity to escape, she tried to roll off the bear's shaft, but Rick quickly caged her in his paws. \"Uh uh.\" He lifted her higher atop his shaft so that her face was mashed against the head of his cock. \"Suck and stroke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess did as he told her. She could feel his paw holding onto the back of her head, if this bear wanted to he could wring her neck in an instant. The fox began to cry as she was forced to service the now moaning Rick; it was Fang all over again. She was a tool, just a object to be used by this brute. She said to herself she'd never let another man treat her like this again, but here she was, imprisoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was already so close, he grunted with satisfaction as the girl lick the head of his cock and rubbed him with all her might. She was so tiny, he could barely feel her hands moving, but that only excited him more; he held such power now. The bear fell backwards, his knees too weak to support his wavering posture as he felt orgasm begin to settle in. As his ass slammed into the ground he began to cum. \"Fuck, yeah! I'm the fuckin' stud!\" he roared into the air. His semen gushed out of the tip of his dick, forcing its way up Jess's mouth and nose as Rick held her there as he orgasmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like minutes, the bear went slack, enjoying the afterglow of his first conscious orgasm since becoming this new monstrosity. He felt damn good, and he wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica felt the bear's grip loosen on her. There was one thing Jess always prided herself in, she didn't sulk or feel sorry for herself when she was in the shits. And she definitely didn't feel sorry for herself now. She was angry. Rick's grasp was surprisingly slack, the bear was too busy enjoying himself to realize that she was now on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled along the brown cum-slicked grooves that made up Rick's torso, all the way to his neck. The bear looked at her, his eyes half-lidded when he gave her a snide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. This loser did not just try to act superior to her. She brought her good leg around and slammed it into Rick's jaw. At first, the bear looked stunned, then his eyes rolled back as his head slammed down into shallow lake of cum below. She spat at his now unconscious bear's snout and rubbed away the cum that had collected at the side of her mouth. \"Yeah, some stud you are, can't even handle a girl. Just remember, Chubs, you'll always be the joke 'round here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around; she had to hurry. Tyler didn't have much time. She hopped off the bear, the impact on her knees sent her sprawling face down into the slicked-up turf. She was tired, but she needed to press on, for once she needed to be strong, not just act it. Her heart sank when she heard the deep grunt of another giant waking. She pulled herself up and that's when she saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jess froze as she watched the wolf\u2019s face disappear behind David\u2019s thigh. The idea of Fang being awake terrified her. It was enough to make her want to abandon her little quest and flee the scene. But she couldn't let Tyler down, not after what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess was torn. If she stuck to her plan, she would be able to save Tyler\u2019s legs. But then Fang would suck David while he slept, negating everything that Tyler had risked and sacrificed. She scowled at the thought. No, she had to wake David up. He was the only thing that could stop Fang, and protect everyone from the escalating madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut having said that, could she even trust David anymore? He had lied to her about fighting the wolf, instead he seemed to have literally grown quite close to the evil fuck. Rick had certainly changed. Jess had seen Fang in the bear\u2019s eyes. And with a shiver, she remembered how she saw Fang in Tyler\u2019s earlier. Maybe the extra size had changed David in a similar way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if Fang or Rick were to start walking around again, she would prefer David awake than asleep. Even if David turned on her\u2026 well, she was done for anyway. Was there any real difference between falling off a thirty story building, and a ninety storied one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAVID!\u201d she shouted up at the drake with as much force as her lungs could muster. She saw Fang\u2019s enormous ears twitch, turning to face her. A moment later, the wolf\u2019s eyes rose above the blue thigh. Fang didn't let his tongue off the Drake\u2019s shaft as he stared at the fox with cold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess\u2019s heart froze. She wanted to run, but her limbs didn't respond. That was the sociopathic wolf that had just tried to kill Tyler; who had raped her last night. And he was looking right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jess felt more vulnerable than she had ever felt in her life. \u201cDAMN IT DAVID! WAKE UP!\u201d She shouted at the drake again, her voice holding far more desperation than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid responded by moaning, his head rolling slightly as his mouth opened in a broad smile. Jess had no idea if he could even hear her form that distance. Fang had managed to, but he was a wolf. How good was a drake\u2019s hearing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl, Jess started running towards David. If he couldn\u2019t hear her, then he would damned well be able to feel her boot in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she advance, Fang shifted himself, lifting the cock up over onto David's stomach as he positioned his massive frame over the drake's abdomen. He rested one of his massive hands pointedly on the ground beside David\u2019s chest. Jess came to a stop as she saw how he had positioned himself, easily able to reach any position around the slumbering drake. He stared back at her as his tongue continued to service the ebony length, silently daring her to come closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess snarled back at him. That was it. She wasn\u2019t going to let herself be afraid anymore. From then on, whatever happened, happened. \u201cYeah, you work that dick big guy.\u201d She spat up at the giant wolf, her voice laden with bitterness. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got experience, is there something you want to come out of big guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s eyes flashed as his mouth opened up in a grin. \u201cI enjoyed our time together last night, slut.\u201d He rumbled softly, taking his tongue off the shaft just long enough to finish the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess\u2019s face contoured into the largest snarl she had ever borne. \u201cDamn it DAVID!\u201d she screamed at the blue mountain of muscle that rose above her. David simply panted in response. A moment later, he lifted one of his enormous feet into the air, and slammed it down onto the pitch, tearing a small chasm through the dirt as he extended it outwards. The noise boomed through the stadium as the earth shook violently. Still, the drake slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess growled. Well, if that ruckus wasn\u2019t enough, then there was nothing she could do to wake the fool. He was just too damned big. The fox turned her attention back to the original task at hand. She had to work fast, it wasn't safe for her to be on the field with Rick and Fang around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were two problems. Firstly, what the hell was she supposed to hold the cum in once she got some? She could hold it in the palms of her hand, she guessed, but how much would be left by the time she got back to Tyler? And would she be able to carry enough, even if there was no spillage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was how the hell could she tell David\u2019s semen from Fangs? It all looked white to her. The field was covered in it, it was more or less one big puddle. And just to further cloud the waters, now Rick was depositing his own loads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, her first problem solved itself when she spotted an overflowing bin in the front row of the bleachers. With a flourish of energy, Jess jumped over the fence and stared rummaging through the garbage. There were plenty of empty soda cups to choose from. How much did Tyler need? The largest size was probably way too much, but then again, his legs were pretty fucked. She settled on the big cup, figuring that she wasn\u2019t going to come back for more if she didn\u2019t bring enough, and Tyler could simply not drink more than he needed. As she turned to leave, she hesitated. She quickly turned back to get a second cup, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, she thought to herself. Now how the hell does she determine what to fill the damned things with? Her eyes caught a slight shimmer coming off the bleachers next to her. A few ropes had apparently cleared the field altogether, apparently splashing into the stands. That had to be David\u2019s, she realised. Fang had faced the other way when he came just before, and besides, she could remember seeing David spray everything just before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed over the benches to where the sticky mess lay, filling them as much as she could by scraping the fluid into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMnfh\u2026 Jess\u2026\u201d David rumbled behind her as fang stated to envelop his maw around the drake\u2019s length. \u201cFuck yeah, bitch.\u201d He cried out deliriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess raised an eyebrow. Was David dreaming about her? Was it her screaming that had put her in his mind, or was dreaming about her something the drake typically did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid lifted a hand up off the ground, and blindly probed the beast that was sucking him. His claw grabbed hold of the wolf\u2019s enormous shoulder.  \u201cFang\u2026\u201dDavid said with a devious grin. He murred as his body writhed on the ground. \u201cFang\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang!\u201d David cried out in surprise, his colossal body flinching as he abruptly woke to the sight of the small wolf eagerly working his shaft. \u201cHaa\u2026\u201d he exhaled almost helplessly. Damn it, this felt awesome. His mind almost melted away as the wolf serviced him devoutly. But as tempting as it was to just sit back and relax, there was a niggling voice in the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had almost forgotten why he had engineered this situation. He needed to talk with Fang, to show him that he cared about him. That he wanted to see him change; to help him change. Prove that he viewed the wolf as more than an object of lust. This whole setup was off message, and if he let it happen, then it could only work against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, fuck the world this felt awesome. It seemed the more compelling of the arguments. And the way that Fang looked up at him, the wolf\u2019s golden eyes wide and locked onto his own, his black ears low and pointed backwards... Fang just looked adorable. David knew that it was bizarre, but he couldn't stand the thought that he could be so cruel as to push that face away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fuck\u2026\u201d David said between breaths as his enormous feet writhed, biting his lip as he watched the wolf go to town on him. Fang\u2019s tongue roughly traced his length, exploring every inch of it, as his pre leaked down his shaft like a thick black veiny fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it David!\u201d He heard a familiar voice scream up at him. Startled, the blue drake turned his head, and with a gaping mouth, stared hazily at the figure that had addressed him. It took him a few blinks to recognise Jess. That was when he started to realise exactly how big he had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the stadium, which to his alarm like a scale model as it surrounded him. Fang wasn\u2019t the same size as he was when he went on the trip, he realised. Fang was bigger than ever, and he STILL dwarfed him. He had gone way overboard, how the hell did he grow this much in a single trip?! He groaned. He intended for it to be out of despair, but it ended up sounding more out of desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d Jess demanded. David looked back at her with surprise, having already forgotten that she was there.<br>\r\nWhat was she doing here? That didn\u2019t make any sense. Was she carrying two cups of beer? The scene felt\u2026 almost surreal. For a second, David began to question whether he was still asleep. But he quickly dismissed it. The sensations the wolf was eliciting felt far too intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groaned as he felt the wolf step it up a notch. The wolf traced his paws around the back of David\u2019s thighs, lifting the drake\u2019s hips as he held his body close. Fang took as much of the drake\u2019s length as he could, sucking and blowing as he gently rocked David\u2019s pelvis back and forth. David took the cue, and adjusting his feet, started to voluntarily buck his hips to the rhythm the wolf had set. Fang smiled. It wasn\u2019t a warm or fond. It was almost triumphant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when David was finally aware that the wolf was manipulating him, playing on his desires. But did David care enough to stop it? He could feel his orgasm building. He was so close.</span></div></div>",

He looked down at the, dare he say cute, wolf and kept a stoic face, shaking his head. \"Not happening, Fang.\" In his mind he wanted to add, 'Not yet, at least,' secretly wishing for a larger, but more complacent beast to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's visage instantly twisted into a sneer. As the dragon held onto Fang, the wolf began to thrash about. \"This wasn't the deal, David,\" he spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal? I don't remember a deal, Fang.

David must have been a good twenty feet taller than he was, just looking at the dragon's terrifying musculature, the drake could probably obliterate him easily. Whatever game David was playing, Fang knew he had to be careful if he wanted to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give you blowjobs, I get bigger. What part of that isn't a deal? You trying to stop me wasn't in it,\" Fang snarled. The wolf glared angrily at David as he began to thrash anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to stop you, Fang,\" David replied calmly. There was stunned silence, Fang looked incredulously back at the drake, not knowing what David had meant by those words or the faint smile on the dragon's face. Fang felt his ears pull back bashfully, however this time it was genuine. David wanted him to grow? He entertained the thought of David nurturing him, almost lovingly. But he knew better, his sudden shyness quickly turning into a unamused glare. In reality, he knew David just wanted to use him to fulfill his sexual fantasies. In the end, Fang meant nothing to the drake, so Fang tried hard to make sure David meant nothing special to him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the dragon wasn't making it easy. Fang felt the drake's massive paw holding his jaw up, forcing him to stare at the dragon's eyes. David's gaze was soft, almost comforting. Slowly, the wolf felt David's grip loosen a bit, but instead of trying to pry himself free, Fang let David hold him; the wolf was confused, what was David up to? He had dug the hole deeper, waded further into the sea of blood. He was unlovable, yet here David was, acting so tenderly towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small voice came from the side. Standing in the bleachers was a petite arctic fox. Jessica was yelling, \"David, you fucking idiot! Don't you dare grow that- that monster.\" Fang snarled at the sentiment. There it was again, he was a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was shaking, trembling with ire, \"If I <i>ever</i> meant anything to you, you'll put your fucking dick away and beat the shit out of that cum-dumpster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess-,\" the drake started softly, but was quickly interrupted by the upset vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't, David. You know what he did to me. And do you know what he did to your brother? <i>Do you</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid glanced at the wolf in his hold. Fang had stopped struggling and was now trying to avoid eye contact. The dragon knew something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang,\" David said cautiously. \"Did you do something to Tyler?\" The drake's voice held a hint of desperation. He wanted to help Fang, but he needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Fang, tell him. Tell him how you crushed him under your foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's grip on the wolf began to tighten. The dragon looked for a reaction in Fang, but the wolf's face remained as stone. The drake felt his lips pull back into an instinctual sneer. \"Is it true?\" In truth, David already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang nodded, he vaguely remembered chasing the little squirt across the field while his vision became increasingly rainbow-filled. He replied softly, \"I was tripping. I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To HELL you didn't!\" David roared. He threw the wolf off him. Fang landed on his side with a dull thud and heavy squish on the turd beside him. David stood up and really showed just how large he had become. The late afternoon sun was completely blotted out by his expansive body, his shadow casting an ominous presence over the wolf as he shook with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was torn. This was Fang; the psychotic, raging asshole. But he realized, Fang was also his first. The first guy he actually had fallen in love with, and that had to count for something, didn't it? But what he felt wasn't love, not even remotely. Earlier he may have felt a small rekindling of it, but now, that fire was snuffed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You killed him?! You killed my BROTHER?\" David spat, his saliva foaming at the sides of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Fang cried, edging away from the drake. It only took a single step for David to loom back over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stepped on Tyler, right?\" the drake demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang whimpered and nodded, his yellow eyes going wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will enjoy this,\" David said through gritted teeth. He raised a foot into the air and brought it over Fang's head, pausing at the apex. A low satisfied rumble exited David's mouth; pure vindication spilled out. David had never felt it before, this feeling that festered in his gut. For the first time, he had a true taste of hatred unabated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, wait,\" Jessica yelled. \"Tyler's alive, you don't have to kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he did, would it have mattered?\" the giant bellowed back in rage. He didn't wait for a response from Jess, he wanted blood now. No one messed with Tyler but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!\" she yelled. The giant stomped his foot down. For a second, she thought his foot had went right through Fang's head, but when she looked more carefully, she realized the dragon had stepped just enough to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen David pulled the stunt, Fang knew it was payback. He could tell the intent was there; David wanted him dead. And that caused the wolf to begin to cry. He wasn't scared of death, when it came to danger, Fang laughed at it. He cried because he lost his last vestige of hope in this world. He had hoped that maybe, just maybe, David would try to snap him into his senses, that no matter how out of hand the wolf got, David would say, \"You can change, Fang.\" That someone out there believed that he wasn't this... monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Fang had won, he had gotten David to truly hate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess began to plead on Fang's behalf. \"Don't kill him, you don't want murder on your plate,\" she reasoned with him. More firmly she said, \"Tyler would never want you to murder him.\" She knew that probably wasn't true, but she continued, \"We stick to my plan, you beat the shit out of him and make him suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid began to calm down a bit. Jessica was right, he was better than that, Fang could stoop to murder, but he never could. \"Is Tyler alright?\" he asked emptily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His legs are crushed, so's his tail. It's why I'm bringing him this, to heal him,\" she replied holding up the cups, just thinking about Tyler's sorry state almost brought her to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook her head, even though David wasn't even looking at her, the dragon still too busy glaring at the motionless wolf on the ground. \"You've got business to attend to, David,\" she said, her tone was ice cold as she too glared at the wolf now. \"I assume you know what to do?\" And with that she left, satisfied that she knew Fang now had it coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess said to make Fang suffer? David could do that. He looked at the wolf, a twinge of wildness in the dragon's eyes. \"I'm gonna make you pay,\" he growled. He sat on top of the wolf, pinning him to the ground. He held Fang's jaw roughly and looked down his snout with contempt. \"You don't fucking touch Tyler ever again, you hear me?\" When Fang didn't respond, it sent David into a tantrum. He then brought his fists down onto the wolf's face, raining blow after blow. David reserved his strength, he wanted this wolf to suffer, the blows heavy enough to bruise, but not strong enough so that Fang required healing. He was done with Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, that's what he thought. But as he continued, the emotionally hurt look on the wolf's face began to wear down on him. The big golden eyes pleading for David's senses to return. He felt his blows weaken with each strike until he was left sobbing on top of Fang's defeated body. Why couldn't he continue? What was stopping him from beating the shit out of this guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one last spurt, David renewed his beatings, yelling between his blows like Fang had done to him earlier. \"I loved you, Fang. And I wanted to love you again. But. No matter. How. Many. Fucking. Times. I. Try... You. Push. Me. Away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before David could land another blow, he felt a sharp pain hit...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David cried out in surprise as he felt the powerful blow land painfully on his jaw. The drake was caught completely off guard; he had been so physically and emotionally invested in striking the wolf that he didn\u2019t notice the colossal bear walk up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn\u2019t have enough time to recover from the surprise attack before a second blow landed just below his ear. Dazed, David hunched over, raising a hand to shield his head. He felt himself get shoved off Fang, his enormous blue form snet stumbling sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was vaguely aware that this should have been impossible. He was huge, Fang was the only person alive who could possibly fight him like this. David groggily found his balance and looked up at his unknown attacker, just in time to see a light brown fist crack into the side of his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid frantically scrambled himself up, his feet tearing up the turf below. With a deft flurry of movement, he was able to parry the fourth punch, the swing wide and wild. David followed through while his attacker was off balance, shoving the giant in his side, sending him scuttling several steps backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid finally stood up properly and faced his attacker. It wasn\u2019t until the bear turned to face David before the drake recognised him. \u201cRick?\u201d David asked dumbstruck. The bear's face looked different, it was lean and angular, devoid of the layers of fat that normally packed under his pelt. But it was unmistakably Rick. And he stood only a head shorter than David. The bear was taller than Fang, David realised. Several questions burned in David\u2019s mind. Where the hell did he come from? How the hell did he get so big? \u201cWhy the hell are you hitting me?!\u201d He cried out in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick didn\u2019t say anything as he advanced towards the drake. David could see that his eyes were wild, focused on taking the drake down. David scowled as he lowered his stance, preparing to strike out at the bear. Well, if he wanted to fight, then David wouldn\u2019t bother asking any more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rick caught David by surprise once again. With a noise that could best be described as a war cry, Rick simply drove his whole body at David. The drake let lose a punch of his own, but it crashed ineffectively into the bear\u2019s back as Rick slammed into him, causing David to stumble backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick kept pressing into David, and a step later the drake\u2019s foot had run out of playing field to backpedal into. His foot landed awkwardly onto the dirt embankment that the far bleachers were built over, preventing the drake from catching his balance. He felt himself slowly start to fall backwards as Rick continued to press into his torso, steadily accelerating the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid crashed through the bleachers below him, his enormous seventy foot tall body flattening everything in its path as he landed outside the stadium. The earth exploded as it absorbed his form, tons of dirt shooting into the air as his body sunk into the ground. The ground quaked at the impact, the shockwaves collapsing the damaged stands and caused glass to shatter in the nearby buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid lay stunned as he struggled to catch his breath. His own ears rang from the noise of the impact. He felt and saw the bear climbing over him, Rick\u2019s colossal brown form appearing through the rising cloud of dirt. He smiled down on David, a sinister eagerness behind his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid fought against the bear\u2019s weight as Rick pressed his knees on the drake\u2019s arms, trying to pin him down. The muscle-bound nugget of a ursine was heavy, but not heavy enough to overwhelm David\u2019s superior stature. But as David started to leverage the bear off him, Rick let loose, raining blow after blow on the drake\u2019s exposed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick\u2019s punches landed with a lot of force. It didn\u2019t take long before David\u2019s senses began to cloud, and the strength behind his struggle began to wane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick breathed heavily as he grinned manically, his mouth wide open, exposing his long canines. He has chuckling softly, partially from disbelief, and partly from elation. This was it, he thought to himself. He was actually doing it, he was beating up the biggest guy in the world. He really was a god now, there truly was no one left to stop him. And that meant he could just get bigger, and bigger, and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sordid musings were interrupted as he felt a furry arm wrap around his neck. He lashed out at the figure behind him as he was ripped off the drake\u2019s body, but his wild and blind swings failed to land. Slowly, Rick felt himself rise as Fang lifted the bear\u2019s enormous form over his back. With a great effort, Fang managed to sling the larger bear over him, slamming his body face-first back onto the decimated playing field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one invited you fatfuck!\u201d Fang shouted down on the bear that lay prone in front of him. His pose was broad and powerful, his arms hung wide, his hands curled into fists. The wolf's hackles stood erect, making him look even bigger than he actually was. \u201cI thought I made it clear to never gate crash one of my do\u2019s again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick slowly rolled onto his back. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d he said through struggled breaths, his face pained but manically determined. \u201c\u2026not a fatfuck\u2026 anymore!\u201d he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick leapt up at Fang, his teeth barred in a feral viciousness. David was a good head taller than the bear, and Rick had managed to bring him down. Fang? Fang was nothing, the black ball of canine was eye level to his neck now. It was time for him to get payback for all the years of torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar that echoed through the campus and beyond, Rick took a wild swipe at the wolf, his claws barred, intending to slash the meat off Fang\u2019s chest. But Fang simply leant backwards as he let the swing pass, before exploding his frame indwards, shouldering the bear squarely in the chest. The wolf jumped off the ground on impact, sending Rick flying backwards, falling back onto the turf with force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang quickly leapt onto the bear\u2019s chest, pinning Rick\u2019s arms with his knees. \u201cYou\u2019ve shed your rolls, gummy bear. But being a fatfuck is a state of mind.\u201d Fang sneered down on him. Rick snorted as he snarled up at him. The bear writhed underneath the wolf, leveraging Fang\u2019s weight off him. But before he could pick himself up. Fang jabbed him in the sternum with a lightening quick fist, knocking the wind completely out of the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sneered down on Rick as he felt the bear\u2019s strength fade as he struggled for breath. A constant flow of blood trickled down the wolf\u2019s face, staining the bear\u2019s chest. \u201cYou want to know why you were fat, Rick?\u201d Fang asked contemptuously. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of genetics, or your \u2018big bones\u2019. It\u2019s because you\u2019re a lazy, unmotivated loser. You have no friends. You\u2019re a miserable, entitled child who would rather cry about being a victim than be proactive. You can\u2019t outgrow yourself, Prick. Give it a few months and you\u2019ll be as fat as ever, and in a few years you\u2019ll be back living with your parents, cleaning toilets for a few bucks an hour. There is no hope. You\u2019re just another fatfuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Fang knocked the bear out cold with a single, savage blow to the side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid groggily sat up, spitting a mouthful of blood. He watched Fang pant over the unconscious bear patiently, but the wolf didn\u2019t turn to face him. He seemed to be pointedly ignoring the drake. David eventually groaned. \u201cWhy the fuck did you grow him?!\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do shit!\u201d Fang spat, his voice low and guttural as he kept his gaze firmly on the bear below him. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, the whole fucking stadium is drowning in your spunk. Anyone who wants in on the action can do so at their leisure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at the field. The wolf was right, there was so much. David swore under his breath, and with glance at his disproportionately enormous  testicles, silently cursed them. This was all spiralling further and further out of control. If he couldn\u2019t even keep track of what happened to his own cum anymore\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thought hit him. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d He said to the wolf. \u201cYou could have indulged yourself while Rick fought me, but instead you tore him off me. I was in trouble, and you saved me. You chose to help me over power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s tail curled between his legs as he hunched over the bear, his eyes closed tightly. David shook his head in frustration. \u201cFuck me Fang, you\u2019re impossible to figure out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit, David.\u201d Fang sniffed softly, his eyes opening but still avoiding the drake. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking idiot, and you\u2019ve still managed to figure me out. You know me better than any fucker alive. You know why I am the way I am, why I do the shit I do. You know what I truly want\u2026 no, what I need... from you. And you know what I\u2019m willing to do to get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf sniffed again as his whole body started to tremble. \u201cI\u2019ve never cried before in my life. And I\u2019ve done it twice today, because of you. I\u2019ve never even thought about telling anyone the things I said to you. All my fucking cards on the table, so don\u2019t you dare try and claim that I\u2019m somehow obscure. Don\u2019t you fucking dare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s been lying. I have no fucking clue where you stand, there\u2019s no god damned consistency. I can\u2019t figure out your game. I can\u2019t handle any more of this shit. So, let\u2019s just end this here, one way or the other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang slowly raised his head as he finally looked at David, his golden eyes bloodshot as tears freely flowed down his cheeks, mixing with his blood as they rained onto the bear below him. \u201cSo this is me, not pushing you away.\u201d He said so softly it was almost inaudible. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I want to help you... I care about you...\" he said quietly. David stood up and gestured for Fang to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the wolf stepped over the unconscious bear and walked cautiously towards the dragon. When David opened his arms, Fang sped up until he crashed into the big drake's chest, hugging him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid returned the gesture, folding his arms around the small wolf. \"But, this has to stop, Fang,\" he said stoically, trying not to break down like the wolf was, a slight quiver in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf nodded and sniffled, rubbing a bit of mucous onto David's chest. \"I know,\" he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sort of gross to the dragon, but the sort of gross in the cute kind of way. He couldn't help but chuckle. They had come a long way, Fang and him, from two musclehead 'friends' at a party to two giants, though growing out of control, that were never closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, no matter how tender the moment they were sharing, David knew he still had a 'mission.' He had to keep everyone safe. But that didn't mean he couldn't do it in such a way that would compromise the tender situation. The dragon's strong hands lifted the wolf off his feet. He didn't really think about it, he just acted. He brought Fang up and cradled the wolf, much like the heroine's big squeeze would in a harlequin novel. He smiled down at the wolf in his paws, flashing a charming, toothy grin. \"C'mon, let's go somewhere where we can't hurt anyone else.\" The dragon lifted Fang up, just enough so their muzzles bumped into one another. The drake licked at the wolf's face, grooming him, licking over the wounds and the blood off the matte black fur. David whispered in addition, \"Just in case we want to have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang wanted to be smitten, this was a wet dream come true. Here he was with the biggest dragon ever alive, the hot piece of meat, bone and hide he'd secretly wanted for so long. And the dragon wanted to fucking grow him. But he couldn't. In fact he was a bit disappointed. He wanted to be the one to sweep David off his feet. He wanted to be the one to carry his boyfriend into the sunset. He wanted to be the one looking down as Prince Charming at his prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David... Davey,\" Fang said, pausing to gauge the dragon's reaction as he continued to walk into what looked like a wooded area, they were walking right into the forest by the university. David smiled when he heard Fang using the nickname again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bud?\" the dragon responded as he plowed through the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for believing in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang wiped the last of his tears away, a genuine smile, the one David had sought for so long, crept up on his face. \"I know you want this to be about us...\" He paused and looked away, not believing what he was going to say next. \"Can you put me down for a sec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid frowned a bit, disappointed Fang wasn't into his 'bromantic' gesture as he was, but he complied, placing the wolf down gently. Fang stood up and craned his neck to look David in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you want this to work... Between you and me,\" the wolf started softly. He clenched his fist, determined not to cry again. 'Damn it, I'm going soft,' he thought to himself. He shut his eyes as they started to water and he looked away. \"And I know you want to show me how much you care. But... there are more important things right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared down at Fang. Did the wolf just think selflessly... again? David couldn't help but smile at the remark, he should totally become a self-help guru. And for the briefest of moments, David was proud of Fang. And he wanted to show the wolf just how proud he was. He wanted the wolf to know just how much he cared; Fang was wrong, he deserved all the attention he was getting from the dragon now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't say anything, he just dove at the wolf, knocking him to the ground, sundering the earth around them. The dragon let out a low guttural purr as he bent down and licked at Fang's neck. The drake could feel his shaft becoming erect. He wondered how much Fang should be rewarded for being such a good boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!\" Fang yelped, surprised at how much the drake was attacking him. He felt his heart sank a bit. So this was it? He acts a bit submissive and suddenly David's all over him, like he was the dragon's good little boy? This wasn't what he wanted, he wanted David to like him, not like to use him. If David grew him, he'd show the dragon just how he should be treating his man... The wolf flushed a bit. There he was again, thinking David and him were a couple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, stop,\" the wolf said, going slack, showing the dragon just how not into it he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon grimaced. Didn't Fang want this? \"Why?\" he asked, wiping the saliva from the side of his mouth as he sat up. \"Thought we could use a little foreplay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what I mean to you, Davey?\" the wolf said, almost begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon paused, realizing what this must have looked like, realizing just how out of it he was reacting. Fang was right, this was no way to show he cared for the guy. He got up and sat beside the black wolf, holding himself in such a way to hide his erection as best as possible. \"I'm sorry, Fang. I- I got carried away,\" David said shyly, ashamed at his behaviour. \"I'm not trying to lead you on, just know that,\" he added meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf sat up and leaned in against David, enjoying the broadness of the dragon's arm and shoulder. \"I know,\" Fang replied staring off into the clearing in front of them. Something about just sitting there with the drake felt just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid must have felt it too. He wrapped his arm around Fang's shoulder as he too stared of into the open field, watching the sun bleed into the evening. The wolf in his arms exhaled slowly, David thought it sounded like contentment. \"This is nice,\" he said, turning his head to the wolf. Fang looked back up with a happy, yet sad half-smile. David knew there was something holding Fang back. \"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's face was now stone, not a trace of that happy wolf left in his expression; in it's place was pure determination with a dash of... fear. \"We have to go back, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Fang, we could hurt people,\" David shook his head, looking over their massive bodies. Damn, they were getting way too big already, and he wanted to grow Fang even more? Just for showing a little promise of the nice guy lurking underneath?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I don't know that, David?\" the wolf spat, almost panicked. \"Just look at what I did to Tyler. We have to go back, we have to know if they're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, I don't think that's such a great idea. Tyler, the girls, they probably don't think very much of you at this point. We can work slowly. I want to see Tyler too,\" David said, but paused for a moment, he hoped to God that Tyler was okay. \"But we need to work things out between us first. Fang, I forgive you - for all those shitty things you've done. I know it's taken some time, but I think I can finally say I'm falling back in lo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, David!\" the wolf yelled, standing up and tugging at the dragon's shoulder, a marked urgency in his actions. \"We fucked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang-\" David was a bit upset at the wolf's bluntness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get it, you idiot? We need to get to Tyler and the girls now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're fine, Fang-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! They're not! Fuck, do I need to spell it out for you? We. Left. Rick. There.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid bolted upright. Rick was still at the campus? He looked around. He knew he had forgotten something... And the stadium was full of his cum... The two giants ran back the way the came from, anything that survived the wake of destruction David had left behind to get here was surely trampled now. \"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There didn\u2019t seem to be anything immediately alarming as the giants arrived back on campus. But as David approached the stadium, he realised that there was a dormant threat that waited patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was curled up in a ball, softly sleeping. He was enormous, it was impossible to tell exactly how big, but he was easily bigger than David. And judging from the ropes of cum that splattered across the landscape from his cock, he could wake up at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes lowered to a shallow white stream that flowed out the back of the stadium and into the forest. He realised that the stadium\u2019s drainage system had been slowly dumping the flood of semen through a concrete storm pipe. He scowled as he saw freshly turned earth in front of it. So that\u2019s where Rick had run away to earlier, growing in stealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s heart sank when he saw his brother looking up at him. Tyler stood just in front of the playing field, his form frozen in a guilty pose. He was naked again. He must have been twenty feet tall. And he was after some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Tyler.\u201d David shook his head in despair as he walked up to his brother. \u201cWhat have you done to yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s scowled. \u201cWhat did you expect? Did you SEE what that bear did to Jess? And then you just wandered off and left him there?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid.\u201d Fang urgently interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake turned around to Rick\u2019s face smiling back up at him. David squared his shoulders as he looked down on the bear sternly. Rick scoffed at the display, and slowly picked himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s face didn\u2019t change as he watched the brown bear slowly rise higher and higher above him. When he finally stood erect, he was close to a hundred feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid spoke up at him. \u201cOk Rick. You\u2019re one of us now, that means there\u2019s a lot of responsibility\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d Fang curtly interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid wasn\u2019t upset at the wolf\u2019s interjection. He could tell by the way Rick was looking at them that he was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to enjoy finally putting you in your place, you little dog.\u201d Rick chuckled malevolently. He turned to David and shrugged. \u201cFor you though David, it\u2019s nothing Personal. I hope you understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rick lunged towards the blue drake, wrapping his arms tightly around David as he lifted him off the ground, squeezing him tightly. Fang growled and climbed up the bear\u2019s body, wrapping an arm around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick let go of David, grasping at the wolf. With ridiculous ease he ripped Fang off him, throwing the wolf onto the earth below, immediately turning to face the drake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang picked himself up as quickly as he could, the action smooth and unhindered. In truth, his whole body ached, particularly the shoulder that had impacted with the ground. But while his heroics went unnoticed by the duelling giants, it was simply not in his nature to ever show weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled in frustration. David was holding up, but it was only a matter of time before he succumbed to the Bear. The size difference was just too great. The drake could get in as many hits as he wanted, but Rick would easily absorb them. He couldn\u2019t win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was like a midget in a bar fight. He could charge back in, but aside from sating his urge to do something, it wouldn\u2019t achieve much. He was as likely to get in David\u2019s way as he was Ricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked around for inspiration, his scowling face masking his rising sense of urgency. His eyes locked on Tyler, who stood frozen as he watched his brother fight.. Fang snarled at the pathetic sight. With a flash of anger, he approached the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here!\u201d he shouted. Tyler didn't notice the wolf until he was just a step away. Tyler barely had time to flinch before the wolf had his arm wrapped around him, lifting him up over his shoulder like he had done to David earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d the drake cried out. \u201cPut me down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up you little purple sponge!\u201d Fang snarled as he swiftly carried him away, his arm locked tightly around the purple drake as he kicked in protest. \u201cYou wanna be the hero? Well now\u2019s your chance. Your brother needs you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Tyler felt himself getting roughly dumped onto the ground. He scrambled himself up, turning to face the wolf that towered over him. Fang gave him a contemptuous evaluation as he studied him from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce upon a time you\u2019d have been impressive, but now you\u2019re stuck in no man\u2019s land, son. You want to play with the big boys?\u201d Fang pointed to the stadium\u2019s drainage outlet behind Tyler, the slow but constant trickle of cum freely flowing down into the forest. \u201cGet sucking.\u201d He commanded the drake. \u201cAnd get your mouth over it, so it keeps coming in, even when you\u2019re out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler swallowed, his eyes darting between the wolf and the drain pipe. What was Fang playing at? It almost sounded like he was trying to help. \u201cWhy me?\u201d He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause when David goes down, Rick will kill me while I\u2019m tripping. I can stall him for you, but you can\u2019t stall him for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler licked his lips. No, there was something here he wasn't getting. He had to think quickly, what was Fang up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snarled at the drake\u2019s hesitation. \u201cHurry up, there\u2019s no time!\u201d The he barked as he took a step backwards, impatient to return to the fight. \u201cI\u2019ll hold him up as long as I can, but don\u2019t count on any miracles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick threw David face-first into the dirt. The drake had been a hell of a lot tougher this time around. Had they been the same size, Rick knew his ass would have been handed to him. But as it stood, David was battered, bloodied and concussed; whereas Rick felt nothing the adrenalin couldn\u2019t mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick threw himself onto the drake as he landed. The bear felt David\u2019s back muscles relax as he struck him on the back of the head. He sat on top of his defeated foe for several moments, breathing heavily as he absorbed his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFANG!\u201d The bear roared into the air, his voice flattening the grass around him. He smiled as he saw the black wolf waiting patiently for him in front of the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick grunted powerfully as he rose to his feet, his enormous form slowly rising to twice the height of the wolf\u2019s. He was going to get his revenge; that was a foregone conclusion. But he wanted some foreplay, to savour the moment. He wanted the wolf to fear him.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fatfuck.\u201d Rick said with a smirk. \u201cI\u2019m not a loser. I have plenty of friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName one.\u201d Fang demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick\u2019s face dropped. \u201cWhat, that you\u2019d know?\u201d he stammered. \u201cMost of my friends don\u2019t go to this college, but\u2026 Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smirked. \u201cSo you count people who don\u2019t despise you as being friends, but you can still only manage to come up with one name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to bully me anymore Fang. I\u2019m gonna make you pay for everything you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr you\u2019ll lose interest half way through and wander off to the cafeteria like you usually do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d The bear shouted. \u201cSlowly! I\u2019ll dissect you. Cut you open, try and make up for all those science classes I skipped. You\u2019re gonna bleed to death, Fang!\u201d He took a step towards the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scoffed, standing his ground. \u201cFifty bucks says you end up stuffing your face with whatever you pull out of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick struggled to supress tears of frustration. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, and you\u2019re still bullying me?! What the fuck is wrong with you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cPretty much everything, Rick. I\u2019ve got a million things wrong with me, but at least I ain't a fatfuck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight started with those words, Rick snarled as he charged at the wolf. Fang moved like water. Not only did he deftly spin out of the bear\u2019s way, but he even managed to land a blow on one of his passing thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf kept his distance, dodging Rick\u2019s attacks before abruptly exploding forwards with a quick, powerful strike. His strategy was simple. In, and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was flustered by the fifth such attack, his swings growing wilder. Fang was able to land blow after blow, but they simply didn\u2019t add up. The wolf was buying time, waiting for a miracle. But he only had one move, and eventually Rick managed to take advantage of his predictability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear feigned an attack, never intending to follow through. Fang took the bait, and as he lunged forwards, Rick reversed the strike. His blow landed successfully on the side of the wolf\u2019s neck with a solid thud, sending Fang airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s body exploded in pain as he landed a good thirty feet away. He stared up in wide shock, unable to move as he watched the bear walk up to him, and dropped a knee onto his torso. Fang was driven into the ground as he felt a familiar snap in his ribcage, an excruciating pain searing though him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick held out an open paw above the wolf, the sunset shimmering though his claws. \u201cAre you afraid, Fang?\u201d Rick asked. The bear\u2019s eyes were wide and hungry, his breaths deep but controlled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked at the claw Rick held over him as he pondered the question. This was it; his own sword of Damocles, about to fall. Was he afraid? He had his regrets, certainly. And not just the regrets that he usually burdened. He regretted that it should all end now, right when David had begun to save him. Right when someone loved him. But was he afraid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Fang managed to voice calmly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Get away from him, Rick,\" a voice from behind the bear called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant of a bear reared his head, a contemptuous sneer raked across his face. \"Thought I took care of you, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there was the blue drake, his eyes half-lidded and his breathing ragged. David took a wobbly step forward before repeating, \"Stay away from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what?\" the bear snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll beat your fat ass to kingdom come,\" David retorted, cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear rose, and rose and rose, standing up to tower over the dragon, a wicked grin plastered to his face. David had to admit, Rick was quite the imposing figure. Rick slowly walked up to David. The drake obviously expected the bear to lash out, but the cocksure strides of the bear telegraphed anything but. David had to give a slight whimper as Rick lorded over him, the bear so close David's snout almost touched the bottom of Rick's titanic chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got nothing against you, David,\" the bear said smoothly. He flexed his chest, the dragon bearing witness as the muscle in front of his swelled with power, mashing into face. \"Hell, I guess I should be thanking you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you should be,\" David gulped, slightly mesmerized by the display of power in front of him. \"So stay away from Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" the bear snarled. \"What's he ever done for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my friend, Rick. And I thought you were too,\" David said, pushing the bear away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some friend you were. You called me names, you pushed me around, just like all the other guys on the team,\" the bear rumbled, though David could tell that his voice was cracking a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was I supposed to know you were sensitive about your weight? You never let it show! Neither did the guys. And when'd I ever push you around?\" David snarled back. \"You're selfish Rick. You think we hated you or something? Dude, me, Marcus, Burt... hell, even Zack, Kev and some the others, we're all worried about you. You never come to practice, we don't see you in class. Coach is about to kick you off the team. You're our friend, we would've helped you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear stopped for a moment. The guys actually cared about him? \"You're lying,\" he concluded. There was no way they wanted a guy like him on the team. \"You and the other fuckers. You all hate me, just like Fang. That's why I'm gonna kill all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pushed at Rick's chest hard. \"Can you fucking hear yourself, dude? This isn't you at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? And what do you know about me David?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared blankly at the now heaving chest of the bear. He didn't really know too much about Rick. The guy tried to hang out with the rest sometimes, although Fang would usually pick him out of the group. It didn't help that David never helped him out, that he sometimes joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick, I'm sorry,\" David said solemnly. \"All I know is that you're a good guy. Don't do this.\" He looked at the bear's muzzle. Rick's expression was blank, as if contemplating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late to say that, David,\" Rick replied, coming out of his daze, snapping back to the cruel reality. \"You said you're my friend. You said coach was gonna kick me off the team. Then why didn't you do anything about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't I do anything about it?! What the fuck, Rick. Why didn't <i>you</i> do anything about it? That's you're problem, you don't want to do anything! You make it on the football team and you don't do jack shit. You're sensitive about your weight and yet I never see you at the gym. Coach didn't pick you as a charity case. Dude, you're as talented, if not more talented than Burt as a linesman, but you never practice. Look at you, you are one handsome stud, if you worked out with us, you would have had any chick on lap, any day of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear backed off a bit, a bit stunned by what David had said. The message was exactly the same as Fang's; Rick you're a lazy-ass, good for nothing slob. \"You looking down on me, David?\" he said icily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, Rick? I just complimented you.\" David knew it was impossible, no matter what he said, Rick thought he was against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't talk to me like that anymore, you got that, runt?\" Rick growled. \"I'm a god now, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear flexed all his muscles on  display, revealing to David his full power. Just then, Rick's enormous prick started to swell. David's mouth curled in disgust, was Rick really getting off on all this power? Was this what happened if a guy got too much of his spunk? Could his seed actually change a person's personality or was Rick like this all along? And that scared him. If his spunk turned Rick aggressive like this, did that mean him and Fang... did they really like each other? Or was it another byproduct of the spunk? Maybe Rick just had too much testosterone in him, something the fat bear never had much of before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Rick was hot, heavy and horny. He grabbed hold of David and rumbled, \"I'm a handsome stud, right?\" David instantly groaned, regretting he had ever said that. If he survived this, he'd have to keep track of his tongue. The bear's tongue lolled out as he began to stroke his massive shaft to full hardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to back off, but Rick held him in place. \"Rick, what are you doing?\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I just realized, David?\" the bear grunted. \"I now know how you and Fang kept yourselves big all these years. You two must be faggots for each other. That's how you guys got big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no!\" the dragon yelped. He tried to pull free, but the bear was too strong. \"We worked hard to get our bods, this shit is new.\" This 'shit' being their giantness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't keep the truth from me, David. He's your boyfriend, isn't he? That's why you side with him, that's why you let him do shit to everyone! That's why you let him ruin my life!\" Rick spat. He let go of David's shoulder and pushed the drake to the ground. The bear was acting completely irrational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear took his hard monster of a cock and shoved it into David's face. \"Suck it!\" he demanded. The dragon turned away, but the bear roughly grabbed at David's jaw, forcing him to look at the enormous prick in front of him. \"Suck it, or I'll kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick, please, you need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need anyone. Not anymore,\" the bear raged. That anger turned swiftly into lust as he shot a large load of pre over David's face. The bear's tongue lolled out of his mouth. Damn this cock felt good. But he wanted an even bigger one. He gazed down at the pinned dragon. He knew where to get more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang watched as Rick forced David to suck him off as the bear sucked David off, a crude attempt at soixante-neuf. He wanted to help, but the pain in his chest was too great, all he could do was turn his neck to watch. He could feel blood filling his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear was the first to cum. His immeasurable load flowed into David's gullet, the dragon moaning in what sounded like delight as he drank from Rick's cock. Fang had to admit, he'd probably be moaning too if he had to take Rick like that. The bear was simply too much muscle, too much power, too much cock; otherwise known as Fang's deepest fantasy of a man. But he knew, if David came, there'd be no hope left for anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw David squirm underneath the bear. Fang knew that look on David's face, he was close. It was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until he saw what David did next. David took one hand holding Rick's thighs and balled it into a fist. On Rick's next large thrust down into David's mouth, the dragon brought his fist crashing into the gigantic scrotum teabagging his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick's mouth dislodged as he screamed out in a mix between lust and pain, a howl between orgasm and torture. He pushed David off as he held his nuts, still cumming like no tomorrow. David took the opportunity to stand, his own ebony shaft twitching on the verge of release. With one swift motion, David brought his foot crashing into the side of Rick's head, knocking the bear out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang almost laughed at the display. But held it in, lest he cough up any more blood. He looked at David standing there, he wanted to see his dragon's face, but never got to. David fell onto his knees and moaned loudly. Fang watched as a geyser of fresh cum erupted from David's shaft, coating the bear in his spunk and the field in a renewed layer of his jizz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had been guzzling on the pipe for quite some time now. It was absolutely foul. Most of the cum wasn't even David's, whoever's it was, they seriously needed to change their diet habits, the cum was so acrid it made the purple drake gag. Because most of it wasn't David's the effect was so dilute. Tyler wasn't even tripping, just a slight buzz from the growth thus far. Tyler had only gained about ten feet, bringing him up to a gargantuan 30 feet, but he was still dwarfed by even the likes of Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until a fresh wave of heavy cum started pouring down the drain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler pulled his head away from the drain as a draft suddenly flowed out of it. He could tell by the echoing rumbles that came from within that something big was coming his way. And after the recent cries that had come from the other side of the grandstands, there was little doubt what that something was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler licked his lips nervously. He had persevered through the foul trickle, but faced with the oncoming surge, the drake suddenly reviewed the situation with some trepidation. Just how committed was he to this cause?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was having regrets. Had he sat down and rationalised the situation earlier, perhaps he would have chosen differently. In many ways, he was literally living his dream life. He was huge, strong and sexy. He was going to try out for the football team. He was making progress with the hottest chick in college. And if that didn't work out, then he had a paddock full of women clamouring for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he left that behind. If he was honest with himself, he HAD secretly wanted more. When he saw Fang fill his house, and when he laid eyes on the twenty foot Rick, he was jealous. But Tyler wasn\u2019t stupid. David really had snapped him out of his lust for more. Not initially, but over the course of the day, his words had sunk in. Tyler came to realise that ten feet really was enough, and that there is too much of a good thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he saw Rick \u2018play\u2019 with Jess\u2026 something inside him snapped. He was powerless to do anything but watch. He was sick of the powerlessness. Even at ten feet tall, brimming with muscle, it still burdened him. He decided then and there that he would never feel like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he drank both cups that Jess brought back to him. That one action ended life as he knew it. Fruitlessly, as it turned out. By the time he had come too, things had already gotten even further beyond his control. He couldn\u2019t stop the sixty foot bear from licking the stadium dry when David and Fang wandered off. And he couldn\u2019t do anything to help his brother when he fought the hundred foot bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was right, he was in no-mans land. Too big to be normal, still too small to rid himself of the powerlessness. But while he had his regrets, he knew that thing\u2019s couldn\u2019t stay as they were. He had to either be small and normal, or big and powerful. And since there was no going back, the only way left was forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler closed his eyes as he put his maw over the end of the pipe as the surge neared. There was no point in doing this by half measures anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orgasm hit David off guard. The bear had gotten him close, but he had managed to get free before it was too late. The secondary motion David\u2019s enormous shaft endured when he brought his foot down on the bear\u2019s head was all it took to finish the job, sending him to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflexively, David grabbed his shaft and began to pump it as his load shot out. It took him a moment to realise that he was cumming onto the bear. In the back of his mind, David knew that he needed to turn away. He didn\u2019t want Rick anywhere near what he was expelling. With a grunt, the drake pivoted his frame, leaning against the turf on his elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid swore into the heavens as his load continued to cannon out with such force it tore strips out of the damp turf below. From the corner of his eye, he saw Fang watching him. With a prolonged moan, he crawled over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid would have liked to think that he acted because he knew that the wolf was hurt. That he was primarily driven by benevolence. But in reality, his mind was consumed by his ongoing orgasm, his thoughts as fitful as his body. He just wanted Fang to take him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shoved his length against the wolf\u2019s muzzle. With his injuries, Fang was a somewhat willing recipient, but was nevertheless overwhelmed with what David was dishing out. It quickly reached a point where the wolf couldn\u2019t take any more, and ended up forcing himself coughing and spluttering from the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid finished the final those of his orgasm over the playing field before collapsing next to Fang. He panted heavily as he basked in the afterglow. That load had been building since he last woke up with Fang on the end of his shaft. He had never came so hard in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA delirious Fang crawled up to him, gasping in awe at the drake as he collapsed down on him. David watched the wolf as he begun to grow. It was\u2026 mesmerising. If David\u2019s length had been in danger of softening, it was now quite safe. The drake shifted his weight so that he could properly embrace Fang, holding the wolf\u2019s body close to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt, more than watched the wolf grow from there. David could feel Fang\u2019s feet slide down his own, at the same time the wolf\u2019s head rose up against his chest. The wolf\u2019s weight pressed down on him with increasing force, and David felt his arms begin to part as they wrapped around Fang\u2019s broadening torso. By the time it was over, Fang was comfortably larger than David again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt right to have the wolf bigger than him again. As nice as it was to tower over Fang, to carry him in his arms\u2026 this was the way it always had been, it felt comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang unconsciously licked David\u2019s forehead. With a snort, David looked up at the wolf\u2019s snout and returned the affection. Before he knew it, they were kissing. It was a hard, passionate kiss that got David\u2019s blood racing. He started writing his form against the wolf\u2019s. Damn, it felt good just to grind his dick against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was abruptly stripped from his growing fervour as he felt his rod spurt a load of pre onto the wolf. The drake pulled away from Fang, his eyes firmly on his own erect length as it bobbed with each powerful heartbeat. He was fully ready to go again already. This wasn't normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sat up and looked at the scene around him. The stadium was getting crowded as the three giants lay in it. The grandstands and bleachers were half destroyed, and the playing surface was little more than an uneven muddy quagmire, the artificial grass having long been ripped up, stomped or buried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the stadium, there was a similar pattern of damage. The fight between David and Rick had spilled out over the surrounding fields, the earth scarred and turned. They were so big and heavy now that even standing left a deep scar on the landscape, let alone the damage pivoting and sliding feet tore up. Not to mention the chasms caused by slamming bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously, only one building looked to be damaged. A single storied portable across the field had a wall and roof smashed in. David couldn\u2019t remember the moment it was destroyed. And that frightened him. If they were capable of doing this much damage, without even being fully aware of it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snapped out of his broodings as Rick stirred beside him. \u201cUgh\u2026\u201d the bear moaned as he slowly lifted his upper body up. \u201cYou punched me in the nuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was acutely aware that the bear was still easily bigger than anyone. \u201cYou attacked me, I fought back.\u201d He replied flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick paused, scraping a handful of spunk off his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think of it.\u201d David growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defiant sneer, Rick shoved the handful into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRick!\u201d David shouted as he lunged towards him. The drake's body was still stiff and sore from their last altercation, and he knew that ultimately he couldn't stop the bear from doing whatever he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was overwhelmed as Rick slammed into him, knocking the drake onto his back. David raised his legs to ward off the bear as he jumped on top of him. In hindsight, David probably shouldn\u2019t\u2019 have confronted the bear with an erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s feet pressed against Rick\u2019s massive chest. The bear\u2019s arms were free, and he used them to grab David\u2019s length, pulling it up towards his face. With a great effort, David was able to keep the distance between his cock and the bear\u2019s mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick\u2019s snarl slowly morphed into a smile. \u201cI want more, Santa! I\u2019ve been good all year!\u201d He cried down on the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow. He knew how bizarre the trips could be, but damn, how was this ursine\u2019s brain wired?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid kept pushing the bear away from him with his feet, waiting for the trip to set in. Rick\u2019s mouth opened as he pressed his body down on the drake, trying to overwhelm the legs that repelled him. His tongue reached out to the head of David\u2019s erection, his mind consumed by the single goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear was giggling uncontrollably as he started to grow. David could feel the force that bore down on him steadily strengthen. He started to panic. Rick wasn\u2019t blacking out. He mustn\u2019t have swallowed enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d David yelled as Rick\u2019s mouth wrapped around the top of his cock. The warm touch of the bear\u2019s mouth sent a jolt of pleasure up his body, causing his length to spasm as it dumped a fresh load of pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid whimpered as he watched his erection slowly disappear in the bear\u2019s mouth. He knew this was bad. But in spite of himself, he kind of liked it. Rick didn\u2019t seem to have many redeeming qualities, but he was huge. And the sight of it slowly growing in front of David was a definite turn on. The thought of it getting even bigger more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head violently. He had to stop this. He grabbed the bear's enormous head and pushed against it bear\u2019s with all of his strength, but the raw power behind the bear was overwhelming. David whined again as Rick sucked him off. He could feel his release advancing. This time, there were no nuts in front of him to punch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the wolf's lids opened he had to fight hard to not bask in his immense high of fresh growth, using all his will just to not to sit back and jerk off his longer length. When his eyes began to focus, he grit his teeth at the sight. The giant ursine was sucking David off, the dragon was helpless, and from the looks of it, close again. But Fang was strong now, he could do something now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf picked himself up and stormed towards the couple writhing on the ground. He snarled menacingly. But the response he got was troubling; Rick was giggling as he slurped on the head of David's cock. \"Mm, Santa, your candy cane's so cold, lemme warm it with my mouth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck?\" Fang rumbled. Was this guy tripping? The bear did look a bit bigger, but not much so. Either way, Rick was one fucked up dude. No matter. With his improved strength, Fang tried to pry the humongous bear off of David's dick. To his chagrin, his 90 foot frame just wasn't strong enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang!\" the dragon gasped. Fang looked down to see the drake's pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow wasn't the time to try and act tough. Fang wasn't stupid, he'd learned quickly what he had to do as the smaller guy; Fang was so used to just being able to overpower anyone, but now he had to outwit, he had to aim for the eyes, the nose, the knee, the groin; he had to fight dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing his pride the black wolf stood behind the bear toppling over David, Rick's heavy nuts exposed from behind. The wolf brought his foot crashing into the exposed scrotum. The force caused the bear to gag on the dragon's length before dislodging. Rick began to stand and turn, but toppled over, his face now safely away from David's shaft. He began to crawl as he started to heave, a bit of the pre he had swallowed and stomach acid spilling out of his mouth as he retched from the intense impact of Fang's foot into his groin; all the while he was crying in pain. Fang mused too himself, a bit satisfied, 'That ought to teach you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked down at David, the dragon was so vulnerable right now. The wolf could tell David was on the verge of another orgasm. He was tempted to go down on David, to grow for his dragon. But he knew better. He snarled to himself, 'Where the fuck was Tyler?' That good for nothing pussy probably ran off crying. If Fang ever saw that sponge again, he was going to skin Tyler alive. But now was not the time, the bear was beginning to pull himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang knew he couldn't grow, David was in no shape to protect him if he did, the bear would just follow suit with his own growth, or worse, Rick would kill him. There was only one solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf bent down on top of David. He held a black paw up to David's cheek and cupped it, smiling weakly at him. He leaned down and kissed David on the nose tenderly. \"I'll protect you.\" With that, Fang took David's shaft with his other hand and began to stroke hard. It only took a couple of jerks for the dragon's testicles to pull up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Fang-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, the wolf forced David's mouth over his own shaft as the first wave of semen flooded his mouth. David could feel the unearthly buzz start too kick in. With the drake secured, Fang stood up and turned to Rick, the bear already standing there growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the last straw, Fang,\" Rick roared. \"I'm going to kill you, right here, right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it tubby,\" Fang spat arrogantly, wagging his finger at the gigantic bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang rushed at the bear, the heavy ursine swinging at him. Just like before, Fang dodged the blow deftly, striking at the bear quickly. However, this time, he got within Rick's defences, landing a jab at the bear's sensitive crotch. Rick reflexively held his precious nutsack and backed off slightly winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all you got, gummy bear?\" Fang jeered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear roared with discontent, his mouth seething with venom. It was Rick's turn to rush. With claws bared, the bear came thrashing at Fang, slicing the air with deadly swipes. But none of them landed. The wolf managed to get behind the bear and bringing his foot quickly into Rick's Achilles tendon, causing the bear to stumble from the reflex. This was all Fang needed. As Rick jerked forward, Fang grabbed th back of the bear's head and slammed it down into his knee, the 90 foot wolf knocking the 110 foot tall bear out. Fang let out a snarl in satisfaction and growled over the bear's body, \"That's right, fatfuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked at David, the dragon was writhing on the ground, sucking his massive load in. As David grew his bellows grew deeper and deeper. But to Fang's surprise, David was still conscious, he wasn't tripping yet. In a mighty surge of strength, David pushed his cock out of his mouth, his thickening load now shooting freely over the field with renewed vigour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! Fang was fuming, David wouldn't have a sizable advantage at this point, there was no way he had swallowed enough to completely overshadow Rick, at best the small dragon could match the bear. And Fang knew well that he couldn't risk taking the rest, what if Rick came to? The wolf cursed under his breath, David was wasting so much growth potential. What was he thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon called, \"Fang!\" as he lost the last vestiges of his lucidity, finally succumbing to a mind-numbing trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang watched as David's head slammed into the ground, the dragon's body steadily expanding as his blue body rocketed volleys of his magic cum all over the stadium. Fang sighed, he didn't know how long he'd be able to contain Rick, his tricks wouldn't last forever and this bear was awfully resilient to knock-outs, seemingly recovering from them quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang eyed the bear with contempt as he pinned him underneath. This fatfuck thought he could stand with the best? Preposterous. He looked at the concussed bear's body, a wave of jealousy washing over him. David was right, Rick was one handsome stud. Guiltily, Fang held out a paw and cupped Rick's massive chest. Man, the wolf thought to himself, this guy's actually kinda hot. To his chagrin, he could feel his loins stir at the sight of Rick's massive muscles and handsome features. It was hard to believe that someone like Rick had this much potential. And that thoroughly disgusted Fang - he was getting a fucking stiffy from looking at this fatfuck's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, Fang, get a hold of yourself,\" the wolf said out loud to himself, slapping his own cheek. But he couldn't peel his gaze away, and his hands were absently groping at the bear's huge chest when Rick started to come to; the two of them going wide-eyed as they stared awkwardly at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them could speak when they heard an ominous blast coming from behind the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was in the middle of the most intense trip ever. There was every insect imaginable, crawling all about him, tickling all his senses as he giggled in his head. It just kept going and going and going, there was no end to it; it felt like eternal bliss. He didn't know how large he was becoming, but if the power of his trip was any indication, he was going to enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the extreme length and intensity of this trip, Tyler was thoroughly enjoying himself. That is, until it just kept coming. The visions he started to receive began to twist, the insects swarming around him, complimenting his virility, they all withered into nothingness. The blackness was coming. Finally, he was going to surface back in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the darkness persisted. That's when Tyler felt a strange surge through his body. He knew that something was powering his trip again. What was David doing to him? And that's when his trip became a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the blackness turned to brimstone and sulphur. Tyler looked around, was this hell? He spun around and that's when he saw something that completely freaked him out. Sitting on a colossal throne comprised of bone was the largest dragon he'd ever seen. The pelt was a dark blue, the taut muscle stretched as far as the eye could see. He had to crane his neck way up, just to see the face. The visage was angular, powerful, the horns on top of the dragon's head looked like a corona, emphasizing the true majesty of the creature before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother,\" the beast rumbled. Was this... was this David?! He knew this was another trip, but weren't these supposed to whimsical? Not nightmarish like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am disappointed, brother,\" the titan continued. \"You are so small, so weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, I-\" Tyler began to plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, his brother-deity held up a hand to pause him. The blue drake-god before him began to guffaw, laughing at the tiny purple drake's expense. \"Tyler, you fool, you're blood is the same as mine, it's time to unlock the true power of your ancestry, your lineage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's dream-state body began to seethe with energy. What was happening? In his trip, he yelled to his brother, \"David! David stop. It's too much.\" Tyler was roaring, his voice deepening with each passing moment. \"David. I can't... I can't control it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the real world, the titanic Tyler was beginning to wake. He knew he was huge. The let loose a terrifyingly low roar into the world, the 150 foot tall purple mass of muscle rose to his new glorious heights. Little did the new being born inside Tyler know, with the incredible amount of cum he drank....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler\u2019s body seemed to be buzzing. There was an energy that seemed to flow through him, a sense of raw power coursing through his veins. He knew that the growth left him with a buzz, a high of power. But this feeling was completely different; it felt as if there was a surge building within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stretched his new form as if waking after a great slumber. His joints loudly popped and cracked as he worked them in his new form for the first time. Everything about him had been upgraded. His chest was impossibly thick, and as his fingers probed his pecs, felt as hard a steel. His purple scales were thick and taught, hugging his frame so tightly that every vein and muscle fibre seemed to show through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis frame was muscle-bound; it was impossible for Tyler to touch his shoulder by curling his hand back in on itself. He knew that his frame was slow and heavy. But what he had lost in dexterity, he had more than made up for in raw strength. He commanded an unimaginable amount of mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that the drake bothered to venture out of his narcissism, surveying the world around him as twilight began to settle in. He liked what he saw. He towered over everything \u2013 the grandstands, the buildings, the suburbs, the trees\u2026 the giants in the stadium that were looking up at him, their mouths agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt two incredibly powerful rushes. The first was the unbridled, pure hatred he felt for the wolf and the bear that lay in front of him, separated only by the damaged knee-high grandstand. The fury seemed to spur a sudden rush of testosterone, which elicited a sharp spike in his libido, reminding him of his titanic erection that burned for relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pure instinct that caused Tyler to grab his enormous length, his shaft twitching and spurting pre at the contact. The drake smiled lustfully as he closed his eyes. His meat felt so enormous in his hand, too wide for him to fully envelop his fingers around it. It felt so hard and rough as he started to stroke it, the flesh so sensitive that he couldn\u2019t help but twitch his colossal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take much for him to reach orgasm; his recent bust of growth had let him severely pent up. With a scowl and a snarl, Tyler let his seed burst into the world, not caring where his thick ropey streams landed as he roughly continued to pump his shaft. He came for several intense minutes, moaning and jerking sporadically. It felt good, better than anything he had experienced before. But by the time it was over, he felt strangely unsatisfied. He didn't bask in the afterglow. His blood continued to race hot and fast. He wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience had left him somewhat spent, but Tyler wasn\u2019t so much panting as he was snorting like a bull. His eyes flickered back to the bear and wolf. Fang had lifted himself off Rick, the bear no longer even registering as a threat in the shadow of the drake. The wolf eyed Tyler wearily, his stance rock steady.  Rick had also picked himself up, but in contract to Fang, he was emoting freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear looked up at Tyler with a quivering mouth, his face pale. He was already several steps behind Fang, and continuing to backpedal as the drake locked his gaze upon him. Tyler chuckled malevolently. He revelled in Rick\u2019s terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took a step towards the bear. The grandstand exploded as his enormous foot burst effortlessly through the dust and debris. His titanic toes flexed as they landed on the playing surface in front of Fang, the pads under foot straining as they sunk into the turf, bearing the colossal Burden of Tyler\u2019s mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang felt several blasts of air hit him from all directions as the Drake passed by  with a second footstep. Just a simple movement was enough to throw the surrounding atmosphere into turmoil; pockets of brief but violent winds broke out around his purple form, tearing up the ground and debris. The dust form the grandstand trailed behind the drake\u2019s advancing form, being swept up in the slipstream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick cried out in terror at the approaching giant. The bear turned to flee, but found himself in front of the college\u2019s network of multi-storied buildings. Although he towered over them, they still presented themselves as formidable obstacles as he frantically tried to dart between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the Drake\u2019s foot land close behind him, the tremor causing nearby windows to explode and the earth to shake beneath his feet. In a blind panic, Rick ploughed into the building in front of him, his enormous brown body collapsing through the walls and roof as he desperately tried to scrabble above it. But the building simply couldn't support his weight, and he lost his balance as the structure fell underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick turned to face Tyler and screamed as he saw the enormous purple claw reaching for him through the clouds of crushed concrete. His scream was to be short-lived, however, as Tyler\u2019s hand grasped around the bear\u2019s thick neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffortlessly, Tyler lifted Rick into the air. Although he was only half again the bear\u2019s size, his enormous arm felt little resistance as he hoisted the titanic bear above his head. Rick choked and wheezed, his arms fruitlessly slapping against the drake\u2019s purple wrists while his feet desperately flailed about, failing to find purchase on any part of Tyler\u2019s enormous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler held the bear in his grasp, savouring the moment. This was true power. He marvelled at how the bear\u2019s neck could support the flailing mass of muscle that dangled from it. With a vicious grin Tyler began to squeeze the bear\u2019s throat with his fingers. He increased pressure with a gradual progression, watching at how the bear became simultaneously more desperate and less able to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn\u2019t know if he should dedicate the moment to Jess, or his brother, or even to himself. It didn't matter in the end, the bear\u2019s neck snapped the same way. Rick\u2019s body went abruptly limp in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler dropped the bear soon afterwards, his body crashing into the building it was plucked from, the resulting shockwaves causing the surrounding structures to begin to crumble. Tyler breathed heavily, feeling a rush flow through him. The energy he felt when he woke hadn\u2019t faded, if anything he was feeling more powerful than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake took a step back, and with a deep breath, invested all of his strength in another primal roar. It took a fraction of a second for the soundwave to hit the earth below, but it was devastating as it did so. The earth shook beneath him, dust and light objects were thrown away in the sonic blast as nearly every window on campus shattered. The roar continued to echo through the city around him for a long time after it had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied chuckle, Tyler turned around. \u201cFang.\u201d He said with a satisfied smirk. He began an ominous walk back to the stadium. At his size, he covered the ground in three steps. He looked down on the wolf as he approached. Fang stood almost as high as his throbbing groin. \u201cThe main course, as it were.\u201d Tyler sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget I helped you, bitch.\u201d Fang snarled up at him, his hackles raised as he defiantly stood his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head. \u201cYou crushed my legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou crushed my chest.\u201d Fang spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we aren\u2019t close to being even, Fang.\u201d Tyler chuckled. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is unforgivable. This is just your chickens coming home to roost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler slowly leant his colossal frame down in front of the wolf, bringing himself roughly eye level. \u201cDid you enjoy your time with Jess?\u201d he rumbled with a smirk, his voice cracking over the campus like thunder. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. Apparently, it\u2019s not as much fun being on the receiving end. Tell me what you think of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s defiant stance made him easy pickings when Tyler struck out at him, his powerful hand easily pinning the wolf on his back. Tyler lifted a leg over the wolf, letting his enormous length rest against his body. To his delight, the drake noted how his ebony rod was almost the same size as the black wolf that lay under him. With a grunt, Tyler thrust his length up the wolf\u2019s body before dragging it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you man up and just kill me you twisted fuck!\u201d The wolf roared up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler bit his bottom lip and chuckled in response, his length lathering the wolf in his pre as he continued to roughly grind it into him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTyler?!\u201d David cried groggily as he fought to ground his senses in the waking world. The blue drake looked at the colossal monstrosity his brother had become. His eyes darted between Tyler and the wolf underneath him. A plume of dust in the twilight sky caught his attention, and he followed the trail back to a demolished building, where the enormous figure of Rick lay still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head in disbelief as he scrambled to get to his feet. \u201cTyler, shit. No, no\u2026 No, get off him, what the fuck\u2019s happened?! Tyler, get off Fang!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn\u2019t stop, his grin slowly turned into a sneer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on between you and Fang.\u201d Tyler said, his breath laboured. \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore, either. That\u2019s between you and him. It\u2019s personal. So is this. This is between Fang and me, it\u2019s personal. So in your own words David, just fuck off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was taken aback. This wasn\u2019t how Tyler was supposed to act.  \u201cNo.\u201d he finally said defiantly as he walked up to where his brother lay hunched over on all fours. His eyes looked down earnestly into his brothers. \u201cNo, Tyler come on. Listen to yourself, don\u2019t let this get out of hand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler broke out in a genuine laughter \u201cOut of hand? Are you serious? David, look around you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head. \u201cI know, Tyler, I can see it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, don\u2019t get carried away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler raised an eyebrow. \u201cDavid. Look around you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what it looks like!\u201d David yelled back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler softly shook his head, a smirk creeping up his muzzle. \u201cLook behind you David.\u201d He said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at his brother a moment longer, his mouth open in confusion. Slowly, he turned around to survey what his brother was talking about. It was only then that he saw the flashing lights that seemed to boarder the campus. The buildings partially obstructed the view of the road, even from his 110 foot viewpoint, but the red and blue lights were easily visible as they bounced off the buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can see the lights a lot easier in the dark.\u201d Tyler said with a sense of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have they been there for?\u201d David asked dumbly as he soaked the scene in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I imagine a while. There\u2019d be reporters, and onlookers, and police trying to keep the crowd at bay. It\u2019s a bit of a circus, really. All lining up to look at us. We\u2019re famous, David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned around again, struggling to read his brother as Tyler continued. \u201cBut what I find most interesting of all, is that there are no helicopters. You always see helicopters in movies about giants, so where are they now? You\u2019d think the media would be all over us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Tyler.\u201d David said, his tone equal parts despair and impatience. \u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInvest some energy. Think about it.\u201d Tyler scoffed. \u201cWhere are the helicopters David?  This city may not be a global metropolis, but it isn\u2019t a country town either. Every channel has their own copter, you\u2019d think they\u2019d be vying to try and capture something more stimulating than the traffic, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head, unable to figure out where his brother was leading him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are they?\u201d Tyler demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d David said with resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither do I, but I can take a guess. The only thing that would keep the media out of the air would be a no-fly zone. They can call those when there\u2019s a state of emergency called. By the president.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid blinked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s face broke out in a wide smile. \u201cLook up, David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid complied, dreading what he might find. But to his relief, there was nothing but the brightest stars piercing through the fading blue sky. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d He concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but they can see you. Wave to the satellites and spy planes, David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took genuine delight in his brother\u2019s expression as he looked back down at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it, David? We\u2019re on every channel in Azerbaijan as we speak. There'd be a committee in the white house discussing what to do about us. We\u2019re kind of a big deal here, David. I wouldn\u2019t worry about things getting out of hand. That train has sailed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed, shaking his head in resignation .\u201cMaybe it has, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can just let this go on. I mean, I imagine everyone else must be afraid of us, we have to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re still thinking about this wrong.\u201d Tyler interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s not about of us trying to fit into the world. The wold is going to have to try and fit in with US.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grimaced, shaking his head in despair. \u201cYou sound insane!\u201d He shouted at him, on the verge of panic. \u201cTyler, this isn\u2019t you!\u201d<br>\r\nTyler cocked his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m not Tyler anymore, am I?\u201d he said, his grin growing wider. \u201cI am something more now; something greater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to his brother\u2019s words, David\u2019s heart froze as he noticed something wasn\u2019t quite right physically with Tyler. When he had first walked up to talk to him, David looked down on the purple drake as he hunched over the wolf. But now, as his brother\u2019s eyes glimmered into his, David realised that he was now almost at eye level to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid swallowed as he looked over his brother\u2019s form with a fresh perspective. If the purple drake stood up right then, he would have had to have been close to two hundred feet tall. David took a step backwards as he realised that something was horribly wrong with his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy step back?\u201d Tyler asked with a chuckle.  \u201cAfter all David, you did this to me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler\u2026\u201d David began uneasily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David took another step back from his colossal brother. It was just like before, Tyler lording over Fang in a display of dominance. The purple drake was so powerful, David had no ways to control him. It was just like before, at David's words, Tyler's back began to heave; the larger dragon's amusement becoming more and more audible by the second. That near silent heaving became a deep rumble, which in turn rose to low chuckle. David watched in awe as Tyler brought himself to his full height, a towering 200 foot behemoth scraped the sky above him as the beast began to cackle wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" the beast rumbled, halfway between a coo and a snarl, the voice smooth yet intensely harsh. \"Yesterday...\" The behemoth paused, as if to remember what he was like yesterday. He was nothing; he was puny, he was weak. But not anymore. \"I said we were dragons...\" Tyler loomed over his tiny brother, he stepped forward and shoved his meat over David's head as he continued to survey the world around him; his world around him. \"I was wrong. You are an overgrown lizard...\" Tyler's eyes flitted down, trying to find his brother, but his chest was just too large, David was too close for him to see; but that was all the more arousing. He was the ultimate being now. He flexed an arm, watching the peak crest well beyond what it normally should. \"I am a DRAGON!\" he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth shook as Tyler bellowed his proclamation. David could feel Tyler pulling away. And that's when he saw something Tyler do that he shouldn't have been able to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake could feel a power building up within him, he didn't know what it was, but he welcomed it. He turned back to Fang, the wolf was went wide-eyed as Tyler came crashing back on top of his, this time the dragon's length was longer than Fang was tall. And that only further aroused the creature. Tyler began to pump his rod, spewing inordinate amounts of pre over the remains of what was once the stadium, his throbbing length grinding into the wolf below him. He snorted like a bull and that's when it happened. A plume of smoke was expelled from each nostril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler continued to thrust on top of Fang and stroke his length at the same time, he continued to exhale smoke as he grunted in fits of pleasure. He was all-powerful. He began to laugh as he felt it coming. He knew it was more than just an orgasm building. He was going to ascend into godhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could only watch and Fang could only feel Tyler's monumental orgasm begin. Tyler let loose a thunderous roar, a faint violet glow erupting from his mouth. The blue dragon had lost his footing, stumbling back as he saw what Tyler was becoming. As jet after jet of Tyler's semen was violently expelled from the drake's cock, Tyler's hide was darkening, the rich purple deepening to aubergine and finally so dark it was practically black, the purple only visible in the glint of soft moonlight. David had thought Tyler was done growing at 200 feet, but it seems that that wasn't entirely the case; Tyler didn't grow any taller, but as he moaned in his throes of the perfect orgasm, it became obvious that Tyler's impossible physique was broadening to truly grotesque proportions. The dragon was so wide now his arms would never be able to rest at his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at Fang, the wolf was stuck underneath Tyler's erupting shaft, his eyes shut as he tried to push the insane amount of flesh pinning him to the ground; but Tyler held his length down, his one arm vastly superior to Fang's entire body.. Now was David's chance, Tyler was complete preoccupied with his dick. He rushed forward to Fang's side and laid prone to get to the wolf, Tyler's hulking chest above him. \"Fang?\" David said worriedly, afraid something terrible had happened to the wolf. He slapped at Fang's cheek, the wolf opening his eyes slowly as if in pain. \"Fang, I'm gonna get you out of here-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Tyler wasn't all that lost in orgasm, or his transformation. The hulking drake swiped at his puny brother, sending David airborne. David let out a dry wheeze as the wind was knocked out of him as he landed what felt like to him a good five seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!\" he heard a voice call from the distance. It was Fang's deep voice calling to him from the other end of the ruined playing field. David's eyes began to water, partially reflexively due to the pain and also the worried tone in Fang's voice, but also because of what he had turned his brother into. With half-lidded eyes he struggled to pick himself up, only to fall on his knees. He had to save Fang, he'd crawl if he needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler may have been lucid when he threw his brother away from his prey, but he wasn't anymore. An intense pain was erupting in his face. He could feel his bones restructuring, ivory bone piercing his hide to expose new facial features along his brow, cheek and jaw. The horns atop his head, once merely ornamentation, grew out, jagged and menacing. He cried out in pain, another purple glow erupting from his throat. He clenched his teeth tightly and a burst of violet flame escaped between the gaps in his razor sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked in abject horror at what Tyler was now. As the purple-black dragon continued to cum, his terrifying features were only being accentuated, Tyler's face looking more draconic - in every sense of the word. But the worst was yet to come. A deep rumbling built up within Tyler's chest as his orgasm neared its end. With one cataclysmic finish, Tyler spread his back wide, lifting his arms in the air as he sat up. The beast lifted his head towards the heavens as if to challenge it's right to divinity and let loose a roar. But what came out wasn't just a destructive shockwave of pressurized air, a brilliant torrent of intense violet flame burst forth, the flames licking at the air as the cone spread upwards. With a terrifying snap, Tyler's back began to contort, the muscular valleys and hills rippling as two nubs, one on each side of his back began to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler!\" David called to his brother. But whatever his brother was now wasn't listening. The nubs on the creature's back grew, the sickening crunching of bones forming and reshaping echoed through the air once Tyler's roar came to an end. With one final volley, the last of Tyler's essence was birthed into the world, and quite possibly the last vestige of Tyler's humanity. The folds on his back suddenly burst open, revealing a pair of powerful leathery bat-like wings that canvased David's entire view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rumbled with delight, completely forget the writhing wolf underneath his manhood - no, his godhood. Fang was nothing now, but the wolf would still suffer. He would make sure of it. But first, he wanted to see where his 'little' brother had gone off to. He experimentally played with his new appendages, learning to fold them and open them, giving a few absentminded flaps, kicking up storms of debris in the process. He folded both of them to his back and stood. He turned around and almost missed his brother crawling on the ground like a worm towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see what I have become, David?\" It wasn't really a question, more of a statement. \"I am a dragon now, David. No... I am a GOD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler,\" David called weakly up to his brother. \"Tyler, please stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grinning deity stopped smiling, his features dropped to dead serious. \"No.\" Tyler bent down and lifted his brother upwards. David was just as big as that fucking bear was, and was just as light, just as puny and pathetic, but not at all worthless. David had so much more to give Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put him down, Ty,\" a voice called from behind. Fang was getting up, clutching an injured arm. \"Let David go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed. How the mighty have fallen, he mused to himself. He chuckled, \"You sound defeated, Fang. You used him, you wanted to me grow, just to save David's hide so you could have more for yourself later. I get that now. And who wouldn't want this POWER?\" Tyler's voice was growing in louder and he flexed his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want the power anymore,\" the wolf pleaded, sounding genuine; he knew Tyler was way too powerful. Normally, he'd go at it anyways, fearless to the bone. But he loved David, he could risk his own life all he wanted, but he'd never risk David's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot lie to a god, Fang,\" Tyler said icily, looking down his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a fucking god! And I'm not a fucking liar!\" Fang shouted back. His fists were balled as he resisted the urge to just pounce on Tyler right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what am I, Fang?\" Tyler toyed with the words, playing along with Fang's tirade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a sponge, you fucking useless prick,\" the wolf seethed. \"Put him down, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler clicked his tongue in annoyance. \"Such angry words, Fang. Now why should I put my brother down? So you can grow? You don't deserve it, you're not one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love him,\" Fang confessed, falling to his knees, for the first time begging for anything. \"Let him go. Don't hurt him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler wanted to laugh, but kept his smooth, smug demeanour; he was in perfect control. \"Love? You are incapable of such a thing. Raping my brother doesn't mean you love him, Fang.\" Tyler watched as the defeated wolf began to weep. It was just too perfect. The large dragon looked at his brother in his grasp. David was looking away, as if he was ashamed to be related to him. No matter, Tyler rumbled and looked down at the wolf again. \"You know what I'd love to see?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHe\u2019ll never be like you!\u201d Fang roared as he practically flung himself back onto his feet. Shaking with rage and fear, he pointed an accusatory finger at the dragon, tears streaming freely down his face. \u201cYou\u2019re weak, like I was. David is strong; he\u2019ll never give in to the power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lifter his head defiantly, looking down on the wolf at a sharper angle than before. \u201cYou\u2019re still weak, Fang.\u201d He said with a smirk. Slowly, his enormous wings shook and began to stretch outwards, the action effortlessly intimidating. \u201cYou will always be weak.\u201d The dragon continued, his breath shimmering in the night sky. He ominously filled his lungs and took half a step backwards. \u201cYour era of dominance is OVER!\u201d Tyler roared, letting lose a column of violet flames in the wolf\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fire left the dragon's maw, his wings clapped together in front of him, the force so great it forced Tyler\u2019s colossal form onto his back foot. Fang could only watch the pillar of fire appear to explode in front of him as the pressurised air hit it. For a brief moment, the campus looked like it was bathed in sunlight as the white hot fireball sped towards him. Fang had no time to react, aside from closing his eyes and lifting an elbow to shield his face as the wall of fire and air stormed into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was swept off his feet, the wall of air hitting him harder than anything he had felt before. His ears felt as if they were ripped open as the air pressure suddenly exploded, the deafening crack of the wing's sonic boom was barely audible as the world turned into a dull roar. And then there was the heat. Fang knew that he was on fire, that his fur was burning as he flew through the air. His skin boiled underneath, the immense pain striking him seemingly everywhere at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang yelped out in a loud, high voice as he slammed into the ground a hundred yards from where he had stood. The atmosphere was in turmoil, the campus buildings exploded under the brunt of the shockwave. Fire licked into the sky, spiralling in several whirlwinds as the atmosphere tore itself apart in the turbulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler laughed loudly at the sight of the burning wolf as he flailed on the ground wildly. And it wasn\u2019t just Fang that was burning. The whole college was lighting up in a yellow glow as the fields and buildings caught on fire. The dragon sucked in a powerful breath as his eyes traced the burning embers rose and fell across the campus, glowing as they floated through the night like fireflys. There was so much destruction, and it had been wrought all so easily. He was simply unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon turned his attention back to David. The drake was writhing in his hands \u201cFang!\u201d he gasped as he fought against the drake's grip. \u201cYou fucking bastard! Let me go, you asshole!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, the dragon complied, releasing his grasp on the blue drake and sending into a hundred foot free-fall. David hit the earth with a thud, sprawling onto his back. He looked up as the dragon bent down, reaching out at him. David snarled at the black claw in front of him, and with a wild snarl, lashed out at it with his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake tried to throttle the hand, he tried to pierce the scales to cause enough pain to make the dragon recoil, but it was futile. The dragon\u2019s scales were like metal underneath his teeth, and David soon cried out in pain as he felt one of his teeth break in half at the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you finished yet, David?\u201d Tyler chuckled, completely unfazed by David\u2019s attempts to harm him. He rested the claw on top of the drake\u2019s torso, the scales on his wrist were not so much as scratched. \u201cDo you see how pathetic you are? How weak your mortal flesh is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue drake snarled out in frustration as his broken tooth throbbed and bled. He knew that Fang was badly hurt, but he couldn't help him. Tyler\u2019s hand was simply unmoveable, and his scales were impenetrable. There was absolutely nothing that David could do to free himself. Tyler\u2019s smug grin faded from his face as his tone turned serious. \u201cI was pathetic once too, David. But then I awakened. Now I am a god, and you can be one too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head in despair. Fang had claimed he was a god, Rick had claimed he was a god\u2026 but with Tyler, the claim was frighteningly tempting to believe. As David looked into the dragon\u2019s eyes, he realised that they almost seemed to be glowing in the darkness. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like you!\u201d He cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t either, at first. I was afraid.\u201d The dragon said solemnly, his voice soothing as if he was empathetic. \u201cI feared that I couldn\u2019t control the power that awoke with in me. But then I saw that you don't control it. It is greater than our mortal selves. It is to be embraced; to be bowed down before. And it will reward you. There is nothing to fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt a tear fall down his cheek. He didn\u2019t know if that meant that Tyler was gone forever, or that somewhere beneath the dragon, a piece of Tyler remained. \u201cTyler\u2026\u201d he whined. \u201cPlease, Tyler wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s face didn\u2019t change. \u201cThis is my planet now, David. But I meant it when I said that the wold would have to fit in with us. I want to share it with you, brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes and shook his head. The dragon continued. \u201cThey will try and fight us. They will throw all manner of wicked weapons at us. But together, we can make each other stronger. By the morning light, the world will be subservient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane!\u201d David shouted up at the dragon. \u201cTyler, please wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon shook his head incredulously. \u201cHow can I make you see, David? This is divinity I am offering, don\u2019t I cast it down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like you! You\u2019re a monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou fear what you need not fear!\u201d  Tyler snarled down at David, plumes of smoke fuming from his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, get off him.\u201d Fang\u2019s voice growled in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon raised his head to look at the wolf. Fang\u2019s golden eyes stared defiantly into his own. But his stare was a lonely island strength. The wolf was shaking violently, barely standing upright, his stance wide and stiff. Only charred remnants of his once healthy black pelt remained, sporadic clumps of short, singed hairs dotted his form. His exposed skin ranged from an angry pink to dark, bleeding scabs. He was scarred with messy pattern of embossed skin, the severe burns in many places running deep into the flesh beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler raised an eyebrow. He had to admit to himself, the wolf was putting on a gutsy display. Fang knew that he was powerless to stop Tyler, but he still dragged his painful carcass over to try and do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang, do you really love David?\u201d The dragon asked stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang heaved at the question, his body trembling harder as he breathed. \u201cYes.\u201d He finally growled with a broken voice, the act of speaking clearly painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon eyed Fang as he slowly hooked one of his wings around the wolf. \u201cDavid. Do you love Fang?\u201d he asked without looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sobbed under the Tyler\u2019s claw. \u201cYes!\u201d he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon cocked his enormous head. \u201cThen this is how I can make you see.\u201d He said calmy. In one action he lifted his claw off David and shifted his weight as he brought his wing in from behind Fang. The wolf cried out in surprise and pain as the wing shoved him roughly towards the dragon. With a loud slam, Fang suddenly found himself lying on his back, the dragon\u2019s enormous hand pinning him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf whined out in agony as the dragon roughly dug his claws into the wolf\u2019s meaty chest, five enormous daggers piercing his flesh. Instinctively, the wolf thrashed his arms out to fight the dragon's hand, but the movement only served to twist the claws in his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTYLER!\u201d David roared in panic as he lunged towards the injured wolf. With a contemptuous sneer, the dragon batted him away effortlessly with his wing. As David hit the ground he looked up, tears flowing freely down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon eyed him coldly. \u201cDrink your own seed; become reborn like me, and the wolf shall live. Refuse, and I will remove him from the world; cutting one of the strings that binds you to this pathetic mortal existence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid crawled to his knees. \u201cYou\u2019re blackmailing me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon eyed David sternly, raising his snout into the air. \u201cYou will come to understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give in David!\u201d Fang cried out from under Tyler, his face closed tightly as he seethed in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pleaded on his knees. \u201cTyler\u2026 no, please, I know you\u2019re in there. Fight the power!\u201d he cried out in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s face was stoic, seemingly deriving no pleasure from David\u2019s grovelling. \u201cI am the power, David.\u201d He said solemnly. \u201cThere is nothing left to fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head. The dragon had sounded almost remorseful. \u201cNo... no, that\u2019s not true. I can tell you\u2019re in there Tyler. I know you are!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon scowled, clearly intolerant of this tangent. \u201cMake your choice.\u201d He growled impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt paralysed. He knew that the dragon was serious, that he had no inhibitions with killing Fang. And David was physically powerless to stop him. The only way to save the wolf he loved was to capitulate to the dragon\u2019s demands. But as much as he loved Fang, he couldn\u2019t bear to simply write Tyler off. He didn\u2019t know why, but be believed that his brother was still alive, but fading. David could either try and save Fang, or try and save his brother. He didn\u2019t know if he would be able to save both.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler dug his talons further into the wolf below him, eliciting a pained yowl from Fang. \"Well? Do we have an accord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't even know what an accord was, but shook his head anyways. \"No, Tyler. I won't give up on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should be worrying about me, David,\" the commanding drake glowered. Tyler let out a deep grunt, a small burst of angry flames seethed through his closed mouth, telegraphing the monstrosity's irritation. He looked down at the charred wolf beneath him. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him, you do realize that? Do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 No you won\u2019t, Tyler,\u201d David said calmly. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there, I know you\u2019d never hurt me. If you kill him, I will never forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen hate me David,\u201d the behemoth chuckled. He began to squeeze harder, Fang writhed, but made no sounds; his body too wracked with pain. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to grow to stop me.\u201d Tyler\u2019s chuckle grew to sinister laugh. \u201cAnd then, you\u2019ll understand. He\u2019ll be beneath you and you\u2019ll forget all about the pathetic mortal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis sneered up at his brother. Fang was so close to dying, but he had to continue. He loved Fang, but if he went along with Tyler\u2019s plan, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d become, he didn\u2019t even know if he\u2019d still love the wolf. But now, it was painfully clear, he was going to lose Fang either way. But, he just had to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you still love Jessica, Tyler?\u201d he asked weakly. Tyler\u2019s cocksure smirk was marred with a slight sneer, if only for a moment, at the name. It was slight, but it was just enough for David to notice. \u201cWell?\u201d he asked more pressingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful drake let out another annoyed grunt, the flames spilling out from his lips. His answer was resolute. \u201cNo.\u201d Tyler\u2019s voice was unwavering, as if he believed it fully. But David knew better, he could see the sorrowful look in his giant brother\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou love her, don\u2019t you?\u201d David rephrased his question, more certain this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d Tyler responded, the tone obviously mournful now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it does, Ty. It means you\u2019re still in there,\u201d David said flatly, not looking at his brother. He was staring at Fang now, the wolf\u2019s pained breathing laboured. Tyler still loved Jessica; that meant he\u2019d still love Fang if he gave in to Tyler\u2019s demands. \u201cJust stop with this ruling the world thing. Do it for Jess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d the behemoth replied, his tone icy. \u201cThis world is mine, David. Mortals tried to use me. Fang used me as leverage against you and he used me to kill the bear. Jessica\u2026 she didn\u2019t love me. She used me; I was her guard dog!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, you\u2019re wrong, Jess-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll never love me!\u201d Tyler spat. He growled before he continued. \u201cMy love makes me weak. I realize that now.\u201d The dragon paused. \u201cTo truly be this world\u2019s god, I must sever the last of my bonds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Tyler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark dragon let go of Fang and David as he stood at his full magnificence. He spread his wings, displaying all the power he had at his command. He surveyed the land around him; he knew he couldn't find Jess. But he could guess; the crowd had only seemed to grow, it was likely she was there too. He was going to kill her and put an end to the feelings that still clung to his heart. David would try to stop him, and that meant only one thing - David's ascension. Yes, David will soon understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid saw Tyler eyeing the crowd at the edge of campus; he knew what Tyler meant now. \"Tyler don't! Those are innocent people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Innocent?\" Tyler rumbled, looking down at his brother with contempt. \"No mortal is innocent, David.\" The giant drake began to take a step forward, towards the crowd. \"Excuse me, brother. I have a world to rule.\" Tyler was about to move forward again when he paused. His final words to his brother were, \"Enjoy your time with Fang. But, you will join me, I know you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was going to kill everyone there. David had to do something. But he couldn't kill his brother. Deep down, inside that monster was Tyler. But he couldn't save him; Tyler was too far gone, beyond redemption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears streamed down his face. He knew Tyler had to be stopped. And that's what made his decision that much more painful. He crawled over to Fang. The wolf was bloodied and barely breathing, his skin charred and oozing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" Fang said weakly, straining to just call out the drake's name. He would've said more, but David hushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, Fang,\" David cooed. \"Fang, know I'll always love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's eyes went wide. \"Davey, don't. Don't give in,\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, Fang.\" David began to heave on top of the wolf. With resignation, he began to pump his shaft; forcing himself to have an erection. He panted hard, looking up to see what Tyler was doing; a wake of destruction lay in Tyler's footsteps. This only fuelled David's urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't give in, Fang,\" David started. The last thing he said to his love was, \"That's why I need you to do something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was wrong. Jessica did love him. When Tyler's voice rang throughout the world, \"She'll never love me!\" Jess turned to weep into Alli's torso. This was all her fault, she should have never brought that cum to him; she'd take Tyler in a wheelchair over this. But, Tyler's words rang true; she had been using him - using him to feel safe when what Fang did to her left her feeling so vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do, Alli?\" she cried. Tyler's threats didn't sound empty. Already onlookers were beginning to back away, the policeman forming a line looked worried too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinosaur looked at the grey wolf standing beside her, exchanging solemn glances with Ryan. Neither knew how to comfort the sobbing fox. \"I don't know, hon,\" was all Allison could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a sonorous boom echoed throughout the campus. Everyone in the crowd looked up to see Tyler begin to advance in their direction. Jessica was nearly swept off her feet by the blast alone and when she finally recovered she heard a pained whining coming from beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison was on the ground, a thick piece of glass wedged into her thigh. The debris must have been swept up in Tyler's last roar and the dinosaur was just collateral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan got up from the ground as well and rushed to Allison's side, a worried expression painted on his face. \"I don't think it's too bad. Just let me...\" He placed his paws on the shard of glass, the dinosaur roared in pain as he ripped it out. Blood started gushing out of the wound. \"Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I'm sorry, Alli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay,\" the t-rex replied in pain. Her pain turned to terror. \"We have to move. Now.\" She pointed at the approaching dragon. With that, the three of them began to scramble, Jessica and Ryan helping Allison to hobble away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to the truck,\" Jess said. The other two nodded. All around them, people were screaming and running as well, even the police line had broken, some fleeing, some helping others escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother roar boomed from Tyler's mouth, this time fire spewing into the swathes of people. Jessica could feel the heat as the cone missed them. A nearby car exploded, sending shrapnel everywhere - including in Jess' direction. She could see a piece of metal flying towards her, as if in slow motion. She was angry, she hadn't made her peace yet. She didn't want to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she didn't. A force pushed her forward sharply, knocking her to the ground. When she looked back, a dead man with a piece of metal jutting out of his neck greeted her. It was a cop, but not just any; she recognized Officer Fletcher, having busted a couple of the parties she's been to and also because she knew Marcus. She looked up at Alli and Ryan, both of them as stunned as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let it be in vain,\" Ryan said flatly. Holding out his paw to pick her up. They looked up to see Tyler looking around at the destruction he had caused. \"We have to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hustled to Tyler's truck, Jess hopped into the driver's seat while Ryan and Alli took the back. She fumbled with the keys before finally igniting the engine. Speeding off into the distance, she looked back through the rear view mirror, watching Tyler destroy everything he loved. She also saw Ryan tending to Alli's wound, using her shirt to stymie the blood. She grimaced, she should be back there, trying to break through to Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't watching the road. As she sped through an intersection a car nearly clipped her. Swerving to the side, she lost control, the truck slamming into a nearby ditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! Shit!\" Jessica screamed, slamming her fists into the wheel as she began to weep. Everything was going wrong. Alli was in trouble, Tyler was on a rampage and she was helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan,\" she said sternly. She pulled out a giant water bottle from her purse - one she stole from Allison's knapsack. In it was a pearly white substance. She had snuck her way back onto the field with it earlier. She had light injuries from her encounter with Rick, but to her chagrin, the only thing the stuff did to her was give her a nasty taste in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you like Alli, Ryan. You need to carry her to safety,\" she said stoically. She added sombrely, \"Get her to the hospital. If you see Marcus in there, if there's any left... Give him some, we- I owe his dad at least that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" said Alli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to end this.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night was alive. Flames roared the suburbs blazed, fueled by a wild, restless gale that seemingly changed direction on a whim.  Residents and onlookers were driven running and screaming onto the streets. Vehicles sped and screeched as they fled the area, as the distant whaling of a hundred sirens echoed into the night. But the choir of chaos was merely an ambiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the sounds of the dragon that dominated the night. His grating, guttural breaths rattled through the suburbs, the bassy tremors caused by his footfalls shaking the earth and everything on it. The occasional clapping of the dragon\u2019s wings caused a sonic boom that crackled like thunder, followed by ghostly moans of torn air in the distance. That was to say nothing of the sudden roaring explosions as the dragon breathed his infernos; or the deafening blasts of his furious roars; or the hollow crunching echos as he demolished buildings with the swing of his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was terrifying enough to hear, but as Jessica rounded the corner, her tired body already fatigued by the run, it was nothing compared to the sight of it. The dragon was hunched over with his head low to the ground, walking the earth on all fours is he angrily searched through the fleeing survivors. The hulking monstrosity didn't look awkward; Tyler\u2019s transformed body so anomalous that it seemed equally adept on four feet as two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s breath shimmered in the night; faint plumes of violet light flickered from his mouth and nostrils. With a deafening roar, Tyler breathed fire down on a fleeing car, the column of flame lifting the back wheels off the ground before it exploded. Jess shielded her eyes from the light, and by the time she could see through the fading aftereffects, the car was a black burning shell, like so many around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stumbled in front of a parked panel van and fell to her knees. She sobbed loudly as she leant against the grill. She was terrified. She had always thought of herself as strong, able to face whatever was in front of her. But that image of herself had been shattered. Her stomach churned, screaming for her to flee. But she knew that all the carnage that was happening was, at least in part, her fault. She had a responsibility on she could bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man ran past her. He paused as he saw her. With panicked eyes, he yelled something at her, before turning and running away. The man\u2019s screams sounded like muffled noise in her ringing ears. Jess breathed heavily as she tried to force herself to calm down, but the streams of tears were impossible to control. Shaking, she slowly picked herself up. In that moment, she felt herself leave her body. It was like she was watching her movements from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped back out onto the street and started walking towards the dragon. She knew that her weak voice wouldn\u2019t travel ten yards in this chaos, so in order to get Tyler\u2019s attention, she started waving her arms above her head. Although she was small, she stood out. She was the only figure walking towards the dragon, in the middle of an open road. It didn\u2019t take long for Tyler to lock eyes on her. Jess\u2019s heart froze under the gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deepest pits of hell could not have been half as horrifying being under the dragon\u2019s attention. The burning city cast a dull orange glow on the dragon\u2019s epic form, his black scales showing a brilliant purple iridescence. The flickering light illuminated the dragon\u2019s underside, making him appear more sinister than should be naturally possible. With a smug grin, the dragon lowered his head and began to advance towards the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands sank through the road as they fell, sending a vast network of cracks in the bitumen as it elevated around the imprint. The earth shook under Jess\u2019s feet with every step, the initial shock jolting her briefly airborne, before the residual aftershocks gently bounced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of her eyes, Jess could see the dragons enormous wings slowly hook around her, the imposing monster enveloping her with his presence. \u201cJessica.\u201d He rumbled as he came to a stop. \u201cI was afraid I had lost you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, please stop!\u201d Jessica pleaded up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, the dragon shook his head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t obey you. The days of your influence is over. You used me, Jessica. You\u2019re the last thread I have to cut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess cowered under the dragon\u2019s voice; it was so loud it hurt her hears. \u201cIt\u2019s not True Tyler! That I could never love you, it\u2019s not true. I do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon blinked slowly. \u201cLove?\u201d he chuckled as he took another step towards her. \u201cYou have no idea what that word means. You were with me for a day. Before then, I was nothing to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica pursed her lips as she shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you know of me, Jessica?\u201d he dragon said with a sneer. \u201cHow can you love that which you know nothing of? I was an ornament to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shook her head. On one level it was true; it was like the two of them were from completely different cultures. But she knew more about Tyler than he could have known. \u201cI know you hate the fourth rule set.\u201d Jessica called up to him. \u201cYou think it\u2019s a formulaic, methodical system without room for any creativity or imagination. But none of your friends are interested in going back to three point five. You think that it\u2019s only saving grace is that there\u2019s more merchandise to for you to sell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon lifted his eyebrows, scoffing as he gave an impressed smirked. But as his mind processed it further, his expression melted into confusion. \u201cHow did you\u2026 I never\u2026\u201d The dragon\u2019s brows suddenly furrowed. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can even know what half of that means.\u201d He growled at her skeptically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know everything.\u201d Jess admitted. \u201cBut I get the gist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know all that?!\u201d The dragon demanded angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllison told me.\u201d Jess said, flinching at the dragon\u2019s aggression. \u201cShe always talks to me about nerdy stuff. I never listen, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about, and I don\u2019t care.\u201d The fox paused as she licked her lips. \u201cBut I do when she\u2019s talking about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon sneered as he took another step towards her, his hand landing just ten yards away from her. \u201cWhy?\u201d he demanded, his breath bearing down on the fox like a furnace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Jess trailed off as she struggled to articulate an honest explanation. \u201cBecause Tyler, I\u2019m immature, alright? I care about status, and that means I date the most narcissistic, vacuous assholes on the planet. I\u2019m shallow, and bitchy.\u201d Jess shook as she looked into Tyler\u2019s eyes. She didn\u2019t know what future she had at this point, but if she died, then let this be her final confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy.\u201d She said, her tears flowing freely again. \u201cI often step back and look at myself. I don\u2019t always want to be like this, but it\u2019s all I know. You\u2019re a nice guy, Tyler. Nothing like what I had come to know from the others. I could have never have been seen dead with you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s snout twitched, but otherwise he stood deathly still. Jess ran a hand through her hair and down her neck. \u201cAlright, maybe love is too strong a term for that, but I did have a crush on you. And then when you and David came in last night and saved me\u2026\u201d Jess cut herself short as her voice broke. After a few steady breaths, she managed to keep her composure. \u201cTyler, today when you came back, and we went shopping\u2026 I\u2019ve been with a ton of guys, but you were different. For the first time in my life, I was happy. Even after last night, you made me happy, Tyler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s upper lip rose as he cocked his head. Jess swallowed as she continued. \u201cIf I don\u2019t love you, then I don\u2019t know what love is. Maybe I don\u2019t. But even if this isn\u2019t love, it\u2019s all I need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tyler snarled contemptuously. \u201cYou used me for protection. I was a bag of meat to you, like all the others! You never even looked at me until I was like them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess trembled under the volume of the dragon\u2019s words, her hears pressed down and back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, if that\u2019s how you felt. I\u2019m so sorry, Tyler.\u201d She cried. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry if I didn\u2019t show you affection today, I was shaken up by what happened last night. So if I was distant, or cold, then I\u2019m sorry. I was being selfish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSelfish?!\u201d The dragon\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cYou wern\u2019t being sel\u2026\u201d Tyler cut himself off, his eyes widening in surprise. He had caught himself about to comfort her! His face immediately darkened as he barred his teeth at the fox. He was right, she was making him weak. He needed to cut this tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not Tyler anymore Jessica.\u201d He said with dark conviction. \u201cIf you loved me, then you loved me for what I was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox shook her head firmly. \u201cNo, David is right. You\u2019re still there Tyler. I know you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon chuckled. \u201cAnd how would you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica\u2019s shoulders drooped. \u201cBecause if you weren\u2019t, you would have killed me by now.\u201d She silently hoped that her word\u2019s weren\u2019t going to be accepted as a challenge. \u201cAll of your excuses\u2026 They\u2019re for you, not me. You\u2019re trying to convince yourself that there is no love. That Tyler is gone. If any of it was true, you wouldn\u2019t bother talking about it. I\u2019d be dead, because I\u2019d be nothing to you. But here we are. I know you\u2019re in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sneered down on the fox, his eyes wide and confused. With a sudden rush of fury, he lifted his head and roared into the night. He looked back down on her and opened his mouth to speak, when\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Through the crackling fires that spread throughout the suburban streets, a low sorrowful song was picked up on the winds. The menacing black dragon turned his head at the sound, grunting with flames as he pinpointed the source to be the campus grounds. He growled low before looking down at the small fox. \"Stay here,\" he glowered, baring more fangs than need be. \"I am not done with you yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica picked herself up, her own ears twitching at the new sound that rang through the twilight. In the back of her mind, she knew it was Fang. \"No,\" she said stoically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not defy me!\" the dragon snarled, raising his voice as dry heat blasted out of his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming with you, Tyler,\" she demanded boldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what can a pathetic little girl like you do?\" he hissed at her, bringing his head low, staring at her with feral eyes, trying to intimidate her. However, the little fox stood her ground, her pink hair billowing in the draft of Tyler's hot breath. Upon seeing her resolute courage, the dragon's scowl softened, his eyes half-lidded. In a tender rumble he used his snout to nudge her as gently as possible, closing his eyes as he tried to feel her presence. \"You'll get hurt, Jess,\" he said at his softest, his voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were in there,\" she said, smiling as he opened his eyes. Instead of a little hug on the snout, she curled her fist into a ball and punched him as hard as she could, barely tickling him. \"That's for making me worry about you, big guy,\" she said, a slight smirk on her face, her tears still streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a weak smile. He raised himself onto his haunches and stood. He began to heave a bit, his own tears beginning to stream down his face. \"I killed people, Jess. I'm a monster. Did you... did you see me kill someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded her head slowly. \"You killed... a lot of people. You- you killed Marcus' dad, Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shut his eyes and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler...\" Jessica said. But the black dragon wasn't listening. \"Tyler! You did terrible things, but it doesn't mean you can't change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smirked sorrowfully. Where had he heard that before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood at his full height and beamed down at the small fox beneath him. \"Stay here,\" he said gently. \"It'll be easier to find you again.\" The fox was so small, but he knew she was nodding. \"I'm going to make things right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was lost in his hallucination. Right off the bat, he knew this one was different. Instead of the swirling colour, the landscape shifted into a hellish nightmare. Pyres of fire spilled all around him, a wreath of flame cloaking him in hellfire. The flames bit as his flesh, growing his skin back, the fur painfully being grafted on piecewise. He wanted to cry out, but there was no one to hear him; he reached out to grab at some purchase, but there was nothing to hold. All there was was this hell, this Abaddon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf could feel a pain in his chest, the fire seeping through his pores, burning within him. He could feel something burning away inside him, like the fire was destroying a part of him. Is this what Tyler felt? It was... cleansing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw magnificence itself. Standing before him was a god. The deep blue behemoth smirked as he watched his latest subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" Fang called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greggory,\" the deity replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Fang,\" the wolf said with a chuckle, trying to keep a pretense of friendliness as he held back the pain welling within and fear of what he beheld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greggory,\" the blue monstrosity repeated. The god cocked his head, blinking slowly. \"Is this not what you want? To be a god?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Fang spat back as he felt a sharp pain explode within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...\" the big blue drake said as it lowered its head, smiling wickedly. \"What is it you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched as Fang grew steadily on top of him. The gigantic wolf was easily Tyler's size already. The weight was so heavy, the slumbering wolf nearly crushing the drake by just lying there. He tried to hold Fang as he grew, but soon the wolf's torso was just too big. He could feel Fang's strong heartbeat against him. For all its worth, despite the hell that they lay in, feeling Fang completely engulf him like this; it felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf suddenly jerked on top of him. He was waking. But something wasn't right. The wolf was panting heavily, as if recovering from a panic attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang?\" David said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive black paw reached out for his. The wolf squeezed, too hard in fact, nearly breaking the bones in David's hand. \"Fang, please, tell me you're there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here...\" a deep low voice came as a reply from the wolf. \"David, I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Fang whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant wolf sat up, removing his weight from the blue dragon below him. With a sense of obligation, the wolf began to wrap his hands around his growing shaft. As David watched, there seemed to be no joy in Fang's actions. The pleasure was mechanical, basal; there was no pretense of love in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, what are you doing?\" the drake stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Fang whispered. With that, the wolf slammed his hand into David's skull, rendering the drake unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang stared at the moon, an atavistic desire built within him as he began to howl; a soulful serenade pervading the night sky, and began to beat himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Tyler reached the two, it was too late. Fang was already changing and David was knocked out cold. He could see the wolf had just started to cum, the grotesquely large shaft bulging as a new wave of seed pushed its way violently into the world, the pearly ropes spraying an arcane pattern along the ground. He watched as Fang's 250 foot frame widened impossibly to pack more slabs of meat than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler watched and waited. \"Fang,\" he said cautiously yet sternly, as if he was in command of a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned his head, the striking lack of pupils was a frightening sight, the eyes seeming to glow a golden yellow; only wincing as each new blast of cum spilled forth. \"It's Greggory now, Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, don't listen to what it told you,\" Tyler grunted, his rising anger causing him to snort smoke. \"It won't change what you are. You're still you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changing, Tyler,\" the wolf said solemnly and shook his head. \"I don't have to be Fang anymore. I don't want to be Fang anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It changed me too,\" the black drake glowered. \"You can fight it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was crying, openly weeping. \"That's where you're wrong, Tyler.\" Fang looked up at the drake as he continued to shoot his load out; his transformation began to take full effect as the wolf's hide began to shift, silvery etchings being carved into the wolf's skin. The wolf's face contorted, becoming more monstrous by the second; howls of agony escaping the wolf's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fang continued to become a monster - as a new god was born - he whispered to the drake standing above him, \"Tyler...\"</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s still there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf heaved as he winced, two horns sprouted from the back of his brow ridge. His matte black coat seemed to vanish into the night, the fur growing darker and flatter. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d He said between pained breaths. \u201cI asked for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stared at the wolf a moment before shaking his head in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked up at the dragon as the fur on his muzzle ridge began to shed, exposing a narrow strip of silver scales. The tears had stopped flowing down his golden eyes. \u201cI asked him to purge my love.\u201d Fang said solemly. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe David-God thing in hell?\u201d Tyler asked as he suddenly realised what Fang was talking about. \u201cYou asked him to\u2026 make you not love David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d Tyler roared in despair as he shoved the wolf, his efforts amounting to nothing more than a nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t stop him, Tyler.\u201d Fang growled, his voice laden with bitterness. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop him from changing me. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand up to the power, that I would end up like you. But if I am to become a god, and desire only power, then I didn\u2019t want to\u2026 feel. And now I don\u2019t. I\u2019m completely empty. This brings me peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s mouth worked wordlessly as his fury built. \u201cYou fucking\u2026 selfish!\u201d he spat, unable to articulate coherent thoughts. \u201cI was right; you never loved David, did you? You only love yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shook his head, his expression stoic. \u201cI did love him, Tyler. That was the problem. I didn\u2019t choose this. But at least I don\u2019t have to live with the burden. The burden of what I have done; and what I am yet to do. Do you know what it\u2019s like to live with regrets, Tyler? To be consumed by them?\u201d he asked, the wolf\u2019s scowl deepening as his anger rose with each word. \u201cFang did. And I don\u2019t want to be Fang anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the wolf stood up. Tyler stood still as he watched the wolf elevate in front of him, by the time he had stopped, the top of the dragon's head only reached the bottom of the wolf\u2019s bludging pictorials. Fang stared down at Tyler, his glowing golden eyes two islands in a sea of black, indistinguishable from the night sky around it. \u201cAnd now, I am not Fang.\u201d He proclaimed. \u201cI am Greg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler sneered up at the wolf as he pulled his shoulders backwards. Tyler may not have been consumed by the power, but it still coursed through him. It was at his command. In spite of the wolf towering above him, a quarter again his height and twice his mass, he felt powerful. His breath shimmered as he let the rage build in his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looked down his silver muzzle at David as he lay unconscious at his feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to see what I became.\u201d He said quietly, as if to himself. Tyler shifted uneasily as he studied the wolf. \u201cIt all seems so quaint now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was prepared as Greg suddenly snarled, lifting a foot into the above David. Tyler\u2019s body slotted in to shield his brother by the time the wolf\u2019s foot was brought slamming down, the dragon catching it in his hands. Greg\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as he jolted with the sudden loss of momentum. With a mighty heave, Tyler threw the wolf\u2019s foot back up. The movement capitalised the wolf\u2019s lapse in balance, sending him stumbling backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fool, Fang!\u201d Tyler roared, his voice raw and unrecognisably stentorian. \u201cI was gone, you stupid fucking wolf! I was gone; the power took me over. But love brought me back! It was the only thing that could bring me back!\u201d He shook his head as he let out a guttural sigh, his mouth glowing violet. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to save you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf raised his head, his monotone eyes seeming to glow brighter. \u201cOh, Tyler.\u201d He said as a smirk slowly grew across his face. The wolf\u2019s familiar mannerism had returned, albeit on a completely unrecognisable face.  \u201cThat\u2019s your problem, not mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply stared at the Greg as he stood between his brother and the wolf. The two enormous figures were in complete contrast; Greg stood still and silent, his demeanour the perfect portrait of calm confidence. Tyler, however, stood hunched forwards, his feet wide and slack, ready to strike. His muscles tensed across his titanic frame as he snorted like a bull, clouds of smoke rising in front of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no interest in sharing this world with you.\u201d Greg announced formally. \u201cAppreciate that I am the greater deity. Bow before me, lest we engage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler unfurled his wings, the thick leathery membranes engulfing the area above and beside his form. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking pawn, do you know that?!\u201d He spat at Greg. \u201cThe David-god thing, he\u2019s just using you. He made you like this to be his avatar after I rejected him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d The wolf said solemnly. \u201cBut it is my destiny. Do you challenge my destiny, Tyler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d The dragon roared. \u201cYour destiny is with my brother, Fang. I won\u2019t stand in the way of that.\u201d With a laboured sigh, the dragon shook his head. \u201cBut this deluded megalomania? You\u2019d better fucking believe I challenge it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf lowered his head, his teeth barred in a vicious smile. \u201cThen let one true god reign.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf burst to life with an unnatural speed for his size, and while Tyler was fully expecting the fight, he was still unable to fend the wolf away from him. With a single lunge, Greg barrelled into Tyler, sending the dragon falling backwards. For a brief moment, the dragon was terrified that they would crash onto his unconscious brother, but the wolf hit Tyler with such force they easily cleared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg lashed out at the dragon\u2019s neck as they flew through the air, his teeth sinking into his jugular. While the wolf\u2019s jaw compressed the dragon\u2019s windpipe, his teeth simply ground against the dragon\u2019s steely scales, unable to penetrate them. Tyler positioned his feet above the wolf\u2019s abdomen, and as they hit the ground, he kicked up. With a great effort, he hurled the wolf\u2019s superior mass over his head, and for a brief moment the wolf was airborne, flying backwards and upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the titanic wolf twisted gracefully as he completed his arc, and landed on his feet. Tyler didn\u2019t even have time to pick himself up before the wolf launched into him again, pinning him flat on his back. Tyler fought, but the wolf easily overpowered him. Greg pinned one of Tyler\u2019s hands down with one of his own, and the wolf\u2019s other hand grabbed his jaw, angling Tyler's face away from him while his elbow pinned the dragon\u2019s other arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fool for saving your brother from me!\u201d He roared down onto the dragon. \u201cHe is a father of gods! While he lives, any mortal may rise to challenge us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s my BROTHER!\u201d Tyler roared as he fought against the wolf\u2019s hand, trying desperately to angle his head at Greg\u2019s body to set him on fire. But the wolf was steadfast as he pinned the writhing dragon on the ground, a sinister grin slowly splitting his face, revealing his sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes went wide and his movements went still as he felt the wolf\u2019s length rest on his abdomen. The wolf\u2019s rod was on the move, sliding further up the drake\u2019s torso as it swelled, pressing down with increasing force. The wolf\u2019s head left a slick, wet trail as it progressed, and it didn\u2019t take long before it started to convulse, spurting torrents of pre onto the dragon\u2019s black scales, overflowing off his epic form onto the ground below in wide waterfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYield!\u201d Greg snarled down on the drake eagerly. Tyler clenched his eyes as he scowled. His arms and head were pinned by the wolf, and his feet were locked under Greg\u2019s knees. In a sudden flurry of movement, Tyler beat up at the wolf with his wings, but the long, comparatively slender limbs did nothing but slap harmlessly against his pelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left the dragon with just one appendage. With a deafening crack, the dragon\u2019s tail whipped up lashed across the wolf\u2019s ass. With a surprised grunt, Greg looked down on the dragon with a smirk. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked it rough, Tyler. That\u2019s fortunate, really. It means you\u2019re going to enjoy this a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt the wolf shift above him, but he re-calibrated before Greg could follow through with whatever he had planned. The second lash of the dragon\u2019s tail landed squarely on the wolf\u2019s testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s eyes went wide as he clenched his teeth. Tyler seized the opportunity to leverage the weakened wolf off him, and after a brief wrestle, found himself on top Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed up at him. \u201cSo what now then, Tyler?\u201d He taunted with a smile. \u201cHow are you going to stay on top of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of unease washed over the dragon. Greg wasn\u2019t hurt, and had superior strength to him. Why was he just laying beneath him passively? And why was he smiling, taunting up at him? Tyler snarled as he felt the power race through him. Perhaps the wolf didn\u2019t realise exactly what the dragon had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s breath shimmered as he filled his lungs. With a roar, he sent a pillar of flame down onto Greg\u2019s face. The wolf\u2019s silver insignia light up as\u2026</span></div></div>",

He watched as the smoke cleared, a sudden feeling of dread washing over him as he saw the wolf's smug grin looking back at him. The wolf's inky black fur was unmarred, the markings on his pelt and the silver of his muzzle glowed with the same eerie glow as the wolf-god's unnerving eyes. Tyler sat there frozen, confused as to why his attack didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow glow seemed to fade at the wolf's periphery, the scales returning to their stark silver on his black fur; the golden light concentrating as it made its way down from the wolf's face, over his immense chest and down his colossal arms, finally residing as in intense light held within the tips of the wolf's claws. Greg's smirk widened as he swiftly brought his hand up and clenched Tyler's neck. Pure energy seared into the dragon's flesh, the pain indescribable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake rolled off of the wolf and clutched his injured neck. Greg, on the other hand, sat up and chuckled as he eyed the waning glow in his claws. He rumbled to himself amused, \"That's new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the black dragon beside him, a new wild glint in his pupil-less eyes. He tried to conjure the energy again, but there was no spark, no iridescent glow was summoned. Greg was about to grunt in frustration when he had an epiphany. He looked at the dragon again, Tyler eyeing him back cautiously; a new realization struck him. \"How peculiar,\" he mused to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg's wicked grin never left his face as he crawled back on top of Tyler, his hungry shaft leaking rivers of pre onto the cowering dragon. He bent down an licked over the black drake's snout and rumbled darkly. \"Are you ready, Tyler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, what are you doing?\" the dragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only what I deserve,\" the greater god replied. With that, he re-pinned the dragon in his embrace, the drake wincing as he felt the claws dig into his neck again. Tyler flinched, expecting another shock to emanate from the wolf's claws again. But, it never came; the drake looking around confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler roared in pain, the fire unable to be contained as he spat his volatile flame at Greg's face. The wolf was entering him, taking his virgin anus. To his further horror, the glow had returned to the wolf's markings, the glow migrating down to his extended claw. As the wolf began to thrust into him, he squirmed as Greg brought down his empowered nails to his neck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of releasing all the energy at once, the wolf held control, letting just a fraction of his power loose; his touch electrified. He grazed a single finger along the outline of the drake's jugular. Tyler expected his end, this new god was too powerful for him. However, Greg traced his finger down the dragon's body; over the swell of Tyler's heaving chest, over the hills of the dragon's abdominals, all the way down to the drake's impressive member. As he grabbed hold of Tyler's shaft, he grinned wide as he forced Tyler to have an erection. He didn't have to rub, the light amounts of pure energy arcing between Fang's grip and Tyler's shaft was enough to pleasure the dragon. Tyler looked up confused, scared of what Greg was doing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this was not the emotion the wolf was looking for. Greg didn't revel in other's fears, he had no need for it. He wanted something else from Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, do you know how Jess felt when I took her?\" Greg cooed. \"Let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was about to speak when he felt the wolf's powerful arm grab a hold of his snout, forcing the mouth shut. Tyler's mouth burned with the fire trying to escape, jets of violet flame bursting from his nostrils as he couldn't contain his growing rage. This was how Jess was treated? Someone would treat his Jessica like this? He could feel his wrath breaking loose. Tears welled up in his eyes, the fire inside was growing so strong; he had to release it soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf paid no heed, he thrust deeply into the dragon's ass. He roughly ground in and out. Despite his air of superiority, Greg couldn't help but loll his tongue out at the sensation. It's been over a day since he felt his dick in something so tight; much too long for a being such as himself. Despite him no longer considering himself mortal, he still felt the desires of the flesh. Tyler was no exception to this either. The dragon was moaning into Fang's hand, the fires receding as the anger made way for lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn't want this. This was wrong. He knew what Jessica must have felt, he felt the shame of being violated and more so because his body was enjoying it. He was being forced to enjoy it. It made him so angry, but he couldn't get past the pleasure. Eventually, the dark dragon began to let loose as the wolf continued to pump into him. Greg let go Tyler's muzzle, the flames bursting forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg took the brunt of the blast. The energy being absorbed into him, the power crawling through his skin; it exhilarated him and only made him want orgasm that much more. The wolf grabbed a hold of Tyler's hips and forcefully pushing the dragon up and down his length, much like he did with Jess. As his orgasm began, the threw his head up to the moon and howled; his song low and tortured as he forced more and more of his cum into Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, both gods were panting. Greg pulled out and sat back, a satisfied look on his face. \"Do you hate me yet, Tyler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" the dragon responded as he sat up. He hated the wolf. He hated him for everything. His rage boiled in his stomach and he roared into the night, a cone of flame so powerful, it would have incinerated everything in its path if it were not for the wolf sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing that?\" the drake demanded in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get it, Tyler?\" the wolf said, the tone was icy and distant; without emotion. \"He engineered me to be like this.\" The wolf grinned down at Tyler, electricity arcing between the tips of his claws in each hand. He reached out and grabbed Tyler's neck so quickly, the dragon had not time to respond. He sent all the energy he had stored up into Tyler and forced him to the ground. \"Before David changed me, he asked me to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" the black drake roared in pain. \"He'd never...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had no choice!\" the wolf spat, his words dripping with spite. \"You couldn't be stopped. He loved you too much to smite you down himself. So I agreed to help him.\" The wolf was snarling. \"I gave up my love for this, Tyler. I will honour my pledge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true, Fang. You're still in there, just like I was still in me,\" Tyler grunted as he anticipated the wolf to strike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's face emptied itself of emotion. \"Of course, Fang is still with me. But that's not the point, Tyler. You never left, you were always there. Just like Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you doing this?\" the dragon snarled, an uncontrolled jet of flame blasting from his mouth as he seethed with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand, Tyler. When we changed, it's not the loss of yourself you should be worried about. It took the worst parts of us and made them flesh. We are incarnations of our greatest sins. Your fire? It's your rage, Tyler. You're angry; you hate me for raping your Jessica. You're angry that you were bullied your whole life. You're angry that I ruined everything for you; that I turned you into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler watched as Greg's eyes stopped glowing for a moment, a glimmer of Fang showing through, the wolf's pupil's large and sorrowful. A tear rolled down the wolf's cheek before his eyes began to glow with conviction again. \"I told you, I had to give up my love, Tyler. I accepted that, I asked for it... Because the worst part of me? It was my heartlessness. If I hurt David now, I won't feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf got off of Tyler, standing above him as the victor. He looked at his hands, they glowed with power. Even though he had seen so much of Tyler's anger, he knew it wasn't enough to slay the dragon, he needed more. And there was only one way to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, you have been so quiet. You finally understand, don't you?\" The wolf turned to look down at the dragon still lying on his back. Tyler nodded slowly, he understood. His power, his fire, it was his anger... That meant that Greg really couldn't feel love anymore. But then... why did he see the wolf shed a tear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg continued, \"He is cruel, Tyler. He never gave me enough power to destroy you outright. Instead... the only way I can kill you is through your own wrath. I am to torture you until you give in to your hatred. I am just the means, Tyler. You will destroy yourself, and I will be left as the only god in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true,\" the drake seethed. But it was obvious that he was enraged, smoke and embers sparking from his mouth as he tried to calm himself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You said love brought you back, Tyler? That means Jessica is still alive. It's only a matter of time until I find her.\" The wolf moved without any pretense, he bent down on all fours and sniffed the air, his powerful sense of smell trying to lock onto her scent. He realized he couldn't find her's, having not memorized it, but he knew Tyler's and that was all he needed. \"Come stop me,\" he said as he was about to dash and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice called out, \"Fang... Tyler...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg snapped his head towards David as the drake spoke, his face dropping like a stone. Tyler read the wolf\u2019s snarl before it formed on his face. With a frantic movement, he flung himself onto his stomach and skidded towards his brother, spraying tons of soil into the air as he came to a stop. Tyler\u2019s breath shimmered as he stood on all fours between the wolf and the drake, his wings slightly unfurled. Had the wolf not turned to leave as David spoke, then it was likely that he would have gotten to the drake first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg arched his back, his snarl fading into a grin as she cocked his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll really hate me when I kill David, won\u2019t you Tyler.\u201d He said with a sudden realisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck off Fang.\u201d Tyler growled, his voice low and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll just go find Jess then.\u201d The wolf chuckled, pointing a thumb over his shoulder to the blazing street behind him. \u201cYou can\u2019t protect both of them from me, Tyler. Ultimately, you won\u2019t protect either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked up at the wolf\u2019s eyes, the glowing orbs towering above the dragon in front of him. \u201cFang!\u201d he cried out as struggled to his feet, his voice weak and pained. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf ignored him outright. \u201cGive in to the fury.\u201d He commanded Tyler with a smirk. \u201cYou can end this here. I\u2019ll have no need to dispose of them if you are gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler craned his neck, as if to challenge the wolf. \u201cI promise you this Fang.\u201d He spat, his mouth glowing violet as the rage built within him. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna be that easy.\u201d As he spoke, Tyler\u2019s tail gently probed his brother behind him. David was too busy staring up at the wolf in disbelief to pay too much attention, and he didn\u2019t react as the giant black tail slotted in between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stood stolidly, his smirk frozen across his muzzle. \u201cEasy?\u201d he asked calmly. \u201cTyler, I just fucked you. Believe me, I know how easy you are.\u201d With that, he lowered his head as he advanced towards the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler launched his tail up in the air. David cried out in surprise and pain as the appendage lifted him up from underneath his oversized groin. The dragon lowered his hips towards the ground as his tail heaved his brother onto his rump. In one movement, Tyler lifted his hips and dipped his chest, sending his brother flying forwards up his spine. Once he felt the drake crash into and grab hold of his neck, he launched himself upright, throwing the earth beneath his hands while his enormous wings beat downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was almost upon him by the time he was upright, his brother stretching down his back as he clung to the dragon\u2019s neck. Tyler\u2019s wing\u2019s didn\u2019t stop, cracking again as they flapped out in front of the dragon, the thrust powerful enough to stop the wolf in his tracks as it sent the dragon skipping backwards. As Tyler landed on the ground again, he squatted down, his wings rising high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a leap from his hind legs and another powerful beat of his wings, Tyler launched himself at the wolf. Greg\u2019s eyes widened and he raised an elbow to protect his face as the dragon\u2019s talons crashed into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of riding the wolf to the ground Greg expected, Tyler launched himself off the wolf as they began to fall backwards, the dragon bearing the force of his bodyweight down on the wolf twice as his wings beat down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is said that every action has an equal but opposite reaction. As Tyler took to the skies, Greg collided with the earth in a meteoric impact, walls dirt and rock spewed high into the atmosphere as his hulking body buried itself in an open crater. The earth shook with a tremendous force, the tremor bringing down several of the blazing campus buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s maiden flight was not graceful. While many of the basic elements seemed to come somewhat instinctively, he was fighting hard just to stay in the air. His enormous body was packed full of solid muscle, bone and scale, his form incredibly bulky and angular. By himself, it would have been a challenge. But with the additional weight of the one hundred and ten foot tall ball of muscle he called his brother, it was almost impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he could hear David shouting, but he couldn't make anything out as the air roared past his ears. His wings beat hard and fast. Beneath him, the flames of the burning suburbs were whisked into a frenzy as roofs were ripped off houses and branches flung off trees. He had to get his brother away from Greg. It was the only thing that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, one of two things. The wolf was right; he couldn\u2019t protect both David and Jess at once. He had told the fox to wait for him on the road, but surely she wouldn\u2019t still be there? She could hear the conversation. She had a good head on her shoulders. Tyler told himself that she would be able to look out for herself until he returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler quickly began to tire as the streets sped past underneath. His pectorals were fatigued, and he felt himself beginning to lose altitude as his flaps started to wane. With a final beat, Tyler finally gave up, spreading his wings wide as he parachuted down onto a park below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed with a thud, the dragon\u2019s hands and feet sinking deep into the earth. Tyler panted heavily as his chest burned. They were a good mile or so away from the campus, the glowing flames of the suburbs safely behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank God.\u201d David moaned weakly as he slid off the dragon's back. The drake\u2019s knees buckled as he landed, causing him to bend over on all fours as he gasped for air. \u201cPlease...\u201d David said between breaths, his eyes wide as his body trembled. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes bore down on his brother. \u201cHow could you do this, David?\u201d he demanded, his voice shaking the nearby trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked up at the dragon. \u201cTyler, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d David cried out. \u201cI looked into your eyes and thought you were gone. I gave up on you. I thought\u2026\u201d his voice broke as he trailed off. \u201cI thought that you needed to be stopped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that!\u201d Tyler snarled, his breath shimmering as he felt the rage build through him. He closed his eyes tightly as he took several calming breaths. By the time he opened them again, they were watering. \u201cYou had the right idea. I was a monster, and I should have been stopped. Now I\u2019ve killed so many\u2026 oh shit.\u201d His profanity wasn\u2019t due solely to his contrition. His remorse made him angry. He felt the fury rise again, this time directed at himself. Again, he paused to take several calming breaths. The anger lessened, but it didn\u2019t disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for putting you in that position David.\u201d Tyler began, his tone firm. \u201cBut you fucked up. Fang? I can\u2019t believe how stupid you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid scowled. \u201cI did what I had to do, Tyler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon sneered. \u201cDo you remember the nursery rhyme, the one about the old woman who swallowed the fly? I am the fly. Fang was the spider you swallowed to kill me. In order to stop me, you unleashed an even greater force. And you should have known better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were a bit more than a fly!\u201d David spat. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand why Fang would do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s eyes flashed angrily. \u201cSeriously, are you retarded, David?!\u201d he almost shouted, his nostrils flaring with a violet light. In the back of his mind, he knew that his aspersion was unwarranted, that he should pull back. But the fury remained strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Tyler! No one knows him better than I do!\u201d David shouted at the dragon angrily. \u201cFang had\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t dare tell me to shut up!\u201d Tyler roared, his searing breath sending his brother onto his back. It took several moments before he regained his composure. \u201cMy anger is hard to control.\u201d He said apologetically, without actually apologising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid picked himself up, though he was visibly shaken. \u201cFang is like you were. He just needs to wake up. Trust me Tyler, he\u2019s not like what you think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. He isn\u2019t like me at all David.\u201d Tyler said flatly, his tone leaving no room for debate. \u201cHe asked to be heartless, so he didn't have to live with regrets anymore. Fang\u2019s dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d David said defiantly. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you in there anymore either. But you came back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang\u2019s dead!\u201d Tyler roared at brother\u2019s insolence. But as quickly as the rage had risen, it melted away as he watched David fall to his knees and started sobbing. Tyler had never seen his brother cry like that before. On rare occasions, he had seen him shed a tear. But he had always kept his emotions tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to go back.\u201d Tyler said his voice low and remorseful. \u201cHe\u2019s after Jess. I have to protect her.\u201d Tyler lowered his head as he turned his body around, his feet tearing up the park. He paused as he faced the burning suburbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop him, David.\u201d He said solemnly. \u201cHe\u2019s bigger, stronger, and faster. Eventually, he will kill me. And then nothing will stop him. He will be looking for you. If he finds you, he will kill you. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do now, David. But I can\u2019t be there for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon closed his eyes and barred his teeth. He didn\u2019t want to say what he did next; he knew no good would come of it. But he couldn\u2019t leave his brother with any prevarication. \u201cPerhaps, Fang can be saved. I saw him. For a moment. For what it\u2019s worth, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. But I don\u2019t know for certain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes again. \u201cThe old woman swallowed a bird to kill the spider.\u201d He said with a wry smile. \u201cJust for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d With that, he launched himself into the air, his wings cracking as the lift flattened the nearby trees.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David's head was reeling. Was Fang really too far gone? When he had stared at the wolf, his once handsome face changed, twisted into something else - tortured, he wanted nothing more than to reach out and grab at him; to comfort him. But the wolf was so hostile, the sneer, the threat; it was all so genuine. That scared the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon gulped. He remembered Tyler's words. He could stop 'the spider.' All he had to do was become 'the bird.' He knew he didn't want to get any bigger, but he had to. After he turned Fang into... whatever he was now, he had run out of options. He had to take matters into his own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, he could hear the snarls and growls of animals. He knew Tyler and Greg were fighting. He saw a burst of purple illuminate the distant sky. That could've meant Tyler was protecting Jess, or worse... He prayed Jess was alive, that Tyler wouldn't succumb to his growing rage. He worried that Tyler might lapse, that he might turn into the demon he was when he first turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut David could stop it; he could stop them both. He could save his brother and his love. With grim determination, he began to stroke his member. It wasn't difficult to get him to pre again, his massive nuts were always ready and willing now. He clamped down on his own shaft as he felt his balls churn. He knew he'd never be the same. Before the onset of orgasm, he could hear an unearthly roar booming into the night sky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cum began to spill into his mouth he could feel the buzz returning. But it was different this time. He slipped out of consciousness, blackness enshrouding him for just the briefest of moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid awoke with a start. For one, he wasn't outside anymore, and two, his body felt different. As he came to, he realized he was in his room. Looking down at his body, he realized it was the same size as what he used to be; beefy and athletic. This had to be a trip, there was no way this could be happening. But the colours, they were so life-like, so real; nothing like the trips he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis musings stopped when he heard someone beside him exhale deeply through their nose. He turned to his side to see a waking wolf beside him. Fang was very much what he used to be; big and brawny, topping the charts at 7'10'' of prime wolf. But there were strange memories floating in David's head. Things that were never there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, morning, hon,\" the wolf yawned, placing a large paw around the drake's waist under the sheets. That was right, David's head told him, they were boyfriends. Ever since the wolf had come out to him in high school, the two of them have been dating each other. The wolf was still a cocky asshole on the field, but the big lug had a good heart in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" David replied softly, a gesture reflected in his the grin forming across his face. If this was a dream, this was a damned good one. He didn't care if he was tripping or not; he's been so preoccupied with trying to maintain a sense of normality, this moment was perfect and he was going to take it for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringer for his alarm went off. The wolf in front of him chuckled and turned around, regrettably ending their loose embrace to hit the snooze button. He turned back and smiled at the dragon. \"Mm, I got class in an hour,\" the wolf rumbled. Fang leaned in for a quick peck on David's cheek, the dragon blushing immensely. \"Love it when you do that,\" he chuckled before growling playfully. \"Don't think we have enough time for a quickie, I'm just gonna take a shower if that's okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" David replied, the blush never leaving his face. He felt a small pang of loss when the wolf rolled over to get up off <i>their</i> bed. He watched with bated breath as Fang put on a pair of almost too tight boxer briefs and walked out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, he could hear his boyfriend banging on the door of the bathroom. \"Yo, Jess! Hurry the fuck up in there. I'm gonna be late for class,\" he heard Fang growling. As David sat up, he saw a figure passing by his open door. It couldn't be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot up, rifled through his wardrobe for a pair of underwear and went into the hallway. What he saw astounded him. He was staring at the incredibly wide back of his baby brother. Tyler knocked at the door impatiently. \"Jess?\" he grumbled; it was definitely Tyler. \"Baby, save some hot water for the rest of us.\" When his girlfriend didn't seem to listen he turned around and rolled his eyes before looking down at his older brother. \"Oh, mornin', David. Didn't see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Ty,\" David responded nervously. As he drank in how colossal his eight and a half foot tall brother was, he vaguely remembered his little brother exploding with size during high school. And, under his and Fang's tutelage, the purple dragon became just as much of a football and bodybuilding nut as the wolf was - on top of being an incredible nerd and geek, still owning the shop the two brother's ran together. David gulped when his mind jogged to his younger brother wearing some incredibly skimpy costumes with his huge body; for some reason Tyler always liked to highlight the incredible amount of junk he was packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I would've woken up earlier if I'd known she was going to take this long,\" the wolf glowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well maybe you should've,\" Tyler responded sharply. Even when they were practically family now... David liked the sound of that - those two were always at each other's necks. Though, it didn't seem so one sided in Fang's favour anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well maybe you should stop moaning so much when you cum. You and Jess kept me up all night,\" Fang growled lowly, looking up at Tyler's face. The wolf pounced on Tyler. The giant dragon wobbled back and forth as he had to carry the weight of two bodybuilders. Both of them were giggling as they horsed around, almost like they were brothers themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open to reveal the short fox still towelling off her pink hair. \"Hey, bud, hands off my boyfriend.\" The two boys disengaged, smirks on their faces. The fox turned to the blue drake standing there and said, \"Hey, Dave? Me, Alli, an' a couple of the girls are heading out for a girl's night out tonight. You and Fangykins are always welcome,\" she said with mock sweetness. David couldn't help but roll his eyes as she walked past them and slapped Tyler's hand away when he tried to reach out and touch her. Good old Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to respond to Jessica's invitation when he felt a pair of strong hands yanking him into the bathroom. \"Hey, what's the big-\" He was abruptly cut off when he was suddenly spun around and felt Fang's tongue begin to invade his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang broke the kiss momentarily, reaching past David to close the door on the gawking purple dragon. He looked passionately at David and said, \"Shower with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rhetorical. As if David would ever say no. The two studs were naked and lathering each other up. It was almost serene to David. He could recall doing this so many times before with Fang. A rush of memories flooded him; Marcus, Allison even the likes of Rick, they were all so happy in this reality. And that was troubling. No place was ever that happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf began to kiss David again, to which the dragon reciprocated in kind. The dragon closed his eyes, feeling the intense heat of the hot water beating against their muscular forms. He felt up Fang's powerful body; his pocketed, his swelling chest, his handsome jaw, the horns growing out his brow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen David pulled back and opened his eyes, he was no longer in the shower with Fang. Instead, he was face to face with a monster; intense yellow glowing eyes, the Devil's horns growing out of his head, silver scales on the bridge of his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop?\" the wolf-god asked coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid began to stammer, but the wolf interrupted before he could say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would never happen, David. We could never be together like that.\" The wolf's face was empty. That empty gaze turned into a wry smirk. \"Unless, you give yourself to the change like I did. You'll never have to think about it anymore, Davey. You'll never have to wonder what a perfect life will be like, you'll have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" the dragon sputtered,\"how? I'll still be in my body. It won't be like that at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf-deity chuckled. \"Just like there's Fang... and then there's me. We both have what we want. Join me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to him, brother,\" A voice called out. David turned to see the Tyler-god, the epitome of what it meant to be a dragon. \"You're not like us, we are weak.\" The wolf snickered at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon rumbled lowly at the wolf, but did not attack; he continued, \"You're a god now, David. Unlike us, you're strong. Let your virtue guide your ascension, not your vices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's vision began to become blurry, the dream was collapsing. Before he returned back to reality, he heard Tyler say, \"Choose wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid eyes shot open; he felt different. He experimentally move his arm, his eyes going wide at huge how huge and rough it felt. He looked down his body, he had grown -  just how big, he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid winced, he could feel his insides changing as he sat up, his dick bobbing painfully on the verge of another release. He looked around to see a figure standing tall as it emerged from the shadows approaching him cautiously. To David's amazement, he was just as tall sitting down as they were standing up. A smile crept up on his face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFang.\u201d David said with a sinister delight as recognised the wolf. To think, it was only moments ago those glowing yellow eyes towered above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Greg now.\u201d The wolf said flatly as he continued uneasily towards the titanic drake. \u201cI see that I am just in time for your ascension. I would have stopped it, but I let the opportunity slip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s gaze cast down over the wolf\u2019s body. Fang\u2026 Greg, was titanic in his own right, the tallest trees stretched no higher than his knee, and the tiled roofs of the two-storied houses that bordered the park peaked no higher than his hock. And yet, as truly gigantic as the wolf was, he seemed so puny as he stood at mere eye level to the sitting drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s heart raced as he continued to study the wolf. His fur was incredibly flat and dark in the night, but his form was so bulked and ripped, it easy to make out the contours of his naked body.  The silver insignia that traced up Greg\u2019s boy rose and fell as they tightly hugged the peaks and crevices of his form. Every movement he made caused a symphony of movement underneath his pelt, the mountains of muscles tensing and flexing with unbridled power. David began to pant as he felt a surge of energy building in him.<br>\r\nHe wanted to touch that body, to caress it. He wanted to press it up against his own and fuck it. The drake\u2019s brow furrowed as his malicious smile stretched to its limit. He would do exactly that, he decided, his mouth salivating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile David evaluated Greg\u2019s body, the wolf was reciprocating, though for slightly different reasons. He read the drake\u2019s face, and saw what he wanted. His demeanour relaxed as his smirk returned. His gait carried far more confidence as he continued to advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched the wolf and started to laugh. He didn\u2019t know why Greg was approaching him with such assurance, but it made it all the easier.  The drake felt no reservations about what he planned to do with the wolf.  \u201cYou wanted to kill me.\u201d He said ominously as his prey approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d The wolf confessed without a skerrick of humility. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have to anymore. You\u2019ve done that yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took a deep breath, his powerful lungs sucking in the atmosphere violently.  He felt the energy course though him, his heart pounding as his blood boiled with desire. \u201cI\u2019m very much alive, Greg.\u201d  He promised with a sinister smirk as the wolf came to a stop, his naked form standing within arm\u2019s reach of the drake. David\u2019s eyes flickered down his body. \u201cYou have no idea what I am going to do to you.\u201d He rumbled, his low guttural voice trembling the earth beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf suddenly leant in towards David. The drake\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as Greg\u2019s kiss caught him off guard. The wolf spared no prelude as he Invaded David\u2019s lips, investing his whole mind and body into the passionate embrace. The drake\u2019s surprise quickly subsided as he responded eagerly, his whole body flooding with warmth. The drake really didn\u2019t need the encouragement, and with a feral urgency he roughly grabbed hold of the wolf\u2019s sides and threw him to the ground, bearing his far superior body down on top of Greg\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grunted painfully as he was slammed onto the earth below, but he quickly regained his composure. \u201cI think I have some idea, David.\u201d Greg smiled up at him. The drake\u2019s enormous throbbing erection rested heavily against the wolf\u2019s chest, shifting slightly with every pulse of the drake\u2019s powerful heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snorted as he stared into the wolf\u2019s eerie eyes. The flat yellow glow emanated an impersonal power that caused the drake to pause against his instinctis. He couldn\u2019t see Fang anywhere in those eyes, or on the face that surrounded it. He could recognise the wolf\u2019s demeanour, though even that was somewhat more distant\u2026 colder. He wanted to fuck the wolf all the same, but as much as his body screamed out for it, It seemed\u2026 wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re hesitant.\u201d The wolf stated in confusion, his face dropping as he tried to read the drake above him. His eyes shifted down to the ebony length that rested on his torso. \u201cYour ascension isn\u2019t complete, David.\u201d He said, a small grin returning to his face. He gently caressed the drake\u2019s head with both hands, the enormous pillar of flesh shaking under his touch. Almost immediately, the cock erupted, spurting tons of warm clear pre on top of Greg\u2019s face, causing the wolf to laughed out in delight . \u201cDavid, if this is how you start off, I can\u2019t wait for the finale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared down on the wolf uneasily, internally conflicted. He watched the silver insignia that broke through the wolf\u2019s pelt begin to glow. Greg\u2019s smile broadened as he looked deep into David\u2019s eyes, his hands gently tracing the surface of his length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid roared in surprise and pleasure as he felt the head of his cock jolt under the wolf\u2019s touch. With complete control, Greg slowly released a trickle of the energy he had bent up over his recent confrontation with Tyler. David moaned down on top of the wolf uneasily, his eyes wide. He didn\u2019t know what was happening, but he knew it felt amazing. To his own surprise, he felt his balls clench as his orgasm hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes and roared down on top of the wolf with all of his might, the sonic burst cracking the earth as it vibrated to his tone. He came with an intense force, his seed releasing with the pressure of a bursting dam. Greg winced as the torrent of cum slammed into his face, the force knocking his head backwards as the warm fluid crashed against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could feel the energy racing through him build to a crescendo as he came, the release unlocking the true power that had been building within him. He felt his body begin to change around him, his frame cracked and heaved as it exploded outwards, new sheets of muscle expanding out into the new territory like inflating balloons. His muscles strained as they packed on ton after ton of flesh, the meat compressing as they fought each other for space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face painfully cracked as the bones extended and reformed, leaving him with incredibly angular and sharp features. He felt two horns burst painfully from his skill, the new bone seeming to explode in size, twisting as they lengthened. With a snarl, he felt his scales harden as they darkened, stretching taught against his figure as his muscles finally began to stop pressing further out. His cock released a final load of his seed on the world, and it was over. David simply panted, feeling the reserved power that had been added to his body, savouring the moment of his ascention. It took him several breaths before he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake gave an undignified start as he looked at Greg underneath him. The wolf was covered in his spunk, along with the rest of the park and several streets worth of nearby houses. But it wasn\u2019t the mess he had made that startled him. The wolf was bigger. Significantly so. Before, Greg was half of David\u2019s height. But now, he had closed the gap by half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it.\u201d The wolf said as he smiled proudly up at the drake-god. \u201cYou are the Titan from the dream.\u201d He said. He looked down at the drake\u2019s cock that still rested on his chest. \u201cIt looks like this got even bigger.\u201d He noted playfully, his hands returning to the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grunted as he felt his length respond to the wolf\u2019s touch, a fresh load of pre shooting out. The drake swallowed as he felt his blood race again. David shook his head as he looked down on the wolf. \u201cNo.\u201d It was so hard for him to say such a simple word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s smile broadened as he continued to caress the drake\u2019s head. Despite David\u2019s words, he did nothing to stop the wolf from playing with him. \u201cI know you, David.\u201d Greg said soothingly. \u201cI know your vice. The one thing that can lead you astray. The same thing that has lead us all here now.\u201d He teased gently, his solid yellow eyes staring up at him earnestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s be frank here, David. You\u2019re a big, stupid dragon with a big, courageous heart. You care about those you love, and would literally kill yourself to save them. You\u2019re compassionate and caring. You\u2019d never use someone else, not for anything.\u201d Greg looked down on the slimy pillar of flesh on his chest, and patted it. \u201cWith this one exception.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, David whined. Every fibre of his being wanted to fuck the wolf again, and again. He was a god now; he doubted he would ever have to stop. But there was something in the back of his mind that restrained him. Something which was telling him that this was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to fuck me.\u201d The wolf said seductively. \u201cI want you to fuck me. So why are you so hesitant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid licked his lips, but his tongue was dry. It was a good question. Why was he hesitating? \u201cYou will grow stronger.\u201d He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The wolf\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Greg laughed with genuine amusement. \u201cWhat is the point of being a God if you don\u2019t do what you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a God.\u201d David said, his voice a monotonous drone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smirked up at the drake as he let the electricity flow  down his fingertips onto David\u2019s cock. \u201cWell then, what do you want, David?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid bit his bottom lip as his erection writhed under the wolf\u2019s touch. </span></div></div>",

His member let out another powerful wave of pre-seed and David shuddered when he felt the wolf's rough tongue licking along the lip of his head gently, methodically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid lowered his head into his neck and tried to speak again, before it was too late. \"I want to...\" he began. A spark of electricity jolted through his shaft as Greg coyly began to stroke his length gently. \"Aw fuck!\" the drake moaned. David brought his fist slamming into the ground, displacing the earth below him. He felt something snap within him. Fuck all of this, fuck everything, I need to fuck. He ground heavily into the wolf-god below him and hissed, \"I want to fuck you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked menacingly at Greg, the wolf's visage twisted with a delighted grin. \"What are you waiting for then?\" the wolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf roared in agony. He wasn't just growing, the drake's cum was changing him further, further monstrifying him. Silver spines erupted from the back of his neck; like a sliver mane of scaled growth. The horns on top of his head began to grow further, curving outwards like that of a bighorn sheep. The wolf snarled as he felt his gums splitting as the fang that used to stick out of his mouth even when closed, and the corresponding tooth on the other side of the mouth, began to thicken, more ivory white bone jutting out, his fangs become tusks that glistened menacingly from the yellow light that emanated from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" he moaned, feeling his muscles begin to bunch up. He was rapidly approaching the drake's size and there was no indication that the dragon-god was even close to being finished. Greg wanted the power and David was giving it to him so freely. But something felt wrong. The world around the wolf-god began to swirl. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI want to save you,\u201d the dragon-god said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chortled, \u201cSave me? From what, David? You made me perfect, exactly how you wanted me to be. I am \u2013 I will be \u2013 your magnum opus.\u201d With that the wolf brought his electrified hand down to David\u2019s wanting shaft and shocked it intense energy, the pulse sending an excruciating wave of pleasure up David\u2019s length, the tingling sensation completely overwhelming the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d David said calmly. Despite the pleasure, despite the lust, despite the desperate need to fuck this wolf; the dragon held strong. It was as Greg said: he\u2019d go to any length to protect those he loved; even if it meant going against his destiny. He knew what he was; he was a sire of gods and Greg was indeed his greatest creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was no one he loved more than Fang; the cocksure attitude, the wolf\u2019s bulging body and deep down, the wolf\u2019s small, but growing heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, by any means. It took all of David\u2019s will to push at the wolf. He met so much resistance, both from Greg and his desires. The wolf clung to his eager member, his eyes going wide as the behemoth of a dragon lifted himself off the ground with Greg still gripping tight to the mighty shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great torrent of pre gushed out of the drake\u2019s spire and David let out a deep and sonorous moan. He almost caved in to the desire right there and then. But he pressed on, he gripped Greg\u2019s paws on his member and pried them off, straining through the pleasure of his own hands on his godhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looked incredulously at the dragon before him, his blue scales shifted with each thunderous, laboured breath, revealing the power coursing through David. Another wave of pre was birthed into the world from David\u2019s cock, the liquid raining down on the pair. Greg was so close to it, if only he could just reach out and make David blow \u2013 he\u2019d become the ultimate god, even David would bow down before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf struggled, thrashing about, trying to get the dragon to release his wrists. However, David held firm. In a desperate gambit, the wolf let loose the last of his stored power, the blast powerful enough for electricity to arc through the air and singe David\u2019s skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat tickles, Greg,\u201d the dragon sneered. David\u2019s face twisted into a wicked grin. He squeezed the wolf\u2019s wrists hard. Greg winced but otherwise remained standing. \"Where's Fang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone, David,\u201d the wolf said, a wry smile forming on his face. \u201cJust like your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d David\u2019s calm demeanour disappeared, his eyes suddenly wild. \u201cWhat did you do to Tyler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI killed him,\u201d Greg said with demented satisfaction. \u201cPoor little Jessica. She fell right into my hands.\u201d The wolf made a gesture, opening a palm and then squeezing it with all his might, a sick smile stuck on his jaw. \u201cTyler was so mad, he couldn\u2019t hold it in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d David snorted. He could trust Fang to never lie to him, but Greg?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promised to never lie to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not Fang!\u201d David roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you need to think, Davey,\u201d the wolf chortled. \u201cI hoped you\u2019d figure it out by now - how I can use my lightning. I used Tyler\u2019s power against him, turned his rage into my own strength and I tortured him to death.\u201d The wolf was pressing forward, almost giggling as he spoke and David could feel his grip loosening a bit. \u201cYou should have seen him, David. I took everything away from him. He died broken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true!\u201d David roared into the wolf\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou understand, don\u2019t you? How I had a little juice left to\u2026 excite you. It was painful, David. I made sure he suffered until the very end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let go of Greg\u2019s hand and brought his paw to the wolf\u2019s neck, squeezing it firmly. \u201cAnd why tell me this? To enrage me? I don\u2019t have Tyler\u2019s fire, you gain nothing from this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I? I know you, Davey. Everything you are now is lust. Every action, every emotion; it leads back to your uncontrollable desire to fuck something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon eyed the wolf and had to stop himself from gulping. Even though Greg was smaller, he seemed to understand this godhood better than he did. \u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, that\u2019s what I am, David,\u201d the wolf said cooly. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me? I can read you like a book, just one of the generous gifts Fang left behind\u2026 Tormenting you - just like tormenting Tyler - is just too easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard,\" the dragon glowered. But Greg was right. Even as he stood there; right there, right then; his desire to fuck only grew. He wanted to bend this wolf over and teach him a lesson. As his rage grew, so did his lust. That's what David was now: completely, uncontrollably lust-driven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw the wolf to the ground. What he didn't expect however was for Greg to deftly flip himself to his feet. While David felt more cumbersome now than ever, his bulk containing sheer power like his brother, Greg was agile, his power explosive as it was overwhelming; perfect for the cruel, calculating predator he had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a building pressure was building within David; one in his loins, his arousal back in full force and the other in his chest; it was back to plan A, he was going to fuck this wolf a new asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready now, Greg. I'm going to fuck you. Is that not what you want?\" the drake said, lowering his head as he leered menacingly at the wolf, his gaze hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s stance eased itself into a relaxed, confident gait. \u201cI thought you\u2019d see things my-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was abruptly interrupted by David leaping on top of him. Greg tried to play along, even when he felt his back slam roughly into the quagmire below them, a sickening squishing sound as he landed. He growled playfully, trying to egg the beast on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagined what he\u2019d become. Larger, more powerful, more potent; everything Fang had ever wanted, and it would be his. A weak voice in his head reminded him that Fang actually wanted one thing greater than all of those; something his old self would trade in an instant. But he wasn\u2019t about to let this opportunity slip. Oh no, this was far too important. He wouldn\u2019t just ascend this time \u2013 he\u2019d transcend. He\u2019d be completely unrecognizable, completely unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seemed that David had other plans than to just fuck him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a little foreplay?\u201d the drake rumbled, a deep dark laughter coming from deep within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grasped the wolf\u2019s arms and squeezed. Greg winced as he felt his pelt being pierced by the drake\u2019s claws. The drake brought his mouth next to Greg\u2019s neck, the wolf turning away as he breathed hot air into the wolf\u2019s form. \u201cUnlike us dragons, Greg, you\u2019re still a little fleshy, aren\u2019t you? I wonder how much will you bleed when I\u2019m done with your neck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s powerful jaws wrapped themselves around the wolf\u2019s neck and with a sick sense of satisfaction, David clamped down. He did so lightly at first, savouring the quickening of the wolf\u2019s heartbeat, the instinctual fear of all prey. And then he bit down hard, drawing blood into his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg let out a pained howl as the drake bit him. He could feel David\u2019s tongue lapping over the wound. By the rate at which it was coming out, there was no doubt: David had severed the jugular vein. He whimpered, but the dragon didn\u2019t stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid knew he only had moments to save the wolf\u2019s life. He\u2019d spare the wolf, he wanted to savour knowing how he held the power of life and death in his hand. He lusted for that power. But, he\u2019d make Greg suffer. In an act of cruelty, he grabbed at the wolf\u2019s face, forcing him to open his mouth. Initially, the wolf thought it was time, closing his eyes as he awaited David to force-feed his dick into his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut David had other plans. With a powerful grip, the dragon held onto the wolf\u2019s signature fang, the one that always stuck out of Fang\u2019s mouth. He pushed on the wolf\u2019s head by the horn with one hand and pulled the tooth with the other. Greg yowled in agony as he felt the roots in the tooth being severed, blood gushing into mouth as he stared at the twisted smile plastered on David\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, Greg had been de-Fanged, left with no more trademark. The wolf\u2019s breathing became ragged; he was ready to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gazed down at his handiwork, an evil smirk crossing his face. He had no plans of sharing his world with Greg anymore. He wouldn't spare him. That's what the old David would do, the weak David. He began to chuckle, holding the extracted tooth in hand. He noted how sharp it was and wondered: wouldn't it be grand if the wolf bled to death as he went on his trip, to be killed by what was left of Fang?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, David brought his leaking spire over Greg's anus. Without mercy, he penetrated the ring, but the wolf was too weak to protest. It was so tight, that the drake began to cum almost immediately, just half a thrust in and his seed began to spill into the wolf's ass. Greg began to moan as his vision went hazy, he could feel his body repairing itself, his fang coming back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he was knocked out, the wolf could see David grunting and buckling as he held onto a sharp object, almost like a dagger. He looked into David's eyes, his own pupils going wide and whimpering:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blue drake\u2019s mouth contorted in surprise at Fang's appearance. The drake pausing his bucking as he continued to orgasm, his seed filling the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s eyes grew distant as he faded into his trip. \u201cYou have to kill me to stop him.\u201d He almost whispered as his face became pallid, his eyes widening in terror at whatever vision his trip presented him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang!\u201d David cried as he clenched the wolf\u2019s jaw, trying to force his gaze. But he was gone, the wolf\u2019s eyes steadily illuminating into solid yellow globes as he began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid moaned in both despair and pleasure as he clenched his teeth. In spite of his efforts, he returned to pounding into the wolf, unable to deny himself the extra pleasure in the throes of his orgasm. He knew that he should pull out, but he simply couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as the wolf\u2019s head scraped along the ground. It didn\u2019t take long before he had outgrown the confides of the park, and his head started churning up the asphalt street as it steadily advanced towards the row of houses across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snarled as he fought against his desires. The wolf was already his size, and he was still dumping tonnes more seed into him with each thrust. With a strained roar, David willed himself out of the wolf, pulling his length free. His cock erupted his load into the soggy, churned turf below, the pressure of his release boring a hole in the earth. David bit his bottom lip as he stroked his member fervently. It was a poor substitute, but better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf continued to grow in front of him, passing his own size and beyond. But the wolf wasn\u2019t simply growing larger as his head started to bulldoze the houses it loomed over. His body was mutating further, his horns growing longer and thicker, curving in on themselves as they pressed out. His teeth grew longer and sharper, sticking down out of his lips viciously. His vertebrae sprouted spines from his neck and back, digging into the ground as his body dragged further outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf stopped growing shortly after David stopped cumming. The drake climbed onto the wolf\u2019s superior stature as he lay unconscious. The wolf was far too big for him to realistically control now, being about a third again his height. And worse of all, he saw less of Fang in the giant wolf-god than ever. Fang had shown through, and he responded by burying him even further inside Greg. Part of him was furious with himself for allowing this to happen. Another part was screaming for him to fuck the wolf some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg stirred as David moved on top of him. His eyelids fluttered, spilling a golden glow over the two of them. He stared at the drake on top of him, slowly absorbing the situation. \u201cGood morning hun.\u201d He said with a cold smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snarled down on him. \u201cYou lied! Fang\u2019s not gone, I saw him! Where is he?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right here.\u201d Greg replied smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet him out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid, he\u2019s not being held hostage.\u201d He chuckled condescendingly, as if he were laughing at the antics of a child. \u201cIf he wanted to come out, then he wouldn\u2019t have asked to be heartless now, would he?\u201d He stared expectantly at the drake, but sighed when David\u2019s snarl held firm. \u201cYou are conflicted, I can see that. But it\u2019s a conflict between you and your darkest nature, not David and some other entity. As it is with you, it is in me. Fang and I are one. But the difference is, Fang doesn't want to fight his nature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d David roared. \u201cI saw him, I fucking saw him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have, David. If I was weak enough, he might have shown through. But nothing would have come of it.\u201d The wolf cocked his head. \u201cThink about it. What drives a being, David?\u201d He asked, pausing long enough for effect, but not a response. \u201cEmotion. Fear, Love, Hate, Happiness, Guilt\u2026 it\u2019s what gives meaning to the meaningless. If we don\u2019t fear death, then what importance is life? If we don\u2019t hate pain, then why would we bother to preserve ourselves? If we don\u2019t love someone, then what difference is it if they live or die? Without emotion, there is no meaning; no consequence. The universe simply is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s face split into a sinister smile. \u201cFang is heartless. He doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore. He has no motivation to fight; it\u2019s all meaningless. And that is what I am. I am his vice, his darkest embodiment. I am his heartlessness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething sparked inside the drake\u2019s mind as the wolf finished his final sentence. He couldn\u2019t quite piece it all together, but he knew that the wolf was lying. David lowered his head into his neck. \u201cSo Fang doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore?\u201d He asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg mistook David\u2019s sceptical clarification for grim realisation. His smile widened, his unnaturally vicious teeth barred. \u201cNow you\u2019re getting it, David.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake looked sternly down his snout, staring hard into the wolf\u2019s yellow eyes. \u201cThen why did he want me to kill you?\u201d he demanded calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s wicked smile held a moment before slowly fading. The wolf\u2019s eyes darted across the drake\u2019s face as he tried to read him. The saccadic movement was masked by the monotony of the wolf\u2019s eyes, and only readable by the quick subtle movements of his eyelids. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d He concluded firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake squared his jaw. \u201cNo.\u201d he said with absolute conviction. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d His mind raced in a flurry of sparks he rarely felt, the pieces of the truth falling into place almost effortlessly. The drake slowly started to smile. His heart beat with a hope he had feared had faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s smile returned, as vicious as ever. \u201cThen I\u2019m lying.\u201d He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d David said almost triumphantly. \u201cYou are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf squirmed under the drake\u2019s mass, gently scraping his body against the drake\u2019s erection. \u201cI\u2019m being a very naughty boy aren\u2019t I, David? Are you going to punish me?\u201d he teased up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slowly shook his head. His cock responded to the wolf\u2019s movement, and his whole body screamed at him to fuck him again. But now, those screams were easy to ignore. The voice in the back of his head was front and centre, in complete control. \u201cI\u2019m going to save you.\u201d He said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed in a cruel delight. \u201cSo you said before. But how will you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid leaned his head down over the wolf\u2019s. \u201cYou forget, <i>Greg</i>.\u201d He emphasised the name contemptuously. \u201cAs you said, you ARE Fang. You can read me like a book. But I can do the same to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf started to chuckle silently. \u201cWhat\u2019s the book about then, David?\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid cocked his head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t Fang\u2019s heartlessness. You can\u2019t be.\u201d He said with a knowing grin. \u201cFang was tormented by what he did. He hated himself for it. What he did to others, he felt himself. His heart was heavy and burdened, not empty. That can\u2019t be his vice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gave a mirthless laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re being too clever here, David.\u201d He said with a forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a lot in common, Fang.\u201d David said, his face fading into stoicism. \u201cYou\u2019re vice is the same as mine. Lust. Not for sex, but for power. Domination. It\u2019s why you\u2019ve come back here, hoping to fuck yourself powerful. And once you are, you\u2019ll turn on me, like you did with Tyler, to be the only god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid swallowed as he mentioned his brother. He hoped the wolf was lying. No, he KNEW that the wolf was lying. Tyler couldn't be dead.He had to believe that. He scowled as he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s why you bully others, tear strips out of them. It\u2019s why you beat up Marcus. It\u2019s why you raped the girls. It\u2019s why you kept taking more and more of my seed to get where you are now. You want the power, you want to dominate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf chucked up at him, but his throes were bitter. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question, David.\u201d He sneered contemptuously.  \u201cHow are you going to save Fang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d David said flatly. \u201cBut I can help him save himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shook his head as his sneer deepened. \u201cI told you, David. He doesn\u2019t want to be saved anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you lie.\u201d David quickly countered. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing you want more than the power.\u201d He leant in closer to the wolf, his snout almost touching the wolf\u2019s. \u201cYou wanted to change, remember? You gave it all up for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s hands began to tremble as his emotions began to race. \u201cThat means your love is stronger than his lust.\u201d He said as he fought back welling tears. \u201cYou\u2019d better be scared, Greg. Because there\u2019s a giant inside you just waiting to wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf\u2019s face dropped into a dangerous snarl. \u201cDavid.\u201d he growled, his tone low and threatening. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d His eyes hardened. \u201cI don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me hear you say that with pupils.\u201d David challenged the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sneered, as he shifted under David.  \u201cNo more talk, David. If you\u2019re not man enough to fuck me, I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake was thrown off the wolf with ridiculous ease. David didn\u2019t physically fight the wolf as Greg climbed on top of him. The wolf was clearly stronger now, there was no point. Instead, he looked into Greg\u2019s scowling eyes earnestly. \u201cThere\u2019s a voice inside there. Like there is in me. And it isn\u2019t heartless. I saw that first hand!\u201d He didn\u2019t take his eyes off the wolf\u2019s as Greg grabbed hold of the drake\u2019s shaft, and angled it towards his ass. David shed a tear. \u201cFang, I love you. Fight. He's not too strong!\u201d He pleaded</span></div></div>",

The wolf plunged himself so quickly, both parties let out exacerbated gasps as David\u2019s penis penetrated Greg\u2019s anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang, p-please!\u201d David roared with ecstasy as the wolf-god began to bob his rump up and down over his needy shaft. \u201cF-fight it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to fight, David? I want this. This is my destiny,\u201d Greg said flatly, his expression darkening, a wry smile on his face. \u201cFang wants it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang. Fang, I know you\u2019re in there. Choose me. Baby, come back,\u201d the dragon pleaded, begging for the wolf to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn\u2019t stop. Greg\u2019s pace began to quicken and David let out an unwanted yet appreciative moan. David began to buck on his own, grinding his dick further and further into Greg\u2019s ass, further solidifying the wolf\u2019s position to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! I\u2019m- I\u2019m\u2026\u201d The pleasure was so intense, David was unable to complete his sentence, his mind going shot as he could feel the most incredible orgasm building. He knew it was wrong, to give Greg this much power, but he was powerless to stop it. It was up to Fang now; David could only hope for a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the giants roared as the flow of cum began to spill into Greg\u2019s ass. David reflexively grabbed onto the wolf\u2019s thighs, his claws grabbing onto the wolf\u2019s sleek fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg could feel his body expanding, his already titanic frame increasing in height and girth. Muscle began to pile up on his frame, the fibres noisily stretching and contracting as he grew. The wolf\u2019s tongue lolled out, he could feel his bones cracking, his joints reshaping as he grew taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even with his new power, Greg could feel the buzz begin to settle in. He scoffed to himself; he thought he was above such things by now. It wouldn\u2019t matter, once the trip was over, he would be the one true god of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf-god stood in the middle of a swirling chasm of fire and brimstone. He couldn\u2019t help but smirk, he knew where he was; he knew what was happening to him. He began to saunter his way through the hellish landscape that surrounded him; embracing the home of the god that changed him forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreggory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned around to see the god David had become. To his delight, just like in the real world, he was larger than this one. He was the ultimate god now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2019ll be good,\u201d Greg rumbled darkly, looking hungrily at the dragon. Despite the wild glint in Greg\u2019s eyes, the dragon stayed steadfast, his expression as cold as ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d the dream-David said knowingly. The drake began to approach Greg, only coming up to the bottom of the wolf\u2019s chest. The dragon rubbed his cheek dearly into Greg\u2019s torso. \u201cYou are by far my best creation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf-god growled with delight. \u201cI am, aren\u2019t I?\u201d The black beast brought his arms up and flexed them, showing his sire just what he had created, how powerful he had made him. \u201cAnd this is only the beginning, David. Together, we will make me truly unstoppable. The entire world will bow at my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no doubt, Greggory. Most of the world will bow,\u201d the drake said smoothly and pushed off of the bulging wolf. The dragon smiled coyly. Greg watched as David\u2019s eyes began to glow a light blue, a similar light emanated from his hands. \u201cHowever, I will not. David never showed you his true power, did he?\u201d the dream-dragon said smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the drake\u2019s glowing hand so much as brushed against the wolf\u2019s fur, a powerful shock was sent throughout Greg\u2019s body. It wasn\u2019t painful, but he could feel his skin begin to crawl; it was pure desire. The wolf\u2019s length began to grow erect as his lust was sent into overdrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was just a taste, Greggory. This is what David feels constantly.\u201d The drake\u2019s snout curled into disgusted frown. \u201cBut, unfortunately, he somehow hasn\u2019t succumbed to it yet.\u201d He smirked as the wolf fell down onto his knees, the pleasure building was too great for Greg. \u201cYou on the other hand, you cave so easily. You\u2019re weak.\u201d The dragon knelt and massaged the wolf\u2019s chest, sending another wave of pleasure up the wolf\u2019s spine. He leaned in close and whispered, \u201cOnly you can make yourself stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Greg\u2019s superior size and strength, David easily forced the wolf to bend down into a passionate kiss. Before they locked lips, the wolf could only whimper when he saw the glow coming from inside the dragon\u2019s mouth. Just a brush on the lips and Fang was sent over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grabbed onto David\u2019s torso and clenched his eyes shut, lost in the throes of an imaginary, yet extremely powerful release. He bucked hard, spilling untold amounts of cum onto the hellscape around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his eyes something was different. Instead of the fire and sulphur in the air, he was in a bedroom. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s happening?\u201d he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, we\u2019re having sex?\u201d came a questioning voice. The wolf looked down and was shocked. For one, he was lying atop David, but not just any David \u2013 the old David, the one before all this crazy shit started. Two, he was his old self again too. And three, the wolf had his dick up the dragon\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2026 no, Fang didn\u2019t know why, but he could feel himself blushing. What was going on? The drake below him seemed to catch onto the wolf\u2019s hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHon, you okay?\u201d David sat up and pulled himself off of Fang\u2019s member, the swollen pink shaft bobbing precariously. \u201cWe can just talk if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavey?\u201d Fang asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d the drake responded quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, it's our room?\" David said with a chuckle. \"You know, the one we've been sharing for three years now?\" The dragon leaned in to bump his snout against Fang's. The wolf melted at the gesture, absently moving his head to graze against the dragon's. He never felt something so amazing, so tender. He was in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could this be? The wolf asked for his love to be taken away. He wanted to be heartless. Heartless so that when he hurt David, he wouldn't feel it. Before he completely succumbed to his destiny, he had tried to kill the gentle soul that was staring right at him. He knew that if he got rid of David, he would never have to give into temptation of wanting to grow again. Just look where that temptation got him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this... this felt so real. He brushed a paw against David's cheek and the drake caught it, holding the hand close to him. This felt so perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll get a raincheck then, huh?\" David said, kissing the wolf on the cheek before putting on a pair of boxers and opening the door to leave. \"I'll make us some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" the wolf muttered softly. The more he thought about it, the more he liked this. The memories that were flooding his head. This Fang had no regrets, no hardships that he had to overcome without a great boyfriend beside him. He didn't have to feel guilty about anything. And while he did enjoy getting bigger, working his body to get as ripped as possible, he had something else more important in his life: David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf found his own pair of boxers and followed the drake out and down the stairs. When he got to the living room, something caught his eye. Sitting on the couch was quite possibly the largest dragon in the world. Tyler's immense eight and a half feet of sheer bulk took up nearly half the couch by itself. In his lap he was nursing what looked like a passed out white fox with pink hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler?!\" Fang blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" the purple behemoth hissed. \"She's still sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way the two looked so happy together, it made Fang's heart sink. After what he did to them. He silently prayed that wherever they were now, that they were okay. But that was in a different universe; in this one, Fang's hands were clean - well, cleaner. He could have a second chance here. He could live the life he always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang could get used to this. His old body, his handsome features back, his new boyfriend; heck he didn't even care that Tiny Ty was now Titanic Ty. In fact, he almost loved Tyler, almost like a brother in this universe. Something he could never have in his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf walked up to David who was heating up a pan to fry some eggs. From behind, he wrapped his arms around the drake's torso, eliciting a silly giggle from the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop that!\" the drake said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" the wolf replied, resting his head on the dragon's shoulder. \"I love you, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon turned his head towards the wolf, a wicked smile on his face, his eyes glowing a bright blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf woke with a startle. He was bigger, oh so much bigger. He had a third on David before, now David was a third of this massive wolf's height. He felt so heavy, his bulk almost a burden now. His breathing was laboured from his recent growth. Not only did he grow, but he had changed even more; the protrusions had become more prominent, his face barely recognizable as his and his tail had become whip-like. He was truly monstrous now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream was so vivid, but the wolf knew it could never have happened in real life. He was a god now. And as a god, he was going to take what he wanted.e David was looking up at him in fear. Consumed with lust, the wolf noted that David's shaft was still lodged inside his ass. Without another thought, the wolf began to move up and down over the member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" he moaned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greg sneered at his own words. He almost felt embarrassed that he still held onto such sentiments. He was a god now, what would it take to ditch the last vestige of his former life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth shook with each thrust of the wolf\u2019s pelvis. Behind them, the wolf\u2019s feet dug into the ground, tearing up rows of houses as he tensed his muscles. David didn\u2019t fill him anywhere near as much as he had earlier, but it was still enough for him to enjoy himself. And  there were no complaints coming from underneath him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg crashed his weight down on the poor drake with reckless abandon. But if David was in pain, he was remarkably impervious to it. The drake clenched his teeth as he bucked into the wolf, his eager body betraying his apprehensive face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled down on David wickedly. He licked his lips, revealing the mouthful of overgrown daggers that sprung from his gums. This was a perfect system. Fang desired more power, and David desired to give it to him. And there wasn\u2019t anything in the world that could stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long before David was roaring again, his small blue hands roughly clasping the wolf\u2019s hips as he spilled fresh seed into them. Greg laughed as he felt the buzz grow within him. He had gotten what he wanted. Now it was Fang\u2019s turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snarled behind his face guard. Inside, he was completely calm; a fortress focused with grim determination. Outside, the world was electric. The home crowd was shouting on the edges of their seats as the teams faced off. The wolf\u2019s eyes flickered to the clock. There was still time. Time for this one play. He knew that everyone was well versed and prepared for this. They were down, but there was no way they would lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang took position behind David. The wolf growled as he eyed the scrimmage. \u201cBlack Nine!\u201d He shouted. \u201cBlack Nine Hut!\u201d The drake snapped the ball, and the formations collided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang skipped a few steps backwards as he watched the field unfold in front of him. From his peripheral, he saw Tyler take out their outside line backer, the hulking rhino dropping into the turf as if hit by a train. On cue, the gigantic purple drake followed up as he stepped to the side, screening for the incoming wide receiver. Marcus wove deftly around the drake, and Fang threw his arm back to make the pass as he felt himself get tackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second, Fang feared that the contact had pushed his throw too wide, but the kangaroo stretched out a single hand and plucked it from the air, completing the pass without breaking stride. Marcus bulked in the next step, dodging a diving defender. With an explosive burst of acceleration, he was in full flight again the next moment, charging directly towards the end zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang could only stare intently as the defender\u2019s safety cut across the field to intercept the roo as he pressed against the sideline. Marcus was fast, but not as fast as the cheetah that ran at him. Anyone else on the team would have been dragged over the line, but the kangaroo was a college hero for a reason. With the incredible flair that typified Marcus, he jumped into the cheetah\u2019s tackle, his powerful legs launching him into the air. With an outstretched hand, he half-fended, half-pushed off the cheetah, and with an in-air cartwheel that looked more at home in a parkour showreel than a football field, flipped himself over the last defender and landed on the ground running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd exploded onto their feet before the roo ran through the goal line. Fang did likewise, jumping high into David\u2019s arms as they shouted in jubilation, the adrenalin charging though him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a phenomenal team, unstoppable. It seemed like the whole country was talking about the no-name college with the invincible team. And as good as it was, Fang knew that the future only held even bigger things for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed in exuberance as he put the wolf in his arms down. \u201cFor a moment there they had me wondering!\u201d He laughed as he took off his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf removed his own. \u201cIt was never in doubt.\u201d He smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed, and patted the Fang on the back. He leant in close and planted a quick peck on the lips. They looked at each other, and for a moment the elation of the crowd and team faded into the background. David tittered as he placed his hand on Fang\u2019s shoulder to turn the wolf around. \u201cLook around, Fang.\u201d He said as they drank the atmosphere in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stadium was full, and bigger than ever. The college had recently built a new stand that ran down the far length of the field to house the throngs of people who came to see them. The crowd was literally jumping, throwing everything they could into the air. On the field, Tyler was chest-bumping several of his teammates at once and coming off better. Marcus was buried underneath a pile of players that was only growing as the bench streamed onto the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very stylised, isn\u2019t it?\u201d David mused as he held the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Fang roared triumphantly. it took him a moment to realise he had no idea what the drake was talking about \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked with a bemused chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at the wolf with a wry smile. \u201cAll of this. It\u2019s a bit overdone, isn\u2019t it? Things could never be like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s smile slowly faded. Deep down he knew that this wasn\u2019t real, but he didn't want to face it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome of this is just impossible.\u201d The drake continued. \u201cI mean, Tyler could never have gotten this big, no matter what. And they couldn't build extra grandstands mid-season. And don\u2019t get me started on that illegal move Marcus just got away with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s face dropped as he sighed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just a stupid dream, isn\u2019t it. But some of this was possible. The important bit. Us.\u201d His voice was soft, but still managed to carry over the noise. \u201cYou trad a path untraveled, Fang. You aren\u2019t welcome here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stadium suddenly went silent, the roar of the crowd nothing but a fading echo. Fang looked around in alarm. Tyler stood in front of him, the massive purple drake holding his helmet under his armpit as he stared back stolidly. Everyone on the field was doing the same thing, the away team looking up at him impassively from the ground, their anguish faded. Fang\u2019s eyes flickered to the crowd, where thousands of people stood staring at him, their pose still and faces dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf breathed rapidly as he started to panic. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Fang?\u201d David growled behind him. Fang spun around, his eyes widening further at regular-sized version of the drake-god David had become. \u201cYou wanted power. Now you have more than you could have dreamed of. You could crush this stadium and everyone in it, if you so desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang took a step back as he shook his head helplessly. \u201cDavid, no\u2026\u201d he pleaded as a sickness rose in his stomach. He didn\u2019t care that it wasn\u2019t real. He was happier than he had ever hoped to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the drake god shook his head. \u201cYou chose power, and now you have it. So how are you going to use it? What have you been building it all up for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang fought back tears as his mouth quivered. \u201cNothing!\u201c He shouted desperately. \u201cI want this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid chuckled, his throes deep and slow. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn back time, Fang. No matter how powerful you become, this will never be your destiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang sunk his shoulders. \u201cThen I\u2019ll always be powerless.\u201d He whined, his voice breaking as he struggled to get through the sentence without sobbing. It was a brutal epiphany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake\u2019s eyes flashed blue. \u201cOnly you can make yourself stronger.\u201d He said as he took a step towards the wolf, the colours in the world around them fading. \u201cYou are my most magnificent creation, Fang. But I can\u2019t claim all the credit. I merely provided the means. You did this to yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Fang felt when he woke was the earth pressing against the side of his face. His eyes fluttered open, his vision taking a moment to focus. He was laying on top of houses, his muzzle sat over the top of several of them. He had grown out of the park, he realised.To him, then the two storied abodes that littered the terrain around him would have risen about an inch and a half off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf groggily picked himself up, his enormous paws crashing down on several more houses. The resulting tremors caused by the impact causing others to crumble in a radius. With a pained grimace, the wolf groaned as he lifted his heavy torso into the air, looking at the flattened suburb beneath him as he knelt hunched over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut simply, he felt like shit. Not physically. In fact, in spite of the sluggish movements the wolf-god was making, he had never felt so virile. He was brimming with power and energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut emotionally, he was sick to his stomach. The dream was not evanescent; the images and emotions he had felt lingered vividly, weighing heavily upon him. It was a cruel immersion he had endured; a sharp reminder of everything he wanted but could never have. It left him wounded, heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf wallowed in the depths of despair, he felt the power awaken within himself again. His pain numbed as his eyes began to glow. He closed his eyes as he embraced the power. It was his blanket. His panacea. His vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf-god heaved as he felt the sickness in his stomach turn into a burning desire. The wolrd underneath him was so small, so fragile. It was completely at his mercy. But still he wanted more. He had a destiny to fulfill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snarled as he turned around\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wolf-god rose from his haunches and looked at the cityscape before him. All of history has bent before gods; it was time civilization learned what a tangible god could do. The deepness of night was slowly being swallowed by the light creeping over the horizon. It was a new day, a dawn of something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg turned to look at the blue dragon lying on the destroyed parkland; he was tiny, almost insignificant. The wolf snarled, there was an insistent chattering in his head, a nagging feeling of guilt. The goody-two-shoes was gaining ground inside the wolf\u2019s head. That dream crushed Fang\u2019s hope; yet for some odd reason, the old self was fighting. And it angered Greg; he was in control for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t the lust for power anymore, he was power. Every fibre of his being coursed with untold energy. He looked over his body; unable to see past the swell of his chest. He was simply too massive now, his own body competing for space on his frame. But it all felt so good. Greg felt his length begin to fill with his blood. It\u2019s been so long since he had pleasured himself, just for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg brought a gargantuan hand down and began to rub his shaft. With the other hand he cupped the bottom titanic chest, massaging his nipple. The feeling was exquisite, his length sending a large dollop of pre out of his shaft. He loved how his arms and chest were fighting for space as he began to masturbate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind reeled to all the times he masturbated to the image of David. The athletic ripped drake always left his shower stall open for everyone to see. Ever since high school, Fang would sneak glances at David\u2019s body. He memorized every curve, every rough feature on the rugged dragon. Sometimes he\u2019d cum three or four times a night just thinking of being together with David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Greg was shooting, the long powerful blasts of his spunk rocketing into the suburban neighbourhood. The feeling was so powerful, the white noise echoing static in his mind. He didn\u2019t have to feel the shame Fang kept trying to bring into his new life. Even his own lust for power was curbed; nothing but the next intense burst of cum spilling from his cock mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished, he looked at the destruction he caused. A wry smile forming on his face as he marvelled at his handiwork; he coated everything within a mile radius. He licked his lips, he wanted more. More size, more power, more sex. He glanced at David, the drake still passed out from cumming twice into the new and improved wolf-god and nearly being crushed by it. The dragon could barely pleasure him now, he was much too small. He smirked at David\u2019s unconscious body. \u201cGrow for me, David. It\u2019s going to take a lot more dragon to stop me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention back to the city. He had a world to conquer after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became clearly obvious as the wolf neared closer to the heart of the city that he was remarkably bigger than any building there. The skyscrapers, monsters of metal and glass, only came up to his waist. He couldn\u2019t help but smile. Everything was so fragile. He stomped hard and the nearby buildings crumbled from the shockwaves. His foot cracked the pavement. He could feel a small shifting underneath him; he looked down to see water spilling out onto the streets, his foot penetrating into the city\u2019s sewage and subway infrastructure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this power, it was too much. He could feel his member begin to become rigid again. As he felt himself up, a devious idea was birthed in his twisted mind. He came across a towering office building, the face of the building just wide enough to \u2018accommodate\u2019 the wolf. His tongue lolled out of his mouth as he knelt down and poised his shaft straight at the building. With one fluid motion, he pushed his dick down and forward into the building. It was glorious, he could feel the steel bending against his shaft, the shattering glass buffeting off the impenetrable yet sensitive skin. He could feel his dick pushing out the other side of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg closed his eyes. He remembered all those chicks he used to bring home, how he\u2019d fuck all their brains out. In particular, the one time where he scored with a pair of hot foreign exchange girls. He fucked one girl into submission, forcing her to suck him off and fondle his balls afterwards as he prepared to take her sister. He\u2019d sloppily make out with the bitch as he fingered her and finally push her sister off as he forced his way into her vagina. That was a fond memory indeed, and it only made the wolf want to cum through this building all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his favourite moment was the first time he took David\u2019s ass. The drake was so apprehensive, neither of the two having any experience with a guy before. They kissed passionately, fighting each other in a race to get the other\u2019s clothes off. He remembered the way David screamed his name as he came-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf-god opened his eyes. That wasn\u2019t a real memory; he cursed at the lingering effects of the dream. But the image of David grabbing tightly onto the sheets as the wolf forced a pillow into his mouth to stop him from waking up his parents with a loud howl; it was enough to send Greg over the edge. He came again, sending his seed into the streets below, covering entire blocks in his spunk. He howled into the air; he was letting the entire world know they had a new god to worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg left his shaft lodged into the building he had just fucked and panted hard. As he did so, he could see a familiar flash of black come into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler deftly landed on the remains of the skyscraper\u2019s roof, perching himself on top of the destroyed building. In the soft awakening light, Tyler\u2019s black scales glimmered with a rich purple accent. As he looked up at the wolf, he snarled. \u201cGreg,\u201d the dragon rumbled, his brow furrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, Tyler,\u201d the wolf replied condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this? You already failed your mission; you spared me and Jessica,\u201d Tyler growled, a hint of purple sparking from his clenched teeth. Though Tyler was putting up a good front, he knew he couldn't take on Greg, especially since he was still injured from their last encounter. But he had to stall, he had to let his friends get as far away as possible; he had to make sure Marcus, Alli, even Ryan, but especially Jess were okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf-god chortled, \u201cI assure you Tyler, the generosity I showed you \u2013 that Fang showed you \u2013 that\u2019s all gone now. Besides, you\u2019re no longer a threat. You\u2019re just another being to worship me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gods looked at each other, staring into one another\u2019s eyes. One with a burning anger and the other with cool confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you, Tyler. All grown up from being the little dweeb David dragged around because you were his brother. You\u2019re a sponge, always were, always have been.\u201d Greg\u2019s mouth twisted into a smile. Tyler was pathetic. Ever since he first met him, he disliked the kid; he couldn\u2019t defend himself, could never go anywhere without having his brother to protect him from the bigger kids. Tyler was everything Fang hated; weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he remembered. He remembered teaching the little guy how to throw a ball, how to catch. When they hit puberty, he taught Tyler how to lift. If he thought he exploded with mass, then Tyler was something else; the kid was huge. In a ways, David was his boyfriend and Tyler was his best friend-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg snarled, those weren\u2019t his memories; his head was fucked up from the latest dream. He assured himself it would go away, that this gnawing feeling growing in his stomach would eventually turn into pure desire again. But the fa\u00e7ade was waning, he could feel that burning desire begin to fade a little, like something was trying to claw its way out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe focused on the drake in front of him. Tyler had to resume flight as the building began to crumble. What shocked the wolf was that Tyler\u2019s eyes were darting\u2026 wherever his eyes were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang?\u201d the black dragon said softly, almost wincing from the pain; he couldn't keep this up for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kid was his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the guy he passed the mantle of team captain to when he graduated from high school. He was the friend who helped him through the low times when he and David fought; the chauffeur when Fang and David were too piss-drunk at the bar; the patient-type as he drove to drunkards making out in the back of his truck. Tyler was the guy who introduced him to all the nerdy stuff they\u2019d play when Jess came over. He had a particular fondness for 4.0, if only to irk his bud. And-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that was real. The wolf snarled to himself. But why couldn\u2019t he get it out of his head? How did he know things he wasn\u2019t supposed to know? He began to panic, his resolve to rule waning bit by bit as his memories began to dissolve, the line between real and imagined blurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang held a massive paw to his head. He looked at the drake that was eyeing him cautiously. He didn\u2019t know what to feel; he hated, yet loved him, he was a stranger, yet so close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided: no, he couldn't show any weakness anymore, he was a god now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's eyes began to glow, almost forcefully. He looked at Tyler with contempt, or at least an attempt at it, and was about to lash out, when suddenly his pupils returned, going wide, as he stared at the drake in front of him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound was a faint rumbling that seemed to echo through the city, the reverberations obfuscating its origin. Greg noticed Tyler eye\u2019s focus on something behind him. With a confused sneer, the wolf-god turned around just in time to see several projectiles slam into his torso, exploding into a balls of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t hear the full effect of the fighter jets until they started flying past him. The jets were like a swarm of hornets as they attacked him, roaring loudly as they flew around him haphazardly in uncountable numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe missiles didn\u2019t hurt that much \u2013 there was a sharp sting whenever one exploded, but the feeling was akin to a slap rather than a wound. And with each explosion, the wolf felt a strange charge of energy course through him. Just like with Tyler\u2019s fire breath, he was absorbing the missile\u2019s energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wicked smile, Greg started to laugh. The mortals were fighting back, and it was only making him stronger. He was their God; they just needed a demonstration of his power. What better statement could the wolf make than pleasuring himself while they hit him with the best they had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg grabbed hold of his sheath as he licked his lips, coaxing his shaft back out. Tyler rolled his eyes as the wolf massaged his engorging cock. He stopped flapping his wings, and allowed himself to slowly fall. He landed onto the street below, his body battered and fatigued. He needed to hold the wolf up; if Greg simply wanted to masturbate again, then that was mission accomplished as far as he was concerned. After all, how much damage could he cause doing that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg laughed as the jets continued to circle him. He let the electricity flow through his fingertips as he massaged his shaft. He murred as he felt intense pleasure trickle up his shaft. He wondered to himself whether or not he could hit one of the jets when he ejaculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis was beyond afraid as he stared up at the mutated wolf, the sounds of a hundred fighter jets echoing through the streets.  The little otter had almost shat himself when the giant had first come into the city, but there was only so long he could maintain such an acute emotion. Instead, he felt almost numb as he stood in the middle of the congested street, the cars that haphazardly covered the bitumen long since abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his camera up at the beast, filming him as it masturbated in his direction. He stood about a quarter mile away from the monster\u2019s feet, the enormous paws almost filling the width of the street as they lay half-buried underneath the concrete. Between his toes several burst water mains spurted water high into the air. The morning sunlight seemed to mock the city as it refracted a rainbow in the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was twice as tall as the buildings around him, and so thick that his bludging thighs barley fitted between the buildings. His whip-like tail cracked into the surrounding buildings as he pleasured himself, decimating their fa\u00e7ades. The wolf was grunting and moaning as he loudly beat his length over the city, but there was a noticeable delay between the action and when the sounds finally made it down to the otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t an act of stupid valour that kept Travis rooted where he was. He simply didn\u2019t have any better ideas on how to spend his time. The streets and freeways had been clogged long before the official order to evacuate came in over the night. There was no way for him to get out, and if he had to stay in the city, he wasn\u2019t going to get stuck in one of those falling skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he continued to film as the wolf neared climax. The giant lowered his head into his neck, his brow furrowing as his vicious teeth snarled. He let lose a powerful roar as he came, his mouth opening wide as his seed began to spill into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis didn\u2019t hear the roar so much as he saw it. He watched the windows on the skyscrapers break in succession as the sound wave silently raced towards him. He lowered the camera and laid his ears back and flat as he braced for the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sonic blast from the wolf hit him like a burst of wind. His entire body felt like it spasmed as it reverberated with the low, powerful boom of the monster\u2019s voice. Most of the noise was far too low to be audible, but it held enough energy to lift the surrounding cars off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a muffled ringing in the otter\u2019s ear as he awkwardly picked himself back up. Even the unremitting sounds of the jets that passed overhead seemed distant. Looking back up at the wolf, he noticed the long, thick rope of pearly cum shooting out of the end of its red length, the wolf\u2019s hands still brutally working the shaft as he howled across the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis swallowed as his eyes followed the ropy trail that the wolf was ejecting. His heart started to pound as he realised that there was a hell of a lot of semen heading in his direction. His first instinct was to eye the abandoned cars around him, contemplating taking shelter in one. But as the tremendous load loomed down on him, travelling so fast and in such quantities, he quickly realised that a vehicle simply wasn\u2019t going to cut it. This was going to be no ordinary downpour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around in alarm. He had to run, but where? He started towards the first thing he saw \u2013 a subway station. Everyone else on the street seemed to have similar ideas, panicked and alarmed cries rose up around him as people started to flee. Travis wove himself through the maze of vehicles as deftly as he could. He was almost at the subway entrance before he pulled himself up. This was a very bad idea, he realised. If the street was about to get flooded, then being underground seemed counter-intuitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of people ran into the back of him, almost sending him falling down the narrow stairs. He awkwardly stepped aside to allow the panicked crowd to pass by him. He turned around to see the stream of cum looming close overhead, and accelerating. As the load got closer to the ground, it started to break up, revealing exactly how much of it there was. It seemed as if the whole sky was being engulfed by the falling torrent. And all the while, the wolf continued to pump even more out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, he ran towards the closest building. It looked kind of like a bank, but he didn\u2019t recognise the corporate above it. He didn\u2019t care either as he charged through the front door. Inside, there were a number of people taking refuge, their eyes wide as they stared at him and the chaos on the street in alarmed confusion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cRUN RUN RUN!\u201d Travis shouted manically at the people inside as he ran deeper into of the building. Behind him, the day seemed to darken abruptly as the cum landed in a thunderous roar that shook the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torrential fall didn\u2019t so much land on the cars as it completely crushed them, the mangled hunks of metal quickly disappearing under the sheets of white that crashed relentlessly down on them. Almost instantly, the building\u2019s windows shattered as a tide of the semen came flooding in behind the otter, sweeping up those who huddled inside before they could scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm swell knocked Travis backwards as it crashed into his feet at a tremendous speed, propelling the otter forwards. His hands quickly shot out and grabbed at the marble counter that stood embedded into the floor, the ornate furnishing standing like a rock as the white river crashed into it. Travis managed to pull himself up from the torrent and onto the counter and with laboured breaths he turned and looked behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears flattened helplessly as he saw the white swell pouring inside, rising steadily like a tsunami. He knew instantly that the counter he stood on wasn\u2019t going to be high enough; if he was going to survive, he needed to get to higher ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flickered desperately around the building, hoping to find something - anything. He spotted an \u2018exit\u2019 sign at the side of the building next to the elevator. Underneath it, a door burst inwards as the flow of semen bore into it, revealing a stairwell. That was it, he realised. If he could reach the stairs, then he would be able to climb up a level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout sparing the time to hesitate, the otter threw himself into the current below him. It was far too string to fight, but with a lot of effort from his limbs and his muscular tail, he was able to guide his general direction towards the stairwell. But to his dismay, he drifted past the door. Travis desperately lashed out and grasped the corner of the wall, fighting the current that roared against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Otter\u2019s fingers held all his life as he fought the thick torrent. Were it not for his naturally hydrodynamic body, he probably would have succumbed to its force. He felt the semen rise relentlessly higher as he pulled himself around the corner. Within moments the flow was crashing up crash up against his face. With one final breath he allowed his head to be submerged by the rising tide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely black.  He tried opening his eyes, but aside from reflexively squinting closed again, they offered nothing. This was nothing like water. No light penetrated it, he felt no buoyancy with it, and there was significantly more strength in the current as it rushed past him. His heart raced as he crawled along the wall towards the now invisible stairwell. The movement took all of his strength, and he was quickly running out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his efforts were made significantly easier as he felt himself get sucked into the stairwell as he approached it. Abruptly, his body was ripped through the opening, and a moment later he slammed hard into the stair railings. He cried out in agony as the steel balusters dug into his thigh, realising that there was air in front of him as he heard his own voice. He opened his eyes. Below him, the white liquid flowed down the stairs in a vortex, filling up the  basement levels. With a snarl, Travis slowly sidestepped up the railing, fighting the powerful flow that crashed over his back and down into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he was able to position himself away from the current, and with a flurry of movement he crawled up the staircase. Trembling, the otter finally wiped the cum from his eyes and face, his breath rapid as he tried to calm himself down. He spat out a mouthful of the foul stuff that had managed to find its way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut any relief he may have felt quickly subsided as he stared dumbly at a flow of cum that seemed to be travelling down the stars from above him. Travis looked up in confusion, his eyes trailing the thin but strengthening flow of the pearly liquid. He picked himself up and slowly rounded the stairs to investigate. Above him, the door to the first floor stood buckled inwards, jets of the thick white semen spraying into the stairwell through its corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis only had time to widen his eyes and swear as the door exploded inwards, sending a wave of the cum down on top of him. He took a breath as it crashed into him, but it was quickly knocked out agaun as it slammed him down and back into the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears compressed painfully as tonnes of the fluid bore down on him, the pressure so immense that it felt like he was being crushed. It no longer felt merely warm \u2013 the temperature of the semen at this pressure was almost searing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, the otter blindly fumbled for where he remembered the balusters being. His movements in the thick gloop  were slow and strenuous, and it took a lot of time and energy before he felt the steel raining in his hands.<br>\r\nIt was desperation that fuelled the otter as he slowly crawled up the stairwell against the current, one balustrade at a time. His lungs burned, and his muscles ached. But there simply seemed to end to the submersion. Travis started to convulse as he rounded the corner. He had held his breath for too long, his muscles were too starved of oxygen. He knew that he was going to suck in a lungful of cum involuntarily. With one final movement, he launched himself upwards and sucked in whatever was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he didn\u2019t think that he had surfaced. Thick ropes of the semen were sucked into his mouth and were the first thing to go down his throat. But he ignored his initial cough reflex, and sweet air quickly followed that into his starving lungs. Coughing and spluttering, the otter continued to drag himself the rest of the way up the stairs, collapsing in fatigue as soon as the majority of his body was on the dry stairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe weakly turned his head down over where he had just come. The semen was still flowing in from about half way up the first floor down into the basement, the roar almost deafening as it reverberated around the narrow stairwell. Looking down on it now, Travis was amazed that he had managed to defy that raging torrent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, it became apparent that the semen level wasn\u2019t getting any higher up the stairs; the cum was dispersing across the city as fast as it was being added to. Travis groaned in relief as he lay back on the stairs. For now, he was safe. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh. As a way to die, he would have described \u2018drowning in cum\u2019 as\u2026 unforeseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he stopped laughing when he remembered all the people in the building when he first ran in, and all the people on the street. None of them were with him then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a disgusted groan, he took his jacket off. Even though he was drenched in the foul substance, he didn\u2019t like the way the soggy fabric rubbed against his fur. As he looked back out of the doorway, he noticed that the cum was receding. It was difficult to tell at first, the thick pearly liquid liked to cleave to everything it touched. But gradually the level seemed to depress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the level had fallen below the first floor, the otter tenuously stepped out of the stairwell and started making his way towards the shattered windows that overlooked the street. Well, at that moment it wasn\u2019t so much a street as it was a raging white river. But once it was dispersed completely, it would be a street again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the decimated room. It was probably an office, but nothing was in place or even discernible. There was a pile of rubble and debris pressed against the back wall and lathered in a thick coat of opaque white liquid, the semen slowly trickling down onto the floor and out of the building altogether. He started to laugh again. It was an odd feeling; as shaken as he was by the whole horrific experience, it left him with a sense of elation. He had come so close to death and now he had never felt so alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis\u2019s eyes went wide as a gigantic foot filled the street outside, crashing down onto the receding flow. As he was jolted violently by the resulting tremor, he noticed that\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Travis looked at the colossal foot crashing down into the asphalt just a few yards in front of him. He looked out of the building to see it attached to an enormous dragon-like creature. The black dragon leapt into the air, the pavement cracking as it bore the impact of the monster\u2019s lift-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt flew towards the wolf\u2019s face, a dopey look plastered all across it, his shaft still bobbing lazily as it began to drool with pre. Travis couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying, it all sounded like snarls and grunts to him. Though he thought he picked up the giant wolf jeering at the smaller dragon as if taunting him by name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever they were saying, it seemed as if the two were arguing. That was fine by Travis, he could use this time to escape. He fled into the open street covered with cum and began to run in the opposite direction from the giant wolf with a dragon hovering in it\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was another burst of missile fire, guided rockets bombarding the giant mutant wolf\u2019s pelt with another barrage of explosives. A deep rumbling came from the wolf\u2019s mouth, the sound reverberating across the cityscape. To Travis, it sounded like laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too plausible as well, he looked back to see a devilish smirk on the wolf-thing\u2019s face. But the dragon in front of its maw looked livid, an angry conversation evident by its body language. That\u2019s when he heard the drake roar what sounded like, \u201cStop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the blue, or rather purple, a jet of violet flame burst from the drake\u2019s mouth. What looked like it was originally aimed at the wolf\u2019s chest, actually hit the monster\u2026 square on the shaft. The black wolf moaned and in what looked like a building collapsing, fell to its knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious to the otter that whatever the dragon was doing, it pleased the wolf immensely. The monster wolf was already stroking its hard length again, grunting wildly as it splashed the street with its pre-seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis realized that he was in the line of fire and decidedly began to back off. However, with a stroke of misfortune, the semen that still flooded the street obscured the end of the sidewalk; his foot slipped back and he lost his balance. He tried in earnest to stabilize himself, but that further complicated things. As he crashed into the ground, half his body being soaked in seed, he felt his ankle twist in just the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter let out a sharp cry in pain. He pushed himself to his feet, but when he tried to take a step, an intense pain shot up his leg. He tried his best, but was only able to hobble a couple more steps before crashing back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at the two giants. The wolf had shifted into a seated position and the dragon had crawled on top of the wolf\u2019s dick and had his head suckling the tip of the wolf\u2019s spire. Or at least that\u2019s what Travis initially though. On closer inspection he realized, the black dragon was breathing fire\u2026 right down the wolf\u2019s shaft. It didn\u2019t look like the monster-wolf minded though, if the deep rumblings that shook the ground were any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted, Travis turned around and began to crawl, intent on not having to watch two guys engaging in it as his final moment. He made his way to edge of the nearest building, laying his back against the brick wall. He was going to die and there was simply no way out this time. He almost gave up when something surprising happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter\u2019s phone rang; a familiar - and quite frankly, annoying - tune blaring through his speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I just met you,<br>\r\nAnd this is crazy,<br>\r\nBut here\u2019s my number,<br>\r\nSo call me, maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter blushed, but was glad no one else was around to hear it. He let it ring for a while longer, remembering how his ex-boyfriend chose it a couple months back for him. He didn\u2019t know what happened, but things fell apart so quickly between them. A part of him hoped he was safe, still harbouring feelings for the guy. This ring-tone may very well be the last thing he had to remember him by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Travis looked down in confusion, surprised that the thing was still working and that there was still reception in this part of town, he thought for sure the wolf or dragon would have knocked down the towers on their collective rampages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d he spoke cautiously into the mobile. He didn\u2019t have caller-ID; just fresh out of law school, he had debts to pay, so luxuries on his phone bill were kept to a minimum. He silently prayed it was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrav?\u201d came a worried voice. It wasn\u2019t him, but his hopes were up just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToby?\u201d Travis blurted incredulously. As he sat there waiting for the end, he smiled at the sound of his little brother\u2019s voice. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d he said tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m at Aunt June\u2019s,\u201d the otter on the other side said. That was good, he was already well out of town. \u201cMom and Dad are here too.\u201d Even better. There was an eerie pause between them, the only sound coming from the other end was white noise drowned out by the cacophony of lewd sounds coming from the wolf outside. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he lied. \u201cStill in town, I\u2019m almost out, don\u2019t worry \u2018bout me.\u201d He tried his hardest not to whimper as he tried to move his ankle. It\u2019d recovery, but not quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Toby sighed with relief; something Travis felt as well as his eyes began to well. \u201cDo you- do you see Tyler and Fang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, um\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of people in the crowd,\u201d Travis said cautiously, realizing that there should be honking and the shouting of desperate families trying to flee the city; not the wet squelching of the massive wolf\u2019s paws or the guttural grunts of pleasure that now surrounded him. Why would his brother be trying to find either of those two guys? Sure, Toby and Tyler were friends, and he used to bring his little brother along when he babysat the Matthews brothers ever since they were young, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not coming towards you are they?\u201d Toby said with a shrill pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, Toby?\u201d Did Tyler or Fang mean something to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d Travis groaned. He leaned back. He could feel the thumpings getting harder; the wolf was getting close. He should hang up now, save his brother from the truth of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose monsters, that wolf thing\u2026 that\u2019s Fang and the flying dragon, that\u2019s Tyler,\u201d the voice on the other end whimpered. \u201cI saw it, Trav. I was there when Tyler started growing, he was drinking something out of a pipe and he just kept growing.\u201d Toby was sobbing now. \u201cI ran before he could get up. You have to get out of there, Trav. You have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis was stunned. That huge black dragon thing was Tyler? The little kid he\u2019d buy a popsicle for when the ice cream truck would swing by the neighbourhood? And Fang\u2026 he knew the guy was supposed to be big from all the rumours, but this\u2026 The otter gathered his thoughts for a moment, resigning to his fate that he was going to drown in a swathe of Fang\u2019s cum any moment now; knowing that the little tyke he used to babysit was helping the wolf too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped back to his senses when he heard Toby\u2019s voice again. \u201cTrav?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, bud?\u201d he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust make sure you don\u2019t go west; there\u2019re reports on the news saying there\u2019s another one. It\u2019s supposed to be even bigger than the others. It\u2019s sleeping or something, they\u2019re not certain for sure. Just make it out, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis gulped. There was another one? That was even <i>bigger</i> than these guys? \u201cY-yeah, thanks for the tip,\u201d he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause on the other end, a little shuffling and what sounded like a light argument. When he heard his brother\u2019s voice again, he nearly choked. \u201cDo you want to talk to him? He\u2019s here, just gimme a sec-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud beeping noise rang in his ears. He lifted the headset from his face to see he was completely out of battery. \u201cNo!\u201d Travis yelled into the empty space. The otter\u2019s eyes went wide. His ex was alive! He had to see him again, he had to touch him just one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shot straight up and screamed in agony, his ankle hurt like hell. But he could feel the adrenaline coursing through him; he had to live, he had to. He told himself to \u2018suck it up, princess,\u2019 and hustled. And by hustle, he meant hobble. He made about another half block before he had to rest a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by then, it was too late. Another ear shattering roar ripped through the atmosphere as the wolf-thing began to cum again. In great globs, the white substance rained from the sky and flooded the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis\u2019 eyes bulged when he saw the wavefront coming. It was like one of those moments you see on television, a tsunami ripping its way inland, the deadly currents swiping through streets. He grabbed onto a nearby streetlight and braced for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like getting hit by a tidal wave. Travis\u2019 entire world went black as the milky liquid rushed by over his head. The torrent rushing by screamed into his ears. It was getting increasingly hard to hold on and he felt his grip begin to slip. With renewed determination he grasped at the lamppost tighter and hoisted himself up. He had to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrecious air rushed into his lungs when broke the surface, his senses given a momentary reprieve. This was it, he thought. The level of the flow was growing, the tide of semen only getting higher. Travis whimpered and prayed. All he wanted was one more chance to see his baby again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked up he saw:</span></div></div>",

It was a bull, who must have been fifty feet tall. A proud little smile broke across the front of the giant\u2019s muzzle as he eyed the otter in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me down!\u201d Travis cried out, punching the bull's fingers desperately as his feet flailed beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion, his smile vanishing. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d he began as his glance darted down to the torrent that roared above his ankles. \u201cYou\u2019ll drown?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill me!\u201d Travis screamed desperately, his voice shrill and uneven. \u201cPlease\u2026 please don\u2019t kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 What?!\u201d he stuttered in confusion. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Travis felt his body slip a little as the bull loosened his grip. With a shout, he stopped flailing, his hands gripping the giant\u2019s fingers. As frightening as being in the giant\u2019s hands was, below him lay death. A multi-story plunge into a rising tsunami of cum. Out of the kettle, into the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis stared into the bull\u2019s giant brown eyes, paralysed with fear. Eventually, he managed to expel a strange wavering moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull licked his lips uneasily as his gaze flashed at the titanic wolf that was cumming down the street. He turned around and carried Travis carefully down a side street, eventually placing him roughly onto a sixth story window ledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter cried out as he felt the bull\u2019s hand release him, leaving him sitting on the narrow ledge unsupported. His wet knuckles clenched the concrete edge tightly as he looked down on the raging white river below. Breathing heavily as his heart pounded in his chest, his eyes slowly worked their way back up again, steadily tracing the form of the bull that stood eye level to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you OK?\u201d the giant asked with a nervous intensity. Travis stared into the bull\u2019s wide dark eyes with an open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull swallowed nervously as the otter remained dumbstruck. His eyes darted nervously before he placed a hand on his chest. \u201cMy name is Hal.\u201d he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so big?!\u201d Travis finally managed to shout, his voice breaking. Thick ropes of cum slipped off his body in thick globes, but he didn\u2019t dare let go of the ledge to wipe them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal grimaced. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d He said, shrugging his enormous shoulders. \u201cI was lying in bed; I had just woken up, you see\u2026 and then the roof caved in on top of me. That\u2019s all I can remember.\u201d His eyes dropped, staring into nothing as he fell into a reverie. \u201cI had this strange dream, I thought I was dead. But I guess not. I woke up again like this, wearing my house like blanket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence followed between them as the bull continued to stare off into space. The ambiance was anything but silent, however. The streets echoed loudly with the roar of Fang\u2019s seed, the white liquid crashing loudly against the buildings as it spread out across the city. Somewhere unseen behind them, the wolf still cried in the throes of orgasm, his voice shaking the building Travis gripped onto. The otter shook his head as he fought to level himself in the situation. \u201cSo you just woke up big?\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal\u2019s eyes returned to the otter. \u201cYeah.\u201d He offered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis shook his head incredulously. \u201cThat\u2019s it? You have to know more than that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull looked slowly inhaled through clenched teeth. \u201cUm, well\u2026 it gets a bit blue, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019re beyond worrying about that, aren\u2019t we?\u201d the otter insisted flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull sighed. \u201cThere was this stuff\u2026.\u201d He looked down on the river of cum he was standing in, gesturing at it with his hand \u201cEverywhere.  From a rather large blue gentleman that was sleeping near my house. I assume that was what caused my roof to collapse, when it rained down. It got more than a few other houses, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis swallowed. So that would be the third monster his brother mentioned. His eyes opened wide as a thought sparked in his head. \u201cWait a minute, Blue?\u201d Travis demanded. \u201cA blue drake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal nodded. \u201cI think so. He was kind of weird looking though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDavid.\u201d The otter mumbled to himself. He tried not to think about what the drakes he used to babysit had become. What they had done to the city. \"So just to re-iterate.\" he began, \"A load of semen came crashing into your house, and the next thing you knew, you woke up huge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal simply nodded. Travis sighed. \u201cMaybe you caught a virus, or something.\u201d The otter dreaded the thought. If the third giant\u2019s semen had made Hal big, then would happen to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull shrugged.\u201cI don\u2019t feel sick, or anything.\u201d He said skeptically as he craned his neck downwards to examine his own body. \u201cIn fact, I haven\u2019t felt this energetic in decades\u2026 if ever. I\u2019ve never been built like this, either.\u201d He said as he idly traced a hand across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal\u2019s comments seemed to invite Travis to evaluate the bull\u2019s body. Not as a colossal monstrosity, but as a man. He had to admit, were the bull a tenth as tall, Travis would have considered him eye candy. The bull seemed huge everywhere. While Hal didn\u2019t compare to the muscle-bound monstrosities of nature around the corner, he had any bodybuilder\u2019s measure. From his thick budging calves to his tree trunk of a neck, the bull\u2019s form was that of unbridled strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis fell into a trance as his eyes slowly traced over the bull\u2019s body. He watched how the huge barrel chest flared with every breath. How the veins that ran up the bull\u2019s thick biceps seemed to pulse with each powerful heartbeat. How the skin flowed over his pronounced shoulder muscles; each tensing sporadically underneath even through Hal wasn\u2019t making any significant movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes stopped dead as they fell on the Hal\u2019s groin. As gigantic as the bull was, his package was still disproportionately big. A long, fat sheath ran up most of the way to his navel, the contents inside too big to be properly enclosed by the slit. Underneath swung a scrotum that hanged lower than one of the surrounding buildings stories, the thick sack of skin weighed down by two enormous churning testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please forgive my indecency.\u201d Hal interrupted, abruptly ripping the otter out of his own thoughts. The otter shut his mouth as soon as he realised that he was gaping. His eyes were wide as he felt his face flush red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hal seemed oblivious to the otter\u2019s embarrassment, and probably appreciation. On the contrary, he looked as embarrassed as Travis felt. \u201cI\u2019m in a bit of a bind right at the moment.\u201d He attempted to cup his groin into both of his hands, but the organs simply spilled out of his grip. \u201cThey're a bit of a handful. And If I was walking around like this, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to pluck you out of the street.\u201d The bull\u2019s smile turned into a nervous laugh. \u201cI hope my wife doesn\u2019t mind too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal\u2019s slight smirk seemed to hang a moment before slowly fading. \u201cShe\u2019s dead now.\u201d He said with a solemn realisation \u201cHas been for years now. But sometimes\u2026 that seems hard to remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHal\u2026\u201d Travis began tentatively. \u201c\u2026how old are you?\u201d\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal\u2019s demeanor lifted, the bull arching his back as a smile crept back up his snout. \u201cI\u2019ll be eighty four this year.\u201d He announced proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look it.\u201d The otter said distantly as he stared blankly at Hal\u2019s face. There were no signs of aging anywhere on the bull\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I don\u2019t feel it, either, truth be told.\u201d Hal scoffed as he traced a hand across his cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t remember my skin ever being this tight on me before.\u201d With a final evaluation of his body, Hal sighed and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced I\u2019m still alive.\u201d He said solemnly. He looked around the devastated city, and down at the cum at his feet, the torrent now reduced to a simple stream. \u201cBut if this is heaven, then it\u2019s\u2026 not what I was expecting. Maybe I\u2019m in hell?\u201d He asked the otter with sincere eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis would have shrugged, but he didn\u2019t dare to make such a movement on the narrow ledge. \u201cMetaphorically, maybe.\u201d He replied politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause, the bull never taking his eyes off the otter\u2019s. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d he almost pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Travis burst out in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came into the city, because I saw that large monster tearing it apart. I thought I might be able to stop it, but now I\u2019m here, I see that I\u2019m far too small. But, where else do I have to go? My house is gone, and I\u2019m too big to fit in it anyway.\u201d Hal said, almost rambling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis\u2019s mouth opened but no words came out. While he was struggling to conjure a thought to articulate, the bull added through dampening eyes \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Travis began slowly as he evaluated Hal. The bull wasn\u2019t a destructive, lustful beast like the others. He was just a normal guy, a seemingly nice one, who now found himself hopelessly out of his element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, he heard snarls and rumbling laughter from Tyler and Fang. He scowled as he heard the wolf moan again, the sounds of his lustful gratifications echoing through the streets. His attention returned to Hal, and he eyed the enormous horns that sprouted from the bull\u2019s head. They seemed just the right size to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put me on your head, and then we can\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why don't you put me on your head and then we can get the hell out of here,\" Travis said. He looked at the giant bull's face, gauging for a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal brought an incredibly thick arm behind his head and chuckled heartily. \"Yeah, I guess we shouldn't stay too close,\" he chortled. The bull looked around the corner and watched as a jet of semen arced out of the wolf's jutting erection again, the tide of semen beginning to rise again as the monster got to work spilling another fresh load onto the streets. Hal couldn't help but get a bit randy from the sight of it, wondering if he was even a fraction as virile as that wolf was. It had been ages since he'd had enjoyed orgasm, let alone get an erection. Although, for an older gentleman, sporting wood was one of the least appropriate things for a man his age. But he sure didn't feel that anymore. The bull snapped himself out of his daze, letting out a snort as he locked gazes with the otter when he looked back. \"Sorry, dazed off a bit. Let's get going, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal cupped his hands and brought them underneath Travis. He smiled gently and said, \"Hop on.\" Travis could only stare wide-eyed and slack-jawed as he watched the impressive chest before him moving, as the bull inadvertently flexed his arms just to bring them in front of his own chest. Travis would never admit it, but he had a thing for big guys. The feeling of a big man next to him, he felt protected - safe. And that's what Hal made him feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Travis did just that, he hopped on. As soon as he did, he looked up to see Hal giving him a warm smirk. Travis also couldn't bring himself to believe that such a good looking guy was almost three times his age. The otter looked away in embarrassment; he couldn't believe he was falling for a guy that was old enough to be his grandfather, or the fact that he was a widower, a man that was married to a woman no less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull placed Travis on top of his head, the otter holding onto Hal's horns tightly as the bull bellowed, \"All set up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks Hal,\" Travis said with a blush. Even the guy's deep voice was a major turn on; he was thankful the bull didn't have eyes on the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh... where to?\" Hal asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you could take us north? I've got family waiting for me in Milton,\" Travis replied. 'And an ex-boyfriend,' he thought to himself. He forced himself to think of Hal as just a friend, not a potential suitor; after all, his heart was reserved for one guy only. Or at least should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Travis. Aren't a lot of people heading north? I don't think people would appreciate a giant bull stampeding into their ranks,\" Hal said with a playful chuckle, but with a hint of sadness. Even though he'd been given a second chance, given all the strength and virility of youth, he was alone in this world now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go through the woods,\" the otter offered weakly. \"Please, Hal?\" he added softly, almost pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem, little guy,\" Hal said with resignation. He began to walk in the opposite direction of the giant wolf that was still cumming loudly in the background. As he walked further and further, he felt the level of the semen go down until it was just a thin coating on the pavement. The scenery was dreadful, but he kept trekking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them didn't talk until Travis tried engaging Hal in a conversation. \"So, Hal, you have any kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull chuckled. \"I wouldn't call them kids anymore. They're older than you, young man! Two daughters; look just like their mother. Just as beautiful.\" The bull paused for a moment before continuing. \"One's got kids almost your age, still in school, but bright kids. Other one, she's a trouble-maker, still won't settle down with a man. How about you, Travis? You're a strapping young lad, ever thought of starting a family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thought of it,\" Travis said without thinking. He thought of all the times he'd tried to talk his ex into a future of them with kids, a pair of little hands reaching out for daddy. \"I mean, I used to talk to my boyfriend all about it-\" Travis caught himself outing himself to the bull. Hal was an old-timer, Travis thought that maybe he was less accepting of his 'lifestyle.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandson's gay too,\" Hal said softly. \"It's hard isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes,\" Travis replied and then sighed. He knew entertaining thoughts of Hal as being anything more than friends was a bad idea, and these recent revelations only seemed to solidify the fact. He looked at his crotch and scowled at the slight tent in his trousers. \"Stupid penis,\" he growled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's he like?\" the bull asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ex? He's... great. We met in law school,\" Travis started and blushed profusely, reminiscing how he and Kyle met. \"Sat beside him on the first day of Torts actually. Thought he was just this big dumb jock of a lion. And it turned out I was pretty wrong. He was probably the smartest and funniest guy I've ever known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still like him, don't you?\" Hal said. Travis thought he detected a hint of sadness in Hal's voice, but quickly wrote it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I don't know anymore. He... he hurt me pretty badly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to talk about it, Travis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis nodded, though he knew Hal couldn't see it. He turned around and gulped; Fang wasn't lying amongst the city streets anymore. \"Hal? I think you better see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's latest orgasm was just as powerful as the last two. To say Tyler was exhausted was an understatement. If he had to breathe fire one more time, he thought he might have to hack up a lung. The black drake collapsed onto the wolf's chest, looking like nothing more that a small stuffed animal on the giant's pec. For Tyler, this was it, he couldn't stall Fang, or Greg, or whatever the guy was calling himself these days, anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the dragon's surprise, the wolf brought a hand to wrap around Tyler's body. 'So this is how it ends?' Tyler thought to himself. However, to his even greater surprise, the grip was gentle and Fang brought the drake to his mouth. 'Oh God, he's going to eat me.' However, Fang surprised him again, giving Tyler's face a playful lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredulously, Tyler looked up to see the wolf's happy, almost puppy-like smile. He looked down to see the still twitching spire and the wolf's whip-like tail wagging happily along the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" the wolf asked innocently, his tongue lolling out as he panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" Tyler groaned. He couldn't believe that's all Fang could think about now, just wantonly masturbating and having sex. Tyler didn't want to admit it, but it was actually pretty fun getting the wolf off and watching him cum. But something here was wrong, it was as if Fang's mind was addled by sex, as if that was all he cared about now. Tyler tried to pull himself out of Fang's grip, but failed. \"Ugh, what about David, I thought you loved my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snorted. \"Who cares? I'm done with him, Tyler. Every time we get close, there's too much emotional bullshit going on between us. But you? You made me realize how much fun sex for the sake of sex is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying,\" Tyler growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I am?\" the wolf snarled back. \"I gave up already, Tyler. Me and David? We can't ever have regular sex again. I just want someone to wake up next to, who's my size, who I can bone and get boned by, who I can suck and get sucked by... And you're all there's left, Tyler. You're not David, but you're close enough.\" The wolf thought back to his dream, how he and David shared a bed with each other, how they could have sex with each other without all this crazy growth crap. That's all Fang wanted and he was going to get it as close as possible to his dream, no matter how empty or hollow the facsimile was. Tyler was good enough, he was a dragon, built like a tank, he could pass off as David. As Fang's thoughts reeled he began to giggle maniacally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're insane,\" Tyler spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, you know it!\" Fang cackled. \"When you have that dream, Tyler, you'll want it too. You'll need it, crave it. When he shows what a perfect life could be like! I'm gonna make us both huge. And then? I'm gonna fuck you, and you're gonna fuck me like we're boyfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrank inside the wolf's clutch. What was he talking about? What dream? The David-god thing? That wasn't exactly a desirably dream... Unless there's something more to it, he knew David probably had to have grown too to make Fang this big. Could this 'dream' be a manifestation of David's god-like power? Just like Fang's electricity and his own fire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn't have time to think it over anymore, the wolf stood up and carried Tyler with him. At the wolf's full height, Tyler could see just about the entire city. And that's when he looked east to see the form of his brother lying there. David was simply titanic, easily a mile tall and outrageously thick. Even at a distance he could see the changes in David's form. His scales were a deep luxurious blue with the tip gilded in gold. His horns grew out, looking even more like a regal crown. Around his neck golden hairs formed a mane. There was no doubt that David was the king of the gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler admired the sheer radiance and presence his brother's body now possessed, just a pang of jealousy shooting through his system. But that's when he noticed...</span></div></div>",

Hell he did stole some seeds from his own brother to grow to begin with even when David forbidden him to. And now here he was the smallest of the 3 giants in the city and he could only hope his brother find what he wants in the power he was about to give himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid roared loudly and all the city panicked knowing it could only mean one thing someone was about to grow even Gregory stopped a few second holding tyler and what he saw made him fear the worst.<br>\r\nNormally David would not be able to handle the pressure his seeds would drip like rain on top of the surrounding buildings but yet nothing came out of the godly dragon being except loud gulping sound and the classic bone creaking muscle growing godlike sound David seeds creates when powering the body that consumed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Inside David's dream* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell well well wo decided to come back for more ?

If you would have been me you would have known I loved Fang and you've taken him away from us! Who are you and why did you did this to me? Out of all the jocks in the world you chose my seeds heck my balls to grow us into beings that cannot live normally anymore! You've ruined our lives and you tease us with vision of a perfect live!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause you wanted this above all thing and you we're able to grow people from your seeds as long as you hitted puberty dave heck you never wondered why Tyler was so small compared to us? You jacked off in the shower some drips came in your mouth you swallowed and boom David the football player was born!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply assumed you were that big just because nature made you this way? As of Fang you kept lying to us and when he wanted more power to please you you gave him with no regrets but it came with the price that he transformed us into the king of all gods and he lost his love for you simply so that he shall never be hurt by harsh feeling ever again. So we did what we wanted and it translate to turning Fang into our cum dump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00b4David you are outdoing yourself' said a smirking Gregory as he watched the dragon glowing golden every seconds that a loud gulp that shook the ground echoed into his own massive goodness.

Just one big grasp of air would turn them into crazy humping machine and with the size that the king of god gained from his downstair area would turn any horse jealous since David was almost immobile  his balls taking way too much place between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world seemed to get darker by the second for Tyler as he look his own brother ascending <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang's eyes widen as he finally noticed the behemoth that David had become. The dragon was easily four times his size and built so immensely that he looked nearly swallowed by muscle. His rich blue scales creaked with the strain of holding his size every time the colossus moved, and his back and chest was so thick his head looked undersized, armored by it. Worse yet, the dragon's cock rested in the valley between those all-encompassing pecs, as thick as his waist at the base. His balls rested on top of thighs bigger than a cluster of skyscrapers, far too large to fit between them, nearly coating the dragon-god's knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's good sense went right out of the window as soon as he realized what that meant. David was capable of bringing him through his next stage of godhood. More than capable. And now, while the titan was unconscious, would be his best chance to do it. He would merely have to chase off the parasite sucking David off first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello, David,\" the wolf rumbled. The skyscrapers all around him trembled with the bass of his voice. \"Looks like you've got quite the present for me.\" He dropped the pipsqueak in his paw and plowed through the buildings that hadn't had the good sense to collapse yet, stomping his way with ease back towards the remains of the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler slammed into a building before he could unfurl his wings and catch some air, the downbeat of his mammoth wings crushing several other buildings and blasting rubble through the streets for nearly a mile. He couldn't believe what he had just seen, much less what Fang...or Greg, whatever...was doing in response. Could he really be that power-hungry that he forgot everything he had just told the dragon? Despite everything, Tyler felt the pang of rejection and a hint of jealousy for his brother. Even now, when he was an impossible 300 feet tall and built like a tank, he was still being overshadowed by his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew up towards Greg's face now, trying to intercept the wolf-god somehow before he got to his destination. He prayed that it would be only a matter of time before David woke up and sorted all of this out, though he doubted that's what would happen. Things had gotten so far out of control now, it was hard to imagine how any of this would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg, you can't be serious.\" Tyler easily dodged the wolf's half-hearted swats, even though he was so tired he could drop right out of the air. \"After all you told me about too much emotional bullshit and everything, you're going right back to David? I thought you were done with him. I thought you were going to settle for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed at the dragon, giving him the briefest of glances before he refocused on the mountain-sized bulk of David in the distance. \"I was, until I found out that I didn't have to. Once David gives me a top-off, I'll have more than enough power to make him whatever I want. I'll be an unstoppable God, and he will be my High Priest and chief worshipper, first among millions.\" Greg's eyes had glazed over at the fantasy, and his shaft was engorging again, lowering to the ground with its weight and bobbing in front of him with his pulse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There won't BE millions if this keeps up!\" Tyler flapped around Greg's head and chest, trying to block his view of the behemoth. \"If we keep growing like this, there's not going to be anyone left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smirked at that, then casually caught Tyler's leg in a lazy slam. For the much smaller dragon, it was like being hit with a building. He pinwheeled down to the ground, unable to catch himself in time before he slammed through the suburbs. He skidded for several blocks, destroying several dozen homes utterly before he stopped with a groan. The wolf admired his handiwork, the power he displayed in such a small act more than enough to get him hard and dripping again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me,\" he rumbled. \"This rock is getting to be too small for me anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"> *    *    *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus didn't remember anything between the fight and waking up in the hospital with the alarms going off. He had just enough time to hear the alarms going off and realize he was stuck in bed before a tidal wave of cum crashed through his window on the third floor and filled up his room immediately. He was lost in the current of it, felt his bed slam into the wall as it was pulverised by the wave. It got everywhere, in his ears, his nose, his lungs as he swallowed great big mouthfuls of it. He didn't realize how familiar it tasted at the time, or that his injuries were healing rapidly every time he swallowed. He just thought he was drowning, that this was a very strange way to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flood receded by the time he was washed several blocks away. He groaned as he lifted himself to his feet, the remains of his hospital gown and many casts falling away as he did. The entire world was coated in the same thick, sticky white. When he got his bearings and finally understood what was happening, he started laughing out loud. He looked over the horizon, towards the University, and his suspicions were proven correct. David was towering over the trees even while he was lying down, muscle surging around his head. He was growing horns and a mane, and every grunt he uttered shook the world around him. It looked like the behemoth was still growing, impossibly huge and incredibly muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo remembered suddenly who put him in the hospital and why. He didn't need to think very long about what must have happened at this point. Things had gone crazy. Chances are, Fang was still out there, bigger than David, wreaking some kind of havoc. And he would take so much pleasure in being the one who stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifteen-foot marsupial hopped towards David, feeling strength surge in his massive legs. He stopped every so often to sample more of the behemoth's seed, whirring at the way he felt when he grew even bigger. It didn't take long at all to reach the mega-dragon, and by the time he did he had more than doubled in size to forty feet tall. But that would just be the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus climbed the colossus and got to work. He made David orgasm three more times while he was sleeping. It was so easy -- all he had to do was touch the dragon's cock and rub for a few moments, and he went off again. The first blast nearly carried him away before he grew big enough to handle the volume, and with this third one he was growing just big enough to slip his mouth over the impossibly wide shaft. He drank as much as he could, but thousands of tons of it were spilling past his lips and onto the ruined ground below. What a waste, the kangaroo thought, before swallowing again. It would be nice to be able to take everything without missing a drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea how big he truly was, but measuring himself against the titanic dragon and the ruined trees nearby was good enough to give him an estimate of 500 feet. The godly stud's seed had gotten to be incredibly potent at this point; a little bit went a long way, especially the bigger you got. He rumbled as the flood trickled to a stop once more, his massive paws clenching David's underchannel as he prepared to jack him off one more time. He squeezed and felt those balls clench up again. He stroked and heard the great dragon's grunt, a boom of power that shook the world for miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing? That's my cock!\" The voice that thundered over Marcus was deeper and more powerful than he would have guessed, and an ominous shadow loomed over him. He turned around and his ears folded automatically. Fang had arrived, and he wasn't big enough yet to fight him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf had gone through changes of his own. He was well over a thousand feet tall -- more like 1250 feet or so -- and several hundred feet wide. He had grown a pair of immense horns that circled around his ears like a ram's, only making him look more powerful, almost demonic. His tail had lengthened and thinned, a barb peeking out from the soft brush of fur that had been kept. His face was a malevolent snarl, arcs of electricity shooting from glowing neon-blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was about to say something, when the mountainous dragon shuddered and both the wolf and kangaroo heard a distant roar. They realized what that meant, and both leapt for the dragon's tip!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The massive, yet still normal-ish looking kangaroo dove at the tip. David was so close, he had to get there first. Despite Fang being over twice his size, the kangaroo still had the wolf beat in one department; pure unadulterated leg strength. Using his powerful legs, the marsupial leaped with great force, pressing almost painfully into David's groin as he propelled himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Greg dove at the tip of David's epic cockhead blindly. He was still mid air when he realized that the kangaroo had already made it there and had one very muscular, very powerful leg poised to kick Fang right in the face. The next thing he remembered was seeing stars as he momentarily blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus had a look of satisfaction on his face, smug realization that if he could kick the crap out of Fang at this size, when he became this wolf's god, he would truly be unstoppable. He looked back at David. David... The guy he'd been pining over for the past seven years, ever since they met as freshmen in high school. The same guy who he had finally had the courage to do something with in a drunken stupor. The same guy who rejected him outright after his first growth. The same guy who he fought to protect from Fang. It dawned on Marcus that if David could do this to himself, then why hadn't he stopped Fang already. He realized they were in on this together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was tired. Tired of always getting looked over. He had the crush on David, he was the one to stand up for him. And HE chose Fang. With renewed vigour, the kangaroo stroked at David's shaft. \"Give it to me,\" he snarled at this dragon-god. \"I'll be your god too, then you'll finally recognize me, David.\" It wasn't long before a loud bellow shook the earth and the giant dragon began to cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was ready, the kangaroo planted his mouth over the everflowing stream that was David's latest orgasm. He wanted it all. He screamed to himself in his head, \"Give it all to me, David!\" He was ready. Ready to become a god. The world around the roo began to swirl, the colours coalescing into a vivid tornado of light. He giggled, the feeling so indescribably pleasant. In the middle of his revelry, the dreamscape suddenly shifted, to a vision of fire and brimstone. The kangaroo could only smile when he saw the king sitting on his throne. He bowed slowly to the David-god, the lavish drake nodding his approval of his newest acolyte. However, Marcus didn't plan to be bowing to this monstrosity for very long. Soon, David would be bowing to <i>him</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe David-god seemed to realize this, raising an emotionless eyebrow at the kangaroo before grinning wickedly. In a blue haze, the landscape around Marcus shifted again, now to that of his town. What trickery was this. He walked down the street, people greeting, a couple of girls asking for an autograph. He was the star wide receiver after all, a near perfect track record, the gem of the conference. He's been bombarded by offers from scouts ever since his freshman year. It was... everything he wanted. No, not quite. He turned the street down to David's house... no, their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hon? I'm back,\" he said as he unlocked the door and stepped inside. Where'd that come from? He walked to the kitchen, seeing Tyler and Jessica on the couch cuddling in a not so family friendly manner, the huge purple drake's jeans tented to its limit. Tyler waved to him and he waved back. What was this feeling? He felt something in the pit of his stomach as he began to unbutton the first few buttons on his shirt, intent on getting a little sexy for his boyfriend. He walked up the stairs, deciding to surprise David with a view of his lean cut up abs in an entrance that one would probably find in an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ad shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he rounded the corner to the bedroom he shared with David, what he saw horrified him. On their bed was David. But Fang was there too. He watched and felt his heart breaking as he watched Fang entering David, breeding the dragon like a bitch, the drake moaning and caressing the hulking wolf as he got fucked. The drake lazily turned his head to the kangaroo in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, babe,\" the drake said, a wicked grin spreading across his face, his scales darkening, a golden mane erupting from his neck. At the same time, Fang stopped his motions and turned to look at the dumbstruck kangaroo, grinning maniacally as electricity began to arc from his eyes and fingertips, silver etching crawling along his fur. The wolf growled sultrily, \"Yeah, Marc, aren't you gonna join your boyfriends in bed?\" The wolf raised its tail, inviting Marcus to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe god-roo opened his eyes. Anger seethed through him, even in his dreams, he couldn't get David, at least not David and David alone. He spun around, his anger sated by what he saw before him. He was huge, built larger than any kangaroo before him, everything from his arms, to his chest, abs and glorious legs were freakishly overdeveloped, everything so perfect. He looked at the drake below him, he had to be over half of David's size now, at least a mile high. At that meant he was larger than Fang, stronger than Fang, better than Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg lifted himself up and snarled at what he saw. Marcus was bigger than him now, over twice as big as him. The insanity that was the wolf's mind swirled through different scenarios, cold and calculating, assessing the best way to outsmart the kangaroo before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, pipsqueak,\" Marcus rumbled, sitting up beside David's huge body, a wicked smile of his face. There was nothing Fang could do to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the little fagaroo decided to play with the big boys,\" Greg snarled back, cracking his neck to emphasize he wasn't scared. \"Looks like enjoy sucking cock, don't you? And to think I was gonna get you to suck mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus sneered at the remark, stomping his foot along the ground, sending a shockwave through the air. In one giant leap, he was kneeling in front of Fang, bending down to be on eye level with the black wolf. \"Funny,\" the kangaroo said coldly. \"Last I checked, it seems you like to suck cock just as much, Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one swift motion, the kangaroo snatched the wolf up by the waist, squeezing hard causing Fang to squirm. \"It's... Greg now,\" the wolf spat in Marcus' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't care what you call yourself, Fang,\" Marcus chuckled, pleased with the way the wolf writhed in his grip. Marcus began to cackle, this was just too good. \"Say, you sucked David's cock right? Why don't you suck on mine?\" The giant kangaroo grinned evilly, feeling his monstrous shaft begin to push out of his own sheathe. Marcus groaned as he began to work himself with one hand and play with his toy in the other while he re-positioned himself to lie down beside David. \"Suck,\" he barked, mashing Fang's face into the tip of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf obeyed, he had planned for this. As soon as the shaft was in his mouth he gave a few 'appreciative' groans as went down on Marcus. Furrowing his brow, he concentrated on bringing his lightning to his teeth. With a snarl, the wolf bit down on Marcus' shaft, simultaneously sending a wave a pain and a wave of shock up the god-sized kangaroo's length. Marcus yowled in pain, but held fast, bringing a hand down to squeeze at Fang's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of a bitch!\" the kangaroo growled. Fang began to flail in his grasp, retracting his teeth from Marcus' sensitive flesh, frozen in fear from his plan backfiring. Marcus snarled. If Fang wouldn't suck him off, then he'd just face fuck the wolf. And he did. Fang whimpered as he felt Marcus edging himself closer to the point of no return, his mouth and throat being assaulted by the roo's member than would've bobbed between Marcus' pecs if it weren't lodged in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcus came for the very first time since his epic growth from 7'6'' feet tall, he began to change, his own god-like transformation taking place. Coils of green scale-like protrusions etched their way along his arms like a constrictor, his hands entirely engulfed in the scales. Marcus' once warm eyes, eyes that were filled with his friendly demeanour became icy, his pupils narrowing into a pair of snake-like slits. He flit his forked tongue, his brain rewiring itself to sense the heat in the air. Marcus looked down at his prey, grinning widely, showing off his new fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked at what Marcus had become, watched as he mutated and thickened out like the rest of the gods did on their ascension. If he was scared he didn't show it. However, what the wolf was scared of, was what the kangaroo could do with his new-found powers, wondering id he could counter it like he could with Tyler. He didn't have to wait long, Marcus was eager to show him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly minted god pushed at the wolf, dislodging the cur from his godhood. The David-god had shown him a glimpse of his power. And he wanted more. All he wanted was more. If Tyler's vice was wrath, Fang's pride, and David's lust, then Marcus only had one above all others: envy. He wanted what they had and now, he'd take it by force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus lifted the defeated wolf to his face until their noses bumped into one another. He waited until Fang was looking at him, the wolf staring back half-lidded. Oh, he was going to enjoy this. The giant kangaroo opened his mouth, a mist of green smoke exiting his and entering Fang's. The wolf began to writhe again as he felt the kangaroo begin to rip something from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow in Fang's eyes faded, returning to their natural state.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus rumbled happily as he saw Greg's head shrouded in that green cloud, shutting his eyes and shivering against its effects. He knew that this insignificant little wolf was frightened of him now, and why shouldn't he be? He was the true god between them, the colossus dwarfing everything around them. Except, of course, the still-slumbering mountain that was David. But there would be time for that. Soon enough, he would be God of everything, and everyone would have to give him everything he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense kangaroo narrowed his eyes as he watched Greg' face change. The demonic features that had deformed it receded, and the horns and sharper teeth became less severe. Whatever he had breathed on him seemed to be seeping the power out of him, taking it and dispersing it back into the air. Marcus' heart leapt inside his chest, and his shaft instantly sprung back to life. Could he take the wolf's might, just like that? Could he really just suck out the parts of the wolf that made David choose him? He practically drooled at the thought; whatever David wanted, he could be. Whatever power the dragon desired in a man, he could take. He could be the perfect god for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shook his head and whimpered, his monstrous paws trying to pry Marcus' even more massive fingers off of him. It was to no avail, though. The wolf was shrinking in the kangaroo's grip, his features softening. The kangaroo growled at the sight of the change, but also just how slow it was. This was taking far too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed in, and it was like taking a hit of some wondrous drug. His mind lit up with the rush of power, or indomitable strength that Fang possessed. He knew instantly how the diminishing god had felt as he romped in the city, effortlessly crushing buildings around him. He knew how great it felt forcing Tyler to stimulate him until he flooded entire neighborhoods, and how even the burden of power and virility was a kind of pleasure that he was willing to take on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also knew the great pain and shame that caused him to seek out the thrill of sex and dominance. There was something in there judging what all of them did, a presence that darted through the cracks of Greg's shattered psyche, showing him that things didn't have to be the way they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus kept breathing, unable to stop himself. He wanted it all, no matter how much it hurt, no matter how confusing it was. What was he doing? Why was he doing it? Just what kind of life did he expect to have now? Thoughts crashed against each other, endless possibilities played out before him, and the power kept rising in him, pushing him to proportions no mortal should ever have. It was too much. The weight of it all, it was just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo-god's shaft throbbed and swelled, rolling like an animate building. The tip bumped his nose and leaked a river's worth of precum, soaking Marcus, Fang, and most of the ruined meadow next to the football field. Without warning, Marcus screamed, the sound shattering windows and eardrums for miles around, the shock of it felling the few buildings that still stood on the outskirts of town. He felt his body go slack, felt his grip on Fang ease, and then everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *      *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in some sort of underground cavern. From a cliff-top he watched two behemoths who all but filled the chamber fighting each other. One was a wolf-creature with horns and tremendous, glowing eyes. He was wrestling with another giant, equally impossible in size, who looked to be some unholy cross between a kangaroo and a dragon. The walls shook with their movements, and rocks fell all around him. He shuffled nervously on his perch. It didn't feel like the most stable thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy, isn't it?\" A deep voice rumbled beside him, and a massive paw covered his shoulder. Marcus jumped and looked up to see Fang standing there, as big as ever, as insanely muscled and impressive. There was something about him that made him seem smaller, though. He looked more normal, almost relatable. Fang smiled at him, a genuine expression that held no trace of arrogance or malice the way it usually did. \"All this. It's insane. What we're doing, it can't keep going on like this. We may have already pushed it too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giants seemed to be growing as they fought, their muscles surging larger as they crashed. They were in a lake of lava, enormous splashes of magma slamming into the walls all around their feet. The chamber didn't look like it would last much longer if they didn't stop expanding or slamming each other into things. The ground shook with their growls and grunts. On the other side of the chamber, seated on an enormous throne, was some sort of dark figure. He watched the proceedings with malevolent interest. He was big enough to dwarf the combatants by a factor of 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they doing? Is...is that me? Am I fighting you?\" Marcus was surprised at how frightened he felt watching this. The stone under his feet was shaking almost constantly now. He could feel the heat from the magma getting closer. \"Why are we even here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked down at him and squeezed his shoulder. His smile was regretful. \"We're here because we thought we wanted to be.\" He nodded to the titans, who seemed to be melting now. They were punching each other, leaving tremendous pieces of themselves lodged in the body of the other. \"We thought we wanted this. But...\" The wolf sighed and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus watched as the gladiators all but melted, writhing into one super-heated, sticky mass. It was chaos for a moment, and one limb the size of a building lashed out and struck his perch. He screamed and jumped backward, flattening himself against the wall. The combined creature, whatever it was, shuddered and grew, filling the chamber and then some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be hard for you, Marcus. I really don't envy what you're going to have to go through. But you have to keep fighting. This thing, it's the worst part of--\" Suddenly, Fang was gone. He was replaced with fingers the size of skyscrapers, finer features just beginning to form. There was fur, and claws, and the incalculable weight of power. The claw peeled the cliff like it was getting rid of a stray strand of fur, leaving Marcus where he was. The hand fell away with most of the ground under it, and Marcus found himself eye-to-eye with what could only be described as a demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast's eye alone was impossibly large, the pupil alone filling the area in front of the kangaroo. Its eye glowed a sickly green color, the color of radioactive materials in movies. Marcus couldn't tell just how big the beast was, but he knew it was miles upon miles of insatiable power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE.\" A voice boomed out, so deep and immense it seemed to come from everywhere at once. \"YOU WILL GIVE ME MORE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' vision was washed in green, and then he felt power incarnate tear him apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scrambled out of the way as quickly as he could once he was released from Marcus' grip, dodging the growing kangaroo's dangerous thighs. The god was so big he could watch muscle writhing underneath the fur, bulging the limb so large that it grew past the width of his shoulders, then expanded that much more. He grunted as he tried to get out of the path of the kangaroo's growth, but the behemoth was so big and his spasms were so violent it was hard to do much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know if Marcus was cumming, and it really didn't matter. He was getting bigger, and that meant he would be even more impossible to stop. He also knew that whatever corruption that had been possessing him was a part of Marcus now, and that only meant terrible things. In a way, he was glad that he was thinking more clearly than he had been in days, but this also meant he was nowhere near as powerful as he needed to be to make this madness end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looked at the still-slumbering mountain of David. The dragon was still out cold, his cock laid out over him stubbornly hard. Measuring himself up against the colossus, Fang put himself at 2000 feet tall. He was bigger than nearly every skyscraper on Earth, but he was still utterly dwarfed by these two insane deities. He sighed and started climbing David's leg. He had no idea where Tyler was, and there was no guarantee he could count on David at this point. If anyone was going to stop Marcus, it would have to be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crested the hill of the dragon's knee, and quickly sprinted up to the monstrous thigh. It felt good, this power. Muscle ground against more muscle, and his neck and shoulders were so thick that he could barely turn his head or see over the insane swell of his chest. His thighs bunched with impossible power, and his sheath and sac slammed against the top of his legs whenever he moved. Even now, when he was bigger than he could have dreamed of being, there was a small voice in the back of his head that wanted more. He hadn't achieved perfection yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfection? He stopped short, right in front of the mountainous sac that sprawled over David's upper thighs and then some. What did that even mean? When would he be perfect? When the world was too small for him to fit on, when he had destroyed the planet in his quest for power?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have long to think about it. David suddenly shuddered and the quake of sound shook the world around him. Fang leapt up to get a view of David's torso. What he saw shocked him. It was...</span></div></div>",

He held her slightly away from his body as he ran, trying to smooth out the shock of each footfall. The enormous dinosaur felt surprising light in his new arms. He was slowly getting used to the feeling of being strong and heavy. His feet hit the ground with a lot more force than he was used to, and he felt a lot less nimble as the time between steps had also increased. But in spite of this, he doubted that he had ever ran as fast in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only swallowed a couple of mouthfuls of the thick acrid liquid, preferring to down it as quickly as he could to get it over with. But he was surprised at how potent it was. What he had taken was enough to grow him a good half a foot taller than the T-rex he was carrying, and a hell of a lot wider. Why Jess had put so much in that flask was beyond him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he had literally burst through his clothes, he didn't fancy streaking in the slightest. He had invested precious seconds quickly fashioning a rough loincloth from the pieces of torn fabric he had shed. He got the impression that the dinosaur appreciated the gesture. As embarrassing as it was when he woke up, Allison had seemed\u2026 understanding with regards to his nakedness and fervent public masturbation session while he tripped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as embarrassed as he was, he was nevertheless still unmistakably randy, and the sight and touch of the topless t-rex in his hands was torturous. It was a constant battle to rip his eyes and thoughts away from her, lest his now huge member come alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during one of the quick glances he snuck at the dinosaurs smooth, curvy thighs where his gaze trailed to her injury. He had wrapped it up pretty tightly, but the blood had thoroughly soaked through the fabric. He had stemmed the blood loss at least. But he hadn\u2019t stopped the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I should have removed the glass.\u201d He said, partly to himself. At the time, he didn\u2019t realise how deep it stretched. He hoped there weren\u2019t any shards left in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you knew what you were doing.\u201d Allison said wincing, trying to sound supportive. \u201cYou\u2019re a surgeon, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan grimaced uneasily as he looked down on the dinosaur in his arms. \u201cYeah\u2026 about that.\u201d He started awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m not actually studying to be a surgeon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison turned her head up at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure if you can study that at our school. Isn\u2019t that something you do at a hospital mostly?\u201d He pondered the question as he asked it. In all those TV shows he had seen, students were usually carted around a hospital inspecting patients, and depending on the genre, hilarity ensued. Did they study in college first, or is that how they started out? He really had no idea; he wasn\u2019t a medical student. \u201cYou almost blew my cover with that chemistry question.\u201d He said with a nervous smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison\u2019s brows furrowed as she looked up at him in confusion. \u201cWhy did you say you were a surgeon?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan cleared his face of the nervous uncertainty. \u201cTyler needed to heal himself. Jess was arguing, so I had to say something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shook her head. \u201cBut you\u2026 lied?\u201d she asked incredulously. \u201cYou didn\u2019t KNOW that they would cut his legs off?!\u201d Anger was rising in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did! Doctors do not have a monopoly on human physiology!\u201d Ryan said with a scowl. He wasn\u2019t a medical student, but he still took the subject seriously. It was a big part of his life, the reason why he was such a successful swimmer. He knew far more about the subject than any laymen, he had studied it for years. In his own damned time too, not because he was made to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he quickly softened his face and tone when he remembered who he was speaking to. \u201cLook, your friend Jess? She\u2019s\u2026 got good intentions. But she didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. I don\u2019t have formal qualifications, but I still know enough to know those legs weren\u2019t going to heal. And they would have cut them off without a second thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shook her head in dismay. \u201cBut Jess went back because of you! That bear\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was going to run off!\u201d Ryan cut off defensively, his deep voice becoming shrill. \u201cI\u2019d have gone back there myself, but she charged in first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison opened her mouth, but after a moment simply looked away from the wolf with an angry grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she not been injured, Ryan guessed her words would have been a cold \u2018put me down.\u2019 The wolf's heart sank as he felt anger rise. This wasn\u2019t fair. Things had been going so well, all things considering. But he had just blown it. And for a really stupid mistake which wasn\u2019t even a mistake. He did the right thing and he\u2019d do it again. Well, unless he could come up with any better ideas a second time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued down the street in an awkward silence. Even Allison\u2019s pained noises seemed more mute as she stewed. Ryan kept up the pace, carrying both of them for miles before he started to pant through his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if he wasn\u2019t going to take anything else out of tonight, at least he had a new body to be proud of. He didn\u2019t really dream of being taller; he wasn\u2019t the kind of guy to worry about things that were out of his control. But he was glad he was. Although, his actual figure wasn\u2019t ideal. His quick, lean muscles and narrow hips were gone, replaced by a much broader, bulkier frame that really wasn\u2019t hydrodynamic. He didn\u2019t think he would be swimming any faster with his current shape and weight. In fact, he\u2019d probably struggle to keep his spot on the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scoffed quietly to himself. It was funny how sometimes things took a while to sink in. There was no college left to swim at. There would be no more meets, no more classes, no more studying. He wondered what that would mean for his graduation timeline when the street went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to a gradual stop as he looked around. It was a good time to catch his breath, anyway. Allison stirred in his hands \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d she asked startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe power\u2019s off.\u201d Ryan said absent-mindedly, stating the obvious. The street was pitch black; Streetlights, houses, traffic lights\u2026 everything was off. The only source of light was the moonless sky above and the dim orange glow of the burning suburbs behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud but distant roar broke the eerie silence as it echoed through the night, coming from seemingly everywhere. Allison whined softly in Ryan\u2019s hands. The wolf looked down on her, only then realising that she was crying, and judging by how wet her cheeks were, had been for some time. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine.\u201d He said reassuringly. The dinosaur seemed to relax a little in his hands, even though both knew it was an empty statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on.\u201d Ryan said as he started to run again, though he was forced to temper his pace in the darkness that enveloped them. \u201cWe\u2019re only a few blocks away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things stood out to Ryan when they finally turned to enter the hospital\u2019s parking lot. The first was that it was quiet. Dead quiet. The car park, like the rest of the suburb, was completely dark and devoid of anyone. Only a handful of vehicles sat near the front. The second was that while there were lights on inside, they were few and dim, only coming from a single wing. The wolf swallowed nervously; this wasn\u2019t what he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the lights were on inside as he ran up to the entrance, barely stopping himself before ploughing into the electronic doors that didn\u2019t open. Allison winced in pain at the sudden movement, but let out a sigh of relief nonetheless that she wasn\u2019t flattened between the door and the bulky wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Ryan asked in frustration as he looked at the solid red light on the sensor above the door. His gaze shifted lower to see what was happening inside. A rather fat cow waddled down the hallway in a huff. Ryan stood and watched her approach, but to his frustration the cow simply kept walking past, ignoring him completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d He called out, wishing he had a free hand to rap on the glass. The cow turned around and yelled something irritably at him, but by the time it made it through the glass to him outside, it was a barely audible muffle. \u201cWhat?!\u201d He yelled out at her. \u201cThis woman needs medical attention!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow roller her eyes and pointed to the side of the door. Ryan stared at her in confusion before realising that she was pointing to a sign. He walked up and inspected it. It was a simple note hastily hand-written with a black marker on a piece of A3 paper that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Hospital evacuation in progress. <br>\r\nAll medical emergencies divert to St. Frederic Hospital, Richmond.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sneered at the message. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking closed?!\u201d he roared incredulously. The cow offered no response as she disappeared behind a door. \"Evacuation?\" He said to himself. He imagined an evacuation to look a hell of a lot more chaotic than the dead silence surrounding them. \u201cRichmond?!\u201d He spat. That suburb was over the other side of town, he didn't even know they had a hospital. He knew there were others on this side of town, so why the hell were they going all the way out there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter anyway. It would take him all night to run across town, even if he knew where the damned hospital was. Allison needed attention now, even if only to stop the bleeding. If nothing else, at the very least he needed was some proper bandages, closed hospital or not. He looked around angrily\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David squeezed his way through the hallways and out the front door. He was immediately greeted by the imposing bulk of Fang looming over him. The giant black wolf looked enormous, each breath making his muscles heave and bulge. His paws were enormous, big enough to leave sizable prints in the ruined lawn of his house. The dragon had to peg the wolf at ten feet tall at least, if he was an inch. He was easily dwarfed by two feet, and who knows how many pounds at this point. Despite his brawn and virility, there wouldn't be much he could do against the wolf if they were to fight straight up. This would need to be a battle of strategy. Fang wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, and it wouldn't be too hard to out-think him -- especially now that he believed he had the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, Fang. What do you want?\" The dragon's stomach was tied in knots as he faced the titan-wolf. He had no idea what he could do to stall him, but he had to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's big ears twitched and he narrowed his eyes down at the smaller dragon. \"I think we both know what I want, pipsqueak. And I'm going to get it.\" He growled, his small smile turning deadly serious. \"First, though, why don't you and me head out some place more quiet? Some place where we can be alone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was about to protest when the wolf's arm slid around his shoulders. Fang started to pull him towards the forest easily, the big wolf's superior strength impossible to resist. He grunted as he felt himself starting to get dragged against the implacable pressure. \"Ugh. OK, fine. You don't have to push.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You act like you don't want to hang out with me any more.\" The wolf sneered as he eased the pressure just enough for the dragon to walk under his own power. \"I thought we were friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were too until you forced me to come and raped Jess.\" David found his deep voice carried surprisingly far through the neighborhood with its force. \"How could you do something like that, Fang? That's low, even for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant wolf shrugged and flashed the dragon a rather unsettling, predatory grin. \"Ah, you know, a wolf has needs. And sometimes you just have to take the first bitch available.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled low in his throat, \"That's sick Fang. You know it. You crossed a line, and that's not OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled back, the sound more like a cross between an earthquake and a low, rumbling thunder. \"What are you going to do about it, shorty? You gonna cum angrily at me?\" He chuckled at his own joke, his arm cinching a bit tighter around David's shoulder to bring him closer. \"I can't wait to see you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take them long to walk away from David's house to the deep woods in the back of it. At their size, the trees seemed closer than ever, but it looked like Fang had no problem pushing between them. He uprooted a few of the smaller ones, tilting them crazily as he passed by. They were far too broad to walk side by side at this point, so the wolf completely covered the dragon's hand and lead him along. They walked in relative silence for a few minutes before Fang finally stopped and turned. He stepped towards David and trapped him against a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon squirmed helplessly, his huge hands coming up to Fang's shoulders and pushing as hard as he could. It was like pushing against a marble statue at this point, though. There was nothing he could do. \"Fang, stop. You don't have to do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant wolf growled and licked his lips, watching the dragon's shaft start to emerge despite his protests. \"You don't have to do this either. If you want me to stop, just go soft.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid tried to make himself do it. But feeling the wolf's enormous bulk and the easy strength he wielded just made him throb all the harder. He shook his head, tried to think of anything to get his erection to go down -- his parents, the sight of Jess lying battered and sniffling in the room, his brother for Dragon's sake -- but it all came back around to the titanic wolf looming over him. He whimpered, his knees buckling a little. He couldn't. He was too hard. The more he tried to think about anything other than Fang, the more he needed release. What in the world was happening to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's paw slipped around his throat and held him fast against the tree. He slipped to his knees now, bending down over the incredible bulk of his chest to slurp at that throbbing cock. He rumbled at the taste of pre, chuckled at the helpless whimper David offered in response. \"You like that, don't you? You little faggot. Show me how much.\" The canine's muzzle clamped over the dragon's erection now, that soft and flexible tongue flickering all over it. His teeth barely scraped the skin, but to David it felt like pinpricks that hurt a little at first, then exploded to tiny, surface orgasms on their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's eyes rolled back in his head as his hands pushed and pushed against Fang's forearm. He wouldn't be able to hold out much longer, he thought. And that was the last one he had before the blinding erection overtook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like his seed was being forcibly pulled out of his balls, that's how violent it was. Fang rumbled in approval as he felt the first massive splash hit the roof of his muzzle, then slide down his throat. The giant greedily gulped the flow down, making sure nothing was wasted. Even in the throes of his orgasm, David despaired. This was a big one, and it would make Fang even more unstoppable. He couldn't help himself, though. Something inside of him broke, and his climax went on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree spurts, then four, then five. Six, seven. Then finally, after what felt like two breathless minutes, he began to taper. David panted, finally able to open his eyes. He could hear again, the rush of blood in his ears not quite so strong. What he saw was...terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was already growing larger before his orgasm was even finished. The beast's massive erection was full and swelling against the monstrous bulk of the wolf, rising up along a torso that seemed to be widening in front of him like a storm cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's heart sank as he realized what he had done. Fang was rapidly growing out of anyone's control, and if this went too much farther, they were all in big, big trouble....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David watched helplessly as Fang began to grow. Even as the giant wolf laughed his voice deepened within his chest, lowering to an intense bass that shook the dragon right through his scales. He squirmed against the tree he was held against, his massive hands no match for the even bigger forearm swelling in his grip. His heart sunk as it was harder and harder to catch his breath. Fang's paw was just too big, and it was growing even wider. It forced him to look up at the beast, watch him as he expanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang, for his part, seemed lost in bliss. His tongue lolled from his mouth as his jaw grew wider and his teeth grew longer, his head fur growing shaggier still to cover the added bulk. His neck grew bullishly thick and then started to get lost in the size of his traps, the muscles thickening until it look like his cheeks simply rested on his shoulders. Those were broadening out too, hulking underneath his pelt with more and more muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's chest broadened until his lats crashed against his biceps, which responded by simply getting bigger. Every muscle seemed to tense and bulge, the rounded swell of them growing bigger and bigger, past bodybuilder proportions into...something else. His forearm grew nearly as thick as David's own biceps, and still strengthened. The fingers around the dragon's chin grew thicker, longer, the claws slowly climbing around to the back of his head. David tried to look down, but all he could see was Fang's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf convulsed as he grew, muscles contracting and staying the same size they were when they flexed, then growing again as they relaxed. The feeling of the expansion was exquisite, to say the least, and Fang rumbled as he felt his paws sinking deeper into the dirt, outgrowing their old prints, then sinking deeper still. His weight must be skyrocketing with the added bulk and height, and he closed his eyes to simply savor the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked on in horror as that massive hand threatened to grow right over his muzzle, the wolf's casual strength making it harder and harder to breathe. He was almost relieved when the giant let go and he crumpled to the ground in a heap. But then he looked up to see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's chest was so large that he could barely see the wolf's chin above it, and it was still surging larger, forcing his arms wider against his sides until his shoulders thickened enough to catch up. His endowment was immense, the tip rising right in the middle of those impossible pecs, leaking what must be quarts of precum down the length of it. The balls providing that fluid were the size of beach balls, packed tight with virility, and growing visibly larger with every breath he took. They shook and surged, then pulled tight against the wolf's body. He was so close to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA howl shook the ground beneath David's body and pierced the sky at the same time. Fang came with enough force that he snapped a high branch in two and scoured leaves off several more past that with his first blast. His body grew in surges with every spurt, making him impossibly larger, stronger than ever, closer and closer to unstoppable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the wolf nearly a minute before he stopped spurting and growing, and then his eyes rolled back in his head. He fell backwards with a ground-shaking thud, his chest rising and falling rhythmically. David only then dared get to his feet. He circled around the behemoth's bulk and checked. It looked like Fang was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also looked like he had grown to twice David's size, 16 feet tall at the very least. Even more impressive than that was his build. He was packed with so much muscle he looked almost squat despite his freakish height. His monstrous, midnight-black erection bobbed over him, leaking what must be quarts of semen over his chest and nearly non-existent neck. His balls, far from spent, were already tightening again with another load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon shook his head, horrified. Even still, his erection popped out again, growing achingly hard at the sight of this monstrosity. He tore himself away from the sight and backed away as quietly as he could. Now was his chance to get away. He had to find his way back home and figure out what to do now. It wouldn't be long before Fang woke up, and they had to have at least a plan in place to beat him before then. He turned to go, leaving as quietly and quickly as he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, he heard...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Leaving so soon,\" an ominously deep voice bellowed from behind David. The drake froze in his tracks and turned around, fearing what he would see if he turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did anyways. He looked back to see a colossal Fang sitting up, his huge thighs spread-eagle, showcasing the massive monument that was his cock and balls. The devious wolf had a wicked grin plastered to his face, the glint of moonlight reflecting on the beast's vicious signature fangs, some of it partially obscured by the rising and falling of his gigantic chest. Fang licked his chops, thinking of all the things he wanted to do to David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davey,\" he rumbled, the titanic wolf rising to his haunches, squatting in position such that his cannon aimed directly at the fearful drake. The sheer look of terror on his face, so delicious. Fang wanted more. As he took one thunderous step towards David, the drake backed up two, but distance was still lost for the drake. A deep rumbling cackle built within Fang's throat, unbridled manic joy echoing throughout the night sky. \"Aw, don't run,\" he sneers playfully, picking up the pace. David redoubled his efforts in trying to run, but yelped as he felt himself trip over an exposed root.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake spun around in horror, feeling the tremors of the wolf's footfalls approaching. The pale light filtering into the woods was completely eclipsed by Fang, the drake bathed in total darkness, the only light he could see was the reflected rays off of the wolf's ravenous saliva-coated fangs, his hungry eyes, a faint golden light spilling over him, and the glint of light reflecting off the ever-flowing stream coming out of Fang's yearning cockhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang bent down, his shaft pushing into the drake, pinning him to the ground. The wolf as dark as midnight rumbled at the feeling, the squirming of an inferior being struggling to keep its face away from his godhood. That's what he felt like, a god amongst mortals, a god amongst real men; men like David. \"Told you not run,\" he half-moaned, half-scoffed; a glorious mix of carnal pleasure and smug satisfaction coursing through him. \"After all, we're friends,\" he hissed as he felt another thick wad of pre erupt from his spire. \"Mmhmm, with bennies, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" David yelped, finally managing to vocalize anything. He was coated in the wolf's pre, the thick slime all over his exposed scales. It was turning him on. And that scared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang reached down and using a massive paw light slapped the cobalt dragon's cheek lightly a couple times. \"Now now, don't get so eager. I think I'm a tad too big for you these days, you little faggot!\" The gigantic wolf's voice rose in pitch until he ended it with a triumphant roar, bringing his colossal arms up into a flex. He admired himself; only he could truly appreciate how beautiful his body was now. Only he deserved to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the wolf's awesome display, he felt a little something of David's bumping into his. A smug grin crept up of Fang's face. No one deserved to touch him, but he was in a good mood. For David, he was feeling rather generous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grabbed at the drake underneath his cock and rolled onto his back, loam and fallen leaves being upturned in the process. David almost felt like he could wet himself, what was this behemoth planning to do with him? As Fang held him, a good three feet in the air above his magnificent chest, eyeing the drake with predatory grin, David felt Fang's titanic erection bumping into the space between his legs and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you off, David. Now, wouldn't it be rude if you didn't return the favour?\" the wolf rumbled darkly. He dropped the drake onto himself, revelling in how easily he could take the impact as David let out a little 'oof' from the fall. In many respects, David was everything Fang used to be; huge, hung, virile. But Fang was so much more now, so much more powerful. And that drove the wolf wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit up,\" Fang commanded. David made a whimper in protest, but the wolf quickly snarled, David's entire world shaking underneath him as Fang's pelt vibrated with colossal might. The dragon obeyed. As soon as the drake's back made contact with Fang's erect throbbing member, David let out a small yelp. \"All the way up,\" Fang grunted, clearly enjoying the struggle the drake was having at pushing at his shaft. With all his might, David pushed his back into Fang's steel hard length, making it point into the infinite night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Fang, the feeling was exquisite, he must have more. The feeling of David's entire back pushing against his prodigious length was amazing. He looked over his expansive chest to see the dragon's eyes watering, never had David felt so humiliated in his life, and judging from the dragon's erection, never so aroused. Fang loved every moment of it, watching as the drake cringed at every drop of the wolf's pre that was now oozing onto the top of his head; and it showed, Fang could feel himself getting closer to the edge from just looking at how easily he dominated David, how easily it looked like David wanted to be dominated by him. Fang licked his lips with excitement, whether he came from just lording his might over David or if the drake caved in and stroked him off, it didn't matter, in some sick fantasy, Fang wanted to cum for David, to show David what a man he was, what a man the drake had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf flexed his chest, his immense pectorals blocking his view of the drake. \"Feel 'em, little guy,\" the wolf huffed, straining to talk from the mass of muscle pushing into his chin. He couldn't see it, but he felt David's paws moving along the swell of his pecs, squeezing and caressing the huge slabs of meat. He could barely hear it over his loud moaning, but he knew David was enjoying the worship session as much as Fang was giving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn David's part, he was completely hypnotized, there was something mesmerizing about Fang's huge bulk, the way he looked freakish, completely unnatural; it was turning him on and frying his circuits. He didn't even realize until it was too late that he had his hands on Fang's pecs, feeling the rock solid muscle under that plush cum-soaked shaggy black fur. The groove between the monstrosities chest, David fought extra hard to not completely succumb and shove his snout into it. He didn't know why, but he found Fang, the largest guy in the world, somehow incredibly attractive at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid partially gave in, bending over, letting Fang's shaft push him into one of the wolf's colossal pecs. He tongued the bottom of the wolf's steel-like shelf, his eyes going wide at the thought of just how much the muscle stuck out of Fang's chest. Before he knew it, he was suckling on one of Fang's massive teats like a newborn babe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until he felt the muscle rumbling underneath him as Fang brought one colossal arm down and flexed it, the muscles in his chest and arm fighting for space and David's attention. The drake moved his lips from Fang's nipple to the gigantic boulder that was Fang's bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang groaned deeply. None of the chicks he's ever been with worshipped him like this, none of them were so devoted to his muscles as David was. And surprisingly, none of them ever turned the wolf on as much as the drake was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf suddenly grabbed at David and casually tossed him off his body. David gulped as he picked himself off the dirt floor wondering what Fang was going to do next, he was so close himself to release, but he needed to hold out. It took him a moment to realize what he was doing and what he had just been doing. Fang had made the drake worship him and David knew he should not be okay with this. He should be upset, he shoud-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was now looming over the drake, a titanic leg standing up on each side of David. Even though most of Fang's face was obscured by his billowing pecs, David knew the wolf had a confident smirk on as the wolf stood with arms akimbo. Wordlessly, the wolf commanded David to stand and worship his legs. Wordlessly, David rose and began to use an arm to each massage the enormous thighs that the wolf sported. In a twist of sick pleasure, the wolf moved himself to have his sloshing ballsack smush itself into David's face, the drake complying by licking the globs of pre that soaked into the wolf scrotal fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was too much for Fang. Despite the giant wolf's impossible strength, he felt himself going weak in the knees, his orgasm so indescribably close now. With a thunderous crash, the wolf fell forward onto his knees and bent forward onto the palm of his hands as he braced himself, the pleasure coursing through him paralyzing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was close, but he had himself under control at the moment. However, that was about to change. One moment he's taking calming breaths and the next he's feeling the mother of all loads being squeezed out of his testicles, his semen bubbling forth, cascading through him as he began to cum and howl into the night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, David?!\" the wolf yowled. Fang had had himself under control - until David had pressed his dragon snout into the cleft between the wolf's glutes, the drake brushing up against the sensitive skin around the wolf's anus, sending Fang into an uncontrollable orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood back as he watched Fang release onto the ground, high-pressure jets erupting from the wolf's dick as he clawed at the ground, lost in the throes of release. David didn't realize he was stroking himself until it was too late. The dragon looked down to see his throbbing member twitch at the start of his own orgasm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David's willpower was completely gone. A voice in the back of his mind told him that this was a bad idea, that he should never have come here with Fang, that the consequences of this would be impossible to undo. But then he looked at this immense wolf taking up the space between two trees, stripping the branches with each shot of seed, and he felt his body moving of its own accord. The voice in the back of his head screamed at him not to, but he grabbed Fang's gigantic hips, squeezed, and rammed his oversized member right underneath the wolf's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant yelped in surprise and clamped down around the dragon's cock, and that was all it took. It was a vise gripping David's member, and he felt it throb and then shoot harder than he'd ever felt it go before. The orgasm was too intense; David grit his teeth together and grunted, each long spurt accompanied with a flash of white behind his eyelids. Fang kept squeezing, almost as if he were milking David for every last drop. He was shooting too, each incredible load splattering against trees with a loud, wet sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to catch his breath through the experience. Each surge of his cock was so strong it felt like it was being ripped out of his balls, his stomach clenching fiercely for two seconds at a time. Every one took his breath away, and he felt his chest pressing against his arms as he gasped and moaned. Time seemed to stretch on forever; his balls ached with the violence of his climax, but they seemed to have an inexhaustible supply. And Fang wouldn't let go. He felt locked with the wolf, the sensation only spurring him on. In the midst of this intense feeling, the voice was gone, and this just felt right. So, so right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had no idea when Fang had stopped cumming, or when the wolf finally released his grip on the dragon's shaft. Suddenly he just snapped to, and realized what he had done. He could feel his cock dribbling its seed deep within the monster he had created, and quickly pulled out. He stepped back several paces, his stubborn erection bobbing in the air as if reaching for the hole it had just left. He cursed himself for what he had done. This was so, so bad. He knew it, and there was nothing he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang heaved himself up to a standing position, the earth shaking around him as he resettled his mass. He turned towards David, his cock just as hard as ever, leaking what might be a pint of seed from its pointed tip. Even in the darkness, David could see the wolf's body rippling, eagerly turning seed into yet more mass. Fang chuckled as the feeling of growth washed over him yet again this evening, his body slowly expanding with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davey, Davey, Davey,\" he rumbled, his voice already deeper, louder than before. \"Just can't get enough of your old pal, Fang, can you? That's OK. I can't get enough of myself either.\" The wolf flexed and his biceps exploded under his pelt, leaping to fill the space between his shoulders and forearms. The peak pushed against the wolf's gigantic paw and then grew larger still -- along with every muscle in the titan's body. It was hard to see in this light, but Fang had already grown two feet taller and who knows how many pounds heavier, and the expansion had just started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\" the wolf's tongue lolled from his mouth as his neck widened, then disappeared into shoulders that were threatening to push the back of his great head. \"...it's such a grrrrreat feeling, Davey. I almost wish I could share it.\" He bent down to see past his own chest, one paw pulling that impossible cock out of the way. \"Almost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid squeezed his eyes shut as if that would stop this from happening. Instead he simply heard the deepening moans of the growing wolf, practically heard his pelt stretching around his new mass. When he opened his eyes again Fang was still larger, his muscle making him thicker than a tank, his ears pushing past twenty feet tall and still rising. His slick cock gleamed in the moonlight as it crashed into the valley of his pecs, pointing towards the sky as it rose towards the wolf's snarling, smirking lips. His legs were thicker than the young trees around him, his paws were as wide as David's chest, and his voice shook the ground as well as the air around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon watched in stunned horror. How big would he possibly get? How was anyone supposed to stop him? He cursed himself for being so stupid, for only thinking with his dick, for getting everyone into this fucked-up situation. All of this was his fault, he knew. And if he didn't find a way to stop it, then everyone he loved would end up in big, big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up as Fang's growth continued, pushing his head past 21 feet, then just under 22. The wolf's eyes were faintly glowing now, and every once in a while he could see them close as Fang reveled in his building power. He had to get out of here. He had to run. Now, while Fang was distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took a few steps back, then turned and fled. He could only hear the terrible, bassy moans of the wolf-monster echoing through the woods behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had driven to the hospital as quickly as he could, and once he was there he called all of the friends of David that he could think of. In the end he only got the Jason Leverin, the lion quarterback who was often the only decent guy on the team; Rick Bernard, the immense bear left tackle; and Ben Sparrow, the equine defenseman that Tyler had talked comics with once at a party. They all jumped when they heard that Marcus had been beaten, and had wanted to know immediately who had done it and where they were now. He had made them promise to come to the hospital before he told them anything. He had to make sure they could actually look at how Marcus had changed so they could believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to get past the nurse when he told them that members of the football team were coming to the hospital directly from practice so they could see their teammate. He felt a rash of annoyance at how the raccoon simply rolled over for the excuse. If he had said his gaming buddies were driving over from a Magic tournament, would he have gotten in so easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the thought out of his mind for now. The best thing he could do was help Marcus and David beat Fang, and that wasn't going to happen unless he got some help. He waited for them in Marcus' room, with four gallon-sized jugs. Each contained a mixture of David's seed, whole milk and protein powder that he hoped would mask the taste. They wouldn't be able to run up against Fang the way they were. They would need to at least be as big as David if they had a prayer. And that was only if Fang hadn't forced David to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit. Marcus!\" The booming voice of Rick pulled him back to the present. The big bear filled the doorway for a second before lumbering to Marcus' bedside. Jason and Ben were right behind him, both massive beasts in their own right. With the three of them filling the space around the kangaroo's bed, the room suddenly got a lot smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was a jumble of voices as Tyler stood up to speak to them. \"Holy shit, can you believe this?\" \"Does he look bigger to you?\" \"Fuckin' A man, I bet it was that asshole Brian.\" \"Naw, look at the claw marks, it had to have been...\" And then they argued until the nurse came in and told them to keep their voices down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at Tyler expectantly. The smaller dragon cleared his throat and said, \"Now, as you can see, Marcus is a lot bigger than you remember him, right? This is really important, because it's proof of what I'm about to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rick pushed forward and loomed over Tyler. \"You'd better tell us who did this, man. Nobody puts our guy in the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's earfans flicked, and he tried not to look annoyed. He needed these men as allies. \"It was Fang. He...there's some kind of supplement going around, and him and Marcus got into a fight about it, and...\" He gestured to the kangaroo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That punk-ass bitch!\" Rick practically roared, his voice filling the room so completely Tyler felt his ears ring. Ben and Jason both punched him on the arm. The nurse came a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen, this is your final warning. You're not even supposed to be here, and if you can't keep the noise down I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" She gave them a pointed stare before retreating back to her desk. As soon as she was gone, the three football players crowded around Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the fuck is this asshole?\" Rick hissed. \"It's time to teach him a fucking lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...the thing.\" Tyler looked at his jugs, then started handing them out. \"It's hard to believe, but he's a LOT bigger than he used to be. Twelve feet tall at least. David's trying to talk him down before he does something else, but I don't think it'll be enough. That's why I called you guys here. I have the supplement here, and you have to take it before you go and stop Fang once and for all. They're in the forest behind our house. The police should be there by now, but I don't think they can do anything.\" Tyler looked at the three of them. \"Only you can, and only after you drink this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the jugs into their hands, and looked at them as they stared in stunned silence. Ben finally spoke, the huge Clydesdale leaning forward. \"You're joking, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head emphatically. \"I swear on my life I'm not. Please...we don't have much time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear and horse looked to the lion. Jason seemed to consider for a moment, then said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No man, I don't trust this,\" the lion said, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler clenched his fists. Jason may not be as much of an asshole as the other football players; but the damn lion was still thick as a brick. He sneered at the three jocks, well two jocks and a ball of blubber. There was one way they'd listen to him. The purple drake couldn't believe that it had come to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust? I think you'll fuckin' trust this,\" Tyler snarled. The dragon sauntered up to the lion, squaring up against him. Jason Leverin realized all too late what he was dealing with. Him and the guys were so busy worrying about Marcus that none of them had realized that the tiny dragon they were so used to dealing with around David wasn't exactly so little. In fact, Jason found himself staring into the base of Tyler's neck. But not just that, Tyler's chest practically filled his view. The lion felt a rough paw grabbing him by the collar of his polo and lifting him off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Tyler?!\" he stammered. This seemed to garner the attention of the two other big guys, their eyes going wide with a sudden epiphany\u2026 if this wasn't David\u2026 then the only dragon they knew\u2026 was Tyler Matthews. \"What\u2026 what happened to you, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you, that 'supplement's' been going around,\" Tyler growled. For emphasis, he brought his other arm in front of Jason's face and flexed, his thick bicep stretching the fabric, much like David's arm would - if David wasn't an 8 foot giant now, or God knows how big he's gotten. Tyler found a bit of satisfaction in the act, he felt so powerful now, so strong. He was now big enough to fit into David's old clothes from high school. It felt awesome, even if he sort of looked like a douche in the process .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor their parts, Ben and Rick looked stunned, flabbergasted. The bear looked at the stallion and then eyed the jug in hand. Excellent, Tyler thought to himself, at least he got one of them interested, if Rick biting his lower lip was any indication. But he needed to take it further. Seal the deal, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler took the jug in hand and made his way over to the unconscious kangaroo, lying beaten and broken on the hospital bed. Tyler gulped, he really hoped this would work. Slowly, he uncapped the top and opened Marcus' mouth. He sent one last prayer up before he tilted the jug just enough for the concoction of dairy, whey and essence of David went down Marcus' hatch. Tyler took it slow, making sure not to choke the roo, or cause him to gag; Marcus was going to need every last bit of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, that was the last of it, the still out-cold kangaroo laid there still. Tyler began to worry, he thought, no, he knew Fang's split lip was healed after David's cum was ingested. But\u2026 Marcus wasn't stirring. Was it too dilute? Was he wrong after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the least likely of things happened: Marcus' exposed boxers began to tent, a giant erection poking out of the flap. Tyler's cheeks burned with embarrassment, this wasn't what he wanted the guys to see! The large shaft pushed its way out, the flesh exposing itself in the cold air. The room was silent, Jason, Ben and Rick just staring at the spire jutting out from Marcus' crotch. All three had a different reaction thereafter; Jason facepalmed, Ben looked away and Rick covered his own crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um,\" Rick stammered, adjusting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boyfriend's going to kill me,\" Ben sighed, the horse always complaining about his little squirt of a human partner ever since they met in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you wanted to show us, Tyler? You just put Viagra in that or something?\" Jason said annoyed. \"Where's the real supplement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the real sup,\" Tyler said through gritted teeth. He didn't know why it wasn't working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait, look,\" Rick said under his breath, completely in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before their eyes, Marcus began to stir a bit. The kangaroo's chest began to animate, his breathing becoming more pronounced. Then, Marcus began to grow. The guys watched with eyes the size of saucers as Marcus' frame filled out with pounds of muscle; the bodybuilder sized kangaroo growing to truly monstrous proportions. The process was slow, deliberate, as if Marcus' body was savouring its changes. Marcus began to whine through his mouth, his pain, or perhaps pleasure becoming audible. He began to move his limbs, the size of his biceps incredible, the triceps equally marvellous, his calves the envy of every professional bodybuilder's, quads and hamstrings like those never seen before. Tyler gawked at his, well, mostly David's, creation; Marcus was a beast, a monster. The kangaroo pushed past eight and a half feet and he was still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when everyone in the room began to get uncomfortable, Marcus was getting a bit too into it. It seemed he had regained a bit of motor function, some basal part of his brain ordering the semi-conscious kangaroo to stroke himself, a hand gliding lightly over the long, thick and still growing shaft. He let out a deep bellow, letting the guys know he was in the right place, a big dopey grin spreading across his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others were so busy looking at Marcus' changes, Tyler was looking for signs of healing. He was relieved to see the wounds closing, the brown fur matted with blood, but nothing gushing out anymore. It worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler <i>was</i> relieved. It turned to annoyance when a ribbon of Marcus' cum splashed him on the muzzle, the hot seed searing into his hide. Well\u2026 at least he knew Marcus was alright. The colossal marsupial continued to moan, his voice a deep baritone, as he came bucketloads of seed; the nine foot even giant of a roo spilling out of the bed, his legs resting on the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That proof enough for you?\" Tyler said with a smirk. He turned around to see Ben and Jason eyeing Rick, the brown bear already guzzling down his jug. Jason rolled his eyes and shrugged, he was kind of tired of never getting to play because Fang hogged the quarterback spotlight, if he got big, maybe coach would put him on the field more. With a shrug, Jason began to down the fluid. Ben was the most difficult. The horse looked at his jug. On one hand, he wanted to help, on the other\u2026 his boyfriend already had troubles accommodating a guy that was 'hung like a horse.' With apprehension, and maybe a little regret, the horse began to drink the concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd only be a matter of time before Tyler would be surrounded by giants, the three guys going into their own little worlds. He turned back to Marcus, only to see the roo staring up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler? Tyler, is that you?\" the roo asked with a deep voice. Marcus had apprehensive eyes and wary fingers as he began to feel himself over. \"Is this\u2026 is this me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Look, Marc, I need your help. It's David and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang,\" Marcus sighed. The way Marcus looked down\u2026 there was something off. \"Tyler, this is all my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I did know about Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus laid back, staring at the ceiling. \"I've known Fang was gay for a while now. I was at a LGBT club meeting and he came in, looking for help. Saw me and he bolted right out of there\u2026 We're sort of closet friends now, sort of pretending we don't know about each other; he even picks on me from time to time to make it believable. What I did today\u2026 I did it on purpose, though the results were a bit unexpected. I didn't expect him to get violent. Tyler\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

And this whole thing, this whole crazy thing that was unraveling right before his eyes...it was a lover's spat that had been taken way too far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon shook his head and took a step away from the kangaroo. \"I don't believe this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus swung one enormous leg over the bed to sit up. It creaked and nearly broke under the monstrous kangaroo's weight, but barely held. \"You have to believe me, Tyler, I didn't want any of this to happen. I just thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick's moan cut through the thought, forcing both the kangaroo and the dragon to look his way. The bear was already growing, his massive frame tearing through clothing that had been too tight anyway. The bulge underneath his zipper had been most prominent, and the stitches there were giving way in rapid succession. Even still, it wasn't enough. Thick brown fur was all but pouring out of the hole, forcing it wider and longer. Tyler stared a little longer than he meant to before looking away. Marcus continues looking on in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jason and Ben were starting to feel the effects of David's cum as well. The horse nickered as he felt himself starting to grow larger, his hooves clopping on the tile floor a bit more loudly as the weight piled on. Jason's broad shoulders grew even more so, stretching the fabric of his flannel shirt. The darker fur of the lion's mane was pushing between the buttons, threatening to pop them off in just a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them had grown several inches and put on at least fifty pounds of muscle, and the expansion had barely started. Tyler shook his head, wondering just how potent David's seed was. How big would they get? He looked at the ceiling, his own horns brushing the tiles while Marcus' ears whispered noisily against it. They wouldn't last much longer in this room. They needed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, guys?\" Tyler spoke in his deepest, loudest voice. \"Maybe we should start getting out of here. I'm not sure how much longer the room is going to hold...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen whinnied as his jeans ripped rather explosively, the immense bulge of his shaft tearing right through the denim. He tilted his head back on his thickening neck and grabbed it in both massive hands. It responded instantly, leaping up to slam against the horse's chest before visibly expanding longer and thicker. The draft's ears were already starting to push against the ceiling now, and his clothes were moving from a shirt and jeans to a collection of tatters falling away from his thick, chestnut-brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was already jacking off, his shaft an angry red color that seemed to grow an inch every time the bear breathed. He was swelling even faster than the horse at this point, his head bumping the ceiling and immediately pushing it up. Muscle rippled underneath his shaggy brown pelt, the loose fur filling out with impressive bulges that only seemed to multiply and grow. The bear's growls were growing lower, deeper, shaking the floor underneath the dragon's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was taking the effect and gaining muscle faster than height. The tall quarterback had gone from an impressively built but somewhat lanky cat to an absolute beast of a lion. His clothes had ripped around a chest and set of thighs that were surging right before their eyes, and his neck had disappeared behind monstrous shoulders and a mane that looked prehistoric in its wildness. He was getting taller as well, pushing past eight feet now and growing into nine. He seemed helpless in the face of the semen's effects as well, grabbing his own oversized member in two mighty paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head as he looked at the scene before him. Rick's shoulders were pushing into the ceiling now and he was growing fast. Ben was already leaking from a shaft that was glancing the ceiling, his balls grown so large they covered his thighs down to the knee. And Jason was becoming a musclebound, atavistic version of himself, so thick with power he was crowding himself with the simple act of masturbation. The room rapidly filled with their combined scents and moans, the booming voices of the trio getting louder as they neared their orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth did you give them?\" Marcus wondered, the giant kangaroo rising to join Tyler on the far side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon simply shook his head, rolling his own broad shoulders as he ignored the swelling of his crotch. \"Hopefully I gave them what they needed to beat Fang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*     *     *     *     *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid crashed through the woods, bouncing off some trees and simply plowing through others on his way back to the house. He couldn't see very well; the night was dark and his eyes were full of tears. He couldn't believe he had been that stupid. Now Fang was more powerful than ever, and more than likely truly unstoppable. It was time to cut his losses and stop this before it got any more out of hand. He'd talk to the police, tell them that the military needed to be called, and get him and Tyler somewhere safe. It was the only thing left to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge dragon crashed through the trees and almost tumbled into his front yard. He groaned at the sight of it. His house was partially ruined, and a good portion was still smeared with his own semen. He looked around for the flashing lights of the squad cars, or for his little brother. Neither were anywhere to be found. The night had become quiet, and his house was deserted. All he could hear was his own breathing and his heart hammering in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a tremendous crash. It was a pronounced boom that he felt under his feet, sharp and deliberate. It was followed by another. Then another. By the fourth, he could feel the ground shaking under his feet. His heart sank. Fang had recovered much more quickly than he thought. And he was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" the wolf boomed through the trees. It was supernaturally deep, a punch of sound he felt through his body. \"Where are you?\" The wolf chuckled, and David could see one tree sway drunkenly and then topple over. \"I thought you weren't dumb enough to run away from your old pal Fang any more. We're going to be the best of friends, you and I. I'm never letting you out of my sight again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors were getting worse, and the trees that were snapping and breaking were coming closer. Fang was carving a path right back to his house. David looked around frantically for a place to hide, to run to. He had to keep away from the wolf, or else he wouldn't be able to stop himself. Weak, he muttered to himself. He was so weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!\" Fang thundered. The sound rang through the neighborhood, setting off car alarms. \"Get your little ass back here! It's time for my next injection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon cursed under his breath and ran, his heavy feet thumping through grass, pavement and asphalt. He couldn't let himself get caught. And he couldn't lead Fang anywhere someone else could get hurt. He raced through his mind for places he could run to, and came up with a solution so obvious it was a wonder he hadn't thought of it sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a military base fifteen miles from here. It would be a hell of a run, but he was sure he could make it before Fang bore down on him. And if he didn't, well...at least he was leading the monster out of town. There was that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thundered towards the southwest with renewed purpose. He had to make it. The military would know what to do, and they'd be able to stop Fang before he could do any more damage. At least, he prayed they would...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler flattened himself against the wall opposite the door in Marcus' hospital room, watching the three jocks he had just given David's cum to grow to fill the remaining space. The conditioned air was rapidly filling with the overwhelming musk of the trio, which completely outshadowed the scent of dragon and kangaroo at this point. The lion, bear and horse growing right in front of him were making quick work of the ceiling in rather distinct ways, and he could feel the floor starting to shudder more and more under his toes. He felt his heart hammering in his oversized chest, wondering when they would stop. Already, it would be next to impossible to get them out of the door without breaking the wall completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...how big are they going to get? How much did you give them?\" The thick, booming voice of Marcus sounded like a whisper next to the groans and growls of his football buddies. Despite his persistent erection, he looked nervously at Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. A...lot, I guess. Maybe it would have been a good idea to give it to them outside.\" The dragon's eyes settled on Jason the lion, quarterback for the football team. He was a nice guy, though a little dumb. His teasing of Tyler probably had the least edge to it. Right now, though, he looked like a cross between a prehistoric dire version of himself and some kind of Hulk-like superhero. He was ten feet tall now and still rising slowly, his shoulders broad and thick enough that his neck had completely disappeared. His mane had grown around his head and down his shoulders and black, covering him with an impenetrable halo of thick red fur. Muscles bulged and thickened and crashed into each other constantly, forcing him to spread his stance for room. He was snarling with lust, his fangs shockingly large inside of his squared muzzle. His paws were as big as Rick's proportionately, and they still couldn't wrap around his surging red shaft. Pre was arcing in jets to splash noisily to the floor, growing in intensity and volume all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Marcus boomed at him, his eyes wide as he stared at Rick the bear. \"As it stands we won't be able to get any of them out of here. If they grow much more they're just going to break the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo had a point. Rick seemed to take to the potion the best, which was a worrying prospect. The bear had taken up perhaps a third of the room now, his great and shaggy head sitting on shoulders that boiled with muscle. His thick fur wasn't quite enough to hide the definition that was forming underneath it, muscles growing denser, stronger, bigger all the time. His height had taken off like a rocket as well, and he was down on one knee in the room just to fit. Even still, his back and shoulders had punched through the loose ceiling tiles and into the spaces between floors. If he stood, he would have been maybe 15 or 16 feet tall. His paws were large enough to cover even Tyler's chest, and the floor was cracking and bending underneath what must have been over a ton of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we should do something.\" Tyler said this more to himself than Marcus, and stepped forward. Ben almost immediately grew into him. \"Guys! Guys...we should...get a hold of yourselves! We have to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ben heard him, the horse gave no indication. He had risen to 12 feet tall, then 13 feet, his broad shoulders and massive chest broadening out considerably. His cock, however, was obscene -- it had grown to the level of the horse's ears and rivaled his thigh in width. Veins visibly pulsed along the length, and his flare flattened against the space above the ceiling before splashing what must have been a gallon of precum over an astonishingly wide area. His balls covered the top of his thighs, and sunk towards his knees with a worrying speed. He stamped a hoof and whinnied as the sensation of arousal and unnatural expansion washed over him. The entire room shook, and Tyler could see from the way he snorted that he was quite close to orgasm. Tyler sighed; he was once again the smallest person in the room despite his 8-foot height and immense musculature. There wasn't anything he could do to stop the worst from happening here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth is going on?\" The raccoon nurse on night shift was standing in the doorway, her black eyes glittering in shock at the scene unfolding before her. Jason was immediately in front of her, facing away, his bulk mostly shielding her from the colossus that Rick was becoming in the corner. However, she could see Ben clearly, his increasingly violent gouts of pre flooding the room now, filling it with the distinctive odor of a rutting horse. Both the bear and lion were contributing to the tremendous flow, and Marcus himself was leaking profusely. Tyler simply stood with his mouth hanging open, glancing about the room and the three giants filling it. What could you possibly say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let out a window-rattling sound that was somewhere between a whinny and a roar, and his underchannel swelled visibly. A second later a roar of liquid filled the room as the horse shot out his load with the force of a firehose. There was a crack, and some plaster came down with the flood of seed, immediately forming a puddle that splattered over the ruined tiles. Ben visibly expanded with that shot, his chest pushing out until his pecs crashed into each other, his arms growing rounded and swollen, his long neck thickening with brutish size. His shaft looked to gain another inch in width during the three seconds it shot its load, then came to rest for just a moment before pumping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, less of the seed splashed down into the room. The horse had broken into the floor above and was flooding the room on top of Marcus'. There was more cracking now, and the floor was bending under his hooves as who knows how many dozens of pounds of muscle built onto him in the span of a few seconds. Before Tyler, Marcus or the nurse could say anything, Jason roared, and so did Rick. The lion's head and shoulders crunched through the tile and slammed into the floor of the story above them, raining down more plaster on top of them. His red shaft swelled and fired, a solid stream of seed shooting across the room and breaking the window behind Tyler. The lion's teeth and mane rippled and grew with his orgasm, and it looked like his muscles were going to split his pelt wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery move Rick made shook the room and warped the floor. He was a brown storm cloud that was threatening to take out the ceiling and two walls with his growth, and the force of his orgasm chiseled the floor away. He left huge, scouring divots with his seed, and the combined flow of the trio was creating two inches of the stuff on the floor before it spilled into the hallway. He grunted and growled, each sound inhumanly deep and incredibly loud, and even though he was hunched with his knees barreling into his monstrous chest his head and shoulders were breaking the floor above him. He panted as he grew, his giant frame pushing further into the room and creaking the walls behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt his knees go weak as his climax came for him, too. His vision blurred and he sank to his knees, his earfans fluttering against the sides of his head. When it cleared, he could still hear the roaring growing deeper and louder around him. But he noticed that the nurse was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus tugged at the dragon's arm, trying to get him up. \"Come on, Tyler. We have to get out of here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon struggled to focus. He looked at the kangaroo with an embarrassed look before nodding. Jason, Ben and Rick were lost in the throes of their climaxes, and they wouldn't really be themselves until they came down. Judging from the intensity of the orgasm, chances were very good that they would pass out before they did. And the crash of those bodies would probably be enough to bring the place down around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to scoot past Jason, slipping in the warm pool of seed as they passed. The lion was so obscenely wide that one arm grew into their path, and they were forced to flatten themselves against the wall. The floor sunk and shook noticeably now; it wouldn't take long before they crashed through the first floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus and Tyler were just about to squeeze themselves through the door of the room when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David thundered through the neighborhood, his thousand-pound weight shaking cars in his wake. He looked around to make sure there weren't going to be too many people around, and was dismayed to find people stepping out of their homes to see what all the fuss was. Fang's approach made a lot more noise, the wolf's every footstep like a bomb sounding. David could feel the soft shudder of the giant's tonnage landing, a rhythmic quake that got worse as Fang got closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only making me want to fuck you harder, dragon.\" Fang's voice was a klaxon that carried through the neighborhood. \"You know I love it when people play hard to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf burst out of the treeline near his home, even bigger than David had imagined. He was nearly four stories tall if he was an inch, his shoulders so thick and huge it brushed his cheeks as he breathed. His chest was thick enough that it extended past his muzzle, forcing him to hunch over just to look down. He was a black-furred building, rippling with power, his thighs bursting with strength every time he took a step. The wolf's obscene endowment rolled over the trunk-thick limbs, wobbling heavily, throbbing with his pulse. His golden eyes flashed in the dim light coming from David's ruined house as Fang looked around, his saber-like fangs showing when he spotted the dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are. What are you doing all the way over there? You should be here.\" Fang grabbed his sheath, the pointed tip of his shaft surging out with the motion. The wolf's biceps swelled as it crashed against his impossibly-sized ribcage. His chest and arm were so big he almost couldn't reach it. The wolf grinned like a demon, his tongue lolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything, David felt his knees go week and his sheath stir. What was wrong with him? How in the world could he be aroused at a time like this? He shook his head as if breaking himself out of a spell. Don't talk, he thought to himself. Just run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did. He spread his wings and tried to take off, the mighty limbs beating the air into the ground. It was harder than he thought it would be; he could feel the muscles in his chest working hard to lift himself, and he barely managed to get his claws off the sidewalk. He beat harder, gritting his teeth. Eventually, his legs lifted and he was airborne. Not by much, but it would do. It'd be faster than running, and by air he might have a chance of not being run down by the titanic wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, Fang did something he had never heard the wolf do before: he howled. The sound was immediately deafening, drowning out the blown windows and car alarms that sounded down the block. It engulfed David in a massive wave, dominating his senses to the point that it was a struggle to focus on anything else. He beat his wings harder, feeling enormous amounts of air beating against the ground to hold himself aloft. He had to move faster. If he was caught by that monster, it would be all over. He knew he'd give in, and then the wolf would simply be even more unstoppable than he was already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt the rush of air as Fang got down on all fours to chase him. The titan's hands slammed down into the asphalt, cracking it under powerful fingers, and then he pushed off on his hands and feet to propel himself forward. The wolf's incredible mass responded to the powerful leap, and David swore he felt Fang's hot breath on his tail before he landed. The dragon saw the ground ripple under what must have been tons slamming into it, and the shockwave actually tilted him in mid-air slightly. He used his long, heavy tail to right himself and pushed himself harder. Now that he had figured out how to compensate for his increased weight and muscle, he was starting to get the hang of his wings again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon rushed himself out of the neighborhood, fanning his wings until he flew higher off the ground. Once he had raised himself to about 30 or 40 feet he focused on putting as much distance as he could between himself and Fang. Of course, this meant trying not to think about the building-sized beast right behind him. Incalculable power raged for him, wanting nothing more than to grab him and bring him to orgasm. Normally, David had fantasies about this sort of thing. Now, it was nothing short of terrifying to contemplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I'm going to do to you when I catch you, Davey?\" Fang rumbled between breaths, his words punctuated by the loud impact of his landings. \"I'm going to suck you dry. I'm going to see just how many times in a row you can come.\" The wolf's voice was loud and deep enough for everyone for a couple blocks to hear this, but he said it like it was just a conversation between two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" David caught himself wondering out loud. \"You've hurt a lot of people, Fang. You ruined my house. You've wrecked our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why WOULDN'T I do this, Davey?\" Fang thundered right behind him, panting and leaping, a storm cloud with yellow eyes that left devastation in its wake. \"I had no idea you could do this, but as soon as I knew you could there was no way I wasn't going to take as much power as I could. I was pretty big before, but now...I'm practically a god. And there's no telling how powerful I can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could hear the naked lust in Fang's voice as he spoke. He felt his own sheath stirring as he wondered just how much size the wolf could accrue. He shook his head and flew up once he saw the last buildings of the suburbs streak by in his peripheries. He should be discouraging these fantasies, not quietly contemplating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't the power you had enough?\" David found he could speak easier once he caught some wind around 80 feet up, circling lazily to see how much distance he had put between himself and Fang. \"Right now you're...you're too big to play football, or live like a normal person. Did you think about what would happen if the authorities caught up to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked up at him as he stalked behind, keeping pace with the flying dragon easily. His tail wagged audibly behind him. \"Come on, Davey. You know me. There's always a bigger something out there looking to put the hurt on little old Fang. I just got to be bigger than anything anyone can throw at me is all. Why don't you come down here. Together we'll make me unstoppable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shook his head and flapped higher, then rushed away. He aimed towards the lights of the military barracks. \"No thanks, Fang. I've see what you do to the people you lust after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe low growl sounded like an earthquake below him. \"Then you should know having to chase you is just making me lustier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang pursued him with renewed purpose, his massive paws slamming into the roads, creating craters at least two feet deep behind him. David flew high and far, trying to make sure he was well out of Fang's reach. It was so hard to tell if he was; his own bulk made it difficult to climb too far into the sky, and he was already beginning to tire. But who knows what the wolf was capable of? He was over three times his height and who knows how many times heavier and stronger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf didn't seem to tire or slow down as he chased after the dragon. He stayed close to the road, his paws filling up a lane of traffic and leaving prints that would swallow small cars. He kept focused on David with a disturbing single-mindedness, so he probably didn't notice the car swerving through his destructive wake. It sped up, chasing him, and then crashed into one of the monster's footpaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked as surprised as David was when he went down hard. The dragon could see the power lines and small plants leap in the air, and the headlights from the car behind the giant shifted and cracked. What...who would actually try to ram Fang? He had to go and investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant dragon swooped down carefully. Fang was moving, but dazed; it might be a little while before the titan could gather his thoughts again. He landed as softly as possible, moving to the car. Inside, he saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David thumped to the ground next to the little hatchback that had crashed into the back of Fang's leg. All things considered, the car looked much worse than the wolf did. Its hood had crumpled nearly to the windshield, which had been completely shattered. Inside, he could just make out the body of Jessica Hallows. She was slumped over the steering wheel, her white fur muddied by a terrible streak of red. There didn't look to be nearly enough room between the seat and the steering column for her chest. She wasn't moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Jess!\" David crouched down and ripped the door off its hinges, planting his other hand on the roof of the car. The whole vehicle rocked from the motion. It was so easy... He didn't think about that just now; he had to get Jess out of here and into safety before Fang came to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seat belt was easy to cut with his claws, but removing Jess from the vehicle was another story. He had no idea what sort of injuries she had just sustained, or what he could possibly do for her if she were too bad off. If the police and ambulances came, Fang would probably destroy them all in his rage. But if he moved her now and ended up hurting her worse while trying to help...David didn't know if he could take that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Jessica began to move before he had to come to that decision. She groaned and tried to shift in her seat, looking around for a moment as if she didn't know where he was. David tried to reach in to help, his forearm scraping the sides of the door he had just broken open. \"Jess, can you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox yelped and slapped at the hand immediately. Then she cried out in pain. David pulled back immediately, not sure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, David. You scared the shit out of me!\" She leaned against the steering wheel, protecting her ribs. \"Where the hell did you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was leading Fang away from the city. I'm hoping that the military will take him on once he gets too close to the base. What were...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess coughed. \"I was going to kill that fucker for what he did to me and Alli. But when I drove back to your place, everybody was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find us?\" David blinked in at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't feeling bad enough to avoid giving him the look she reserved for him when she thought he was being dumb. \"Are you serious? He left a trail of broken concrete that you could see from an airplane.\" She turned to look at the shaggy black mass blocking the road in front of her. \"Speaking of which, how the hell did he get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression froze as something in her brain clicked. \"Oh. God. David, did he--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to make things better, but I just seem to keep making them worse.\" David looked at her, and he felt like he was going to cry. \"I'm weak, Jess. Really weak. I caused this whole mess, and now, because of me it's all gotten out of control...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess shook her head. She looked back from Fang to David, and then back again. \"Well, you're trying to fix it now. That's what counts. Do you really think the military could handle him like...like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope so.\" David gingerly pushed his way through the door frame again. \"Otherwise, what hope do we have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NONE.\" Fang's voice shook the ground as he spoke, and suddenly the small black hill blocking the road moved. The car jumped as the immense black wolf got to his feet and turned around. His yellow eyes glinted in the dim light along the highway as he leaned in, his chest flattening against the asphalt. He growled when he saw Jessica, his muzzle more than capable of snapping up that shattered front of the vehicle. \"You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf moved with astonishing speed. In a split-second, his right paw came up and swatted the car away as if it were a child's toy. Jessica's hatchback went airborne before it landed hard on the shoulder, and then it tumbled into the field next to the road several dozen feet before it came to a stop, on its hood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" David shouted, and started to rush towards the car. He barely noticed Fang's other paw reaching out to grab him in time, and with a beat of his wings he was airborne. His chest strained with the burden of so much muscle and weight, but he shot up just the way he needed to. He felt the air from the wolf's paw against his talons as he leapt skyward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang jumped after him with a growl. The force he used to jump left a deeper crater in the middle of the highway, and David found himself suddenly disturbingly within reach of the giant. Fang stuck out his hand and grabbed the dragon's tail, tugging down viciously as he crashed back down to earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid struggled to get free of Fang's grip, but the wolf was far too strong. He felt the air rippling through his outstretched wings as he came down, and moments after the wolf landed he swung his arm and slammed the dragon hard into the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of white was the only thing that registered, and then a pain so intense David thought he might vomit. He grabbed the back of his head, felt his horns gouged into the road. All he wanted to do was curl up and be left alone. One wing hurt as it scraped against the road; it might have been broken, he didn't know. He didn't get a chance to move before Fang thundered over him, sitting down on his legs and pinning him with his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davey...\" The giant rumbled, planting his paws on the dragon's outstretched wings. \"I told you not to run. Now look what you did. You've gone and got yourself a world of hurt for nothing. I still caught you. And I'm still going to drain you dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid felt Fang's sheath thump over his stomach heavily, and the broad tip pushed out in a heartbeat. The wolf's immense paw reached under it to grip David's own sheath, which responded by swelling into the touch. What the hell was wrong with him? Even after seeing Fang maybe kill one of his friends, after being slammed into the dirt by this asshole, he's still getting aroused? What the fuck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. There we go. Just give me what I want and it'll all be OK. I'll even let you go and check on that bitch afterwards. But try any funny business and I'll fucking break your wing, OK?\" The wolf's claws scraped against his left wing, and David felt pain shoot right to his spine. His erection faltered. Fang frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, David. Don't back out on me now.\" Fang gripped his shaft firmly and stroked it, trying to coax it back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid simply shook his head, cracking an eye open to look at the looming wolf. \"I...I can't. I'm hurt, Fang. And you threatened me and my friend. I don't think there's anyone on the planet who could get aroused under that kind of...pressure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf growled, and the ground seemed to reflect the rumble back at him. David felt it aggravate his wing, and it made him wince. \"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were a fucking girl. You didn't seem to mind me being a little rough with you back in the woods there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was something else.\" David was having a hard time thinking straight. That slam back to the pavement had taken a lot out of him. \"I didn't have a broken wing then, and Jessica wasn't lying hurt or maybe dead in a ditch a couple hundred feet from you. I...I can't do it, Fang. Not now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled, and suddenly the wolf's hand wasn't around his cock. It was around his neck. It was so thick that it forced David's head up so it could fit. Fang squeezed, and he could feel his scales digging into the pads there as the wolf bore down on his windpipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gagged. How...how could Fang be like this? Had he been this big of a monster the whole time, and no one noticed? Or was it his cum? Was it doing something to the wolf that made him so terrible and aggressive? He couldn't understand it. His head hurt like a motherfucker. His vision began to swim as it got harder and harder to get his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, Fang eased the pressure. The wolf's immense, shaggy head was blocking David's view of the sky, and when he growled he got a faceful of teeth. \"Fine. You're hurt? Suck yourself off. Heal yourself. Then I'll treat you like the precious little flower you are, and the real fun can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't have the presence of mind to wonder how Fang knew that his seed healed people. Instead, he...</span></div></div>",

He doubted he could get himself off even if he tried, but that's precisely what he had to do in order to heal himself. And after that? Fang would take power from him, grow even larger, dominate the world around him further still. There was nothing else that David could do. He was caught, and injured, and if he tried to bolt he wouldn't make it very far before the giant wolf captured him again. Something told him his reaction would be even worse than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he thought about Jessica in the wreckage of her car, slammed off the highway and through half a field just because Fang swiped the vehicle in anger. He felt responsible for that. If he had been stronger before, if he had been able to resist or think of some way to prevent Fang from getting what he wanted...that probably wouldn't have happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragon took a deep breath and looked up at the black furry storm cloud that filled the highway in front of him. He had to start doing something to rectify his mistakes. He had to at least try to fix things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang...dude...listen.\" David grunted as he slowly got to his feet, tucking one wing behind him while he held the injured one out at an odd angle. \"I know she tried to hurt you, but...you hurt her best friend. Bad. She was really angry, and she just wanted you to...pay for what you did I guess. But she's my friend, man. And I don't want to have her die in a ditch while I'm having sex with you out on a public road. I have to fix her while I still have the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled, his expression darkening. \"You little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid held up a hand and took a step back. \"STOP, Fang. Look around. You've WON. You're bigger than me, you're stronger than me, you're faster than me. I can't run anywhere. I can't stop you. You're going to get what you want. All I'm asking is that you let me help my friend first. It...it'll make me feel better, and it'll be easier for me to get off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow that had been cast over his eyes lifted somewhat. Fang's chest moved up and down several times with his breath, his fur rippling with the burden of covering all of that strength. Abruptly, the wolf looked away, down the road, out into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned to see what the wolf was staring at. His earfans flicked, but he couldn't pick up anything. It was probably just a matter of time before the authorities followed the wolf's trail of destruction out to where they were, and he had no idea what would happen then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" the wolf boomed suddenly. \"Let's go help your little bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned to watch Fang rise into the air, a colossus of black fur that made him nearly invisible. The ground shook and cracked under his massive paws, themselves nearly wide enough to fill a lane of traffic. \"Dude...thank you. Seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shrugged. His shoulders lifted his cheeks when he did. \"If it means you'll shut up about it, then I guess that's what we've gotta do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned to walk to Jessica's car in a bit of a daze. It was probably the nicest thing that Fang had done since this whole mess began. Maybe there was bits of the old wolf he knew in there somewhere, the one that could be gracious in winning, surprisingly generous when he wasn't out proving he was the biggest, the strongest, the best. Maybe there was a way to just talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the big dragon and the giant wolf to get to the car. David got down on one knee to look inside, and saw Jessica's head and shoulders pressed against the roof of the car. It looked like the steering column had broken free at last, but he had no idea the damage it had done in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the side of the car in both paws and lifted. His left shoulder hurt like hell, a lancing pain that came from the broken bones of his wing. It made him seize, and suddenly only one arm was lifting the car. It wasn't quite enough. He pushed, and the vehicle simply rocked on the hood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Fang pushed the smaller dragon out of the way and scooped one massive paw under the car. He rocked it gently until he get his fingers under it, and then he simply turned it. He slowed the roll of the vehicle with his thumb until it was right side up, and then he gently pushed it back down on the ground. \"You need me to rip off the roof for you too, weakling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the tone in Fang's voice that made the insult sting less than usual. \"No. I've got it from here.\" David tried to put steel in his throat but he couldn't muster much of it. He was just so tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached in with one hand to grab Jessica and pulled the vixen gingerly from the wreckage. Her body slumped in his fingers, and she showed no response when he laid her on the grass. Blood had streaked her fur in multiple spots, but none of her limbs stuck out at funny angles or anything. That had to have been good for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid knelt at her side and watched her. Please let her be alive, he thought. The idea of her dead made tears come to his eyes, and he forced them back before they could fall. He couldn't think about that right now. He needed to get off and heal her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands found his cock easily, and he rolled the sensitive flesh in his fingers. He looked up into the sky and tried not to think of how this looked. Here he was, a hulking monster, in a field with a certified giant masturbating over the wounded body of an arctic fox. What could he say if the military showed up, or the police? This wasn't what it looked like? He was actually healing her by shooting semen all over her body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed out loud at the thought, and he quickly bit his lower lip to stop himself from collapsing into a fit of giggles. This was so fucked up. He felt his shaft stir at last after minutes of stroking, and he closed his eyes to fall into the feeling. He imagined himself touching Fang immediately, his taloned fingers buried in a massive shaggy pelt of black fur to feel unyielding, immense muscle underneath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock jumped in his hands and he rolled his hips to push the underchannel against his palm. David imagined himself sprawled on top of the colossal wolf, the beast's great head framed by grass and small bushes, a happy and contented look on his face. They kissed, Fang's muzzle dominating his own, and he lifted his tail as he felt that widowmaker of a cock warming the area between his legs. He let himself have the fantasy; it was the only thing that would get him aroused at the moment, and that's what mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon pumped his heavy shaft several times, his breath steaming in the night air as his arousal built. It turned out to be surprisingly easy to stroke himself off once he got going, and it quickly got to the point where he forgot everything around him and simply enjoyed it. Within only a few minutes, David pointed his shaft up against his stomach and clenched. His shaft thickened with its load, and a strong, heavy spurt of seed rocketed past his horns before falling back down on his wide chest. He gasped at the feeling, and the second spurt shot higher than the first. The climax took his breath away after that, his body visibly tensinig all over as he produced jolt after jolt of healing, growth-inducing cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more than a minute, David was finally able to relax. He looked down at himself, practically covered with his own seed. He rumbled and licked the stuff off his chest without thinking, then looked down to see a good portion of it covering the grass, and Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of her body jolted him back from the present, his afterglow fading as quickly as the buzz of growth was building all over his body. He leaned down and gripped her head in one huge hand, trying to ignore the euphora that brought his erection back to life instantly. \"Help me, Fang. We have to make sure she swallows at least a little.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response. David cursed to himself (low enough so that the wolf wouldn't hear), and lifted Jessica to his other hand. The fox's nose twitched, and she immediately recoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, David?\" she croaked. She was too weak to put her hands up, but it looked like she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was more than strong enough to hold her fast, and getting bigger and stronger all the time. \"Drink this,\" he said. \"It'll make you better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only held her nose away for a moment more before she lapped his hand a few times and swallowed. \"You know how messed up--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" David said, and patted her shoulder. \"Trust me, this is plenty weird for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica made a face as she tasted David, even though her injuries were beginning to fade almost immediately.  \"It's a pretty fucking disgusting superpower, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid laughed.  A wave of relief washed over him as he watched the bruises that had matted Jessica's fur lighten and fade. The change in her demeanor was just as quick, and she began testing her limbs and straightening her back. She smiled up at him, and then she began to inch upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm sorry for...\" David began. Then there were two heavy, rhythmic shakes before a black shape barreled into him. The dragon slid a few feet in the grass, dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he sat up, he saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a moment or two for David to figure out what was happening, and when he did he couldn't believe it. There was Fang, a small black mountain, looming over Jessica and the wreckage of her car. He was snarling down at her, his oversized teeth filling his muzzle, drool dripping down onto the mass of his chest. Jess was underneath his right hand, squirming and hissing and scratching as best she could. He had her pinned easily, though; his hand covered most of her still-growing torso, and his fingers were thicker than her arm. He pushed down, using just a fraction of his weight to sink her into the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, what are you doing?\" David heard himself roaring at the giant, his heart hammering in his ears. He could try to fight Fang, but he was still hurt and the wolf was simply too big and too powerful. There was little he could do here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET GO OF ME!\" Jessica roared and surged, her body swelling up into Fang's paw as she scratched and bit. She was turning into a rather impressive specimen, her anger apparently fueling her growth at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tickles,\" Fang rumbled, \"but you should really stop it.\" His fingers clenched around Jessica's body, and he put more of his weight down on top of her. She stopped squirming with a yelp, and that sound was cut off when she couldn't spare the breath for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, stop it!\" David shouted and moved closer. Fang was ignoring him for now, and he tried to steel himself for an attempt at gaining his attention. This might hurt, a lot, but he couldn't let the wolf do whatever it is he was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.\" Fang leaned in a bit more, his chest nearly brushing the ground while his muzzle was still several feet away from Jessica's. \"Are you feeling better? You don't have to speak. Nod yes, shake your head no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stopped in his tracks. Did he just ask Jessica if she was OK? He watched on in fascination. He suddenly had no idea where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded, then started squirming with what little room she had. Even though her claws were noticeably longer than before, each rake across the webbing between Fang's fingers or the back of his paw didn't seem to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant wolf simply pressed down harder and growled. The fur at the back of his head bristled, and Jessica stopped. Her tongue was lolling now, her breath steaming in the night air. David was sure that if she weren't bigger and stronger than before, Fang would be hurting her. He didn't know his own strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to stop it,\" he growled. \"Don't fucking move again.\" He waited for her signal that she understood before continuing. \"You're really lucky that David here is such a good friend. It's the only reason you're alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think your time would be better spent taking care of Allison? I mean, she's probably sitting in your house, all alone, wondering where you are and if you're coming back at all. Why would you leave your friend alone like that in her hour of need?\" Fang tilted his head, his cheek resting on one swollen shoulder. \"I think you should go back to her and make sure she's OK. And stay by her side for a few days to see that she has all the support she needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched as Fang's fingers clenched further. Jessica squirmed reflexively until she couldn't any more, and she gave a yelp of pain. \"Because if I see you near me again, David won't be able to stop me from making sure you don't try to hurt me again. You feel how much your ribs are hurting right now? I'm not even trying, little girl. Imagine what would happen to you if I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's heart leapt in his throat. What in the world was this? How could Fang...say that to her? Who in the world was this guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang eased his grip on Jessica's torso, staring down at her with his burning golden eyes. \"I'm going to let you up now. If you do anything besides walk away from me when I do, I'm going to beat you to death with your own car. You got me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded, and Fang lifted his paw and thumped it down next to her. He stared at her as she got up, her clothes ruined in the accident and her expansion, and turned to walk away. She stopped next to the dragon and smiled up at him. \"Thanks, David. You're a knucklehead, but you're not a bad guy. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched up on her toes, and he leaned down. She kissed him on the cheek and then whispered, \"I'm going to try to call the police and tell them where you are. Just...keep him away from people until they get here, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded, and he gave her a brief hug with the arm that wouldn't send lances of pain through his entire body. \"Thanks, Jess. Give Alli a hug for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other, and then Jess ran off. David couldn't help but notice how much her fuller breasts bounced as she jogged back to town. He caught himself thinking, she doesn't look half bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how I handled that, fag?\" Fang's voice boomed behind him, and David felt the twin shocks of the wolf standing up to his full height. David turned to face him, trying his best not to look afraid. He found the giant wolf peering down at him, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, Fang? You didn't have to threaten her.\" David took a step back away from the looming giant. No matter how much distance he put between himself and the giant, it never seemed to be enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shrugged. \"I wasn't threatening her. I was explaining our new arrangement.\" His smile faded, and he looked around at the seed covering the grass. \"Now come on and fix yourself up, David. We don't have a lot of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang grinned. \"Time before the police or the military or whatever get here. I heard what Jess said to you, that little bitch.\" He stepped forward, instantly erasing the distance between himself and the dragon. \"We're not going to be here for a showdown. We're going to go somewhere nice and quiet, and then I'm going to drain you dry to get even bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's heart sank. His mind raced to think of something he could do to stall for time. But he couldn't think of anything. Fang was enormous, insanely strong and fast, and single-minded. Even before he became this colossus, he knew exactly how to use his size to get what he wanted. At this size, he was nothing short of unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up! We don't have all night.\" Fang dropped down to all fours, even then looming over the much smaller dragon. \"I'll tell you what. I'm going to start licking this up, and you'd better take some if you want that wing of yours to straighten itself out. If you don't, well....it's going to be a while before you can get to a hospital to get it fixed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore David could say anything, Fang started to lick up the copious amount of seed that was laying on the field. The wolf rumbled as he swallowed, then licked another huge swath. It was disappearing fast; David would have to hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned down over a puddle of his own cooling spunk and started licking. He would have to play Fang's game for now, at least until he could come up with a way to turn the tables.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David sunk down to his hands and knees, and began lapping up his own seed. He tried to hold his breath while he did so, but it was impossible not to smell his own musk. By now the seed was drying and cooling, and the texture made it difficult to swallow. Still, he needed to try; Fang was already so much larger, and he had taken in three-quarters of the remaining flood already. The wolf was going to be getting even larger now, and David needed to be in the best possible shape to combat that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten-foot dragon flickered his earfans as he felt warmth growing in his stomach and spreading out to his broad chest. He tried to ignore the sinking feeling in his heart about his situation. He had tried to defy Fang once before, and the titanic wolf broke his wing and nearly killed his friend without even breaking a sweat. Now he could hear the titan's rumbling starting to deepen already, signalling that the growth had begun. The already unstoppable wolf would be even more powerful. And the only thing that could keep that from happening was him becoming more of a freak himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked as much of his own seed as possible, his throat bobbling inside his monstrously thick neck. He felt his broken wing already beginning to adjust itself, the membrane knitting together while those long, specialized fingers reset their joints to their proper positions. He could also feel himself starting to grow larger, his chest booming between thickening arms while is back crept up to threaten even more of his neck and shoulders. His flight muscles strengthened while they repaired themselves, and his weight slowly but steadily increased. With the nagging pain of his injuries fading until they disappeared entirely, David began to lose himself to the joy of expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen feet became eleven feet, and then twelve by the time he finished licking up the remainder of his seed. He could feel the thump of Fang's movements as the giant wolf made sure the small field next to the highway was completely clean, but they felt more distant now. The sensations of his own body took up more of his attention. He could feel muscle pushing underneath his scales, those fine scales growing larger and stronger to compensate. He felt his fingers and toes digging deeper into the dirt as his weight grew, and he felt his own body growing larger and bulkier, more unwieldy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shaft pulsed out of its casing as the feeling of power grew within him, and he rumbled at the feel of his arousal building. It was an intoxicating feeling, make no mistake. He could see why Fang loved it so much. The thought of the wolf gave him a small ping of worry, but he was able to push that thought out of his mind easily. His wings felt as good as new -- no, better. He could feel those muscles stretch as they grew out longer and more durable, swelling disproportionately in order to still carry his inordinate bulk. He was getting less flight-worthy all the time, his body densely packed with strength, practically brimming with it. He rose up to his full height, another foot added to it in the meantime, and flexed his cock just to feel the weight of it bobbing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been two feet long, and it was still growing. He could practically feel his arousal building in pulses, that intense wash of pleasure infusing every inch of his growing body. The way his arm crashed against his side when he tried to grab his shaft made him hiss in pleasure, and he slowly closed his eyes as his eyes closed around his thickening member. His chest lurched forward as his pecs grew, and his arms shoved against his torso as his upper arms thickened as well. It was awkward just to stroke himself in both hands, but it was the best kind of awkward he'd ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was practically beating in his brain as he grew up to fourteen feet tall. His breath was starting to get choice, the sensation of growth only becoming more intense as his arousal heightened. His cock strained inside its skin as it expanded, each heartbeat drawing him out another inch or so. Beneath the rising spire of masculinity, he felt his balls growing disproportionately larger, already filled with more of his seed and becoming more so. His balls were so packed they almost hurt, and the need for release started to make his blood boil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....God...\" David rumbled, through gritted teeth. He tried to force himself to relax, opening his eyes and muzzle, panting against the unnatural lust making it impossible to think straight. He saw his own body swelling inside his vision, his chest so thick that he had to hunch over to see the ground. He felt his neck swallowed by his shoulders, and he felt the power he wielded every time he moved. It was getting to be too much. He needed to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, David.\" The dragon heard a growl that rumbled the ground under his feet with a surprising force. He looked around, and saw a shaggy black mountain rising in front of him, so tall that he didn't even come up to the titan's mid-thigh. Fang's titanic leg swelled visibly as he took a step forward, and the paw that landed punched a print over a foot deep in the soft grass. Instantly, that paw grew, pushing aside huge chunks of dirt and grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang had grown ten feet taller in the time it took David to grow five, and the wolf was still expanding. He loomed over the expanding dragon and panted, each breath seeming to make him bigger and bigger, forcing the smaller reptile to crane his head back further. The wolf's black fur puffed underneath insane musculature, his yellow eyes and flashing white teeth marking his face apart from the night sky. \"You look good enough to eat, David. Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he could take. He sank to his knees and he felt his balls flop over his thighs and brush the grass below. Then it felt like something physical was being ripped out of him. He couldn't breath. His heart strained. And then he was orgasming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang fell on top of him like a building toppled over, and just like that his shaft was buried in the maw of the giant wolf. His whole body was shaken by the giant's rumbling, his shaft caressed by an enormous, soft tongue. If anything, it only redoubled his climax. When he found the breath, he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his expansion waning at 16 feet, but the orgasm that wracked his body more than made up for it. He could feel Fang growing from the effects of his last dosage still, and he was greedily slurping down every shot of seed that David could produce. Each spurt lasted for two or three seconds, and was of firehose intensity. Who knows how many gallons he produced with each pump, but there always seemed to be more. His balls clenched tightly, as full as every, and even after seven or eight spurts each blast felt as full and violent as the first. He groaned and shivered underneath the giant wolf, trapped underneath the monster, his mind gone blank with the singular pleasure of release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, it didn't matter that Fang was getting exactly what he wanted, that David was making an unmanageable situation even worse by helping the wolf achieve his dream of being a bona-fide giant. All that mattered was the rush of bliss wracking his overmuscled body, stealing the energy that had built too high within him and replacing it with unclenched muscles and the tingle of contentment. His vision grew unfocused as the climax continued, a dozen spurts of several gallons pouring down Fang's throat with little signs of slowing down yet. Fang simply closed his eyes and drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed before David slumped and finally relaxed, exhausted. Fang rumbled as he looked down at the shrinking dragon, 55 feet tall and booming larger with every breath. He could feel a vast reserve of power being absorbed within him. When he was done growing, he would be an unquestioned god. David would be his, and soon enough, the entire town...</span></div></div>",

He could feel the vast energy swelling within him, making him stronger and bigger. The black furred canine held a look of unadulterated bliss as his body stretched, muscle building upon muscle, expanding to new heights. He was so high off this new state of growth that he didn\u2019t notice or acknowledge the oncoming weaponry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of metal scraping across the ground along with thin footsteps made his ears flick for a few moments as he simply continued growing. Whoever was there was obviously too small for him to care about, so why bother? Fifty-five feet came and went as Fang\u2019s body swelled outward. The canine\u2019s thick neck gurgled for a moment as he soon let out a roar. It was a roar of dominance. David and the town were effectively his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military response was effectively a \u201cHell no.\u201d. If Fang had bothered to look, he would see several tanks, along with dozens of men armed top to bottom with guns and other assorted weapons. They saw the looming wolf before them, some of the men shaking in their feet. They had no idea what the hell was going on, but they knew they had to do their job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple call of \u201cfire!\u201d, the chaos started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullets upon bullets began raining down on Fang\u2019s thick hide, the metal simply bouncing off as it had hit a thick, rubber like surface. At least seventy feet and still going, this was nothing but a nuisance to the canine. He considered doing something about it, but it was fun to let them try. Better they learn themselves that they couldn't stop him then him having to move from this all too comfortable spot. He could barely see past his titanic chest, but he knew David was under that thick, rolling bulk and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Fang didn't even register the bullets hitting him as a surge of growth overtook the canine. Another roar released him his throat, his already muscled body swelled. Soon enough, the army men began to flee for their own safety. The tanks had attempted to aim and fire as well, but the effect was the same: nothing.  They needed something stronger to try and take down this beast, and it was apparent in the fact that Fang didn't even move a muscle and they were already leaving in what seemed like terror. Whether it was a tactical retreat or not, they\u2019d probably be back, Fang thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, they\u2019ll learn soon enough\u2026\u201d the massive canine rumbled, small shock waves running through the pinned David and the ground. He'd reached at least hundreds of feet, and the process didn't seem to be waning anytime soon. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang needed to lean over his bulging chest just to see David slump and sprawl out on the grass at his feet. The dragon was undoubtedly attractive -- the growth had made a real man out of him. Even laid prone and exhausted like that, the reptile's massive chest heaved as he breathed, pushing his bulk into thick arms probably the size of telephone poles. His spent shaft laid over his torso like a fallen log, the immense balls beneath them already firming up with their next loads. Anyone would have thought the dragon a paragon of masculinity, an unstoppable powerhouse of might. To Fang, he was his favorite and his first, the most cherished of a whole world full of toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always been in love with his own power, ever since he discovered that he was a lot bigger than his classmates in kindergarten. All of his life he had been bigger and stronger than anyone else -- he got to the point where he towered over his old man in his junior year of high school, and he hadn't stopped growing yet. The ability to do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, had been his for so long that he had gotten accustomed to it. By the time he was in college, even police officers thought twice about approaching him whenever someone complained, and that was just the way he liked it. He saw himself as a benevolent dictator on-campus; just recognize who was calling the shots, and he could be a loyal, protective friend. Most of the football team had fallen in line by now, and look at how they were treated on campus? They were the elites; no one fucked with them, and it was because of Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now...now he could rule over far more than the university. The town was his, and if he figured out how to milk David enough, even more than that. He felt the power as a little furnace inside his stomach, churning out heat to the rest of his body that dissipated into growth. With every breath his chest puffed a little further, making it even more difficult for him to see over it. His arms crowded against his lats, biceps balling with immense power even when relaxed. His neck thickened until it practically merged with his widening shoulders, making him look muscle-bound. And his thighs surged and crashed into each other, forcing the heavy sac and sheath of his to bobble obscenely on top of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant laughed at the feeling, and the boom of his own voice made him laugh harder. He threw his head back into the sky and laughed until he howled, feeling each sound send him a foot or two higher and who knows how many tons heavier. His voice shook the earth he stood upon and echoed through the trees next to the road. When he finally looked down at David, the dragon looked positively tiny. If he were standing, he wouldn't even come up to the wolf's knee. And he was still getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sheath stirred and then split immediately, his shaft far too large to fit inside if there was even a hint of arousal. Fang boomed two heavy breaths as the rush of hormones that came with excitement hit him; combined with the euphoria of growth it was almost overwhelming. He squeezed his own chest just to grip a shaft that was sliding out foot by foot, the width of a tree and growing thicker all the time. Maybe he could wake David up by flooding the field he was napping in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement caught his eye, beyond the road and in the direction of town. He rumbled as he watched a small band of people moving towards him. He sniffed the air, but caught nothing but his own intensely dominant scent. His vantage point got better as he grew bigger, though the bulk of his own chest was forming an increasingly prominent barrier at the bottom of his field of vision. Who were these people? Did Jessica round up some kind of posse from town to try and take him out. He grinned to himself. He'd love to have the chance to show that bitch what he could do without even thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until they crossed the road that he recognized them; it was part of the football team, only drastically different. Jason, the lion, looked almost as musclebound as he did, his teeth sabres jutting out of his muzzle past his chin. Rick the bear was immense, as tall as a two-story building and three times the weight. And Ben the horse was perfectly proportioned as a superheavyweight bodybuilder, though his equine characteristics seem to have gotten out of hand. Even though the horse barely came up to the top of his paw, he was as proportionately endowed as the wolf. His balls hid the incredible mass of his thighs, and his sheath hid the cobbles of his abs nearly up to the ribcage. Rounding out the crew was Marcus, who was far less impressive than the other three and looked positively tiny now; and Tyler, David's brother, who looked to have sampled some of his own brother's magic seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, what do we have here?\" His voice was a sonic shock to the tiny giants, and he rumbled at the sound of it deepening. Even though they had clearly outgrown the ability to fit inside rooms, Fang towered over the lot of them, as big as a building and still climbing. \"Come to see me off as I take over the town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group stopped right there. Fang saw Tyler look to David at his feet, a flicker of worry crossing his features. Rick stepped forward, the bear easily twice the size of Marcus, his leg thicker than the kangaroo's shoulder. Jason and Ben both stepped in front of the smaller guys, as if protecting them. How cute, the wolf thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fang, you don't have to do this.\" Jason was the first to speak. His voice had grown deeper, rougher, coming out in a natural snarl. \"You have to stop. You're hurting people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing I have to do, shorty, is whatever I WANT to do.\" Fang boomed over them, tilting forward to see them past the impossible swell of his chest. He was still getting bigger, his shaft grinding between his pecs as it steadily reached its full erection. He never wanted this feeling to end; it was better than any drug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed down to all fours, the shockwave actually making the three giants stumble. David tumbled along the field in his sleep, and both Tyler and Marcus were knocked off their feet. He felt the swell of his chest force his erection to grow into the grass, and felt his bulk nearly push against the ground as he grew. He planted hands that were nearly as wide as the road a bit further apart, and growled in approval at the way the earth shook. \"And what I want is to rule this town. I think I'm plenty big enough to take it apart piece by piece until I get what I want, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang watched the look on their faces. Even on all fours he towered over all of them, and they were getting smaller all the time. Rick had a moment of hesitation before he snarled and stepped forward, his impressive claws bared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, mutt. You have to go through me if you think--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monstrous wolf did little more than flick his paw. The back of his hand hit Rick like an immense, furry wall and sent the bear flying. He didn't land until he reached the other side of the road, and he crashed through the trees with a terrible noise. \"Done,\" he rumbled, as he felt the growth beginning to fade. He was nearing 150 feet tall by now, the size of a small skyscraper. It was nothing to slap a twenty foot bear half a mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Jason cried out, and then all hell broke loose. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was amazing that no one had heard the helicopter coming. Jason shouted, and then suddenly Fang's face was lit by a spotlight and heavy-caliber weapons fire dotted his hide from the middle of his back to his right shoulder. He grunted, annoyed, and turned to see the black helicopter hovering 100 feet off the ground. The light was far too bright for anyone to see inside, but they did hear the voice blare over a megaphone. \"This is the United States Army. Lie down flat on the ground with your hands behind your head immediately. You are being taken into our custody. This is your final warning. If you do not comply immediately, you will--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The. FUCK?\" Fang's rumbling voice drowned out the megaphone, and the wolf rose back to a standing position as he turned to face the helicopter. He rose, and rose, and rose, a black wall rising until his head towered over the helicopter; suddenly, they were flying at the level of the monster's impossible chest, and were getting lower all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\" Fang roared, his car-sized mitts grabbing the helicopter as it tried to evade him. He shook it hard, crumpling the steel in his fingers. \"I AM YOUR GOD NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words burned themselves into the brains of the smaller giants gathered at the monster's feet, the sheer volume of his shout making the air vibrate with the power of it. Jason looked to Ben, then nodded to David. \"We need to get them out of here while he's distracted. We'll carry him over to the woods, see if Ben's OK. Then we get the fuck out of here.\" The giant horse nodded and waddled over to the unconscious dragon. Jason lumbered after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he hissed, when he saw Marcus and Tyler following close behind. \"You two get to cover; find out where Ben landed and help him if you can. We'll be right behind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can help,\" Marcus began, but Tyler put a paw on the kangaroo's shoulder and shook his head. The lion was right; Fang was far, far too huge and power-hungry to be dealt with right now. They had to escape and figure out another way to bring the wolf down. There was no way they would be able to do it in open combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took David's head and shoulders, while Ben took the dragon's feet and tail. The enormous football player must have weighed tons by now, and even with the superior strength of the lion and the horse it was a struggle to lift him off the ground. Carrying him was a slow and arduous affair, but they shuffled towards the road leading out of town as quickly as they could. Marcus and Tyler were already across the road and disappearing into the treeline, through the gap that Rick had made when he was slapped. When Jason saw it, his heart skipped a beat; he had no idea what to expect when he found the bear. There was no way someone could take a hit like that and be OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion spared a glance in Fang's direction as they carried the dragon. The wolf was roaring unintelligibly in his rage, crumpling the helicopter in his paws and slamming it into the dirt at his feet. The two soldiers inside were almost surely dead; hopefully they were able to radio back to the base that they were in serious trouble. What's worse, Fang was still growing, approaching 200 feet and growing even thicker, heavier, and more virile. The skyscraper-sized wolf kicked the twisted, burning wreckage of the helicopter back towards the base and rumbled his pleasure. He started to stroke his erection shamelessly, pleased with the wanton destruction, the loss of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason could barely believe what he was seeing; was this who Fang really was? Some power-mad monster who could casually kill or injure anyone weaker than him? How in the world did he not see this before? The lion huffed as he carried the dragon towards the road a little more quickly. They were almost there; if the wolf could just stay distracted with his own arousal for long enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see what I did to that helicopter, you little toys?\" The wolf's voice boomed clearly in the clear night air. \"If I could get rid of the military just like that, what the fuck do you think I would do to you if you stepped up to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason heard the wolf turn to where he thought David would be. There was a grunt of shock when he only found the dragon's imprint. \"David?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground leaped when Fang fell to all fours again to see where they had went to. His voice rumbled louder, and Jason couldn't help but notice the note of panic in it. \"David??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAVID!?!\" Jason's heart slammed inside his chest. That next shout was aimed directly at them; they had been found out. The lion's ears flattened as Fang's enraged roar threatened to burst his eardrums. He felt the sound through his whole body; it was painfully loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run,\" Jason huffed, and Ben did his best to double-time with David's immense bulk. They heard the slam of Fang's footfalls coming towards them, then a different sort of boom. The monstrous wolf actually yelped from the impact, and Jason lifted his eyes to see that tanks were rolling across the field towards them. This had officially gotten insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion, horse and dragon were nearly to the trees, and Fang whipped his great, shaggy head back and forth on an impossibly thick set of shoulders to look between the retreating furs and the incoming tanks. Jason prayed that the wolf would re-engage with the military, just to buy them enough time to flee.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang looked towards the retreating figures near the forest, nearly out of his mind with anger, confusion and hormones. How dare they try to escape with HIS dragon right out from under his nose? Didn't they know who the fuck they were dealing with? He was an unstoppable GOD now. How DARE they undermine him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something like a pebble being thrown at his arm, and his thick pelt rippled with a reflexive response. His huge ears swiveled in the direction the projectile came from, and caught the sound of a tank's shell being fired. He had to lean over to see the little thing past his chest and insane erection, so big and throbbing now he doubted it would ever go down. One massive mitt stroked his member as his lips curled into a cruel smile. He could still feel himself getting stronger, muscles crowding each other and warping him into an even more-impossible being. His paws were slowly, steadily growing through the grass, punching deeper prints into them. If a tank shell felt like a pebble to him now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rumbling growl made the earth tremble beneath him. \"You're going to be so sorry you did that.\" He watched as the three tanks backed away from him and wheeled around to flee, and he knew they wouldn't be quick enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic wolf took one step forward and crunched through the back half of one tank. The claw of one of his middle toes simply pierced the shell of the turret and caught some vital inner working. He could feel the force of the explosion pop beneath him, but it didn't hurt at all. It barely moved him. He moved that paw forward and stomped down, growling in pleasure at the visible shockwave it caused; the burning tank was instantly extinguished in the middle of the print, and the two remaining leapt into the air and crashed back to the grass. One of them made a high-pitched whirr and would only move slowly and to the left; the other continued back towards the base at a faster pace that was still little more than a crawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang chuckled as he leaned down, involuntarily shivering as the cliff of his chest brushed against his hyper-sensitive erection. One immense paw scooped up the disabled tank and a good bit of the earth beneath it. He watched as it struggled with more urgency, getting nowhere in the plain of his pawpad. Better yet, it was still, just perceptibly, getting smaller. His free paw gave his erection a good pump, and he restrained the urge to howl as a sudden geyser of seed gushed out of him. It arced high into the air before landing across the fence of the base several hundred feet out. His balls were so full they hurt; he could feel them swelling over his thighs as he grew, and his dick was so hard it felt like it would split. He could barely think straight. The power was so intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're real fucking sorry now in there, aren't you?\" He imagined his voice booming through the thin armor of the tank, the two furs inside deafened by it. \"After what you saw with the chopper, you thought you could test me?\" His voice rose, and the echo resonated with a boom for what could have been miles. \"This is what happens when you do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe curled up his massive paw into a fist, obscuring the tank from view. The turret bent and cracked first, and then he felt the main structure beginning to crumple under the pressure. All it took was a flex from a forearm the relative size of a ham, and all that was left of the machinery was a crumpled, oozing heap of twisted metal. He reared his arm back and threw it, watching it disappear quickly into the night sky, blossoming into a speck of fire on the ground so far away. Fang's eyes lidded and he growled again as he stroked his member. Seed shot from it twice, soaking the ground in front of him, falling to flood the one remaining tank still trying to escape. He wasn't even close to orgasm, but he was building to it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster watched the tank make its slow retreat, leaning forward and tilting his head on a neck that had disappeared into his traps. He smirked as he took a single step, the impact making the tank leap again, placing it right back under his oppressive shadow. He struggled to navigate around his bulk, the 250-foot wolf reaching for the tank. He'd save this one until he got to the military base. It would be his calling card. He'd make sure they understood exactly who they were dealing with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason almost collapsed with relief when he saw Fang turn his immense back towards the tanks. His legs pistoned him towards the trees with David in tow; Ben, his long stride hampered by the obscene endowment between his legs, struggled to keep up. He felt a flash of sympathy for the horse, then annoyance. They were going to have to dig deep if they wanted to make it out of this alive. Ben was going to have to find that extra gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down,\" the horse panted as soon as he crashed through the treeline. His broad shoulders knocked off branches effortlessly, and he barely flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up,\" the lion countered. His own body was so big it hampered him. He kept bumping into trees as well, and he had to squeeze his arms against his chest just to carry the massive dragon. It was awkward, but it wasn't difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had gone a couple hundred feet inside the forest, he paused to look around. He could hear Tyler and Marcus crashing around, looking for Rick, but he couldn't see them. How difficult could it be to find him? He was twenty feet tall, for Pete's sake. He had to have left a massive trail after being...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck him suddenly, what Fang had done. He had probably killed the bear as easily as one might swat a fly. Then he had crumpled actual military officers in a helicopter. He was very likely killing the ones in tanks too. Even now, the lion could hear the boom of the wolf as he moved and spoke, the lust and power evident in the syllables but little else. He grunted as he picked up the dragon and nodded for Ben to do the same. The tanks wouldn't occupy the monster for long, and they would need to be hidden somewhere safe by the time he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let's find the others and get to safety. You know where they are?\" He was already on the move by the time Ben nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I see them over there. Looks like they found Rick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason followed Ben's gaze, and found the dragon and kangaroo helping the much bigger bear to his feet. He was amazed that beyond a few scrapes, an obvious limp and -- well -- what might be a serious injury, Rick didn't look that beat up. It was nothing that he didn't endure on the football field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is that fucker?\" the bear growled, thumping towards them. \"I'll teach him not to cold-cock me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fucker is the size of Godzilla right now and taking out the military. We'd better take the chance to get away from him and regroup.\" Jason grunted as he struggled to keep David in his paws. The dragon seemed to be getting heavier by the moment. \"Can you walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we're just going to run away?\" Rick's voice carried quite well through the trees, forcing Jason to instinctively flatten his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, because as much as we want to we can't beat him. He smacked you into a crater a thousand feet away without even breaking a sweat, dude. And he's still getting bigger. I thought you were dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That asshole is going to be the one who's dead. We just...need someone willing to suck off the fag enough to take Fang on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion flinched at that and glanced to Marcus and Ben. It seemed like half the football team was gay at this point, and people were going to have to start watching their language. Especially if said gay people were the size of buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, they had to get to safety. Jason could pick that battle later. \"Whatever, dude. We just got to get to cover. Then we can figure out our next move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw a barn about half a mile that way.\" Marcus pointed back towards the impact crater where they found Rick. \"It should be just far enough away that Fang can't find us. If he doesn't have some kind of freaky kaiju radar or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged his enormous shoulders, noting the way they brushed against his cheeks and the base of his ears. \"If he does, we're screwed anyway. Good enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group slowly made their way to the barn, slipping inside the massive double doors. Ben and Rick had to duck, and Jason had to turn sideways. The five of them crowded inside the expansive space, bumping into each other, the hayloft and the pillars holding up various things. It wouldn't be comfortable, but they hoped it would keep them safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Jason said at last, when he couldn't take the sound of Fang stomping around outside. \"Who's hurt?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang could barely see his heavy paws beneath the incredible mass of his chest and the gigantic, tree-sized bulk of his own shaft, but what he could see made him growl with lust. Each footfall caused the ground to ripple visibly, tearing up huge chunks of grass, cracking the concrete and sending a shockwave of dirt and plants spreading out around it. He could even hear the thump of it between the roar of his breathing, or the constant rumble of his voice. He felt high with his own power, almost dizzy with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis biceps grew into the side of his torso, and his pectorals stretched and flexed as he slowly stroked himself. He took another step and felt himself growing bigger. He gasped and shivered as his shaft leapt and spurted gallons of seed high into the air. The line came down across the fence barricading the small military compound he loomed over, instantly crushing it. If he could do that without even trying, imagine what he could do if he set his mind to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted the tank in his paw, casually grinding the tread against the forest of his chestfur. He couldn't quite see the panicked furs inside through the top, but he knew they were in there. He imagined them, panicky and hopeless, knowing that they were at the mercy of someone with far more power than they possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you didn't think you would be flying in that little contraption, did you?\" Fang grinned down at the tank as he held it against the top of his chest. \"Bet you had no idea what would be in store for you, did you? Well, you're going to be my scouts now. Go on and knock on the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 300-foot wolf reared his paw back and flicked the tank like a skipping stone. It made a horrendous crash as it slammed through another part of the compound's fence, crashed through one of the first buildings along the edge and tumbled through a vast, open area. Fang could barely make out soldiers scrambling to get out of the way of the burning wreckage the tank had become, and growled his approval at the chaos he had caused. There was a thin trail of broken concrete, brick, wood and glass leading from the gigantic wolf to the middle of the complex, the burning hulk of the tank a firefly-sized pinpoint of flame at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang inhaled and felt his chest rise up at the bottom of his vision, brushing against the top of his shaft. His eyes narrowed as he nearly gave himself over to his lust and orgasmed right there. He might have, actually, had he not felt what felt like a bee sting hit him in the thigh right above the knee. It barely missed one of his over-burdened testicles, the heat of the explosion from...whatever it was that hit him surely singing the fur there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf growled, and it sounded like thunder. He was too aroused to be truly angry, but he knew what he needed to do to put down this new threat. His burning yellow eyes scanned the ground below, and he quickly found the smoke trail he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had launched a rocket-propelled grenade at him. Fang's eyes narrowed at his new target when the remaining rooftops of the military complex lit up with similar fire; automatic weapons, high-caliber fire, anti-tank missiles -- the works. All of it streamed towards the impossible giant, and he felt the impact of it all against his tough hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stung, even hurt. But it was by no means incapacitating -- not even close. The thigh of the giant wolf was thicker than most of the buildings the soldiers were standing on, and muscles stronger than anyone knew flickered underneath his pelt at the impact. Fang growled louder, glaring down at these impudent little insects. They had no idea who they were messing with, but they would find out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bugs,\" he boomed, snarling as he lowered himself down to all fours. His hands slammed into the dirt right in front of the complex, uprooting the fence entirely and slamming it against buildings that had been cracked in the shockwave. Fang's chest punched the ground between his forearms, forcing his own erection to dig a trench into the dirt. He felt his sac tug and another small flood of semen instantly filled the hole he had created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know who I am?\" His voice carried through the night, calling the spotlights towards him. His eyes seemed to glow in the bright, white beams; his teeth gleamed and his black fur reflected its sheen right back. No one knew exactly how big he was at this point; they only knew that he was monstrous, and he had beaten their helicopters, their tanks, their heavy artillery. The only thing they had done by opening fire was gaining his full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your new god. I am your Lord and master. I am your destruction!\" He rose to his full height and lumbered forward. His footpaw slammed through a building, erasing two-thirds of it into his pawprint. He kicked forward with his other foot, another building exploding into rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore gunfire, soldiers screaming, all erased by the thundering growl of the towering wolf laying waste to the military installation. Fang stomped buildings with his massive paws, swatted others with his hands, even ground them under his shaft. There was twenty minutes of constant earthquakes, explosions, unnatural growls and the dying pops of gunfire as the soldiers defending themselves either fled or were dispatched. After that, there was only Fang, standing triumphant over acres of wreckage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had stopped growing during the rampage, finally reaching the height of 350 feet tall. His musculature had grown so heavy that he looked squat despite his size, his forearms alone the proportional size of hams. He gripped what he could of his oversized shaft and howled, finally allowing himself to crest over into climax. If there had been any windows left, they would have shattered by the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlooding ropes of seed gushed over the ruined buildings again and again, washing away some of the debris but mostly making a lake of a significant portion of the installation. Fang's heart hammered in his chest as he came; his ears flattened and his eyes squeezed shut. For a minute, then two, then three, there was nothing but the sensation of every nerve firing pleasure right into his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he could breathe again, he found that he had practically collapsed. He was lying on his back inside of his own crater, covered in his own spunk and panting with the effort of bearing his own orgasm. His muscles felt sore from locking and flexing so much. He felt light-headed, almost cold, as the rush of adrenaline and endorphins wreaked havoc on him. It slowly dawned on him what he had done, what he had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang had killed...who knows how many people. He had destroyed an entire military installation. He was impossibly big, bigger than Godzilla, and so strong and powerful he could level a building with ease. He was unstoppable. And all he wanted was more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf rose to his feet and shook the seed and chunks of building out of his fur -- what he could, anyway. He looked at the flaming disaster area the barracks had become and laughed to himself. It was too good, simply. Too good to be true. There would be plenty more where that came from if anyone crossed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, he needed to find the fuckers that had taken David away from him. They would be made to suffer, each one, before he used the dragon to ascend even further. All he needed to do was find them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the sun came up the next morning, Tyler was the first one to wake. At first he was confused about where he was; the scent of hay was strong, and he was surrounded by what seemed to be small hills of fur. It took him a few moments to remember what those were, and what had happened last night. It came back to him in a rush of adrenaline, and he couldn't possibly sleep after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked his way around the enormous bulk of Rick, the ursine linebacker who had grown to the size of a two-story house; Marcus the kangaroo kicker who was less than half that size but still far larger than any man could have grown on his own; David, his brother, the dragon who was still sleeping off the injuries heaped upon him by Fang. Tyler himself was in the neighborhood of eight feet tall, as big as the biggest specimens of his kind and quite possibly a bit more muscular. Jason, the quarterback lion, was nowhere to be seen; neither was Ben, the equine running back. It was cozy enough with the four of them in the barn -- with the other two giants, it would have been downright crowded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler went to check on his brother, who had been laid carefully on a few bales of hay in the far corner of the barn. David was resting peacefully, it seemed, his massive chest rising and falling rhythmically. Save for a few scrapes on his hide and a stubborn black eye, you could scarcely tell that anything had been wrong with him. When he woke up, he'd have to explain just what the hell was going on. How could his cum do what it did? WHY did his cum do what it did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this made any sense. It was like they were in some kind of monster movie. The smallest of them were bonafide giants now, all thanks to David's magical semen, and the largest of them would never be able to fit easily inside of a building again. But that paled in comparison to what Fang had become -- a truly unstoppable monster. What's worse, the insane power that the wolf enjoyed wasn't enough; sooner or later, he would come looking for David and he didn't care who or what he'd have to tear through to get him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered and shook his head. They were all in so much trouble. And none of them would have any idea what to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon opened the barn door as silently as he could and ducked through the opening. Even still, his horns scraped the top of the frame and his shoulder slammed into the side as he made his way through. He cringed and cursed himself, glancing back to see that only Marcus had stirred. Tyler wasn't sure he would ever get used to being so big; he could only imagine what the others must be going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning sun was bright coming up over the horizon, but the air was hazy. Tyler lifted his nose into the wind; it was heavy with the scent of wolf and fires. His heart dropped into his stomach when he realized what that meant. What had Fang been doing all night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind shifted just enough for him to catch the scent of a lion. He glanced to his right and followed the scent until he found Jason sitting against the back of the barn, turned towards the woods they had come from the night before. From behind the lion looked like little more than a hill of tawny muscle, his back hunched and bristling with an insane amount of bulk. The small hill of feline was shaking; Tyler thought he might actually be crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason?\" He took a step or two forward, leaning around to get a better look at the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was holding his shaft in both hands, jerking himself off furiously. The cat was so burdened with muscle that he had to hunch forward to navigate his own bulk, and even still his arms crowded his chest enough that he had to reach for his member. The cock was so big that it wasn't nearly as hard as it could have been; it throbbed thicker than a fireplug and longer than a park bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's eyes widened and his throat went dry. He stammered out loud instead of quietly slinking away. Jason turned to look at him, his golden eyes flashing with an unnatural light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing here?\" the lion rumbled. He was still holding his shaft, which spurted enough pre to fill a milk bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...uh\u2026\" Tyler replied. There was a small voice in the back of his brain telling him to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here.\" Jason was doing his best to be quiet, but Tyler could still feel the thundering of his voice through his feet. \"NOW,\" he hissed, and the word came like a slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon scurried away to the relative brightness at the front of the barn. He couldn't tell why he was panting, or why he couldn't bring himself to look back at the colossal lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear him, even though Jason was doing his best to be quiet. What must have been tons of muscle tensed audibly, and so did the motion of his frenzied jerking. Tyler could hear him growl and moan, and the subdued hiss that sounded when he came. There were several audible splats when Jason's seed hit the ground, and the lion's breath caught in that cavern of a chest several times. The noises seemed to go on forever, and even though Tyler couldn't bring himself to look he was embarrassed by it just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going to happen to them? How could they be expected to lead normal lives now? Tyler and Marcus were the smallest of them and they were still far too large. The world just wasn't built for people more than 8 feet tall; Rick, Jason, David and Ben were going to be branded scientific curiosities at best, and monsters at worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feared most for David, the cause of this whole mess. Even if they were going to be able to stop Fang, there was always going to be some dangerous person or group who would want to take advantage of his...abilities. Most of them probably would only care about his well-being as far as it kept them in monster-making material. Is that the kind of life David would want? Reduced to some kind of stud whose worth was only in how much seed he could produce? How could he stop himself from being taken advantage of? If Jason or Fang were any indication, you only got hornier the bigger you got. And with David, that meant that he'd be helpless to keep himself from creating new giants or making them bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shook his head and tried to ignore the sinking pit in his stomach. There didn't look to be a good way out of this. Fang would be impossible to overcome, and if by some miracle they found a way to do it they'd still have the rest of their lives to contend with. No matter what happened from here, their lives would never be the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange thought occurred to Tyler just then: isn't that how most superhero origin stories go? Couldn't they...twist things in that direction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the ground shuddering beneath his feet, and he knew that Jason was on the move. He turned to see the lion looming next to the barn, making his way towards the dragon as gingerly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, dude,\" Jason rumbled lowly as he thumped his way next to Tyler. The lion had to waddle around the bulk of his thighs, his sheath rolling heavily against his stomach, his balls full despite the fact that he had just orgasmed. \"I just...it's like I'm learning about sex all over again. You know how you would spend hours in the bathroom when you found out how great jacking off felt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked up at what he could of the hulking lion. \"Uhm...not really?\" His first taste of puberty came when he watched the green alien otter babes in an episode of Galaxy Avengers. Sex was always wrapped up in the idea of a fantastic woman he could never have, and it took a lot for him to get over the weird head-space that put him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" Jason's eyebrows perked. The musk of the big cat was heavy in the air, and he was giving off an awful lot of heat. \"Well maybe you'll get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn't know what to say to that, so he didn't say anything. Jason seemed content to let the silence stretch out for a little while, and for a moment it was peaceful. The birds chirped through the haze in the air, and the wind ruffled the leaves as it carried the scent of burning buildings towards his nostrils. When the dragon remembered what he was smelling and why, his heart thumped in his chest. Everything lead back to Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" The giant lion appeared to read his thoughts. Tyler glanced up at him and simply shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. We don't have a lot of options here. Either one or more of us gets big enough to go toe-to-toe with Fang, or\u2026\" He couldn't bring himself to finish the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Jason took a deep breath, the sound itself massive enough to cause a localized quake where he stood. \"I just don't think it's good for any of us to be that size. We don't have the desire or the temperament. I could see a couple of us going all power-mad like he did. But if we don't stop him\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...then he's going to find us and become an even bigger problem.\" Tyler sighed. \"I don't see a way around it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about how it'd feel to be that big, but I also know I'm having a hard enough time with things now. If I were Fang's size, maybe\u2026.maybe I'd be like him too.\" Jason's voice lowered when he said that last little bit. Tyler looked up, and was surprised to see the expression on his face. He actually looked...self-conscious. Even when he was smaller, he had never known Jason to be anything but confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply shook his head. \"I...don't think you'll have anything to worry about, there. If you're this big and holding it together pretty well, I think you'll be just fine no matter how big you get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jason basked in the compliment, it seemed. \"You know, you're not a bad guy, Tyler. I've always liked you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the dragon's turn to be silent. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to say something, but he heard a crash coming from the forest. Both he and Jason turned around to find the trees swaying, then falling, as something immense made its way towards the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think\u2026\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not,\" Tyler replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyler groaned and slammed his back against his seat as he watched his brother walk up to accompany Officer Fletcher into the hospital. All he wanted to do was clear his head, but the heady scent that pervaded the cabin of his truck prevented him from such. He took a dreary look at the mess David had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCum was splattered all across his windshield, the pearly substance slowly sloughing off the glass. Droplets of it dripped from the roof and the armrest was covered in the white goo as well. This was going to be hell to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tyler got an idea that perhaps he shouldn\u2019t. He took a nervous glance around the lot. When he felt relatively safe, he brought a pair of fingers a particularly goopy spot on the dashboard and swept some of the sticky semen up. He eyed the viscous liquid in his paw and brought it to his nose to sniff it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gulped and closed his eyes. He brought his sticky fingers to his mouth and winced as he licked them off. The taste was absolutely foul. How the hell did Marcus get off on this stuff? Hell, how do girls put up with this stuff? But then, he felt something tingle all the way down to his gullet. Tyler never felt so alive, this goop that came out of his brother\u2019s dick gave him such a high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little purple drake smacked his lips. He wanted it. He wanted to get that high. This was completely out of this world. It also burned in the back of his mind that this was his chance. He could be big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler always wanted to be like his brother; no \u2013 better than his brother. He imagined himself, just as big as the new Fang. Man, that\u2019d be awesome. To be able to bounce his pecs and flex his arms like that; he\u2019d kill to be that big. Not to mention, Fang\u2019s, uh, other bits got bigger too; Tyler couldn\u2019t help but get a little aroused at the thought of himself having a little extra something-something. He smirked a bit, wondering if he were Fang\u2019s size and they were to compare, who\u2019d be bigger? Uh, no homo, he muttered to himself internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t do it here. It was too well lit; he wasn\u2019t about to get caught growing and jacking off in his truck. Hmm\u2026 or could he? Maybe a totally hot chick would notice- He shook his head; that was a stupid idea if he ever thought of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich presented Tyler with two problems; one he needed his privacy and two, he needed a way to get all this cum somewhere private. Well, he wasn\u2019t going to find it here. He pulled into reverse and backed out of his parking spot. Driving out of the hospital lot he searched for a place to solve all of his problems when he came by an empty gas station. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled into the station and parked off to the side. Getting out of the truck, he scampered into the building. Once inside, he bought a bottle of Coke and paid for it at the counter. The tired, or perhaps stoned, cashier rang it through the till and off he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler practically skipped all the way back to his truck, the excitement building. Along the way, he borrowed a squeegee from a nearby pump. This\u2019ll come in handy, he mused to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at his vehicle, he unscrewed the cap of the bottle and guzzled down the carbonated drink like no tomorrow. He downed about half of it before he stopped to gasp and breathe. Still panting, he opened the passenger side and marvelled at all the cum he had to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith due diligence, he worked methodically to gather every last scrap from every last corner of the cabin. It took quite some time, but when he was finished, his truck was spotless, save the stickiness all over the passenger side of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at the bottle with disgust. There was so much in it, there had to be at least one and a half cups of jizz partially mixing and partially coagulated at the top. It looked absolutely repugnant, not to mention it smelled of his brother\u2019s jockstrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, he locked his truck and made his way back into the station. He pretended to peruse some of the snacks when he found what he was looking for: the restroom. He bolted into the sterile looking place and crashed into the nearest stall. Locking the door behind him, he eyed the bottle full of his destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d the tiny drake whispered to himself. With one swift movement, Tyler began to gulp down the mix of sweet liquid and thick cum. It did not go down pretty; more than once, the purple drake gagged at the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle crashed to the floor. Tyler\u2019s head was abuzz with new sensations. He held onto the side of the stall as the world around him began to spin. The dragon couldn\u2019t help but begin to laugh; there was nothing truly funny but he just had to, a fuzzy tingling coursing through his veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery pore on his body began to sweat, a liquid rainbow emerging from between his scales. A school of fish swam by his face. With child-like wonder, the drake\u2019s gaze followed it. Their scales reflected the light around them and the beams of light continued to intensify. The colours began to merge, mixing into new unseen hues as they began to bleed together into a stark white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first conscious thought Tyler had was, \u2018Fuck, I\u2019m cumming!\u2019 And sure enough, he did. His cock had burst through the zipper of his pants, pants which were on the verge of breaking apart, struggling to contain the massive dragon now. But Tyler didn\u2019t care, nor did he notice, all he could think about was getting all this semen that\u2019s built in his system out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis release was incredibly powerful. Tyler always enjoyed the fact that he was complete stud where it counted. Hung like a stallion, the little guy could cum like no tomorrow. But now, he was something else. As the last of the spurts came out, Tyler winced and looked down at his even larger length. He had been pretty big before, and he was still pretty big now. It definitely felt bigger in his paw as he massaged it in his afterglow, his dick twitching but not cumming anymore. However, it didn\u2019t seem to grow in proportion, in fact, it looked almost smaller on him now. He sighed, but at least he was plenty big enough for the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, what would the ladies think of his new body? He unlocked the door and swung it open. In the mirror was the reflection of a god \u2013 at least in Tyler\u2019s eyes. The drake turned his head to the side and gave a toothy grin. \u201cHandsome as fuck,\u201d he murred to himself. Walking out, he flexed his guns, watching the muscles peak. \u201cFucking stud.\u201d He stood there, posing for himself in the mirror, the large member jutting out of his broken pants inflating again at the sight of his now enormous body. He had to be around seven feet now, almost as big as David use to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a curious thought entered his head. He stopped masturbating for a second to look back at the stall he had painted with his prodigious load. If David\u2019s cum could grow guys, maybe it was genetic? Tyler\u2019s heart fluttered as he realized just how huge he could become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big purple dragon wasted no time as he brought his tongue to the metal walls of the stall. He lapped at his own cum, admiring the disgusting flavour as the liquid oozed down his throat. After a couple mouthfuls he sat back and waited. And waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. No growth, no tingly feeling. More than disappointment, Tyler felt his anger rising, his rage beginning to bubble forth. He slammed his fist into the side of the stall, leaving a fist shaped indentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at his reflection in the mirror and his mood lightened. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he muttered. He was huge now, easily one of the biggest guys in town. And in the back of his mind, he knew if he met up with David, the two of them, the dragon brothers, would be able to take Fang on. He couldn\u2019t wait to put that cur in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door swung open, a slim, yet athletic looking otter wearing a three-piece suit walking in, already unbuckling the belt. It took him a moment to look up to see the gigantic drake eyeing him hungrily. Even more pronounced was the huge cock splurting pre onto the tiled floor, adding to the already large mess in the restroom. The otter\u2019s eyes went wide and slowly, he turned around and left the restroom, a petrified look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked. He\u2019d bone that guy\u2026 uh, if he was a she, that is. Naw, he\u2019d bone him even as a dude; Tyler was large and in charge now, he\u2019d fuck whoever, whenever he wanted. But he had business to attend to. The bulky dragon stuffed his length into his pants. Still, his sex-addled brain could wait, he had a plan. Or really, he planned to beat the shit out of Fang and put the wolf in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed his way out of the restroom and back into the storefront. The cashier didn\u2019t seem to notice, or care that a tiny purple dragon entered and a hulking purple stud exited. As Tyler hopped into his truck and noted just how different everything felt, a small voice bit into the back of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had an inkling of what would happen when he and David had a showdown. They\u2019d probably fight, something Tyler was looking forward to, showing his brother how strong he was now, and they\u2019d probably fight verbally all the way back to their house as they geared towards taking Fang down. What happened from there on in, he could only guess. He secretly wished, he\u2019d get to be ten feet tall, muscled beyond belief and wrestle Fang to the ground and stomp him flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he\u2019d do that. Or... Fang and David could wait. He was a big guy now. And big guys had big needs. Tyler rubbed his crotch. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t meet up with David. The blue dragon wouldn\u2019t be too happy to see him anyways. Maybe he\u2019d:</span></div></div>",

She's not significantly 'lacking' in any of those departments per say. Standing at a modest, slightly below normal five foot eight inches in height, shes only a couple of inches smaller than the average woman her height. Her chest was actually modestly endowed, a C cup bra used to hold up the bosom on a 5'8\u201d girl was a decent sight to see, but overall her height still made it just modest at best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe's always been a bit of a handful, even as a child. With her being slightly below average height, she always made up for that lack of size with her attitude. Borderline overly confident and aggressive, she always said what was on her mind, and went full force for what she wanted, whether it be a prize, a contest, a grade, or even another person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen going for someone she likes, she'll start being borderline passive aggressive. Teasing them usually about features she finds attractive. If someones taller than she is, she might taunt them with something like \u201cHows the weather up there beanpole\u201d or if they're particularly beefy she might taunt them about being unable to walk through doors without turning sideways. If she catches any hint of interest in someone she likes, she wont hesitate to make the next move. Catching them alone in the hallway and shoving them up against a locker, or 'accidentally' tripping someone and sending them stumbling into a broom closet. Shes a girl that knows what she likes, and knows how to get it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs stated, Jessy is rather short, only about 5'8\u201d to the top of her ears, so she finds herself looking up at most people. That plus her plush, soft, white arctic fox fur and her slightly abnormally puffy White furred tail gave her an almost 'adorable' look too her, which she quickly decided to change once she was old enough to do so. She liked to stand out, but not for looking like some vulnerable little petite girl. So, on her 14th birthday, she snuck out of the house and got her headfur, and a stripe going all the way from the top of her head, down to the very tip of her thick, bushy vulpine tail, Dyed bright, neon pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCurrently she shares an apartment with her roommate, and long time friend, the rather large rex, Alison (Though always calls her Ali, despite the rex's protests) who she constantly is dragging out to parties or to hang with her friends to have a good time, Despite the rex's shy personality contradictory to Jessy's party girl routine. More times than not The rex would find herself in the middle of a dance floor, nervously trying to pick her way out of it, after having been shoved there by Jessy, urging her to 'get freaky' or meet someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's ready to party, as always. Hopefully tonight she isn't getting more than she can handle.</span></div></div>",

The white-and-pink furred fox pranced into their kitchen, snagging an energy drink out of the fridge.  She cracked it and guzzled it, feeling the floor beneath her shake with the slow, firm footsteps of her towering roommate.  The towering rex-girl emerged, clothed in pajama shorts and a t-shirt, which strained to hold back her bodacious breasts despite being quite large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally Ali, it\u2019s like, 10:30 in the morning\u2026Couldn\u2019t you have just woken me up after you got back from\u2026Where are you going again?\u201d  Alison protested softly, rubbing her eyes and glancing down at the spunky little arctic fox beneath her, who already seemed energetic enough without the energy drink she\u2019d guzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis really trippy store I saw when I walked home a different way from normal!\u201d  She grinned toothily, slamming her empty can to the countertop and crushing it with her hand, causing Allison to flinch.  Jessy smirked slightly at this and tossed the can into their recycling, \u201cYou should come with me.\u201d  She walked around the towering, 8\u20192\u201d rex-girl and gave her a playful smack on her pajama-shorts, \u201cYou could do with a little exercise, if you know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison\u2019s green cheeks turned darker at that playful comment, her tail twitching slightly.  She slowly dragged her thick footpaws to the fridge, bending over to get into the small fridge.  She pulled out orange juice for herself, but not before \u2013 from the hallway \u2013 she heard another comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know there was a full moon this morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli glowered at the petite fox, pouring herself a large glass of orange juice.  She responded with the wittiest quip she could manage, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who should watch her health, with all the energy drinks you consume\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy merely giggled and pranced back down the hallway.  She stripped in their bathroom and started the shower.  She\u2019d gotten into the habit of leaving the bathroom door open, just so she could continue her conversations with Allison.  Over the rush of hot water \u2013 and between a few soft moans of pleasure as the shower cascaded over her moderate breasts \u2013 she called out to her plus-sized roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you should know by now that an ass like yours is something everyone should appreciate!\u201d  She smirked and lathered herself up, scrubbing through her soft, thick fur.  Just to cover her brief lapse in gentle ribbing \u2013 that genuine compliment something that was rare for her to let slip \u2013 she called out to Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!  Did you use up all my shampoo?  I told you its high quality stuff, you can\u2019t use it all on those heavy tits of yours, or it disappears!\u201d  She snickered softly.  She could hear the sound of the rex\u2019s lungs heaving a sigh, even over the sound of the water.  She simply smirked and knocked on the wall with her fist, causing the rex to yelp from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Alli lighten up!  Sheesh, what\u2019s got your panties in a twist today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy slowly ran her fingers over her rump and tail, enjoying the sensation of warm water and the scent of her fruity shampoo.  She smiled when she finally got a reluctant response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t in a twist, you just woke me up before I wanted to be awake!\u201d Allison responded with just a hint of annoyance.  Jessy simply chuckled and rinsed herself, calling out in a slightly softer tone, \u201cAlright alright, you big softie\u2026I\u2019ll go find someone else to taunt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shut off the shower and pranced out into the hallway, leaning against the kitchen wall and eliciting a soft groan from Allison when the rex-girl finally noticed her dripping-wet roommate standing there.  Jessy smirked and folded her arms over her soaked breasts, perfectly comfortable being naked around her roommate, \u201cSee something you want?\u201d  She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison managed a soft giggle and moved into the hallway, sweeping her thick green-and-black striped tail against the slender fox\u2019s torso, \u201cAll I see is a wet rat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica faltered for a moment, before simply laughing and moving into the bathroom, where she dried herself off, snickering constantly over the next few minutes, even as she pulled on a fresh pair of hip-hugging jeans and a V-neck top that showed off her cleavage.  She poked her head into Allison\u2019s room just before she left, \u201cYou almost got me there a minute ago, Ali-saurus.\u201d  She giggled softly, \u201cCatch you in an hour or so, I\u2019ve gotta check out that store.  And seriously\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled and turned on her heel, a flash of pink and white fur disappearing from Allison\u2019s door, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t use my shampoo!\u201d  She called in a sing-song voice, happily swaying out the front door of their apartment.  She pulled on a pair of sunglasses and took the stairs down two at a time, grinning like the Chesire cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday\u2019s gonna be a good day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a good day it would be, for Jessica\u2026All because her trip to the mysterious shop of curiosities would, at the end of the hour, reward her with\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm sure everything in here is from some rare, valuable dig site isn't it?\u201dShe growled out, then sighed, trying to calm herself down a bit. \u201cLook. I don't care if its not authentic, I like how it looks. I just wish you'd be a little flexible with me, and sell it to me for cheaper.\u201d She huffed softly. With her paw covering the rock where it sat on the counter... she didn't notice that a small 'wave' of light seemed to resonate through each stripe of color in turn on it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Ill give it to you for 20\u201d The rat replied with a sigh, causing Jessica to blink a bit in surprise. He had been arguing adamantly against her for a good half hour now, and hadn't even once acted like he might drop the price. Weird. She wasn't going to complain though, and happily slammed a 20 dollar bill down on the counter, tail puffed out behind her, and with a swish of her hips she turned and left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chee... pretty pretty\u201c She giggled aloud to herself. One of her few more... 'girly' moments, that shed probably punch and threaten anyone other than Ali that saw them, Happily petting her fingers over her new little trinket. She suddenly had to stop mid-step as a car rushed by just infront of her, running a light that just switched from yellow to red, just as she was about to cross the street. With a growl she stared up at the crosswalk light as it changed red, that natural born impatience in her already starting to wear at her. She hated waiting, far too much of a proactive girl to be content with just standing around without being annoyed about it. \u201cI wish the stupid light would change\u201d She huffed... again not seeming to notice the strange glow the rock gave off, two cars almost colliding as the light rather abruptly changed, causing her to blink. \u201chuh... weird.\u201d She murmured, before simply shrugging and heading back across the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed with Jessica none the wiser of the strange implications of what had been happening... that was about to change however when she saw a large police block surrounding one of the major intersections on her way home. It was like everything was getting in her way to day! With a huffed growl she stomped a paw in annoyance on the sidewalk, briefly glancing to see if she could slip past, which she couldn't, before sighing and turning to take the long way home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cso sick of this crap today, I shoulda just stayed home with Alli.\u201d She pouted, raising up the stone to stare down at it curiously, as if debating whether it had been worth it or not. \u201chate taking the long way. I wish I was already home\u201d she huffed aloud... then blinked as she saw the stone glow briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUNK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sent sprawling onto her ass, a dull throbbing on her forhead where it had hit her front door, causing her to groan and raise her paw up to rub her forhead. Wait. Her front door? She blinked in surprise and raised her head up to look at the front of her and Alli's house, shaking her head a bit as if to make sure she wasn't imagining things. What the hell? She had been almost a mile from home, how the hell did she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at it curiously, turning it over in her paw as she slowly pushed herself up to her feet. \u201cno way... couldn't be\u201d She murmured softly. Then decided to test it, almost laughing aloud at herself for thinking something so crazy. What was something that would never happen normally?... ooh, she had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish Allison was waiting, inside, with a Vegetarians pizza for us\u201d She murmured aloud, knowing full well The rex, stereotypically, hated pretty much all vegetables. Again she saw, with wide eyes, as the stone seemed to gleam briefly then fade back to normal. Cautiously she pushed the front door open, peering inside for her roommate. \u201cHelloooo~?\u201d she called out, then blinking as she spotted Alli on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chey, Jessy.\u201d The rex murmured happily, looking much more awake and alert, if still barely dressed, than she had been earlier, having opted to stay in her pajamas all day today. \u201cI got a little hungry and figured you'd be back soon so I got us a veggies lover pizza.\u201d She replied, gesturing to the aforementioned pizza on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit. It was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sat there stunned for a brief second as she thought of the implications of this.. and immediately her mind went to sex. She wasn't a slut, or overly horny or anything, but she was very open about her wants and desires... and rather than think of all the crazy things she could do with this, ranging form ending world hunger to taking over the planet, her first thought came to what kind of 'personal' fun she could have with it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Alli~...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison faltered, shifting a bit uneasily in her seat at the table.  She stared at the uneaten veggie pizza in front of her.  After a few long moments debating what to say she finally cleared her throat, \u201cAhem\u2026So you don\u2019t want any of this pizza?  I got it because it\u2019s your favorite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy giggled softly, knowing that her wishful thinking had caused that to happen, and now Allison probably felt rather confused about why she\u2019d even buy such a pizza without being asked.  The arctic fox walked over to the table and took a single slice.  She tore half of it off and chewed it vigorously, then set the rest of the slice on top of the pizza, \u201cSorry Alli, but I\u2019ve got plans!  Hehe, it was a nice thought, but really next time you should ask me first before buying a pizza you don\u2019t like!\u201d  She said with a playful smirk, turning to the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison stared at the pizza with a rather distraught expression, wondering why she\u2019d even thought to order it.  She sighed heavily, \u201cYou know sometimes you make it hard to live with you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy giggled and called out from her room, already stripping to her panties and bra, \u201cOh shut up, you love it here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison blushed and merely nodded, sighing and closing the box of pizza.  She put it in the fridge, the enormous rex-girl lumbering into the bathroom, leaning in the doorframe as Jessy freshened herself up, \u201cYou said you\u2019re going to David\u2019s?  Isn\u2019t that the football player you\u2019re always making fun of?\u201d  She said with a soft giggle, \u201cWhat, you like him now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy growled softly and flicked her tail derisively at the comment, shaking her head as she groomed her facial fur with efficiency and quickness, \u201cHe\u2019s just some musclehead!  I thought it would be fun to erm\u2026You know, string him along a little bit.  Make him think I think he\u2019s cute, then let him down hard.\u201d  She smirked and looked up at Alli, growling softly, \u201cYou got that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison stood in the doorway with her arms folded, purposefully filling it with her wide rump, \u201cYou\u2019re such a liar, Jessy.  I just hope he likes being teased and taunted by women, or you\u2019re not going to get very far with him.\u201d  She stood up straight and walked back into their living room, calling over her shoulder, \u201cMaybe you should try to be nice for a change!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy was caught off-guard by those frank remarks, not expecting such talk from her usually shy, quiet roommate.  Whatever the reason, Allison was serious about what she said.  For just a few seconds those words made Jessy a little uneasy.  But with a flick of her wrist to fluff up her pink headfur she left the bathroom, swaying into the living room and putting her hands on her hips, still scantily clad, \u201cYou\u2019re full of fire today, Alli-saurus rex!  At least, full of fire for you.\u201d  She snickered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison blushed at this, quickly picking up a magazine and flipping it open.  She responded softly, \u201cJust\u2026Just go have fun, then.  I hope you\u2019ll eat that pizza.\u201d  She added, trying to politely suggest that she\u2019d basically just wasted ten bucks for something the arctic fox hadn\u2019t eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy managed a true smile, before turning on her heel and heading back into her bedroom, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll buy you a three-meat pizza the next time that gut of yours makes the apartment shake\u2026I\u2019m still firm in my belief that there\u2019s a cold predator beneath all that fluffy, shy exterior of yours!\u201d  She snickered, disappearing into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy emerged a few minutes later.  She wore her best pair of dark blue jeans \u2013 shredded at the knees \u2013 with a studded black belt.  Her top was lime green, rather loose and wide at the neck, with a tight, black-sleeved shirt beneath.  Both shirts were low-cut enough to reveal her cleavage.  She quickly checked her tail for tangles before happily strutting out into the living room, cocking her hips to one side and posing, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison glanced up at her, before nodding, \u201cLike you always do, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy snorted and rolled her eyes, \u201cNo appreciation for a fellow woman\u2019s look\u2026Have a good time at home alone!\u201d  She said with a bit of a grin, not entirely making Allison feel badly for her preference to be at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the arctic fox made her move.  While she could\u2019ve used the wishing stone to go straight to David\u2019s she preferred to take the time to plan.  It was a short walk, anyway, and it was a cool afternoon.  She beat a semi-casual pace, eager to reach David\u2019s quickly, but not in too much of a hurry, since she needed to plan as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer planning was complete by the time she was in front of David\u2019s house in the suburbs.  It was simple.  With the wishing stone at her side, how could she fail?  All she had to do was\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica had had small forays into being a voyeur, peeking into the men's locker room once or twice after PE, or 'accidentally' using the wrong door when looking for the bathroom after a football game, but tonight she decided she was going to take it to a whole new level. Her plan was a bit crazy, even for her... well, once you got past the insanity of what it actually entailed, to the insanity of the situation she was going to put herself in. She had spent the entire walk over to David's house thinking up the details of it, trying to make sure she wasn't overlooking something important. Her plan would put her in an incredibly vulnerable position if she was discovered... but at the same time would give her an opportunity to sneak around unnoticed within David's home... not to mention feed into the fetish she had for larger guys (That Allison never quite let her live down when she found out about it). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to shrink herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft, calming sigh she raised the store up to her chest, staring ahead at the doorknob of David's home. Her tail was flicking rapidly behind her, seeming unable to decide if it wanted to portray happiness or nervousness. She raised a paw up to comb through her head-fur, brushing it back along the ponytail her long, bright pink hair hung in, as if momentarily trying to distract herself long enough to calm herself down. She had to make sure she worded everything properly, otherwise something might go wrong, or it might not work at all. With one final deep breath, she closed her eyes and started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk... I wish I, clothes and all, would shrink down to only an inch in height, and would retain the same physical durability I have at my original five foot eight inch height.\u201d She said aloud. She hoped that, with the last part of the wish, it would count as a sort of \u201caddition\u201d since she hadn't tried using two wishes at the same time, and didn't know if there was a limit or anything. She also wanted to make sure that, being only an inch tall she'd at least have some remote chance of surviving any unforeseen circumstances... so at least making herself as durable as she was at full height would protect her from accidentally being kicked, stepped on, or falling off of something. At least, as much as it would were any of those things to happen to her at her normal height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second she thought that it wasn't going to work, and almost started laughing at herself about thinking a wishing stone was real. Then she let out a sudden yelp of surprise as the stone started to glow almost red hot in her hand, sending a flushing tingle flooding along her arms and through the rest of her body. She felt her gut do a 'flip' inside of her as if she were in a fast moving elevator, and when her clenched eyes opened they shot wide at the sight of the doorknob of the front door shooting up above her. She watched as if, like one of those fast motion plant growth movies in reverse, the door rose up above her, the porch stretched out in all directions around her, and the sky above seemed to grow all the more encompassing as she dwindled down in size. 5'8 becoming 5 foot... 4.... 3... 1... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Terrifying in some ways, seeing things like the lawn chair beside the door that normally had been something shed comfortably sitting in, now shot up to literal building size above her. Her height continuing to dwindle down smaller and smaller until it tapered out as she reached about a foot in height... barely even comparable to the height of a plastic army man. Hesitantly she started looking around her, letting the sheer scale of the now enormous world around her start to sink in, before she lowered the stone down into her pocket for safe keeping (Thankfully it had shrunk down with her) and then started trekking her way towards the front door. What had previously been barely a foot of space between her and the frame of the door, had now stretched out to be literal yards of distance, forcing her to take a brisk jog to quickly cover the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk... phase one... get inside\u201d She murmured aloud to herself, looking around at the skyscraper sized front door, before climbing herself up onto the metal shelf that was angled along the bottom of the door frame. After a moment of thought she decided, since she was obviously far too small to be able to open the door in any fashion, she'd have to go under it, so she started to crawl her way forward on all fours, and started pushing her arms against the rubbery weather stripping that sealed the door shut from the outside. It was much sturdier to her now, with her strength proportionally diminished to her size, but with enough force it slowly started to bend inwards, and with a few grunts she began pushing herself through. Nearly 5 minutes later she had finally crawled her way all the way through the weather stripping and tumbled down to the other side of the door, panting softly and sprawled out on her back atop the linoleum of The home's entryway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd given herself a few moments to catch her breath, she pushed herself back up to her feet with a faint grunt, and again had to pause in awe of how enormous everything looked. An average sized couch to her was an enormous office building dozens of stories tall and wider than a city block, shoes that sat nearby her were bigger than buses, and even the carpet, as she started to trek across it towards the kitchen and hallway, was like tall grass thick around as her thighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then... Phase one Complete... now for Phase two... Find the target\u201d She murmured aloud, unable to help but giggle to herself a bit at the absurdity of everything. Though her giggle was quickly cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the ground starting to shake Rhythmically, hard enough that it actually unbalanced her a bit till she braced against it. It took her a few seconds to start to figure out what it could be, but when she did, she slowly raised her head up, looking off 'in the distance' to the corner leading to the hallway, eyes wide as she saw a massive behemoth of a dragon round the corner. Towering taller than Most skycrapers, at least from her scale, with paws that could easily crush (Again on her scale) cars, or her for that matter, with ease. Footsteps causing visible, powerful tremors to shake through the ground that, at normal sizes, might be unnoticeable, but to her size almost knocked her on her ass with each one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god... its-\u201d</span></div></div>",

The world zipped by and shook around her, and she was violently tossed about as the giant dragon climbed the staircase, her hands almost lost their grip more than a couple of times but the fear of falling such a great distance made her cling all the tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long they were at the top of the stairs and the tiny vixen finally let go, slumping down on the floor, panting and trying to wait out the rush of what just happened, \u201cI... am never... doing that.. again!\u201d she mumbled to herself, this time out loud, watching as the dragon stomps off into his room and shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica must have lay there for at least a good five minutes before finally picking herself up. She walked along the hallway, keeping close to the edge of the room in case anyone else came along, and soon enough she made it to her destination, beyond the towering door in front of her was the object of her desires, the sole reason she came all this way.<br>\r\nThe gap beneath the door was small but just big enough for Jessica to squeeze through. She struggled her way into the room and looked out into the distance, first seeing all sorts of dishes, magazines, soda cans, etc littering the floor. \u201cTypical boy's room\u201d she chuckled and kept scanning around, seeing her target in the distance. Her heart started beating faster at the sight, David was sitting on the edge of his bed, completely shirtless, his muscles glistening with sweat as he lifted a dumbbell with one hand.<br>\r\nJessica ran over the desk at the side of the room and continued watching this titan continue his exercises, that bicep bulking out bigger with every flex of his arm, she could even hear the subtle grunts and groans with every rep. She admired his strong body, watching the light bounce off his huge blue slightly sweaty muscles, almost making them appear to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid continued lifting for at least another ten minutes or so before finally putting the weight down. He stood up and walked over to the full body mirror on the wall next to his bed and started raising his arms, flexing his biceps to see his progress, talking out loud as his did so, \u201cYeah that's the stuff. Ain't no one as big as I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny vixen under the desk simply rolled her eyes as she listened to him stroking his own ego, she couldn't help letting out a quiet laugh too.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTyler!  If that little runt stomps on me it\u2019s gonna ruin everything!\u201d  She yelped and quickly ran to the baseboard, pressing her tiny body against the painted wood and watching with awe as that massive dragon lumbered along.  To her his pace seemed slowed, somehow, and clumsy.  Perhaps it was an artifact of her new size, that such a titan would show even the tiniest of flaws in his gait to someone her size.  At the very least she certainly felt the impact of his paws, every few moments a new tremble in the floor shaking her firmly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic purple male turned on his heel after emerging from the hallway, his change in direction \u2013 toward the kitchen \u2013 bringing a sigh of relief out of the tiny vixen.  She watched with a small smirk as the big male lumbered away from her, her eyes focused on his lean rump.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad for a scrawny fellah like him.  It\u2019s just too bad he\u2019s the inferior model, when it comes to how he measures up to his brother.\u201d  She snickered softly to herself.  With Tyler apparently out of her way she started moving along the baseboard, hardly thinking to keep a careful eye on the purple titan as he rummaged through the kitchen, apparently looking for something to snack on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as it took for Jessy to make her way down the hallway \u2013 having to trudge through the thigh-high carpet threads and tripping over many, many times \u2013 she lost track of time.  It wasn\u2019t long before the soft tremors from Tyler\u2019s paws finally stopped, signaling that he\u2019d finally located something to his liking in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy yelped when she heard a loud, thundering belch from the other room.  Tyler had apparently finished his snack already, and with no one but his brother in the apartment he released that resounding, massive belch without a care.  The sound of it was so low-pitched to the tiny vixen that she could actually feel it in her chest, shaking her body to the core.  She fell forward with shock, holding to the carpet for the few seconds it lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit\u2026Was that a burp!?\u201d  She burst into a fit of giggles, her initial terror giving way to her own enjoyment of the thrill of being such a tiny size.  Everything was amplified, and everything was a risk!  She chuckled weakly and got back up, nonchalantly making her way along the baseboard once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I wonder which room is Dav\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD.  THUD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck\u2026\u201d Jessica turned right back around to stare down the hallway.  She\u2019d only just made it past the dragons\u2019 bathroom, beyond which were the bedrooms.  She had no hope of making a run for David\u2019s room before Tyler got close enough to threaten her safety.  Instead she huddled down against the wall and the carpet, praying that she wouldn\u2019t be discovered.  Rather unfortunately for her, Tyler wasn\u2019t the type to miss even the smallest of details, and with white fur and pink hair, she was a bit of a bright spot on their dull carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched with horror as those huge footpaws slammed into the carpet, the thick toes \u2013 easily wider than she was tall \u2013 curling into the thick threads and displacing them more than she ever could imagine her tiny body doing.  To her he was carrying tons of weight, and any sort of contact \u2013 even from a toe \u2013 was likely to crush her.  At least, this is what went through her mind, her instincts driving her.  Long forgotten was her \u201cfailsafe\u201d addition to the wish, that she would be durable enough to survive accidents with such giant males.  Then again, even if she did remember she\u2019d wished for such a thing, that wasn\u2019t reason enough to test it.  All she could imagine was getting crushed by those massive footpaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the case, of course, until the drake\u2019s thunderous voice assaulted her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that on the carpet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy shrieked in terror when Tyler planted a tremendous footpaw mere inches from her, the giant\u2019s stance allowing him to crouch down right above her.  She stared at his boxer-clad rump descending from high above, swearing that this would be the end of her.  A great draft buffeted her tiny form just as that huge, house-sized rump halted above the carpet, mere inches from slamming against it.  But the horror was not over.  High from above a massive hand lowered, fingers curled menacingly, as if to snatch the tiny vixen up.  Without even thinking she bolted, trying to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, you\u2019re alive!  What are you\u2026\u201d Tyler chuckled with delight, his eyes fixed upon the little streak of white and pink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy screamed when that massive hand slammed down in front of her, blocking off any escape.  Tyler\u2019s amused chuckling only filled her ears, almost enough to cause her to have a headache.  And in all the confusion of motion and overwhelming sound she was unable to prevent those titanic fingers from scooping her up.  If she\u2019d been Tyler\u2019s size she might have appreciated how gentle he was being, but at her size any slight twitch or application of pressure caused her great distress, even if it didn\u2019t quite harm her.  She felt her stomach turn as that massive palm raised her high into the air, her tiny body laid flat against a plateau of warm, purple flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then suddenly her view was filled with the grinning face of her crush\u2019s little brother, the last person she\u2019d wanted to have capture her.  His thunderous chuckling filled the air.  Jessy\u2019s heart was pounding, every fiber of her being screaming at her to jump off, or to fight back.  And yet she was frozen with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s hot breath washed over her as the drake\u2019s lips parted, and for the first few moments she forgot that his booming voice was even speaking to her.  She managed to catch the last bit, her eyes widening at what the drake had said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cA tiny person, how cool!\u201d His deep, at least to Jessica, rumble of a voice boomed out. With her held right in front of his face it was loud enough to leave her ears ringing. Were it not, again, for that wish of durability it might have actually caused damage to her eardrums. The paw that she found herself resting on suddenly jerked upwards another inch or so, though to her it was several feet, and the force of the movement knocked her down onto her ass atop his palm, as Tyler raised her a bit higher to be right in front of his eyes. Those massive, slitted reptilian eyes of his leaned in so close she could probably leap off his paw and land on one if she tried... though getting closer to Tyler was the last thing on her mind. \u201cWait... don't I know you?\u201d His voice suddenly rumbled out in some mix of confusion and curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to think fast. If she recognized her, then there was no telling what he would do. He might help her with what she was trying to do for all she knew, cause she knew that at times Tyler and David could be rather 'abrasive' agaisnt one another. At the same time for all she knew he might kidnap her and do something terrible with her... a thought that, the longer she would dwell on it, the more she had trouble deciding if it was bad or not. Finding images of the giant, towering form of Tyler looming ominously above her like some titan of lore... sending her drooling briefly at the thought of it. She was knocked from her thoughts by another shifting of that paw beneath her, one of those huge eyes squinting and leaning in so close that she could reach out and touch it if she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DO know you don't I?!\u201d He exclaimed as if in triumph. \u201cYour that girl Jennifer that's always taunting my brother at college, I remember him telling me about you!\u201d the massive purple dragon grinned. Though, the grin didn't last very long. He turned quickly into a frown as the paw that she was riding on suddenly pulled away from his face, then the 'sky' above her went dark. Tyler's other broad hand paw closing in above her like a massive purple fleshed dome, trapping her in between both of them, as he started looking back and forth across the hallway, then turned and quickly scampered his way into his room. Jessica could hear the dull THUD of the door slamming closed, and then a loud CLICK, that she could only assume (And somewhat fear) was the door being locked, before light flooded across her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d She yelled out up at him angrily, having been tossed around quite a lot from his rather rushed movement into his room. She raised up an arm to shake a fist angrily up at the giant face hovering over her as she continued to yell (Or, to Tyler, squeak) Up at him. \u201cAnd its Jessica, Not Jennifer god damn it! Now you put me down right now, your messing up everything!\u201d  she would continue, only to yelp as the 'ground' beneath her suddenly tipped to one side, inclining steeply and sending her tumbling out onto a massive expanse of brown wood that was the top of Tyler's desk. A shadow quickly cast across her as Tyler plopped down into his computer chair, and lowered his head down so his chin was resting atop the desk, directly in front of Jessica, as he stared down almost cross-eyed at her in front of his, to the little fox, house sized muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, cool... so it really is you.\u201d He murmured aloud, grinning toothily as he looked the tiny fox over. An idea seemed to come to him though, as he looked to the side and reached over, grabbing a magnifying glass out of the desk drawer, then bringing it back over to hover it between Jessica and himself. To Jessica, it distorted the view of Tyler's muzzle almost laughably, but for Tyler it made it easier to see more specific details about the fox sitting in front of him. \u201cMan, this is so cool, how did you get so tiny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes its me!\u201d She growled out, stamping her paw against the 'ground' of the desk beneath her, glaring up at Tyler. She was doing her best not to show it... but honestly she was terrified. Or at least, a part of her was. Tyler was normally a shrimp, even to her. But now he was, at least as far as she went, so massive that Tyler could crush her under his thumb. He could step on her like a bug, or do any number of other things to her that she couldn't do anything to stop. While at the same time, another part of her seemed to be LIKING that thought...\u201dNow never you mind how I got so small, you go put me back right now and you forget you ever saw me, got it?!\u201d She growled demanding up at the giant dragon. Unfortunately for her, Tyler seemed to be barely listening, and it took a few seconds, but soon Jessica realized why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magnifying glass was angled right at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of reflex she crossed her arms across her torso, hiding her cleavage from view with her forearms, glaring angrily at the giant magnifying glass wielding dragon above her. \u201cHEY you perv! What the hell?! Stop looking down my shirt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh... oh man, this is too cool...\u201d Tyler muttered softly, a low THUMP lightly shaking the desk beneath her as he set the magnifying glass down. One of those broad, towering purple fingers started to lean in, causing Jessica's tail to reflexively tuck inwards in nervousness... and then the finger simply THUMPED against Jessica's front, effortlessly smacking her down onto her ass. \u201cyour like... bug sized. I've seen army men bigger than you\u201d He chuckled softly, obviously amused. Jessica quickly pushed herself up to her feet and was about to start yelling at Tyler again, but the moment she was back on her feet that finger shoved her again, and once more knocked her onto her ass. Jessica was starting to get a bit worried at the way Tyler was acting, and his next words didn't really help her nervousness any, earfins wilting when she heard him rumble out above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've never had my own little pet person before, maybe I should...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica stared up at Tyler for a moment, thinking that she\u2019d misheard him, or rather, HOPING that she\u2019d misheard him.  She got back to her feet just as Tyler turned away from his desk, giving her a moment to breathe.  She shivered and stood there, arms folded over her breasts and her tail between her legs.  She\u2019d never thought that a man could make her feel this way, so helpless\u2026but then again, this was no ordinary situation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s rummaging attracted Jessica\u2019s attention after a few moments, her fear-driven heart and the sound of blood rushing in her ears not enough to distract her curiosity for long.  What could he be looking for?  She called out to him tentatively after a moment, thinking that perhaps he\u2019d been joking with her, \u201cHeh, what are you looking for, some kind of action figure to play with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple titan simply snorted, one of his hands suddenly lifting back up into view.  Jessica shrieked as a massive metal tool dropped from those monstrous fingers and clattered loudly onto the desk, forcing Jessica to cover her ears as the metal tool resonated so loudly that it hurt.  She could almost feel her bones shaking at the same frequency, and she was forced to back away from the shining metal.  It wasn\u2019t until she took a few steps back that she saw what it was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of tweezers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her size, the metal tool was easily three times as long as she was tall.  What used to be a delicate tool for removing stray whiskers now appeared to be a deadly implement that could be used to crush her limbs or torso with the lightest of touches from Tyler\u2019s clumsy titan\u2019s fingers.  She whimpered and cried out, \u201cW-what are you gonna do with that!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your clothes off, of course\u2026\u201d Tyler murmured, even the softest of words sounding \u2013 to her \u2013 like the booming speech of a god, or at the very least the menacing gale of a thunderstorm.  He smirked and held up his second pair of tweezers, playfully turning it in the lamplight and letting it flash high above Jessica.  His gaze turned down to her, an eerily playful grin on his lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashing teeth or flashing tweezers, Jessica couldn\u2019t decide what terrified her more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow be a good little pet and lay down, or I\u2019ll force you to\u2026\u201d He brought his right hand to the desk as he turned to face her once more, tapping the ends of the pair he held against the table.  Jessica yelped and fell back, scrambling to scoot backwards, her tiny paws slipping against the smooth wood of his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stay the FUCK away from me you freak!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked, his left hand deftly snatching up the second pair of tweezers, \u201cOh that\u2019s not very nice\u2026I\u2019m your host, you shouldn\u2019t say such naughty things.  A Master is to be respected.\u201d  He growled thunderously, leaning close and resting his elbows against the desk, sending a shockwave through the wood that caused Jessica to cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Master is meant to be revered.  Meant to be worshipped\u2026\u201d  Tyler chuckled and shook his head, grinning toothily as he leaned over, \u201cHeh, am I laying it on too thick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica faltered, staring up at him with a mixture of fear and confusion.  Had he been joking?  In her state of fear she\u2019d taken every single word seriously, but for Tyler it appeared that his melodramatic delivery was just that, an act.  She growled and got to her feet, her tail lashing back and forth behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what this is!?  Are you just trying to scare the hell outta me!?  I oughtta\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of metal and a looming shadow was the only warning Jessica had before she was sent flying back by a flick of Tyler\u2019s wrist, the metal tips of the tweezers slamming against her roughly.  She slid backward along the wood and didn\u2019t get back up.  Her heart raced as she stared up at her titanic captor, who lips were curled in a vicious sneer once more, \u201cOh I\u2019m playing games, but it\u2019s for my amusement only.  I couldn\u2019t care what sort of emotion you\u2019re feeling.\u201d  He smirked and paused for a moment, before shrugging, \u201cWell\u2026I\u2019ll admit that seeing you with your tail tucked between your legs is quite satisfying.  So yeah, it\u2019s a little of both.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shivered and lay beneath that titan\u2019s gaze, her heart pounding and her entire body aching after that last hit.  She stayed down this time, absolutely defeated at that point.  She whimpered as Tyler\u2019s hands slowly lowered to the desk, fidgeting and slowly sliding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLACK.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica let out a brief scream when Tyler\u2019s left pair of tweezers slammed down right atop her, the prongs spread so that they touched wood, rather than piercing her abdomen.  At least, she imagined that the wicked-looking tips of the massive tweezers could easily be forced through her. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nShe shivered as the wood beneath her vibrated.  Above her, Tyler\u2019s fingertips squeezed the tweezers slowly, the metal tips grating against the grain of the wood beneath her.  She whimpered when cool metal touched her hips on both sides, and then applied a slow, terrifying pressure.  She began to squirm, crying out as she clawed at the desk, \u201cIt hurts!  No moooore!\u201d She pleaded, bracing her hands against those immovable prongs and desperately trying to push herself away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeaked in pain as her wriggling only rewarded her with more pressure on her hips, the drake\u2019s booming voice assaulting her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want it to hurt, I suggest you stop squirming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica faltered, her eyes bulging slightly as she started to hyperventilate.  She felt as if her heart would tear itself out of her chest if it pounded any harder, and the pain in her sides only amplified the sheer terror she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust calm down,\u201d Tyler said with a smirk, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna hurt you if you just cooperate.\u201d  He chuckled and slowly moved his right hand down to her, that second pair of tweezers looming ominously overhead.  Tyler spoke softly to her, but as soft as he could speak it would bring Jessica no comfort, only more worry and terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019m gonna strip you with these.  If you struggle, I\u2019m gonna get rough.  You\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t try to use my claws, or it might\u2019ve been worse.\u201d  He smirked, \u201cFor once you should be praising me for being a nerd.  I\u2019ve done things like this before, though I must say I\u2019ve never had the pleasure of stripping such a sexy little vixen before.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica might\u2019ve almost taken that as a compliment, if she weren\u2019t in such a position.  It was almost as if he was trying to flirt with her, but with two pairs of tweezers looming over her \u2013 and each large enough to crush her ribcage without effort \u2013 she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to enjoy his playful, almost seductive tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler faltered for only a moment as he gazed at the vixen.  Her heaving chest caught his eye first, and \u2013 with tongue sticking out of the side of his mouth as he concentrated \u2013 he took the hem of her shirt between the prongs of his tweezers, lifting slowly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shut her eyes and squirmed slightly at the sensation of the cool metal tips gliding lightly against her belly fur, unable to comprehend how Tyler was able to be so gentle and yet so rough at the same time.  He never did quite loosen the pressure on her hips, as if he felt he needed to remind her to stay still.  She didn\u2019t think she could have managed to move, even if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGooood girl\u2026just a little bit\u2026\u201d Tyler murmured softly, adjusting his weight and leaning forward a bit closer.  Jessica shivered at the sensation of his hot breath washing over her bare belly, the slight hint of the drake\u2019s mouthwash on the breeze smelling sickeningly sweet, considering it came from a maw large enough to swallow her whole.  She whimpered softly as those tweezers drew the hem of her top \u2013 as well as the tight shirt beneath \u2013 past her muzzle.  Though the lime green top itself was rather loose, the t-shirt she worth beneath was not quite so comfortable.  Jessica could feel both shirts beginning to pull at her arms as he tugged, and before even being asked she raised her arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smirked and tugged a bit more quickly once he saw Jessica\u2019s compliance, chuckling softly at the soft squeak of discomfort that escaped her throat.  He tugged her top away and flicked his wrist, sending it flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!  Hehe\u2026Nice tits.\u201d Tyler\u2019s voice rumbled at her, making the vixen shiver and clench her eyes tightly shut.  She could feel the hot breath from his nostrils increasing in frequency and strength, suggesting that the drake was not only excited, but also leaning in close for a better look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica managed to growl out, \u201cYou want me to take my bra off for you too, pervert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arctic fox flinched as a sharp gust of air blasted against her, the drake snorting his amusement at her question.  He pulled back slightly and licked his lips, \u201cAs a matter of fact, little pet\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much as she refused to admit it, she was enjoying this far, far too much. She always acted the tough girl, mostly to compensate for her smaller stature. She acted so cool and confident around anyone, and never let herself get pushed around... but unknown to everyone save perhaps Ali, she had a thing for big guys. She would never admit it out loud but secretly she begged for them to put her in her place. To take control instead of let her keep controlling them with her attitude and personality. Fang was the closest that had ever come to hitting that, though she didn't give him much of a chance to do so. She liked big guys, not big douches, and Fang was about as Douchey as they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats why she had such a thing for David. He was big, damn big. Second biggest guy in school, behind Fang. And while he was confident, and sometimes even cocky, he wasn't a dick about it, he was just... big, and proud of his size and strength. He didn't go around rubbing it in everyone's face (except the occasional tease to his brother, which was more playful than malicious) but he KNEW he was bigger and stronger than most anyone, and carried himself as such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now here she was, with one of the most timid and subdued guys in school, someone that  just a look from her would make them freeze in place, turn tail and run on any normal day... and now she was totally at his mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she LOVED It. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a twisted power play for her, for her to manipulate and intimidate people so much stronger than her, and yet it would be infinitely more appealing to her if someone were to finally take control. And now, the least likely person to ever do so, was doing so. And that just made it all the Hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you really hated this so much, you'd be flailing, squirming and screaming a whole lot more... but your acting almost exactly the same... being passive aggressive and slightly insulting... your not phased by this...you're loving it...\u201d he murmured accusingly, though his murmur was more of a rumble to the little fox not even 1/50th his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou love it don't you... cmon, just admit it\u201d he rumbled teasingly, grinning wider as his head leaned in closer. He slowly set the pair of tweezers down beside her, and instead slid his massive thumb up, letting it cover her from the knees down. Enough pressure that it kept her from moving (And were she not so much more durable than she should be, probably would've crushed her legs) as his head leaned in closer. \u201cThat's why you shrank yourself... you wanted to be powerless... to have someone else utterly dominate you.\u201d and he was totally right. Normally she was the one that got in people's heads and messed with them... now he was doing it to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis massive purple muzzle lowered down above her, so close that she could reach up and touch his lips. A sudden, powerful blast of hot air blew across her, whipping through her hair and blowing it back as he exhaled across her, then slowly sucked in a deep breath... sniffing her. She could see his body shudder slightly from her scent... he was enjoying this too much. Enjoying having the little spitfire fox in just her underwear, trapped under his thumb... totally at his mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thumb slid up her body, that massive white shard of ivory for his clawtip brushing over her belly, then up along the base of her chest, before catching in the strap of her bra. It pushed upwards just barely, just enough that it tugged her bra up an inch or so (her scale) and caused her to bite her lip to stiffle a groan. Even if she wanted too, she could do nothing to stop Tyler. She was far, far too small to resist, and the wishing stone was still in her Pocket, several feet away from her on the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmf... god you smell good...\u201d he huffed softly, breathlessly. Again a blast of hot air blowing across her, as the source hovered directly above her. He simply hovered there, sniffing at her for nearly a minute, before his lips twisted into a sudden, wide grin and showed off his massive polished ivory fangs. His head pulled back, as did the rest of him, his thumb pulling off her and freeing her from where she was trapped, as the massive giant 'nerd' took a step back... and began to remove his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms crossed infront of his lean torso, grasping opposite hems of his shirt and started to peel the loose fitting Pajama shirt upwards, exposing his taunt, definitionless stomach. His head was briefly hidden from view as he pulled the shirt up over his head then carelessly tossed it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit, he didn't look half bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was just the sheer size of him talking, but he actually had a nice build to him. It was almost always hidden by thick, baggy clothes, but he was a lot less Lanky and skinny than she thought. He still wasn't built by any means at all, but he had just enough definition to be firm and curvy. A flat, firm stomach, pectorals that just barely showed the faintest definition to keep his ribs from showing when he sucked his gut in, and with his shirt off she could see more easily the slight flare of his plump hips and rather thick tush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyou gave me a show, so its only fair that I give you one right?...\u201d he murmured softly, his words seeming to snap her out of her trance. She only realized then she had been sitting there for nearly 5 minutes just watching him take off his shirt and staring, when she could have been taking this time to try and escape.  She was stuck staring... as his paws slid down his stomach, and his thumbs hooked in the waist of his pajama bottoms... and as he started to slide them down, her eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInch after inch the fabric slid down over his plump hips, thick tush and his groin... and good god what a groin it was. She suddenly, immediately realized why he always wore such baggy clothes. With how short he was, it was the only way he could hide... well. THAT. It liked like he had a cucumber stuffed down the front of his pants atop two pingpong balls.. and considering he was easily a foot shorter than the average person it made it look that much more massive on him. God, this little nerd was probably hung better than nearly everyone on the football team, save Fang and David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants dropped down to the floor, and were casually kicked aside, leaving the lean, overhung twink of a dragon in nothing but a pair of bright red boxer briefs, that hugged almost uncomfortably tight against his massive, half hard junk. Clearly she wasn't the only one finding herself incredibly aroused, at least from the what she could see of his massive schlong and how it ground against the front of his underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I...\u201d She squeaked out, seeming to try and find something to say, but unable to form any coherent words, too scared and aroused at the same time to think properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you're going to ask\u201d he interrupted, a wide grin on his muzzle as he slowly slid a paw down, to cup his massive fabric covered nutsac, which visibly spilled out over his too small paw. \u201ca little over 9 Inches, fully hard... I measured every two weeks when I hit puberty...I didn't get much taller, but one part of me was growing...\u201d he rumbled with a slightly cocky grin. This was a side of Tyler that she had never seen before. He was always so shy, timid and nervous in school. So self conscious and worried that others might spot him and make fun of his height... but here he was, oozing confidence, both sexual and otherwise. Maybe it was that he had finally broken his shy streak... or maybe just her size helped ease his shyness... after all, with the way he had stripped those clothes off, she had no doubt he had practiced that by himself... maybe with someone so small, he could just imagine he was alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... now we're both down to our underwear... So I guess its time to take the next step, isn't it?..\u201d he murmured softly, paw giving himself a light grope as he licked over his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about next...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica's jaw dropped as Tyler's deepened, powerful voice boomed high above her, his thunderous, echoing words taking a few seconds to process within her brain. The puny arctic fox snarled with rage as she scooted backwards on the smooth wood, trying to escape the reach of that massive purple digit, \"Damn it, Tyler, quit fucking around! I came here to see <b>David</b>, not entertain some stupid-ass kid-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puny arctic fox yelped as that enormous digit rose up, the titanic, clawed finger flying down to shove her down into the desk. The blunt edge of Tyler's claw kept a firm downwards force against Jessica's puny, furry body as she whimpered and squirmed in futility beneath that huge claw. The looming, monstrous purple dragon giggled deeply at the tinny, pitiful squeaks he'd elicited from the arctic fox girl, leaning down as he tsked playfully, \"Ah ah ah, manners, my little toy...don't you know it's impolite to call names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slender, furry fox girl's eyes were wide with fear as she lay pinned beneath Tyler's claw, the mere fraction of weight he exerted upon her puny form rendering her immobile. The massive, towering dragon was getting out of hand, and it was clear to Jessica that lashing out against the enormous purple behemoth was doing no good. He seemed only amused with her puny shouts, and though the fox girl realized the magical stone's spell upon her form was at least somewhat effective, she didn't want to give the immense, playful young male any reason to get rougher with her. She sighed, wriggling a bit beneath the drake's huge claw as she called up, \"Tyler, come on, I <b>really</b> wanted to see your brother! This isn't fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple drake snorted at the tiny fox's puny words, his warm, humid breath blasting her inch-tall form as he smirked down at her, \"Hehe, well that's just too bad...looks like the only guy <b>you're</b> gonna be getting an eyeful of is me!\" He growled to accent his words, grinning toothily down on his white and pink furred catch, \"Besides, what do you want with my brother, anyway? All I hear is that you make fun of him!\" He raised an eyeridge, leaning forward as he loomed over the puny female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blushed beneath her furred cheeks as Tyler rumbled down to her, her ears half-folded as the gigantic dragon seemed to insist upon keeping her for himself. The fox girl growled a bit at the enormous male's teasing question, shooting him a glare from beneath his claw, \"That's none of your business! And if you think <b>this</b> is making me more inclined to check you out,\" She added, a caustic tone entering her voice as she reflected Tyler's smirk back up at him, \"think again, runt!\" She let the insult slip, too concerned with cutting down the towering male's ego to think of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's grin vanished at Jessica's remark, a dark scowl replacing it as he growled thunderously, his vocalization rattling the desk beneath the fox. Her eyes widened as he bared his enormous, gleaming fangs at her, and she cried out in surprise and fear when his claw pushed harder at her chest, slowly crushing the breath from her lungs as she yelped and squirmed uselessly, frantically trying to pull herself from under the claw. The purple, titanic dragon gave a short, barking laugh at her puny scrabbling, leaning in close as he taunted her, \"Now <b>that</b> wasn't very nice...\" He giggled deeply as she whimpered and wriggled, \"You really should learn to be more polite, my little pet...now, are you done being a little bitch?\" The purple, enormous dragon grinned as the arctic fox gasped for breath, letting up just a bit as he teased, \"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gasped for air as the huge dragon's claw lifted a portion of its immense weight from her chest, her lungs expanding as she greedily sucked in a breath. She took a few lungfuls of air, shouting up at the titanic dragon, \" <b>Okay!</b> J-just let me up!\" The puny, furry female took in a deep, relieved breath as that massive claw ascended from her chest, Tyler's deep, thunderous laughter rocking the world around her as she lay before his towering form, shivering in fear. She hadn't ever thought of David's little brother as being anything but a puny weakling, a nerdy little shrimp no one really paid attention to, but he definitely seemed to possess a grade A Napoleon complex, and the one inch fox girl had gained a new-found fear of pissing the skinny purple dragon off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...I wouldn't want to be in possession of an impolite pet now, would I?\" Tyler chuckled deeply, smirking down at the puny arctic fox as he grinned toothily, \"Now, are you ready to play, my little fox girl? C'mon, it'll be <b>fun</b>!\" He added, the enormous purple dragon's grin returning to his massive snout as he loomed above the fox girl, his expression of excitement at having a tiny, completely helpless fox girl to play with totally genuine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shivered beneath Tyler's monstrous, enormous form, flinching as his deep, booming voice thundered down to her. The tiny fox girl forced back a snarl in response to the purple titan's words, shaking her head and calling back up to the massive dragon, \"O-Okay, fine, I-I'll mess around with you!\" She answered, sighing softly beneath her breath as she agreed to the immense male's request, hoping that Tyler would let her go after having his fun with her. In a way, the arctic fox could somewhat even sympathize with the young male's actions; she knew he probably got more than his fair share of teasing, her own couple of taunts included. Maybe he'd loosen up if she just let him play the big man on campus for once...and she had to admit, Tyler was playing the part of a giant <b>quite</b> well. Still, the white and pink-furred fox girl couldn't help but growl softly up at the towering purple drake as she added, \"You probably wanna see me naked or something pervy like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler burst into deep, booming laughter that shook the desk beneath the slender, lovely little fox, his toothy grin filling Jessica's vision as he thundered, \"...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His words immediately sent Jessica into a frenzy, as she started climbing her way towards the edge of his fingers. The movement across his palm caused Tyler to yelp a bit in suprise, the sensation strange, with those tiny fingers tickling across his paw, and out of reflex he shook his paw and sent Jessica flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d She screamed, to no avail, as she was sent soaring through the air. Her stomach was doing flips in her gut and making her dizzy, as she saw the massive expanse of carpet below rushing up to meet her. Her eyes clenched close for the inevitable impact. Thunk. And she landed on the floor, sent rolling and tumbling across the carpet for, to her, a few yards (When in reality it was just a couple of inches) before rolling to a stop... miraculously, alive. She was far too 'freaked out' by her near death experience to think that she had been saved thanks to her 'fail safe' wish, making the fall, despite her miniscule size, little more than her just tripping and falling over, so all she had at most were a few minor bruises from impact. Of course, today was still not her day, and her trials were far from over, as a dark shadow rose up above her, causing her to look up for its source, and let her eyes go wide at the sight of Tyler's paw hovering ominously overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeehee... sorry little bug, you came in the wrong house... here comes the paw!\u201d Tyler boomed from high above, still seemingly totally oblivious to Jessica's identity, still thinking she was just some strange looking bug. That, to her, massive footpaw began shooting downwards towards the floor and her, causing her to scream in fear and jump to the side. The paw SLAMMED down beside her with enough force to send her sprawling and send a powerful gust of wind across her from the air his foot displaced. \u201cOooh... you're a quick one.. \u201c She heard him taunt overhead, causing her to whimper a bit in fear, glancing to the massive paw beside her then up to its enormous owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat massive purple paw began to lift back up, and this time she took off running. Tyler's thunderous laugh seeming to follow after her as he watched the 'bug' trying to run away from the giant dragon trying to squash it. \u201cYou can't run, lil bug! Big bad Tyler's gonna get you!\u201dHe rumbled thunderously. Paw Slamming down behind her, followed by another one as he began a casual 'stroll' to follow after her. She was running as fast as she could and just him walking was easily overtaking her... she was gonna get crushed at this rate, and only had one thing she knew of that might help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she stuffed her handpaw into her pocket, fishing around for the wishing stone and pulling it out in front of her. As she did, the next step of the massive dragon behind her SLAMMED down where she had been just moments ago and sent her sprawling forward. She was barely able to keep ahold of the stone, as she rolled onto her back and looked up to see that enormous paw hovering overhead, its owner chuckling sinisterly as his toes flexed and splayed in anticipation. This time there was no getting away... she only had one chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish-!\u201d</span></div></div>",

At that moment, Tyler\u2019s foot, flexed and ready to squash his target and was now shocked. The thing suddenly began growing up to his height and shooting up a few inches. In the sheer surprise of this, Tyler had lost his balance, tipping forward and falling towards the now fully grown Jessica, the two of them landing in a heap of limbs. The fox and drake groaned and complained in protest, but Tyler suddenly noticed the position he was in and stopped flailing around as Jessica kept doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, get off\u2026Hey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick smack later, and Tyler was soon standing with a visible smack mark on his check with a scowl on his face. Not even a minute later and Jessica had realized the situation she had been in. Tyler was face first into her breasts and he seemed to be enjoying it. While Jessica certainly didn\u2019t mind the attention, the fact that Tyler was related to her crush and he had tried to squish her completely overpowered those reactions. With a huff, Jessica stood up, the rainbow stone in her hand. She glared at Tyler, who was still nursing his smack mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the anger of trying to squash her was gone, Jessica still had her goal in mind, and she had somewhat succeeded. She was in David\u2019s place, but his brother was currently in the way and this was something she had expected, but not like this. Before she could think about this further, Tyler had interrupted her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust what the hell are you doing, and how did you suddenly appear out of nowhere?\u201d The purple drake asked, tapping his foot on the ground with a scowl. This was not an everyday occurrence, so it was obvious that Tyler wanted some answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how was Jessica going to tell him in a way that made sense? Screw it , not like telling him was going to have any consequences. A smirk forming on her face, she ushered him closer. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, but only if you help me with\u2026something.\u201d She said. Tyler raised a brow and sighed, agreeing.<br>\r\n\u201cSpill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWishing stone.\u201d Was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBull. No such thing as a wishing stone.\u201d Tyler replied skeptically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I thought so too until today. How about I show you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler shrugged his shoulders. \u201cSure. Amuse me.\u201d He said. Jessica made eye contact with the wishing stone, wondering what she could do that would make Tyler into a believer.  \u201cI wish for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\u201d was all she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\nGlaring at the stone, Jessica began shaking the thing in a panic. Why the hell was this thing not working!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler just started chuckling at the fox\u2019s misfortune. \u201cWishing stone, yeah, right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does work, how did you think I got in here?\u201d Jessica countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, you snuck in through the window, I frankly don\u2019t care.\u201d Tyler huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were  bickering over the stone, the stone itself had been a dull color for the past few minutes. As of now, the wishing stone was glowing in it\u2019s marvelous rainbow colors, the fox and drake completely unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really wish I had that sandwich though. Almost dying tends to make someone hungry, a pepsi, too.\u201d Jessica jabbed at the drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the kitchen countertop, a sandwich, along with a bottle of pepsi had appeared , seemingly inviting the fox to chow down and have some grub. The two stared at the countertop for a few seconds before Jessica snapped back at the purple drake with a little dance. \u201chah, I told you!\u201d she cheered. The stone did work, it did! But she wondered why it took so long for the effects to work. Tyler stared at the countertop, baffled as he tried to process this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t. Instead, he just decided to roll with it. Jessica was here for a reason. That reason, he didn\u2019t know. But under the assumption that that the stone actually did grant wishes, this was an amazing discovery. The mere thought of being able to grant any wish was tempting, but he had to get it away from her willingly. Tyler was shorter then Jessica by a good 8 inches and she could probably just take him by height difference. That and Tyler really wasn\u2019t fond of hitting women. An idea soon wormed its way into his head and he smiled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll help you out. But on one condition. I think I know why you\u2019re here, and I think it\u2019d be better to have me give you a hand. But before we do that, I want a wish on that stone.\u201d He said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love to be taken in by the police.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Was he really threatening her with the police? Tyler was not stupid, Jessica knew this. He wasn\u2019t going to go after her, seeing as how he was probably one of the types that disliked hitting women, so he tried striking a deal with her. It was either that, or she had an extra hand in her \u201cplan\u201d. With a sigh, she accepted, handing the stone over to Tyler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t wish me away or shrink me, I\u2019ve had enough of that today.\u201d Jessica added in. Tyler rolled his eyes. Okay, what could he do now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd had fantasies, dreams and even spent several birthday wishes all on this idea, and now he might finally be able to make it a reality! Still grinning to himself, he raised the stone up a bit, causing Jessica to lean in a bit curiously, and then opened his muzzle and spoke in a clear, almost inaudible voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I was taller than David.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blinked a bit in confusion when Tyler spoke his wish, he having said it quiet enough she had barely heard it. Though it quickly became visually apparent what he had wished for and she was able to fill in the blanks. The stone started to glow briefly then went dark again as Tyler's body seemed to shudder involuntarily for a few seconds, then both his and Jessica's eyes went wide as they saw what was happening too him. The sleeves of his T shirt started sliding up till they strained against his shoulders, the front of his shirt pulled tight against his lean, mostly definition-less torso. His legs stretched upwards and outwards, as his jean shorts covered less and less of his thighs and said legs pulled the sleeves of his short taunt. A faint POP sent something thumping against the fox's stomach as the button of Tyler's pants snapped off and was sent flying against her. Within seconds the 5'8\u201d vulpine found herself eye to eye with the formerly 5 foot tall purple dragon. Then she found herself staring at his chin... his throat... his collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigher and higher Tyler felt himself stretching upwards. Eyes slid half closed in a lidded expression of bliss. He felt a bit dizzy from the abrupt changing in height, but the sheer thrill of seeing everything 'shrinking' around him easily overpowered it. 5 foot swelled to 5'6\u201d, then 6 foot. He gave a quiet grunt when he felt uncomfortable pressure spreading across his form, and soon heard a ripping sound as his shirt started tearing apart along his front, his jean shorts soon doing the same as his expanding mass began pulling the seams of them apart. 6 foot swelled to 6'6\u201d... then 7 foot. He looked down and let his eyes widen a bit in surprise when he saw Jessica, formerly towering nearly a head taller than him, staring UP at him from chest level, and still seeming to stretch further and further downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT... Tyler?\u201d Jessica murmured out in surprise as she watched the runt of a dragon tower over her and still continuing to raise higher and higher above her. She gave a quick glance towards David's door then back to Tyler, before reaching out to shove her paws against his stomach. Tyler gave a grunt in surprise and started stumbling backwards, Jessica advancing with her arms planted against his expanding torso. \u201cMove it!\u201d She hissed in a sharp, whispering tone as she tried to shove him back into his room. THUNK. Tyler gave a low groan as the back of his head smacked against the doorframe... the 7 foot tall doorframe. Jessica's eyes widened a bit when she saw that, then only began pushing harder until he finally ducked down, and stumbled back into his own room. With the bedroom door closed and locked, she felt safe from David suddenly discovering them in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Tyler was still continuing to inch higher and higher. He'd passed the 7 foot mark, and by the time that Jessica had locked the door behind her and turned back to look at him, She saw him still stretching upwards. 7'1... 7'3... He was officially taller than David now, and still growing! His shirt was in tatters on him now, like he had put on a child's shirt and just ripped it apart in the process. His jean shorts had fallen down to the ground, unable to hold onto him after the waistline and the leg-sleeves had all been split apart. Leaving him in just a pair of skintight, painted on crimson colored briefs, that weren't doing anything to keep him modest. Tyler didn't even notice the blush spread across Jessica's face, tinting her cheek fur slightly pink. As His growth began to slow, his horns were nearly brushing the 8 foot tall ceiling as he peaked out at around 7 foot 9 inches in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler stood there, all but naked infront of her, Jessica got a first hand look at the one 'redeeming quality' size wise that Tyler had about him. The front of those massively undersized, partially torn red briefs were distended out obscenely, to the point they probably just made Tyler's endowment look bigger rather than giving any level of modesty too him. To her, it looked like he had two lemons stuffed into the basket of his briefs, with a (She noticed with a more intense blush) half hard 'cucumber' sized bulge for his dick. It was so thick and bloated that it pulled the waistband of his briefs away from his waistline, exposing some of the musky, black flesh of his cockbase, and his balls similarly distended the fabric around his legs, exposing part of themselves as well simply from their sheer volume. She had no reason to think this was anything other than his natural size, considering that save for his height nothing else seemed to have changed. He was still lean, bordering on scrawny, so he hadn't put on any muscle, and thus she had no reason to think other 'size' had been added... that was all Tyler. And she was struggling not to drool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica always had a thing for big guys. Whether it be Tall, muscular or 'big' where it counted, she was a size queen. The only person she'd ever seen bigger than David, male wise, had been Fang. And even if he was the biggest, beefiest guy she'd ever seen, she wouldn't touch Fang with a 10 foot pole, he was way too full of himself. She liked confident, even cocky guys, but Fang had his head shoved too far up his own ass for her liking. Now, she had Tyler right infront of her, nearly as tall as Fang was! And while blatantly not as muscular as Fang, or even David for that matter, she could tell he could easily rival, if not outright beat both of them where it mattered most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler meanwhile was unable to stop grinning as he swept his head back and forth across the room, admiring how TINY everything looked. He reached down to grab one of his shirts laying on the floor, almost bursting out laughing at the size of it compared to him now. He was about to try flopping down on his bed to see how far his legs stuck off the end of it before he turned his gaze back to Jessica, seeming to have momentarily forgotten about her.... then realizing how 'exposed' he was, and immediately crossed his arms infront of his groin to try to hide himself. That only made Jessica giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhats the matter, big guy?... you've got nothing to hide...\u201d She murmured softly. She'd never been that interested in Tyler before, at absolute most maybe casual friend level from when she'd sneak over to his game shop. But now, she couldn't take her eyes off him. She couldn't tell if it was the new height was making her better appreciate other things about him she'd never payed attention too before, or if she was just blatantly being shallow, and being attracted to someone so tall that she'd need a step ladder to kiss him. Either way, she found herself Turned on, and incredibly attracted to the towering purple dragon 'boi'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cer... um... maybe I should... er... try to find some clothes...\u201d Tyler murmured in embarrassment, trying to shuffle his way over towards his closet, while still trying to keep his paws infront of his groin. Though he didn't make it far, before Jessica stepped over into his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please... don't trouble yourself...\u201d She murmured with a devious grin up at the looming purple drake, licking softly over her lips and only further unnerving Tyler. \u201cThis is juuuust fine with me, just as you are. I never really thought about it before... and now I feel kind of stupid for it\u201d She murmured in a low, growled tone, causing Tyler out of reflex to step backwards from the fox more than 2 foot shorter than him, as if 'intimidated'. She quickly closed the gap again with another step forward. \u201cI've always had a thing for big guys... that why I shrunk myself down so I could sneak in and spy on that big hunk of meat you call your brother.\u201d She continued softly, her words becoming more and more drenched in those sweet, sugary and 'seductive' words of hers. \u201cSo I can't believe it didn't dawn on me till now, that I don't have to find some big guy now... I can make any one of you I want big...just like you did to yourself. Why seek them out, when I can make them myself...\u201d She murmured, licking over her lips again. Tyler retreating till his back bumped against the wall behind him, and Jessica still advancing with that rather Predatory grin of hers. She reached down breifly to snatch up the wishing stone from where Tyler had dropped it, then grinned up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you know Tyler...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cW-what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d stammered Tyler, claws digging into the mattress with uneasy anticipation as his eyes nervously tracked the stone that Jessica was turning end over end in her delicate black-furred paws. \u201cI... er... if I get any bigger, I won\u2019t be able to fit inside my room!\u201d he added with a whine.<br>\r\n\u201cSuits me just fine.\u201d replied Jessica with a toothy grin. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you all bent over. To that end, I wish...\u201d Tyler flinched reactively, horns scraping the ceiling as those fateful words slipped from Jessica\u2019s mouth, which curled into a wry smile at the big drake\u2019s reaction. \u201cOh, you big baby, lighten up! This is gonna be great! I wish you were bigger in every way... bigger than anyone ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Tyler hadn\u2019t had a reason to flinch before, he had one now. Jessica watched with glee as the dragon began to swell up, musculature defining itself on his scrawny hide as 7\u2019 9\u2019\u2019 became even more than that. Tyler quickly surpassed the 8 foot mark as Jessica ran an exploratory padded finger down Tyler\u2019s thickening calf muscles.<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, very good... I approve. So, have you been working out, Tyler?\u201d she joked, taking in the growing drake in all his magnificence, watching his skinny chest develop a small valley between impressive slab-like pectorals and a textbook washboard stomach quickly appearing not long after.<br>\r\n\u201cT-this isn\u2019t funny!\u201d spluttered Tyler, hunched up uncomfortably against the roof and trying not to break through it. Sure, being huge \u2013 and now beefy \u2013 had been a dream of his for the longest time, but did it have to be done this way? He wasn\u2019t sure he was happy with Jessica ogling his naked form \u2013 hell, he didn\u2019t even know her that well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... well, she and him did share a common interest now, it had to be said. She wanted him to get big, and he wanted to <i>be</i> big. If it meant stealing Jessica\u2019s attentions away from his bigger... sorry, <i>smaller</i> brother, he thought he could get comfortable with that. His uncomfortable grimace turned into a toothy smirk to match Jessica\u2019s own satisfied grin as he looked over his body. It hardly looked like his! His purple hide clung tightly to his statuesque physique, each muscle a work of art on its own. He lost himself in admiring his muscular form for a moment, when he caught a glimpse of Jessica\u2019s eyes, staring at a certain something he had been neglecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit, was that his? A monolith of ebony flesh was jutting from his hips, two feet of imposing draconic meat which had caught the attentions of Jessica, who was practically drooling over the colossal cock as she took in the view.<br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see?\u201d Tyler asked with a growl of pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours, if you think you can handle it.\u201d Ten foot of studly, muscular dragon sat before Jessica, hunched as he tried not to damage his room with his rapidly expanding bulk, heavy paws pushing discarded clothes across the carpet.<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take you up on that offer, big guy.\u201d Replied Jessica with a grin. Dextrous black paws met the throbbing warm flesh of Tyler\u2019s enhanced endowments, as Jessica slowly traced the length of his cock, a wave of tingling pleasure following her touch. \u201cY\u2019know... you\u2019re probably the biggest guy I\u2019ve ever seen. Maybe the biggest guy, period. But I\u2019ve had a thought...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A low, Rumbling moan seemed to vibrate through the very air as Jessica\u2019s agile fingers brushed across that behemoth spire of meat for Tyler's enlarged endowment. He had always been pretty well hung, but now his swollen erection was easily 1/5 as long as he was tall! And when he was 10 foot tall, that was saying something. The huge, throbbing mass of flesh was thicker around than a soda can, hell it made Jessica's arm look like a twig. The thick, pre drooling head was almost the size of a cantaloupe, and each of his massive nuts were even bigger than that! It took both of her paws to even properly hold it upright, otherwise it simply hung down at an angle, simply too heavy to fully support its own immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Big didn't even seem to come close to describing Tyler now. Fang was the biggest guy Jessica had ever met, and Tyler's current form would make that meat-headed wolf look like the runt of the litter in comparison.  It was a bit hard to tell for sure, since Tyler had to hunch down significantly to not simply tear through the ceiling, but shed guess he had to be around 10 foot tall, considering she wasn't even quite 6 foot tall, and was barely taller than his waistline (Not a bad view, she might add). And those Muscles! His biceps each easily outsized his own head. His shoulders were swollen thick enough that they all but engulfed the thick tendons of meat that lined his neck and throat. His thighs had to be thicker around than her entire body, and she actually had to stand back a couple of feet from him to be able to see his face over the thick shelf of his pectorals. She couldn't help but imagine herself stuffing her muzzle and tongue deep into that muscular 'cleavage', deep enough that she could drop pencils in it and they'd just disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat massive length of ebony cock bobbed heavily in front of him as he shifted his weight, those immense tree-trunks for thighs flaring and flexing outwards even from that minor movement, jostling the thick and heavy hanging nutsac dangling in front of them.  The behemoth of a once whimpy purple dragon grinned down at the vixen standing 'so far below' him, his tail swinging heavily back and forth behind him and unintentionally smacking his alarm clock off the bedside table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm... Fuck\u201d He growled out deeply. Even his voice rumbling with power, having dropped at least a half dozen octaves deeper into a rich, almost booming baritone. \u201cLook at me, I'm fucking HUGE!\u201d  He snarled, tongue sliding out to lick hungrily over his lips as he raised up one of his arms, watching how even without flexing his bicep tenses and shifted about, then glanced down at the immense slab of meat jutting proudly from his hips that Jessica had to use both paws just to properly hold up. \u201cDamn girl..\u201d He chuckled, winking down at the now 'shrimpy' fox in front of him. \u201cMaybe I'm a bit TOO much for you to handle now... can't even hold up my dick without both of your arms, can you?...\u201d He taunted, the thought alone of that fact only further arousing him and causing more of what already had to be almost a cup of thick pre to drool from his cock head, dribbling down the under channel and over Jessica's fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should come up there and Join you...\u201d She growled out quietly, struggling to keep her own lust in check as she blatantly ogled the enormous slab of manmeat in front of her. And the rest of Tyler as well. \u201cIt's gonna take a lot of woman to properly handle someone as big...\u201d She paused, rubbing a paw down the length of his massive erection \u201cAnd Strong...\u201d and again paused, as her fingers stroked over the all but unmoving, marble sculpted purple abdominals covering his stomach \u201cAs a hunk like you...\u201d And with that, she started to lift up the wishing stone again, struggling to take her eyes off Tyler's enormous form for a few seconds to look at the stone and make her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish th-\u201d She started to say, but was abruptly cut off, as one of Tyler's massive handpaws reached down, sweeping her arm off his abs, and up against the one holding the stone. His fingers closed in a powerful, vice like grip around both of her lithe arms, and suddenly the floor simply disappeared from beneath her feet, as her arms were raised up over her head. Without even seeming to realize the effort it should have taken, bicep and shoulder bulging from holding up her weight, Tyler was holding Jessica in midair with just one arm, raising her up to his (Crouched down) eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on just a minute...\u201d He rumbled deeply, the barely contained lust obvious in his voice as his massive muzzle hovered in front of her own. \u201cYou already wished for me to be the biggest guy on the planet... so here I am\u201d He growled out. A loud THUMP shaking the floor a bit as he flopped back onto his ass, eliciting a muffled yell from David's room for Tyler to keep it down, which only made Tyler grin more. \u201cIt'd take a pretty big girl to properly handle someone as big as me... dunno if even that giant of a roommate of yours would be up to the challenge.... And maybe I Like It like that\u201d He added with a deep, snarling growl of lust, showing off his razor sharp fangs, even those looking massive compared to how they used to be. \u201cSo why don't we just take this...\u201d He paused, as his other paw raised up to pluck the wishing stone out of Jessica's grasp, and somewhat carelessly toss it over onto his desk across the room \u201cAnd leave it over there for safekeeping... \u201c All the while his cock continued to constantly drool pre from his tip, forming a small, literal, puddle in between his legs, that Jessica ended up standing in as she was lowered back down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail was curled in between and around one of her legs, her undergarments were soaked with her own arousal,and she kept having to lick her suddenly dry lips. She couldn't remember the last time she had been this turned on. He had manhandled her so easily, just lifting her clean up off the ground without even having to try. There was no doubt in her mind that he was in control. Once his size had overpowered that timidness and shyness that came with his previously Tiny height, he had quickly fallen In to the use of the raw strength that his body had... probably from years of watching David do the same thing (Or finally living out fantasies she could only imagine how often he would dream about). He could pin her down beneath a foot without any problem, he could toss her through a wall with no effort at all, Hell if she tried to hit him, shed probably hurt her fist more than shed hurt him... and all of that just turned her on all the more. But despite that, she still had her 'reputation' to keep, even if it was cracked and leaking now, she had no intention of giving up her dominant role... at least not without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blatantly seductive swish of her hips she took the last couple of steps closer until she was standing directly infront of his massive nutsac, that huge pillar of meat sticking out between her legs, and her toes even brushing against the sensative flesh of his balls, which only made the giant dragon growl deeper in his own barely contained lust. \u201cMy My, Little Tyler sure did take control rather quickly, didn't he?... \u201cShe cooed teasingly, grinning up at him and having to mentally struggle to keep her tail from tucking back between her legs every time she thought about how massive he was, and how easily he could overpower her. \u201cJust remember who's in charge here big boy..\u201d She gave a playful growl, as she reached out and teasingly stroked her finger across his steel hard pectoral. \u201cyou're MY big boy, after all... and I'm the one that gets to choose what I do with MY boys...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea... About that...\u201d Tyler replied, grin growling all the wider...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...I don't think so,\" Tyler growled lowly. The predatory drake looked down with a wicked grin and the little arctic fox splayed out on top of him. He grabbed her and lifted her off his chest and stomach, suspending her in the air. As he did so, the big purple dragon got comfortable on his now minuscule bed, the queen-size mattress unable to contain his massive back, his towering height so large his legs dangled off the ends. Tyler licked his chops, he's in control now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-put me down, Tyler,\" Jessica squealed. She didn't anticipate Tyler to do this. At the moment, she was scared that the once puny now giant dragon was going to get violent with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" he cooed. With ease, he lowered the arctic fox with one massive hand, using his fingers to push at the back of her neck, forcing her face to be mashed into his colossal prick. The behemoth of a drake let out a pleasured, satisfied moan, the friction of Jessica's fine fur against his meat confirmation of just how huge he was now, just how dominant he was now; just how perfect he was now. But he wanted more. \"Lick it,\" he grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica snorted, trying to force the entering her nasal cavity out. The vixen let out a whimper before she complied. This was humiliating, getting tossed around by a former runt! However, a slight tingling in her panties told her otherwise. Tyler was her fault. She made Tyler into what he was now. She turned Tyler into a huge, hulking piece of man. And the though of it, that she moulded her boy in the image of perfection made her quiver. Slowly, her eyes glazed over, her tongue coming out of her mouth on its own. In her stupor, Jessica looked at the angry head spurting waves of pre, the torrent so thick it bubbled out of Tyler's dick like a homemade baking soda-vinegar volcano. There was no way Tyler could expect her to drink that down, she'd be full in a matter of seconds. Instead, she brought her snout down over to side, licking him just underneath the glans. Tyler recoiled instantly, the sensation of her smooth tongue playing with his shaft simply too much for him to keep coordinated. He let out a deep bellow, his bass-laden guttural groaning vibrating the window-pane in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big drake let go of her, content with her obedience. \"That's a good girl,\" he said, his baritone voice smoothly encouraging her as he stroked the silky tuft of fur on top of her head, admiring the neon pink streak running down her back- Her clothes obscured his vision of his girl and that simple would not do. Tyler began to tug at her outer shirt, but found it hard for his meaty fingers to gain purchase on her small frame. In a fit of blind rage, the dragon took a sharp claw and began to split the shirt down the middle before grabbing hold of the flaps he created and tearing the shirt in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stopped her ministrations and spun around. \"What the fuck, Tyler!\" she hissed, holding her ripped shirt on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it all off if you don't want to piss your new master off,\" he growled, furrowing his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's it!\" Jessica snarled. <i>No one</i> owns Jessica Hallows; not her parents, not dickwads on the football team - and. Definitely. Not. Tyler. Fucking. Matthews. She brought her fists up and clawed her way up Tyler's massive frame. With her claws out, she took a swipe at Tyler's face, her nails barely digging into the massive dragon's hide. A trickle of blood oozed out of the fresh wound, a hand attached to a bulging arm came up and wiped it away, the drake looking at his own blood, his eyes going red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sonic roar came out of Tyler's mouth. Nobody pushed him around anymore! He sat up, sending Jessica flying all the way to the end of the bed, having to grab onto Tyler's bludgeon of a cock so that she didn't simple fly into wall across the room from the force of the drake catapulting her off of his sculpted chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint \"Yo, Shut the fuck up!\" came from a couple rooms down, David obviously hearing the racket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler began to break into a deep, sonorous, a quite frankly evil sounding cackle. \"Jessica,\" he cooed menacingly, lifting her by grabbing her easily by the scruff of her neck with only his thumb and index finder and turning her around so that she came face-to-face with his sinister grin. \"I don't think you get it, girl. I am in complete control now.\" With that, he took his other paw and began to rip her black body-hugging shirt down the front, revealing her chest and torso fully. With a deep chuckle the drake made it child's play with unhooking her bra with one claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler admired his prize, the soft feminine curves of her body, her sleek silky white fur, those perky round breasts. They were his to control. His to enjoy. He brought her to his mouth and began to suckle on her breast, filling his mouth with jiggling mammary, flicking his tongue over the hardening nipple. Jessica couldn't help it, she was getting aroused by Tyler's colossal display of might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jessica began to get used to Tyler's ministrations, the giant drake threw her onto his abdomen, her hands finding purchase on the ridges that formed his core. \"Strip,\" he commanded. Jessica knew better than to resist, the defeated fox discarded her belt and pulled down her jeans to reveal her neglig\u00e9e, a soft lacy black thong. Tyler rumbled at the sight and before she even got her jeans down to her ankles he already had a bestial paw rubbing against her crotch. \"You're already wet,\" he rumbled with delight. Jessica nodded emptily, her hands trying to cover up her exposed breasts, trying not to feel like she's a whore being used by this brute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the behemoth Tyler had become sliced the band to her thong, revealing her pussy. Instinctually, the fox covered herself up, but Tyler had other ideas. \"Hmm, I am a bit peckish after all that growing,\" he growled sultrily. \"I wish I had something to eat,\" he said with a slightly sinister giggle. \"Mmhmm, and I think I my wish just came true.\" The beast brings her up to his mouth again, shoving his snout between her legs to expose her vadge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox let out a sharp yip as she felt Tyler's rough tongue entering her. Most guys never even tried to eat her out and even when it came to sex, none of them were this intense.  As Tyler continued, she tries to keep herself composed, trying not to reveal the sexual bliss she's experiencing. But it didn't work. In moments she felt it coming; her big O. She latched onto the back of the drake's giant head, using his horns to stabilize herself as the tension built. Until finally, it came. The contractions began, almost spontaneously, she felt it everywhere, deep in her vagina all the way to her quivering lips. Tyler realizes this as well, revelling in his sexual prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe throws her back down onto his abs and sighs contentedly. Jessica on the other tries to recover from her orgasm, her legs feel like putty as she still feels the slight aftershocks. \"Your turn,\" the beast of dragon cooed, placing his titanic arms behind his head as he looked at her expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica feels compelled to obey, not wanting to upset the tyrant Tyler's become. She slowly moves herself over to his erect shaft, the two foot spire of meat bobbing wantingly, inviting her to play. She pushes at it with all her might, using both her hands to massage the skin underneath the glans, eliciting moans from her master\u2026 Yes, for now, Tyler is her master; the man that is complete control. At the same time, she brings her muzzle down and licks the head of his shaft. She can hear Tyler's breathing becoming laboured, the monster nearing release, his panting becoming more like snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she'd have to work harder to get this demigod off. She began to hug the shaft, her entire body moving with it as it twitched and lurched, the drake snarling as he felt his shaft fill the space between her breasts, felt her rubbing her clit along the base of his spire, felt her toes rubbing against his monumental nutsack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler began to roar and Jessica felt her whole frame of reference shift, the dick she'd latched herself onto moving her entire body as the purple titan began his release. A thick streamer of semen erupted from Tyler's tip, an audible squirting sound of liquid whizzing by her face. Jessica held on for dear life, literally riding through Tyler's orgasm, closing her eyes as she felt molten hot jizz rain down on her, a cataclysmic ooze rolling over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears still rang by the time it was over, Tyler was anything but subtle during his climax, the huge dragon spitting sweet profanities that punctuated his unending string of moaning, groaning, roaring and snarling as he came. Jessica's heart was pounding; Tyler was loud enough to wake the dead\u2026 That surely meant that David had bound to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd surely enough, there was a knocking at the door. \"What the fuck are you doing in there, you little shrimp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked up in awe. Tyler tossed her off of himself, the poor abused vixen landing on her rump on the cum-soaked carpet, the drake casually getting up to stoop inside his now too small room. Jessica gulped when she saw the predatory look on the purple drake's face. Tyler sauntered up to the desk and grabbed the wishing stone before flashing a lewd grin at the fox. She couldn't move, paralyzed by the fear of what Tyler could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica could barely make out the whispered wish coming out of Tyler's mouth, the dragon absently flexing his arms for himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wish this reality always had the big me.\" Tyler had a huge evil grin on his face as he eyed Jessica, the lithe arctic fox trembling as she realized what Tyler had in hand. \"I'm here to stay, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic purple drake was expecting some world shattering earthquake or some sort of tornado to sweep his house away. He imagined there to be some swirl of colour, like rainbow cyclone. But nothing of the sort happened. All Tyler saw was the unsatisfying fade of the glow in the stone, as if it had just shut itself off instead of granting his life-altering wish. Piece of shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler?\" came a girly voice, the tone sultry. The big purple guy looked up to see Jessica still plastered with his potent seed beginning to sit up and scratch the back of her neck. The look she gave him was soft, her small smile genuine. \"What's that you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler knew she was referring to the wishing stone. Had his wish actually worked? Why didn't Jessica recognize it, it was hers. Even more strange was the grin growing on her face as she stood up and made her way to him, the big guy stooping in stunned silence as she came up and grabbed the stone in his meaty paws. His initial reaction was to pull away, but something felt odd about the way she held his hand, there was barely any force in her actions; as if she trusted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, she took the magic rock from him and placed it on his desk; one that he could never in a million years hope to use with his massive size, but it must have came furnished with the house when he and David decided to rent it, at least that much hadn't changed. But Jessica... the way she looked at him. She inched her finger for him to bend down and for some reason he did. The next thing he knew, he felt a tingly sensation wash through his body; she had just kissed him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox just giggled and held her hand up. Tyler's body moved on its own, scooping up what he guessed was his fox, his girl, off her feet and cradling her in his massive arms. To Tyler's surprise, he found out he could actually stand up straight... why hadn't he noticed before? That's when he noticed David was still banging on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Ty-tard!\" David's gruff voice boomed from the other end. \"Stop fucking your girlfriend. You're gonna make us late for practice again.\" This surprised the big drake, one, because it confirmed that he and Jessica were an item and two... he was on the football team?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler mustered his courage. He should be bigger than David now, the blue dragon's now the twerp of the family. A growing desire to push David around grew and festered in Tyler's gut. He was going to enjoy this. He flung open the door to see David standing there, an unamused expression on his face, his meaty as ever arms crossed over his still impressive chest. It looks like Tyler's world altering wish hadn't changed his brother one bit... or had it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler flexed his body, puffing out his chest, showing David how big and how much bigger he was than him. But it didn't garner the reaction he wanted. Instead of David's eyes going wide, or a squeal of terror from his blue brother, David began to tap his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I'm scared, Tyler,\" David snarled. \"What's next, you gonna whip your oversized dick on me? Oh wait, you already have.\" The slight roll of his eyes, the snarky attitude; Tyler never expected David, his dim-witted brother, to master the art of sarcasm. Everything David was telegraphing, his body language, his speech; it all told Tyler that David wasn't the least bit impressed by the display of raw masculinity. And that wasn't fair. David lorded his size over him for years, telling him how tiny he is, how inadequate of a dragon he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it, it was time to get a bit physical. Tyler growled and punched his own fist, cracking his knuckles a bit. That ought to intimidate David, get the snide blue drake in his face to tremble in his booties a bit... Except it didn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think you can take me on?\" David said coldly. \"Dude, you know I'm the state champion at wrestling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? Tyler never remembered that. It seems in this universe, David somehow has maintained his status as the 'bigger brother' despite Tyler's new humongous size. And that irked Tyler relentlessly. He squeezed out of his room and charged at David. Before he knew it, David had somehow gotten him to the ground, his massive arms pinned by David's comparatively puny arms. When the hell did David learn to do all this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler squirmed and writhed under David's grip. David was still as strong as ever, but Tyler was stronger. Much much stronger. He broke free from the grip and pushed at David. Tyler swung his tail and accidentally knocked over a small table, scattering the contents, various family photos falling, the frames cracking as the crash to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, Tyler!\" David roared. There was anger in his voice, that was for sure... but also anguish. Tyler watched stunned as David scrambled to the floor to pick up the frames and search through the photographs, making sure they're intact. David was seething. \"Tyler,\" he rumbled darkly. \"Go take a fucking shower and meet me downstairs. We're going to practice.\" <i>Jeez, it's just some photographs, David</i>, Tyler thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler had a naughty idea, screw David. He's going to have some fun. \"Hey, babe,\" he yells into his room, seeing Jessica sitting on his bed, which he realized is now enormous to accommodate his titanic frame and brushing herself down. She looks up with a grin and tilts her head in curiosity. \"Take a shower with me?\" he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was an accommodating girlfriend, that's what Tyler found out. She rubbed down every part of his body, getting him squeaky clean, even using her tongue to clean his 'fleshy fun-bridge,' even now with a towel around his waist he shuddered at how exquisite it felt to have a girl fawning over his titanic body like that. He also found out she was pretty easy to please, just a good flex and she'd be putty in his arms. Good stuff to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler walked out into the hallway, now pulling on a tight black t-shirt, to which he enjoyed wearing immensely as it stretched and strained to cover his ginormous bulk, he noticed David had already rearranged the table, the picture frames neatly lined up again. He picks one up in particular, the one David so desperately struggled to make sure it was okay. There he was, as big as he is now, wearing only his swimming trunks and sitting on what looks like a pier on a lake, his impressive basket not even close to being obscured by the fabric. He was holding onto a smiling arctic fox, her eyes hidden by a pair of shades. But what really made his uneasy was David. There was his brother, just as impressively built as he always remembered. But what he never remembered was him leaning down to plant a kiss on a sheepish looking Marcus. Marcus was gay? Wait... David was gay?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't your fault,\" Jessica said softly as she came up behind Tyler. What wasn't his fault? He couldn't say it outright... but something about all this scared him. Did he... did he do something in this reality? He thought this wish would be awesome, and for the most part, it is. But Tyler couldn't help but feel there was something terribly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, I didn't mean to knock the table over,\" Tyler said sheepishly. In reality, Tyler was hoping she'd hint at what he had actually done in the past in this reality. Instead he just got a slow shaking of Jessica's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler felt a bit deflated. Sensing this, the fox rubbed his hand. \"You better get going, have fun at practice, okay? If you need me, I'll be hanging with Alli.\" He leaned down and she kissed him gently on the cheek. At least he always could look forward to that, no matter how bad this reality turns out. And if worst comes to worst, he could always unwish it, returning everything back to normal. Even if it did mean losing all his new found size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strut out into the garage where David was already waiting for him inside the truck. The blue drake honked the horn, urging Tyler to hurry the fuck up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, let me drive,\" Tyler said as he opened the passenger side door. \"It's my truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" David said incredulously. He looked down his snout at Tyler. \"Your truck? Your truck?! Since when the fuck did you ever pay for a single goddamn thing, Tyler?! You don't pay for any of the goddamn rent, you don't clean up after yourself at home. You never help at my hobby shop. Hell, I wrote your last English essay, and did you <i>ever</i> stop to thank me for that A? No. You're a fucking sponge, Tyler.\" There were so many things wrong with this; David's the breadwinner in the family? David's smart?! Wait... David owns <i>his</i> shop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about the picture, David,\" Tyler muttered, looking down as he climbed in and hung his head low. David definitely did not look up to Tyler in this reality either it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sorry?\" David replied bitterly. \"You're-\" The blue drake stopped himself when he saw Tyler's eyes beginning to mist. Tyler didn't know what he did, but already the purple drake's conscience was taking over. \"Tyler,\" he said dryly. \"You know I've forgiven you, right? You know I've moved on. But it's just... sometimes, you make it so hard to love you as my little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler steps out. \"Tell coach, err, whoever's in charge I can't come today... I've got something I need to do...\"</span></div></div>",

It's time for you to get HUGE!\" Jessica said with a much larger grin spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!\" Tyler gulped as he watched the fox raise the wishing stone up into view again, giving it a quick toss in the air and catching it again, \"But if I get any bigger I'll burst right out of the room... heck maybe even the whole house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica simply smirked at the oversized dragon and leaned in a bit closer to his now much more muscular body, having to reach up so she could trail her finger slowly down the tight crevice between his thick pectoral muscles, \"No need to worry you big lug. I know how we can get around that 'little' problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then clutched the stone a bit tighter and started to make her next wish, taking in a deep relaxing breath as she did so, \"I wish... that Tyler and I were in a large romantic secluded spot away from any distractions or prying eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler simply looked down curiously as she made the wish, then the two waited for any signs that something was happening. Several seconds passed and nothing happened, almost making them think that it wasn't going to work, however their hopes were renewed as the stone began to shimmer and glow brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around them began to fade and warp, reality itself bending to their will, for a moment it appeared as if they were in two locations at once as the cramped confines of Tyler's bedroom gradually fade away, only to be replaced by something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments they both find themselves on a large beach staring up at a clear star filled sky, the bright light of the moon illuminates the area, and indeed it appeared as if they were completely alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprise of being whisked away all of a sudden in such an unusual way caused Tyler to become slightly disoriented, he fell back onto his rump causing Jessica to giggle cutely. She pushes herself closer against his side and now that Tyler is sitting down she is at the perfect level where she can lean her muzzle in close to his and say in a soft teasing voice, \"So what do you say we make you a 'really big' boy hmm?\" following that by pecking a kiss to the dragons lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler could hardly believe this was happening, he had always been a shrimpy dragon next to his brother and most other dragons he had seen, but now here he was larger than life in all ways possible, alone with a beautiful woman who not only made his dreams of being bigger come true, but make his dream sizes look small in comparison. He stared at her longingly, feeling things which seemed like more than simple attraction, 'Could this be... love?' he thought to himself, his heart beating faster as he watched over her, almost unable to form words after being lost in his own thoughts, especially after that cute little kiss. He simply nods and eventually manages to get his words out, \"Lets do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica holds the stone up in the air and takes another slow deep breath before speaking her wish, \"It's time to get huge. I wish Tyler was gigantic! at least five times the size he is now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Five times?!' Tyler thought to himself again, his eyes go wide as he tries to imagine just how big he's going to get, the thought alone gets the blood pumping back into that monster between his legs, causing it to plump up bigger before the growth has even started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone starts to shine once again after a few seconds pass and almost immediately Tyler can feel the familiar  warm tingling spreading through his body as his body begins to push out bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at the small arctic fox next to him, their eyes meet and he watches in wonder as she appears to grow even smaller next to his enlarging form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe too watches in astonishment as the huge hunk of a dragon starts to loom over her more and more even while he sits on the ground, she looks up and down his body, stopping when she that thick malehood, \"Looks like someone's enjoying himself.\" she says as she reaches over to stroke a handpaw over his swelling thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler lets out a soft groan as she feels over his body, his height already grown by at least another two foot, he quietly chuckles with his deeper bass filled voice and reaches down, wrapping his arms around her and pulls her up off the ground, hugging her to his thickly muscled body while he lays back with her resting atop his front. He looks at her dwindling form and pushes his lips to hers while he's still small enough to do so and gives her a deep passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica is taken by surprise, expecting to remain on the ground so she can see this titan of a man tower over her, but when she feels those arms around her she can't help but feel so safe, so warm, and then the dragons lips press against hers and she simply looses herself in the moment and returns the affection, sliding her tongue into his much larger maw so it can dance and play with his. She can feel this tongue as well as his lips growing bigger as they make out, and after a few more moments they eventually break the kiss and stare into each others eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was laying atop a dragon who was at least 20ft tall now and still steadily growing with each passing second, she could feel his body beneath her stretching out in all directions, those enormous powerful pectoral muscles pressing up against her chest feel so hard yet so warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing dragon loosens his hug on her so she can move around more freely and better explore is body. She lowers herself down so her face is level with his chest and begins to rub her cheek against slab of muscle, even going so far as to give it a gentle sniff so she can take in the intoxicating masculine scent of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Jessica growing smaller and playing with him was sending Tyler's hormones wild, his cock was painfully hard and throbbing with need. The dragons body continues to swell out bigger... bigger, the sound of his lust filled groans echo across the empty beach while his body covers more of the still warm sand, 30ft comes and goes after a few more moment, quickly approaching 40ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Jessica was teasingly flicking her tongue over a nipple nearly as big as her head, her hands massage into the smooth purple flesh all around her, she was always interested in big guys and now she could have one as big as she wants, even though she was the small one she was the one with the power here, she could make Tyler as big or small as she wanted, thoughts of the power she held as well being with someone so incredibly huge were driving her wild too. <br>\r\nShe takes a moment to look at the rest of his body and almost has a heart attack at the sight of his cock standing proudly so huge beneath her, my god it was easily bigger than her whole body and still growing more along with the rest of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more moments pass and the tingling starts to fade from Tyler's body, the growth comes to an end when he reaches roughly an astounding 50ft tall. He looks down at the little fox on his chest and smiles warmly, his whole face fills her view to almost a frightening degree, his hand reaches up and he extends a finger to carefully and very gently rub over her back, \"Mmmmmm, now that's more like it. I'm... I'm so huge! Bigger than anyone in the world, and now, my body is your playground my cute little foxy fluff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wriggles nervously for a moment when that giant digit rubs over her back, but quickly begins to relax again when she realizes how gentle Tyler is being, she gives his thick pectoral a kiss and smiles back up to him, \"Now it's time for some real fun my big handsome beefcake. How about...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh yes. This was going to be her best plan ever. The lean, pink haired arctic fox giggled to herself as she carefully climbed her way over the iron cast fence surrounding the university grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had always been a bit of a wild child. Ever since she was a little girl, she'd compensate for her height with her attitude. Doing what she wanted, taking what she wanted, and all the while making it out into a great time. She loved to have fun, whether it be rock climbing with a friend, out on a date with some big, hunky slab of meat for a guy, or just doing the bump and grind with a dozen strangers in a night club. Tonight, however, had the potential to be the most fun that she ever had. Though she would never admit it to anyone, and even her roommate and BFF Allison was barely privy to the knowledge, but Jessica was a bit of a computer geek. She had a real knack for messing with code and programming, and had been 'sneaking' out to intern in the afternoons at the University's computer research wing. One of the more recent projects she had heard about was a prototype full-immersion virtual reality program. One that, despite her best efforts, she had been unable to get anywhere close too. After all, they didn't really need an intern to file for them or skim last gen code for errors on a top of the line experimental project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jessica made her own plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor weeks she got to know those that were on the team as best as she could, some from afar and some personally. Then she learned the security rounds, and made notes of where all the cameras were, and what doors were locked and what weren't. With a bit of work, she had let one of the lab techs 'misplace' their badge around her, and had to get a new one, and with that in hand she was able to make a fake access card that would get her access to anything in the building. Yes, it was a LOT of effort just for some 'good time', but as far as Jessica thought about it, the added risk just made the reward more desirable. \u201cThe Journey is half the fun\u201d She would quote all the time to Allison. Well, tonight was going to be her most interesting journey yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unable to stifle giggles when she found herself humming the mission impossible theme as she snuck her way across the campus towards the looming brick building in front of her.  Once there, she followed along the edge of the building till she came to the small truck loading dock behind the building. Carefully, she slipped a paw into the small laptop bag she had with her and pulled out the hacked security card and swiped it through the key reader. With silent glee, she jerked the door open once the lock's light turned green, and slipped herself inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, all it took was a bit of sneaking up against one wall to avoid a camera, to slip herself into the tiny security station inside. She quickly skimmed across the keys and then looped the film for the next few hours, so that rather than recording new video it would just copy the current video over and over. That way, noone would notice unless they had to go back and look over the tapes... which, if she did everything right they wouldn't have a reason too. And even if they did she wouldn't show up on any of those tapes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the security was taken care of Jessica could happily prance her way down the hallways towards the lab she was looking for, 4A. Again her hacked card was swiped and granted her access, letting her slip inside unhindered, into the VR room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but stare in amazement for a few moments. The room only had a single, major point too it, which was the massive pod looking device in the middle of the room. Thick, heavy industrial sized cables as thick around as salamis were strewn across the floor, all connecting to the pod in some area or another, and most of them either disappeared into the walls, or were connected to the large computer sitting beside the pod. Tentatively she waked towards the computer and began booting it up, idly looking over the pods smooth, leather interior and the strange electrode-looking devices around where the persons head would sit. When the computer turned on she quickly started to skim through some of the files, trying to push aside her amazement at how stupidly complex the thing was, so she could get a gist of how this thing worked. She only had a few hours till morning when people would start coming back in, and she doubted shed be able to sneak in again, so she only had this one shot to give the thing a go. She could read how awesome it was on the internet when they went public with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the things she was reading were simply mind boggling. How the pod fed information directly into the brain, making things seem almost exactly as real as they would be if they had happened in real life. How you could even alter perception in the pod, so you could make 5 minutes in the real world seem like an hour in the pod. That would make things much, much more fun. With a last few glances at some of the plans and test runs she felt she had a general idea of how the device worked, so she set her bag down beside the computer, and started to climb herself into the pod. It was both invigorating and terrifying as she clamped her arms and legs down into position where the pod clenched onto them to hold them in place, so she didn't flail around unconsciously, as the design specs had said. A faint yipe of surprise escaped her lips as, once she was settled the electrodes pushed down along her forehead and against the back of her neck. An electric tingle shot down her spine, and her eyes rolled into the back of her head... and she passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, what happened...\u201d She groaned softly, rubbing a paw across her forehead as she started to push herself up into a sitting position. Her eyes slowly slid open as she started to wake up... and saw white. White as far as the eye could see in every direction. There was no ground, no sky, no people, buildings or... anything. Just, White. Well, white, and her. She was in an entirely empty space void of everything. For a second she started to panic. Oh god. Was she dead. Had the pod killed her?! Then quickly rationality started to take charge and she remembered what the test runs had said. This was what they called the 'construct'. The empty zone that the VR computer generated before any specifications had been added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath to calm herself, heart beating wildly in her chest from the sudden brief terror that had overtaken her. \u201cOk. Calm down now Jessy... you got this. Lets get to work.\u201d She murmured, starting to giggle to herself in anticipation. She raised a paw up and then spoke aloud in the clearest voice she could \u201cConsole!\u201d and immediately a small floating holographic keyboard and screen seemed to simply fade into existence beside her, right at the tips of her waiting fingers. \u201coooh... this Is so awesome!\u201d she giggled aloud to herself, as she started to type along the floating keys. She wish she'd known about this first, she could browse the database in here just as easily as she could outside. She was rather surprised to see some of the details that had been pre-programmed into the system already. They had uploaded everything from three dimensional schematics of most major cities in the world, to the psychological profiles of most of the university students in here! According to the test logs they used them as 'bases' to build models, environments and 'characters' for the environments. That just made it all the easier for her, Now she didn't have to start from scratch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn here, she could do just about anything she wanted. She could recreate most of the people she knew, or make entirely new people... generate cities, fantasy settings... whatever she wanted. The only question was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should she start?</span></div></div>",

With a sigh, Jessica quickly scribbled her name illegibly on the pad and snatched the package out of the deliver guy's arms. a halfhearted thanks was given to him before the door was abruptly shoved shut, and the fox was on her way back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man that guy is always a dick\" She muttered under her breath. Most of her spitefulness came from the fact that she had tried to get him to go out with her at one point and he had totally blown her off. Only later did she find out that he was gay, which consoled her a bit in thinking he didn't reject her but her entire gender. At the same time however it had annoyed her to place something out of her reach, a massive pet peeve of hers as absurd and unrealistic as that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe package on the other hand was something that merited her interest, for she didn't remember ordering anything. By the time she got back to her room and was kicking the door closed she was already tearing the tape off to pull the box open. Inside amidst a small sea of packing peanuts, was a small chrome pistol, looking like something out of a weird sci fi movie. Instead of an open barrel the end of it was a small nub of a polished glass or diamond like substance, and on the side of the gun was a dial with a small indicator arrow. The settings for the gun only further confused her, as she looked looked at the various numbers it could be set too. Ranging from the lowest to highest 1/100, 1/50, 1/20, 1/10, 1/2, 0, 2, 10, 20, 50, 100.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, she flipped the dial back and forth a few times, unintentionally ending up with it on the \"20\" setting as she carelessly aimed it around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it\u2019s one of those weirdo sound toys and the settings are the volume?\" She muttered to herself, idly wondering why something like this would have come to her in the mail at all. Casually she pulled the trigger as the device aimed across the room. Rather than a fake, playful toy made sound, the device vibrated momentarily, then emitted a beam of bright green energy from the tip which shot across the room and hit one of the stuffed animals on her desk square in the chest. Jessica's eyes went wide and her jaw hung slack as she saw an aura of green energy begin to engulf the brown furred teddy bear sitting on her desk, then began to slowly stretch and push outwards. It was as if it was pulling the teddy bear with it, as with each inch further outwards the aura expanded, the teddy bear grew with it. It was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe normally 6 inch tall toy was rapidly approaching a foot in height, then two, then four with no signs of slowing. Bigger and bigger it expanded, starting to push pencils and keyboards off of her desk as it ballooned larger than even she was. When it finally seemed to stop, the teddy bear's head was squished against the ceiling, as the now 10 foot tall teddy bear was taking up the majority of her desk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox simply sat there on the edge of her bed for several seconds staring with wide eyes at the now giant sized teddy bear, slowly glancing back down to the object held in her hand. A size ray. a real, working size ray! A wide grin slowly spread across her face as ideas began floating through her head. A real Size ray! Assuming the numbers were the shrink and growth settings, she could do a lot of things with this. The only question was what to do with it first...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tAllison is a big girl. This is the first thing everyone sees about her, it's just unavoidable. Dragons are usually considered stereotypically the largest anthro species, though technically the average Brontosaurus is bigger than the average dragon. Allison is neither of these, and that makes her immense size all the more unusual. Not that T-rex's are known for being small, but its not everyday that you see a Tyranno towering over Dragons and bronto's alike, making them both look short in comparison. Hell, Allison was lucky she could even stand upright in most buildings, considering the average ceilings are between 8 and 8 \u00bd foot tall, herself being just a tad over the 8'2\u201d mark (though if asked, she will argue heavily that shes not an inch over 8 foot tall, embarrassed about her height)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was a shy girl even in her early childhood before she hit puberty, finding herself spending more time alone than she did with the other kids. When she got into high school, and puberty hit, she became the center of attention in school, much to her self conscious protests. She went from a petite, thin girl only about 5'6 or so, and shot upwards over the course of three years, gaining literally over a foot in height each year until her puberty started to taper off when she neared 18 and her senior year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMore than just her height had exploded on her, however. Her metabolism slowed and altered slightly, leaving her a bit less able to easily process all the sugary treats she found herself guiltily enjoying all the time, having quite the sweet tooth. Small layers of fat spread across her body over the years, though nothing too major, as she constantly Jogged to keep herself fit. It ended up sending most of the fat centering around her already rather curvacious green fleshed hips and buttocks, making them even plumper and thicker (Redefining 'ghetto booty'), and into her chest. That being another reason she drew so much attention. Even considering her over 8 foot height her chest was absolutely enormous. So massively thick and broad that if she raised her arms up you could see her bosom spilling out to either side of her back, noticeably wider than the rest of her torso was. She had to special order all of her bras in order to get them in the right size and proportion, as the only ones commercially available that were even close to fitting, were for less 'tall' people, and the straps ended up being too short for her to hook them onto herself, and when you have tits that could rival your own head in size, having proper chest support was a requirement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOverall she became quite the curvacious bombshell, that sent all the other women in the school grumbling in envy, and all the guys drooling and wolf whistling every time they saw her. Which only made her situation worse considering, despite her massive change in size she was still the same shy, bashful girl that she had always been. Finding herself muttering and stuttering shyly when the football team would hit on her, despite the fact that she could probably kick any of the player's asses, herself, if she tried. The only person she seemed at least somewhat comfortable being more herself around, was Jessica, who to this day neither of them can figure out how they became friends. They just met one day and just started... hanging out. That being a mixed blessing considering Allison's shy demeanor, and Jessica constantly dragging Allison all over town, trying to force her constantly into social settings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tonight, its a different situation that shes going to be getting into, one she would never have expected. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"center\">But before we look into tonight, let us look on how it all began for Allison, looking to the morning...</div><br>\r\nAllison was NOT a morning person, and to her ever-lasting annoyance, Jessica <i>was</i> as her teasing tone and extremely vocal volume would arrouse the great jurassic beauty from her slumber, blearly glaring down at her alarm clock, sighing at that it was indeed, very late into the morning or in the still half fuzzy mind of the rexgal, too early...still, she would finally rise from the bed as her energetic roommate thumped her fuzzy little fists into the door, not letting Ali rest. So, with a resounding thump-thump as her broad, bare feet dropped onto the floor, Allison's great jaws opening with a great yawn, her body letting out pleasant little pops and crunches as she stretched out, her barely held back bosoum bousum, and her round rump shaking with the swish of her tail. She would be reaching for her bedroom door, a bit more awake and now an annoyed snarl in her throat, not one who wishes to be roused from her slumber so noisely as Jessica LOVED to do to her...but as soon as she swung the door open, the t-rex gal would blinkblink at empty air at where her impish little vixen of a roommate would be...but wasn't to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison would look to her left and then to her right, straightening up while scratching her left cheek, confused at where Jessica had gone. She had just been there...but then, Jessica was a speedy little gal. But either way, Allison did sigh in relief at the brief reprieve she'd been given by her friend's sudden disappearence and walked off, great green bare feet thumping the wooden floor, unimpeded to the bathroom...and really hoped Jessica wasn't home, because as soon as that bathroom door closed (and locked. She checked...TWICE), and her clothes were gone, the hissing hot waters which greeted her bare curvatious form. Just the heavenly wake-up call she needed, her cheeks blackening with color of embaressed pleasure as she would let the water cascade along her large but lovely form, tail swishing as she scrubbed her smooth scaled form thoroughly, though lingering then she would as she rubbed her hefty breasts, pressing them together and...well, lets say that shower went from basic cleaning to a long, and very soothing process to get clean...and a little dirty. Though, for a gal like Allison, she was still blushing long after the shower itself was over and had toweled herself off. She was always embaressed for moments like that, especially in the shower and found herself a little down when she realized that she experienced such a good experience...alone. However, she counted to herself as she wrapped her custom towel as tight as possible as she would unlock the door, half expecting the vixen to pop out and tease and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was waiting on the other side of the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...normally this would be when Jessie just pounce onto the scene and drive me up the wall...calling me Alli-saurus and...wait, who am I talking to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe t-rexess would shake her head and chuckle, her bare feet thumping the wooden floor as she would step into the hall, walking back towards her room, feeling extremely foolish but otherwise relieved that for once, she wasn't going to have to put up with Jessica's childish...hmmm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, peering down the hall, to where the front door was...and saw a large brown-paper wrapped package sitting on an end table...and its allure drew Allison from her bedroom, pulling more and more, until she was looking down at the package in question, great watery footprints following behind her. She'd raise an eyebrow ridge down at a small note which had been placed down onto the package...yet smirked as she found the flourishing handwriting of Jessica, whom Allison can't help but imagine is giggling during each word is said, her trickster nature shining through in her wording...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Heya Alli-Saurus, Jes here. <br>\r\nHad to get going, got people to go, and places to meet...strike that, reverse it. Anyway, this big beast of a box was on our front door step, and it was addressed to the house, and since I hadn't ordered anything, didn't wanna bother ya with the details and just thought it was yours, so, here you go! See you later, Alli-Gator...oh, and if there is anything kinky in this box, be sure to share with me later! -Jessica</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison couldn't help but chuckle and smile at her friend's written words. Despite constant teasing and jokes, the vixen meant well, and though Allison found her behavior both extremely childish and even weird, she couldn't wish for a better friend. With that said, the t-rexess's eyes now fell upon the brown package itself. Jess was right, and their address was on there, yet it didn't designate whom it was supposed to go to, and she certainly order anything herself.she didn't even recognize the company which had sent it \"ArchSoft\". Allison, a distinct chill running up her body, became very self aware...especially when she felt her towel lightly flutter agaisnt a gentle breeze, her bare scaled bum buns shivering as they were nearly naked to the elements, if only by the grace of the towel. She turned to quickly race back to her bedroom, not knowing if Jessica would choose this time to return home, and with but a towel on, Allison knew the vixen would require little else as ammunition. But, with one green sole hanging in mid-step, Allison's eyes held onto the box and with a grace which would cause intense jealously amongst the musclehead footballers, tucked the box into one arm, and folded the other over her chest, and soon, she was but an emerald blur, and the door of her bedroom would slam shut, and Allison, bracing the door shut with her towering t-rex frame, sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the box one more time and blushed bright black, admonishing herself for being so odd...over a box! Tossing it onto her bed, Allison let her towel drop without a care, her bountiful, bouncy body was a sight to behold, but as she stood, frowning at the closet, trying to come to decision, she just kept looking over her shoulder, back at the freaking box, and without any fore thought to the actual recepient, she tore away the wrapping and lifted the brown cardboard lid of the mailing box and gaped at what awaited her within the padded contents of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...a pair of large bottles. Both seemed to be made along the lines of specialty energy drinks, bottles with reusable twist-off caps, but clearly made with a sturdy durable metal substance instead of flimsy plastics. Their shapes bore an easy grip for a number of consumer grips. But thats where the similiarities ended between the two bottles. Allison reached down, and took each bottle in hand, shivering a bit with pleasant surprise at their touch. They were chilled. Not lukewarm like one would expect being kept in such a mailing container, but not freezing as if refridgerated. Just...the perfect balance of \"chilled\". Shaking her head, she hefted the bottles in hand. In her great grip, the bottles were more like simple soda cans, but in hand, she could take a good long look at each bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle in her left hand gleamed with a rich ruby gleam, almost exhuding a raw sense of power, a firery intensity, even without the help of the very unusual label. WITH the label, which formed in the shape of a clenched fist (ON FIRE!), declared itself proudly as \"POWER BERRY PUNCH!\". This declaration was further bolstered by the subline \"THE Energy Drink To Give You EXTRA Power and EXTRA Energy to your PUNCH!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison chuckled, at such a macho, overtly masculine way of marketing. The entire football team probably drank the stuff, a gallon an hour...EACH. Still grinning, Allison looked to the other bottle, finding its gentler, smoother looking emerald sheen calming and relaxing. Its logo, just unique as its crimson counterpart, seemed to have this inverse-mobius of what appeared to be a Citrus fruit, a lemon or lime, with a smaller one within it and an even smaller one within that! Either way, it was appropriate as it would seem the drink is called \"Shrinking Citrus\", evidently a diet drink, confirmed by its tag line \"The Health Drink WILL make those Pounds and Inches disappear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison's grunt was more of a skeptical amusement. Both a health nut AND a lover of junk food, she'd been suckered by such products before, especially with ones with odd names. Skinny Cow sprang to mind with the gnashing of teeth. Though, she always had enjoyed citrus drinks. She licked her lips, feeling very thirsty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, she dropped both bottles onto her bed, and seemed instantly resolved in what she was going to do, as she turned back on a meaty heel, and marched back to the closet, and began dressing for a much needed jog. To clear her head with some fresh air, as well as maybe shed a few more pounds. Still chilly despite being late March, she pulled up a pair of slightly roomy but mostly body hugging navy blue-black track pant, and tugged on a lighter-slate blue-grey tank top, both ontop of her snug but comfortable sports bra and panties. Sure, that combonation accentuated her assets more then she'd like, but it was the only outfit which functioned best in her exercise and covered as much of her as best as possible. Dropping down onto the bed as she put on a pair of socks, wiggling the shod thick toes before tucking in her favorite pair of custom work-out sneakers, she took a deep breath...but paused again, and looked at the two drinks. She was planning to go for a long jog...and a drink would be nice...and she already took them out of the box...So, Allison reached out and took...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison grabbed both bottles and looked at them with a bemused smirk. Why SHOULDN'T she take both? Either one might quench her thirst, of course, but maybe having a choice instead of having to resort to just whichever she chose now might prove to be in her best interest...her picky sweet tooth would certainly thank her for providing variety on her hearty jog. So, quickly sprinting back to her room, she snatched her \"small\" to her sports backpack, which slinged over her arms as soon as she tucked both bottles into the bag, alongside an icepack to keep them nice and chilled...even though they seemed to do so without any needed \"addition\". But soon enough, door shut and locked behind her, her large sneakered feet thumping a hasty beat from her home...and towards the university park a few blocks away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe university park was spacious and rich with greenery, many paths leading through the forests edged from the city and civilized societies, stretching for several miles, providing many scenic routes for those in need of clear their minds, or in need for a good hard jogging work out...and Allison had every path etched into her mind. If she were blindfolded, she had gone down that path enough to know how many steps it takes her to reach their ends...and back again. And though she wouldn't like to admit, sometimes, she enjoyed to do a bit of people watching. For someone whose as far a social butterfly as the amazonian rexgal could be, she did enjoy sometimes seeing into the brief glimpses into the lives of those around her. It was nice to look around, and never know what she'd find next....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich would explained why her gaze would fall on Tyler Matthews. The smaller, younger purple scaled brother to the bruiser of a blue dragon, David Matthews. Normally left deep in the looming shadow of his super-sized sibling, Tyler was known for his semi-successful gaming shop in town, but otherwise, little was known about him by the general public...and Allison only knew him from brief, little encounters, but from those few times, she knew a kindred spirt when she saw one, and Tyler was made from a smaller but very similiar mold she was. The little dragon in question was currently resting beneath a large tree, the sun blocked while he rested comfortably, dressed in a pair of old black sneakers, baggy jeans, and a red t-shirt with blue sleeves and shoulders, a familiar Spider emblem on the chest. Quiet and a bit more cerebral then his brother, Tyler found more pleasure in fantasy and science fiction, and Allison smiled as she recognized the novel in the purple drake's hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon I Will Be Invincible...\" she said aloud, loud enough for the purple drake to look up...and up as Allison stepped over, her cheeks coloring as she chuckled nervously \"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your reading, but, I couldn't help but notice what you're reading...I certainly enjoyed the unique structure of chronology of that story, though I found myself looking more forward to Fatale's perspective then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Doctor Impossible's...?\" Tyler finished with a grin, looking up at the blushing t-rex girl's face (whom nodded at his finishing of her sentence), blushing a bit himself...not only for the fact of how far he had to look up at her, but for such a pretty girl to be talking to him so openly...and about a topic like this prose novel about super heroes and super villians. He would slowly stand up, a finger tucked between the pages of where he left off...only to come up short as she was nearly twice his size, so he still required to look far up to meet her eyes \"You're Allison Parker...I've seen you at the store a couple of times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe t-rex girl blushes bright, but nodded \"Y-yeah...y-you had the copies of Ex-Heroes and Ex-Patriots I've been looking everywhere...\" Tyler chuckled and nodded \"Thats right, I remember you picking each of volume..really enjoy the concept of super heroes and zombies co-existing in the same universe, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Peanut Butter and Chocolate...and equally messy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both shared a chuckle and both sporting blushing cheeks, before Tyler finally asked \"So...Out jogging, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I try and do it every day when I can...um, I really am sorry about interrupting your reading. It is a good book, I hope I didn't catch you at an engaging spot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, of course not Allison. I mean, yes its a great book, but theres no need to apologize. There's no harm do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last word stopped dead as Tyler and Allison looked around to a booming call \"HEY TINY TY, CATCH!\" right as something fast and brown blurred by...and slammed right into Tyler's chest, the impact sending him back onto the tree with a meaty thunk...and with a gasping groan, slid down agaisnt the tree, as a horrified Allison looked down at the purple drake and then back to where the ball came from...as David Matthews and Greg \"Fang\" Nathaniel came hustling over, Fang bearing his nakesake fang in a sneering grin, chuckling as he looked down at the downed dragon, while David, clearly trying to hide a small smile himself, knelt down and gave his little brother a hand up,while the purple dragon wheezed and rubbed his chest, wincing to the touch. Both footballers were dressed in matching \"training\" outfits of tight black track pants, with blue stripes running down the sides, large black and blue sneakers on both pairs of furry and scaly feet, and blue football jerseys which hugged their torso's tight, black decals and lettering designating Fang as Number 10 and David as number 03, their positions on the team. They were clearly made in a closer mold...even if David certainly showed a bit more mercy and compassion to his little brother, he wasn't TOO different to the big bad black furred wolf...whose grin of amusement grew wider into a toothy smirk of lecherous approval as his eyes fell on Allison...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, sort of, seeing how, as the big bad wolf on campus WAS the largest manwolf on the team, the t-rexess still had four inches on him and though she didn't bare her own set of sharp chompers, she couldn't stop a throaty growl of disgust as she felt his eyes, undressing her piece by piece. David meanwhile, was gently thumping Tyler's back, chuckling as he collected the thrown object from before, a football (of course), saying with good cheer even if his brother was still wheezing and rubbing his sore chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that little bro...FANG here thought you were going to be able to catch that...which of course, he knew very well you weren't even paying attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Nah, I did say Catch, didn't I, Tiny Ty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's scowl was searing as he glared up at the grinning large lupine, but whatever scathing words he wished to use, he just coughed and nodded weakly, of which made the wolf beam and chuckle, slamming a hand onto David's back, saying with childish pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEE? Toldja...now come on. The others might've quit like the wusses they are today, but you and me are going to get another couple hours of practice in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid would smirk at Fang's words but before responding to him, he would stop and stare...at the heft chest of Allison's and then up at her, a look of momentary confusion and surprise etched on his blue snout. Unlike Fang's intentional gaze, David's accidental, confuzed look made Allison blush and smile a bit. Fang, who probably saw her as some sort of challenge, or perhaps another hot meaty body for him to claim on his long sheet of accomplishments. David on the other hand, probably had a hard time to process that there was a girl out there that was actually bigger then him, in more ways then one. Tyler, whom hadn't stared as intently as his bigger brother had, coughed especially loud and David snapped to, and smiled as one does to a pretty \"new\" girl, while Fang and Tyler, for one moment, shared a look of understood \"Oh Jeezus, What ARE you doing, you idiot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, I'm David Matthews...have we met...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison, though a bit upset at the blue dragon's rather mixed response to his brother's pain, smiled politely back, though her cheeks were still slightly warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes actually...we take Experimental Chemistry together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...On Tuesdays and Thursdays?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Nothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You burnt off Burton's eyebrows a couple weeks ago...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! That class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA double audible slap to the foreheads of big black wolf and little purple brother dragon was enough to make Allison giggle as David looked back at them, Tyler sitting down agaisnt the tree while Fang walked off, waving a hand \"Have Fun, Casanova...I'm going to do some stretches...when you're finished, come over and I'll kick your tail some more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid huffed while Allison sat down besides Tyler, shufting off her backpack, opening, peering at two bottles inside, and then at the two dragon brothers. Tyler was still breathing very funny and one can only guess how he was feeling after all that, all while David stood there, glaring after Fang, his smooth blue scales glistening with persperation from all his training. And when looking at the bottles, she licked her lips, feeling a bit thirsty herself...What should she do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison, weighing her options, finally came to a decision. Thinking of others first, she began to hand the Power Berry Punch to Tyler when he suddenly went into yet another coughing fit, rubbing vigourously at his chest. Thinking giving him something so caffinated that'd it wake the dead was probably not the best solution. So, with one option available, she look to the sweat-glistening blue dragon, removing the Shrinking Citrus bottle from her pack, and walked over to David. Gently, a large but lady-like finger taptapped at his shoulder. David, whom was distracted in his scowling of Fang, he hadn't prepared to be eye to boob again, eyes blinking upon Allison's tightly clothed chest before slowly looking up at the blushing t-rex girl's pretty eyes, before looking at the greeb bottle proffered to him. And though she loomed over him effortlessly, Allison stammered, \"Um, y-you look like you could use a drink...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid smiled widely and warmly up at Allison, who shyly smiled right back at him, as the blue dragon accepted the diet drink, which to him, was closer to a Gatorade bottle in scale, and yet, it had remained perfectly chilled, of which made David grin, and croon a little as he unscrewed the cap. Allison blushed and shook her head, letting the jock tilt his head back, and take a hefty swig from the bottle, and smack his lips loudly, looking at the bottle with new admiration,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, normally, I drain suckers like these in one gulp, I think I only got an eighth out of this beast!...very cool and refreshing...\" Reads the bottle label, eyebrow ridge raising with a smirk \"...especially for a diet beverage...thanks Allison. Definitely the cool kick in the scaly backside I needed to get back into the game, and kick Fang's fuzzeh ass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison just smiled shyly, stammering \"You're w-welcome, David...happy to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shared a roguish smile and a suggestive wink to Allison...which made Tyler scoff as David began to walk back to the field where he'd left his lupine teammate, doing a bit of impromptu stretching, the diminuative purple dragon crossing his arms, his coughing fit under control, though he would rub his chest from time to time, looking to the t-rex gal with a knowing smile as she tucked both drink bottles back into her bag, asking aloud as soon as the zipper zipped. \"...You do know he never ever goes steady...with anyone, right...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison froze...and her cheeks blazed black, unable to meet short dragon's eyes, instead looking up at David...and cocked an eyeridge as he'd seemed to have paused in place...and was rubbing his arms like he was cold. In fact, he seemed to be shivering. Tyler, too much into his spiel on his brother, was going well on without seeing the rexgal's confused expression or his brothers own unique gestures and body language. \"...I mean, I'm not surprised...guys like him never seem to want to settle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler...\" Allison said with a distant, shocked voice as her eyes widned as she watched the drake shiver more...and did he seem to...no, it had to be an illusion of his shivering movement...but he seemed to be...shorter, at least an inch or two, and with sharp vision for a rex (or the fact David was less then twenty feet away from her), she couldn't help but notice his clothes give a bit of slack on their hold on his tight, toned form. \"...I mean, why settle when you have folks throwing themselves at your feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Tyler</i>...\" Allison tried again, sterner but her eyes never leaving as she could not deny that the blue drake was shorter...and getting ever SHORTER, as he a few more inches gone, evaporating into the air as his clothes seem to be more fitting and less body hugging...but they were getting a slight sag to them as well as the blue dragon continued to stand in place, shivering as if in a blustery gusty wind. And yet, Tyler seemed way too engrossed in the sound of his own voice to notice his bigger brother was becoming far less so! \"...of course, if they knew...\" <b>\"TYLER!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He asked, looking at her for the first time, eyebrow ridge raised...before her large hand gently turned his snout towards his brother...who seemed to be finally getting out his trance, shivering subsiding...but the \"damage\" clearly done as he stood in place...many inches shorter, his clothes baggier but enough to still be fashionable, his body shape still showing through. He still appeared to be quite a beefy blue dragon...but a beefy blue dragon of 6'3'' height. Tyler only caught the tail end of the change, but his mouth was hanging as wide as Allison's as they watched as David seemed to shake his head clear...and look back at the two, giving Allison a thumbs up, calling back out to her. \"I gotta get me more of that diet citrus stuff...never got a brain freeze like that before...felt pretty good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and began to walk back to the field, unconciously tugging at his baggier track pants legs, as well as his jersey sleeves, not sure when these stretched out so badly, but he was too busy looking out for a big black blur of a wolf running and leaping about in practice, but it appeared if Fang pulled a Houdini. All while, Allison and Tyler were just staring after David, the t-rex looking at the bag of hers where the drinks were...and suddenly knew that perhaps she SHOULDNT have opened that box. Tyler meanwhile, was not yet making the connection between David and Allison's drinks, just too stunned. \"I just...watched my big brother...shrink...y-you saw that, right? David did just shrink right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison made a non-commital grunt, nodding slowly as her cheeks blazed brightly...as she looked thoughtfully down at her backpack, certain thoughts...ideas...and dreams cascading across her mind's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we need to tell him before it happens again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler would begin running...and distractedly, Allison began to follow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very same time, David was scratching his head, looking to the left and right of the big...empty park field. He knew where they'd been practicing...hell, he had found the Basketball, reaching down and picking it up, hefting it in his hands...and frowning. He didn't remember the ball being so big...and thick. Did Fang switch the ball with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had a moments time to notice something huge and black leap out of the bushes, and a fraction of THAT before it suddenly impacted into him, David carried off with the unstopable force for a few feet before the dragon fell onto his back...with a growling and grinning wolf beaming toothily down at him, winking and baring that fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta work on that peripheral vision, Davy...gonna getcha real hurt some day if you let yourself be blindsided like that...\" teased the looming lupine as he stood up, that freaking fang of his bared triumphantly. The blue dragon huffed and sat up, scowling up at him as he pushed himself up, glaring out at the much larger lupine, whose triumphant smile looking a little confused as he squinted down at the blue dragon as David retorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, and the next time I'll get hit by something like YOU on another team is when I hang up my jersey...cause if I find that there are more then one Gregory Nanthaniels in the world, is the...day...\" the dragon's words drifted as he sensed somethign was off, glaring at Fang, looking down at his huge sneakered feet \"Are you standing on something...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked down at the dragon's feet...and grinned widely again. \"Actually, I'm not...but I'm thinking you're forgetting something...a little cool, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid raised an eyeridge at the wolf...before he gave his toes a wiggle...and became very away of how much colder they were, and looked down...and just stared at his stockinged feet, looking back over to where his sneakers now stood, empty...but then David did a double take, staring at his socks, giving his toes a wiggle as he saw that there was too much fabric on his feet...and too much fabric in his trakc pants, as they piled up atop of his feet, and his jersey. Fang was clearly taking too much enjoyment from the sight as he commented. \"Jeezuz, David...I never knew you were so damn short. Fuck dude, do you wear special lifts in your shoes or something...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAVID!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang and David looked up to see Tyler come a running, panting as he still hadn't completely worked off that football to the chest, but he came ot a halt when he saw David's face...and then at his clothes...his saggy socked feet, and then at his now emptied shoes, and gulped. \"Oh Shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shit WHAT?\" David said with a snarl, taking a step towards his brother, only to stumble on a baggy pant leg, getting a snort from Fang as Tyler stepped back instinctively as he stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know, but Allison and I h-had saw you shrink moments before you went after Fang here.Look, we'd just saw you shiver as if you were stuck in a blizzard, and as you began to shrink! I saw it, Allison saw it, didn't you, Al...Allison?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time Tyler had bothered to look behind him since he went after his brother...only to find that the t-rexess was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd she go..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A little while later, back at her house</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison was scowling at the Shrinking Citrus bottle, rubbing her hands nervously. So many wishes, so many fantasies. All she'd ever had wanted was to be no longer the large lumbering lummox she had been for years now...and now with one gulp she didnt have to be anymore! So, should she? And if so, how much should she drink, to make her the way she'd always hoped to be.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>NO! No more meek butterfly of a t-rexess. She had the solution to a long-standing problem and she was going to take it as far as possible! No more ducking into buildings, no more crouching like some sort of beast so not to slam head into the ceiling. No more probing eyes, no more being a large green spectacle! She was going to be one of the regular people! With that, she snatched the bottle into her great hand, with a flick of a thumb claw, the cap flipped through the air, landing softly onto her bed as she tossed her head back, lips pressed onto the bottles neck and took a large shot of the \"diet drink\", shivering with pleasure as its perfectly chilled intensity and rich citrus flavor exploded at the same time as chillded her tonge and maw, going all the way down her throat with such an intense and pleasuring feeling all the time. She let the bottle drop from her lips, while licking them with her tongue, mmmming as she would stand there in her bedroom, waiting...and waiting...and waiting! She scowled at the bottle in her gripped palm, a snarl building in her throat. She knew this stuff worked, and she had drunk as much as David had, so why wasn't she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped suddenly as she stood up rigid, as her entire bottle just locked in place, or appropriately \"froze\" up as she shivered with such shift in bodily temperature, shivering...and shrinking slowly. Her eyes widened as they were locked to look up at her ceiling...and especially up as it began to RISE from her slowly! In fact, as it rose, the room's walls seemed to pull from her, the room was expanding. No, SHE was shrinking! She was actually shrinking. A toothy grin widened as it was like dream come true, her body regaining some limited movement as she could feel her skin tingle still, but also feel as tight fabric loosened its tight grip on her. She felt her breasts slowly lower as the tight fabric of slate blue-grey tank top loosened, and the tight cups of her sports bra empty a little as her hefty breasts remained bountiful yet at the same time \"less so\". A similiar feeling was felt around at her hips as she actually felt both her track pants and panties beneath slip a little, her bouncing booty losing size yet not mass, still large to her but to her clothes, it was like she'd shed off those last few pounds FINALLY. She even noticed with a giggle, as she wiggled her toes that there was even a bit of room in her sneakers. She could feel the tingling sensation surge...yet it did begin to fade, the towering t-rex scaled down from 8'2'', to 7'2''. By all rights, she was still proportioned as before just \"sized down\". But that still wasn't enough, even as she turned to face the custom mirror. She noticed with a widening smile that she didn't fill the mirror as much as before...but she was still TOO big. She lift up the bottle, smiling as it now looked more like soda bottle then a simple can in her smaller hand, but it didn't stop her from tossing back another large slug, greedily swallowing it down as she pulled back....and just let out a satisfied siiiiiiigh as the chilling pleasure ran through her body, and the process was renewed and Amazonian Allison was finally making a trek down to just \"Above Average Allison\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe t-rexess crooned with deep pleasure as she could detect further changes beyond that of the world around her, or her clothes. For instance, her pleasured croon was sounding higher in pitch, much more a melodic feminine tone then her deeper normal octaves, which made her smile, licking her lips as she squirmed and giggled as soon as she cocked her hip, her track pants sliding down more, showing a loose panty strap, which she hooked a thumb at and pulled out, showing a distinct loss of \"her\" within in, her thick tail thumping happily as she yanked up the baggier track pants, looking down with absolute glee at how baggy they looked on her shrunken yet strong thick legs, the pantslegs pooling up on her sneakers, which were clearly a few sizes to big, she'd even felt the socks have a great deal of slack on her feet! Her shirt on the other hand, was becoming far difficult to keep on, her tank top and bra straps slipping a bit but otherwise still keeping onto her shoulders, yet lowering down...and making her shiver as \"cooler\" air brushed atop her \"littler\" big breasts, and though the fabric was far more plentiful in both bra cups and tank top, she could feel her pert nipples rub agaisnt the fabric and it felt fantastic! Either way, Allison was licking her lips as she looked around, her room looking far larger then before, but yet, the t-rex was still not satisfied! So, she lifted the bottle, greatly amused that it did feel a bit heavier in her hand...and no wonder! It was looking more like a one liter bottle in her much smaller hand, but the thirst t-rexess was certainly under the impression that three times was indeed the charm...and agaisnt better judgement, the now 6'1'' T-rexess took one final shot...and nearly choked it down as she let out a gasping moan as the process resurged to far greater intensity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison's eyes were shut and her body quaked and bucked with almost sexual pleasure, squirming beneath her growing clothes as she shrank even further then before, this time not watching as the world became much greater, while she became a good deal more 'petite'. Her left tank top strap slid off, exposing her left bra cup, which was clearly and significantly much emptier, her hefty breast, despite being proportionately great, had certainly gone down a number of cup sizes! Her pants finally grave up the ghost, as her hand only had time to snatch her much looser panties as her track pants fell into a pile atop her now massive sneakers, cavernous to her now \"little\" feet, and draped within musky, saggy baggy socks! But Allison was only partially aware of these certain sensations and events, too lost in the pleasure induced by the Shrinking Citrus formula that when it was finally down, a dreamily grinning and slightly \"drunk\" with pleasure t-rexess of barely 5'1'' height stood in place, looking much out of place of a world which had just grown up and out around her! Allison's gentle croons were even higher pitched, rich and like that of a small bird then of a terrible thunder lizard, but she beamed as she fluttered her eyes open...before letting them open wide as she gaped at her room which had magnified twenty fold since she began gulping down the \"diet drink\". Speaking of which, she grunted as she realized she was leaning to the side and looked down on the bottle...and was shocked to find it more like a two-liter bottle of soda instead of the little can which fit so perfectly in hand. She giggled and began to walk over to her bed to fetch the cap...only to let out a cute little squeak as she tripped over both her pants and shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked...before giggling like mad, lifting her bare little feet easily from the confines of the shoes and the saggy fabric of her socks, wiggling her bare little toes as she set them next to her sneakers. They looked like feet belonging to a hatchling standing by her big sisters shoes! She was so...so tiny! She was so thrilled, she almost began to bounce with giggling glee as she felt her panties tumble down her legs...but instead of letting them drop, she smirked at how big her tank top now was. Though her left strap slid off her shoulder, the shirt itself was like a night shirt, covering her lap and going as far as passed mid-thigh, nearly hanging over her knees. She was finally back to a \"normal\" size. Well, normal is relative, as she'd gone from being the largest saurian on record, to one of the shortest in the span of three shots of \"diet soda\". Speaking of the soda, she finally twisted on the cap and carried the bottle back to her backpack, tucking it back with its crimson companion. Now, she finally achieved the height she'd always wished within herself...but what now? She looked at herself and though she guess she COULD make a fashion statement, she should probably put on something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she quickly realized as she stood before her closet, now \"doubled\" in sized, was filled with clothing which could not possibly work on her reduced frame. She pulled down a pair of jeans but holding them out to her, she'd realized if she pulled them up, they'd cover her right up to her breasts! And her shirts were practically like night-shirts or dresses, even the tightest of belly shirts were much too loose in the wrong places. And despite her extensive shoe collection, even her tightest strapped sandals would be ridiculously outsized on her shrunken soles. However, she was not without her options. She would grin toothily as she snatched her hanging robe and slipping her feet into her slippers, she giggled like a silly little hatchling...and looked like one when dressed up in a clownishly large robe and thumping in too-big slippers, but she needed to put on something better, as she reached in and flung of the tank-top and useless bra aside...and tightening the robe as much as she could and rolled up her sleeves again and again, she stood up on tip toe and turned the door knob and padded out of her room, her tinier but thick tail thumping behind her as she went to borrow a few things from her roomie, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinier t-rexess stopped dead in her tracks as her head spun to the front door where..!!!</span></div></div>",

Allison began to think in routine, thinking what level of teasing and pranking the little furball was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing in her ridiculously outsized robe, and super-sized slippers, Allison began to remember that the \"little\" furball held a significant size advantage over her now (She'd be seven inches taller then the shrunken saurian!). And like any species in the presence of a \"larger\" predator, she did the most logical option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran into the bathroom, and locked the door right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pushing herself up against it, as if her now \"petite\" frame could prove as effective a blockade as her former looming length could before. Allison's heart thudded rapidly as she strained to hear her roommate's \"dainty little\" feetpaws, quietly padding (she must be wearing socks), and paused in front of the bathroom door...and nearly gave Allison a heart attack as she rapidly thumped her fists into the door like machine gunfire, following up with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allliiiiisaaaaur! Have you been in there all day...and if you have, you soooooo owe me a new shampoo bottle, cause don't think I know what you do in those long hot steamy showers of yours, and the last thing I want is my hair to start smelling like your...Alli?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison chewed on her lower lip as her friend's tone went from energetic vixen kit to a more calm, and clearly concerned friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli? You're usually groaning in annoyance, or politely telling me to shut my trap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no reply, and Allison could nearly feel the vixen press her own \"little\" form agaisnt the door, worry clearly filling her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison? Allisaur? hon, are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm f-fine...Jess...\" Allison finally spoke with a sigh, unable to let Jess worry like that. A brief pause, and suddenly, Jessica was unable to stop giggling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli! What's wrong with your voice? Did you swallow a helium canister or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison sighed, and rubbed her eyes as she prepared herself \"No, not...not esxactly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not ex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let me finish...see, I did leave the house...and went for a jog...and, you know why I do my daily jogs, right...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, cause you THINK you're overweight, which you are NOT, you're perfectly rounded and plump!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right, you jog all the time so you can lose a few...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom door clicks open, and allison gulped as she stared into Jessica's...breasts, before looking up to look the vixen in the eyes, while Jessica was currently frowing up into empty air, looking very puzzled. A cute little clearing of the throat brought the furrowed foxgal brow southward...and her eyes bulged wide open as she stammered out the rest of her sentence in a strangled squeak \"...P-pounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison's cheek were blushing bright black, and nodded weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe...I did lose more then just that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there they were, roles reverse, as the \"large\" lady fox loomed over the \"teeny\" t-rexess...and to Allison's distict pleasure, Jessica was stricken mute for several moments...the longest Allison had ever seen her roommate be ever so quiet before. However, the shrunken saurian watched with dawning fear as those wide eyes were eclipsed by a huge broad, toothy grin. Jessica let out a great fangirlish squee of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD, You're SOOOOOOOOOO KYOOOTE! You're all so...shrunken in the wash! A teenysaurus rex! A dino-mite! A...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, please, hon, no more puns...please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your voice! Its so sweet, and chibi, I could just...just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Allison could stop her, the vixen swooped in and surprised Alli with a tight bear hug, squeezing her close, making her oof lightly...and blush all the brighter as her snout was pressed up agaisnt her friends chest, further reminder of how small she was. A fact further by a light grunt from Jessie, and Allison squeaked as she felt her feet lift off the ground, her oversized slippers precariously held on by her toes, threatening to fall off. She was held that way for a bit before the vixen finally bowed to gravity, and let the t-rexess back down on her own two feet, grinning with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, still got a bit of substance to ya, but lookit you! You've GOT to tell me what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when she was nearly a foot taller then Allison now, the shrunken saurian could not resist the big fox kit eyes, and quivering lip. Sighing, Allison smiled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...but do you promise not to tell anyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cub scout's honor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, the Cub Scouts are for boys, you couldn't have been a Cub Scout...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats fine, wasn't a Girls Scout either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I promise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...so, remember that package that was left on our door step...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>*****A Brief Recap Later*****</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And then you came home, and well, here we are...\" Allison finally finished with a sigh. They were now in Jessica's bedroom, both sitting upon her bed. Allison was still blushing by the facts that she had to hop up to get on the bed proper, as well as her slippers rested firmly on the floor, while her feet did not, her toe claws nervously twitching against the soft felt of the inner slipper sole. Jessica's own socked feet could touch the floor, and it only add to the fiery heat of Allison's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to her fine fuzzed friend for...anything really. Congratulations on finally achieving something she'd been wishing for years, warm words of companionable comfort at her still nervous adjustment, or any kind of reaction to the whole thing, from the \"magic\" sports drinks or stories of scaly shrinkage. What she GOT...was a giggling vixen pulling out Allison's left robe sleeve as far as it could...and giggle as she found the actual hand somewhere \"near\" the elbow of the sleeve...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, did you hear ANYTHING I just said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toothy smiled vixen would be pushing and rolling back the sleeve until she found the smooth jade scaled hand, tracing her fuzzy fingers and finely manicured finger claws along every bit of that hand...and much to the blushing Jurassic bitty beauty's inner thoughts, it sort of felt good. REALLY good. She'd felt the vixen's hands before, but now, when they were larger then her own, and not as \"big\" as a kit's (a comparison she'd often made when around someone as \"small\" and bouncing off the wall energetic as Jessica had been to the t-rexess), it just felt different...so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison blinked as she realized Jessica was talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, Jess. What'd you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, grinning but not broadcasting at what, repeated for the shrunken she-saurian's benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, YES, I did hear you, and I'll let you off without teasing you about YOU not listening. Anyway, sorry if I seem distracted, but this is just so...I mean, look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her hand, taking Allison's, and pressed palm to palm, and a distinct difference was quickly established. Before this whole thing, Allison could EASILY engulf BOTH of Jessica's hands in just one of her own.Now though, they were almost the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's hand was fine furred, and though lithe and \"dainty\", there laid a clear and inherent quick swiftness to them, truly befitting a fox of her caliber. That said, \"seemed\" smaller when held up to Allison's own hand, which was just as feminine, but had a \"tougher\" naturally powerful smooth scaled thickness to it, as if it made for punching or clawing, even it went against Allison's nature. And despite it being bigger in that respect, Allison just gaped how her finger claw tips were nowhere near Jessica's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shrunk in perfect proportion all over, best I can tell...\" The vixen observed soberly...right before leaning over and giving Allison a playful nudge and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing too...cause I can think of a couple of things which coulda been a damn shame to see shrunken more then the rest of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tricky vixen's eyes fell onto her roommate's chest, which certainly still shook and bounce thanks to the vixen's nudging, and despite the plentiful of fabric the robe now held. Allison gasped in surprise by both gesture and comment, but otherwise just tugged the robe tighter over her form...which there was STILL plenty for her to try and cover up with, and it just sent the vixen into renewed peals of laughter and gaggles of giggles, while the \"dino-mite\" just turned an even darker shade of black, silent as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, Jessica finally finished, smiling brightly as she wiped a joyful tear from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison didn't respond immediately, looking up at Jessica with a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know...I g-guess 'cause I never thought it could happen, I didn't put much thought into it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica frowned at this...and leapt off the bed, and onto her socked feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will not do! No, Allison! You and I must take this opportunity and go as far as we possible can! And so, as says I, it is time to...\"</span></div></div>",

She made it back home, the sun peeking over the horizon, the cool air blowing across her scales, but before she could even open the door, her room mate and best friend, Jessica, burst through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli! You got a package!\" The arctic fox said in her usual excited tone of voice. Before Allison could even react, Jessica grabbed a hand and pulled the large T-Rex into the apartment, slamming the door behind her with a bang. A large brown box was thrust into her arms with enough force to push her large ass into the couch, which protested with ominous creaks.  Jessica grinned, dressed in a midriff revealing shirt and shorts, looking like she was dressed to party which wasn't far from the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get going. I'll be back later today.\" Jessica grabbed her back pack and hoisted it over her shoulder. She paused at the door and turned to look at the T-Rex. \"Hey, wanna come to a party tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison smirked, rolling her eyes at the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the answer to that, Jess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmkay! Maybe I'll bring a friend home for ya. Bye!\" She teased. She quickly pulled open the door and left before Allison could respond With another bang, she was gone, out to do something wild and interesting, unlike Allison who preferred being out of the limelight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, left with the package, she tore through the tape. There was no information on the label where the package came from, and she didn't remember ordering anything online. She figured it might be something extra from one of her online stores that she special orders her clothing from.With the last tape ripped off, the box opened. Digging through the packing peanuts, her hand hit cold metal. Allison pulled it out, sending packing peanuts nearly flying out of the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand was a gun, or something similar to a gun. It looked like a bright polished revolver. It still had spinning cylinder, but instead of a hammer and chambers for bullets, the cylinder was a solid piece and had numbers etched into the metal on the back facing the person holding the gun, where the chambers would be. Allison turned the cylinder. It gave a satisfying click as it turned, not too loose but not hard to turn at all. Upon further examination, she saw that the numbers on the back of the chamber were displayed through a window in the spot where the hammer would be. The numbers were 1/50, 1/25, 1/12, 1/6, 1/3 1/2, 3/4, and 1. It continued on to 5/4, 2, 3, 6, 12, 25, 50, all around the back face of the cylinder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere a safety would be, a little switch changed the settings to where the cylinder would 'click' number to number, what Allison would assume to be the normal setting, to an extremely loose setting, the cylinder spinning freely. There was still a clicking between numbers, but it was the fast, Hollywood type where the cylinder would be spun before being flipped back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked it over. To her, it seemed like a toy gun, but the numbers didn't make sense for a toy. She wrapped her fingers around the handle, just big enough to fit. Just barely. She fiddled with the switch, playing around with the loose setting, spinning the cylinder a few times, enjoying the satisfying sound of the cylinder. With no apparent danger she pulls the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a beam shoots out of the barrel of the toy gun, striking her in her foot! She screams in surprise, jumping out of the couch and the gun tumbling onto the couch cushions. A sudden wave of dizziness hits her as...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The T-Rex tensed her sore muscles and looked at her hands as the wave of vertigo passed, seeing her entire body cloaked in a green aura that was the same color of the beam that hit her. She could see the aura pulsing inward towards her scales. What didn\u2019t see was the fact that each pulse, her body compressed in with it, shrinking her all around. She did feel, however, her entire body tingling and the overwhelming dizziness. But as soon as the dizziness started, it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d she gasped, seeing the green glow still pulsing around her form, like a green angelic glow, or like radioactive waste in those cartoons. Allison really hoped it wasn't radiation. Just when the idea of it being a gun that shoots out pure radiation and she should go see a doctor, she took one step and realized something was off about the entire room. It looked, bigger, and was still getting bigger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched with stunned silence as her feet dragged against the carpet, the width between them growing smaller, and her head creeping away from the ceiling. She could stand at full height for once. She straightened her back as a few things on the wall rose higher and higher. Her heart was racing. Was this really happening? She was shrinking, no longer a super massive beacon of embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to 7 feet tall, then 6 feet, back to a normal height. The room looked loads bigger. She took this moment to sit down, enjoying the room. But it wasn't finished, even at 6 feet she was still shrinking, her feet slowly pulling off of the floor as she shrank to 5 feet, then down to 4'1\". The couch was massive now, where once her entire ass would take up nearly 2 and half of the cushions on the couch, she took up barely one of the three cushions. She leaned back and closed her eyes. It was oddly relaxing, knowing she wouldn't be the center of attention any more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like her entire body, for the last few years had been tense and had suddenly just relaxed, a huge weight off of her shoulders. No more apologizing for her ass bumping against people, or having to crouch underneath doorways. She could finally be a bit normal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the shrinking stop, her back and head weren't dragging against the couch any more. She couldn't touch the floor with her toes, just out of reach. That fact alone gave her goosebumps on her scaly hide. Slowly opening her eyes she took a minute in silence to gawk at her new perspective. <br>\r\nThis thing, this gun, was amazing, able to make her this small. Luckily for her, the clothes she was wearing had shrunk with her, so she wasn't walking around her house nude.  Her figure remained, still a heavy ass for her size and large breasts stuffed into her shirt. After the minute, she picked the gun back up and looked over it. She saw that the cylinder had been set to 1/2 and the cylinder was back in its normal setting, not spinning freely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately got up. There was a sudden and incredibly pleasing lightness to her step. No more thuds as she walked around, feeling like Godzilla. She made circles around the coffee table. It was almost addicting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the idea of looking at her room made her heart flutter. She got up and ran, holding the gun. But as she got to her door the door knob, what would be easily accessed by an 8 foot tall Allision, was now nearly unreachable. She tip toed up to it, her fingers juuust able to pull on the lever of the handle and turn it, letting the door open into a familiar, yet alien room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had always kept a tidy room, sheets made, no trash on the floor, everything in its place. Now, it was more like a playground than a bedroom. She grinned as she walked up to her bed, able to rest her chin on the edge without bending over. With a smirk, she opened her closet door. Everything was out of reach and too big for her. She\u2019d have to pull on the bottom hem of shirts just to get to them, and those were the ones that were hanging on hangers; there was no way at her current size to reach the top shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer computer desk and chair were massive, having been custom made to fit her wide rump and immense size. She couldn't see the top of her desk any more, and just to get in her chair would require climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to show Jessica, one way or another. She could either go find Jess at school, maybe try out her new size out, or she could stay at home and wait for Jess to get home. Or, another option, was to wait for Jess at home and then ambush her with the size ray. What would she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve got 10 seconds before this turns into a brisk pillow fight\u2026That oughtta wake you up!\u201d  The unseen vixen proclaimed from outside, her soft giggling barely audible through the pillow but certainly enough for Allison to know that Jessica meant business.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay alright\u2026\u201d She threw her pillow at the door, her half-hearted toss still plenty for it to smack against the door with some force.  She rolled out of bed, a loud thud shaking the floor when her thick footpaws brought her weight to the carpet.  She stretched and groaned, her thick tail arching behind her.  The roused rex groggily re-adjusted her nightshirt \u2013 which had ridden up and exposed the underside of her enormous breasts \u2013 before stepping to her bedroom door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a firm swing of the door she interrupted Jessica\u2019s giggling fit, causing the agile little vixen to spring backward with a playful growl, \u201cHey, you should watch how you swing that door!  With your weight behind it I\u2019d probably get knocked on my ass, and I use that for sitting\u2026.and other fun things too.\u201d  She gave Alli a sly wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rex girl sighed and stepped out, ignoring the little arctic fox in her way, simply stepping forward and expecting her to move aside.  She didn\u2019t usually enjoy using her size in such a manner, but with Jessica around she\u2019d learned that being completely quiet and submissive didn\u2019t quite cut it.  She chuckled softly, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault they made the door swing in the wrong direction when they made this place.  I thought you\u2019d have learned by now to stay out of the way of my \u2018fat ass,\u2019 as you call it.\u201d  She said with a smirk, laying on a bit of guilt for Jessica\u2019s predictable method of teasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggled and playfully grabbed Allison\u2019s tail, causing the rex girl to yelp, before attempting to yank it roughly from her grip.  This sent Jessy flying forward \u2013 laughing her ass off \u2013 as she slammed muzzle-first right into Allison\u2019s rump, her muzzle briefly wedging into the space between her shorts-covered cheeks.  Alli immediately let out a whine and pulled away, but not before Jessy had given that lovely rump a firm smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessy c\u2019mon, it\u2019s too early for this sort of thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arctic fox chuckled and leaned against the wall, folding her arms over her moderate bosom, \u201cDoes that imply you\u2019re interested in playing like this a little later, Alli-saurus rex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison merely growled and disappeared into the bathroom, intending to turn what should have been a brief shower into a long, soothing respite from Jessy\u2019s teasing.  She locked the door \u2013 and checked it twice \u2013 before stripping nude.  A minute later she was laying against the shower wall, rumbling with pleasure as that hot water cascaded over her curvaceous form, great streams of water collecting on her breasts and pouring altogether from her thick nipples.  She panted softly in the thick, steamy air, before\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better not be using my shampoo bottle to masturbate again, you big perv!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison straightened up, her green-skinned cheeks becoming closer to black at that comment.  She stammered, before protesting, \u201cAm I not allowed to enjoy a shower in private!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh so you ARE using my shampoo bottle!  I don\u2019t care how perfect the shape is for your oversized pu\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJESSY STOP IT!\u201d She wailed, absolutely embarrassed to the point of roaring at the arctic fox, something she rarely did.  She sighed softly, straining for any sound before finally getting back to washing herself.  She finished up quickly after that, no longer wanting to enjoy her shower.  She\u2019d freaked out over one of Jessica\u2019s harmless teases again.  How many times had it been that month?  She shut the shower off, head hung as she dried herself off.  She and Jessica had developed into friends over a long time, so long that the arctic fox had come to count on Allison to be reliably \u201ctolerant\u201d of her teasing.  Though Jessy wouldn\u2019t likely admit it, she cared about their friendship, and this likely drove her away, or at least Allison thought it had.  She never could be sure what the arctic fox was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison quickly toweled off and wrapped her custom-sized towel around herself, cinching it against her side, her breasts barely contained and her wide rump showing on her left, where the ends of the towel didn\u2019t quite meet.  She carefully padded into the hallway, calling out to her, \u201cJessy?  Jessy I\u2019m sorry, I know you were just messing with me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed when she heard no response, thinking that Jessica had gone off somewhere to forget about what she\u2019d done.  Allison briefly peered out of the hallway and into the living room, where she saw Jessica standing there with her hand held out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Jessy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shut up and take this.\u201d  Jessica said with a soft pout, looking down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison faltered for a moment, before sighing and taking what was in Jessica\u2019s hand.  A shining, iridescent stone, smooth to the touch.  She admired it for a moment, before questioning, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessy simply smirked and gave Allison a nudge as she walked by, \u201cI\u2019d love to tell you the trick to it, but you\u2019ll have to figure it out on your own.  Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s supposed to help you achieve your greatest desires\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison stared at the stone in her palm, before sighing and moving back to her bedroom, seating herself on her bed.  She held her towel close and murmured softly, \u201cMy greatest desire\u2026well what I really would wish for, I suppose, is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison, a the shy and gentle Rex girl was in her apartment, doing what she liked to do most: lying on her bed and enjoying a good fantasy novel. It had everything she liked. Dragons, knights in shining armor that... Just so happened to be some rather kickass ladies... And a ton of very detailed descriptions of food. The bed of course was less pleased with having to bear the weight of the voluptuous rex and creaking noises where heard whenever she shifted her rather large form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed a little as she looked at the time on her phone. The daily reminder would go off soon. Just like every day, Allison was dreading it. But her roommate challenged her into it and now she couldn't just back out. The big curvy rex grumbled a little. How did she ever get talked into this? A lazy finger poked the phone on the table in annoyance. Probably because it was good for her and as much as she hated to admit it, she would never get to it on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as expected, her phone sprang to life on the table, buzzing at her and making sounds. The face of her roommate, Jessica, appeared on the display and the words \"Get moving! Time waits for no one!\" - Allison sighed and quickly pressed the button labeled \"Dismiss\". Oh well, a deal is a deal and this Rex was going to honor it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison sat up on the bed and stretched. It had become routine by now, but she still had to push herself every evening to go out on her run. Due to her curvy body, she rather early decided to choose a path that was a little less populated. Mostly because her form in motion tended to be very... Distracting for onlookers everywhere. While Jessica encouraged her to \"go all out\" and \"show off what she's got\", Allison quietly selected a different path to jog on every night. Of course it was considerably less safe and lead past the chemical lab close to the city outskirts but... For a little peace and quiet, she was willing to take that little detour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat our green-skinned protagonist did not know was that in this very night, something sinister was about to happen in the chemical plant. Something that would make this day one that she, and probably the entire city, would not soon forget. As her heavy footsteps shook the ground a little, her chest heaved despite the proper bra and her heavy breath was visible in the dimly lit night, she noticed something rather strange. An unmarked, white van was outside the chemical plant, and for a moment or so... She thought she saw the shine of a flashlight in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Allison started to approach. After all, maybe it was just some kind of delivery. She never really had to be afraid of anyone. Given her stature, most people where afraid of her. And probably for good reason, too. Admittedly, she always was curious what was going on in that lab. She wanted to be a chemical engineer some day, a \"nerd job\" as her roommate described it colorfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her rather impressive height, the truck's roof was actually shorter than she was, so she just elected to peek over the roof as she approached. On the other side, two people - you could only really call them 'crooks' - where running down the way towards the van. Allison let out a surprised 'eek!' and quickly crouched down behind the van, quickly reaching for her phone. She had to call... The police! Or maybe Jessica! Or help in general or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't really finish her thoughts. One of the crooks, who was on his way to the van, ran around it to get into the passenger side, only to slam right into the crouching massive rex. It wasn't exactly unpleasant for him - after all, she was almost the definition of soft - but the robber was caught off guard. Allison could feel a small vial of liquid crash against her chest and eeked again, crawling backwards and away from the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I lost it! Where did she come from?\" The unlucky-lucky crook shouted. His accomplices replied right away. \"Forget it! We have to get out of here!\" Only a minute at max later, Allison saw the van leave, still sitting on the floor, feeling her heart pound in her somewhat damp chest. She looked down. What on earth happened to her?</span></div></div>",

Standing at 7'10\u201d hes one of the largest recorded wolves to ever live, especially at a young age of 21, and he loves to show of it off. Hes the cocky star quarterback of the local College football team, and is always eager to show himself off, whether it be on the field or off. Smug, borderline on narcissistic at times, he has no hesitation to outright flaunt his towering height or massively muscular form. Many might consider him a bully for picking on those weaker than him, but he doesn't seem to care, As far as Fang goes, its his world, and you're just living in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6: Macrus Fletcher is a tall, lean kangaroo guy. Standing at 6'6\" he's moderately tall for his species, but certainly not excessive. He's the precise, efficient kicker for the local College football team, and while he knows he has some of the most precise feet and strongest legs in the divsion, he also knows he has no right to show off when guys like Fang are around to carry the team to victory. Though constantly ignored by fans of the team, he is happy to be acknowledged by his coaches and teammates for his stellar kicking records and sportsmanship. He's outgoing and friendly with teammates and fans alike, but what he really wants is to be able to have SOMETHING to show off about, so he too can have a little fun... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7: Chris Taylor is a lean, rather average looking 5'10\u201d tall human with lightly tanned skin and shaggy black hair. He's about as average as can be, especially with some of the Furs that he goes to college with. Hes not particularly beefy, but isnt really lean either. Hes not fat, but not thin and lean either. A mild swimmers build at best with a tiny bit of 'cushioning' around his hips, stomach and arms that keep him from looking totally thin. He's always had a fascination for anthros, despite them being an everyday occurrence, and has a particular infatuation with the saurian and Draconian furs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8: Rich Hamilton: Rich is a college aged raccoon who knows just how to get what he wants, which usually involves stealing it. At 5\u2019 6\u2019\u2019, he\u2019s thin enough and sneaky enough to get just about anywhere. This quick witted and silver tongued raccoon always has a plan up his sleeve, and a place in the shadows to hide until the heat dies down. Recently he has been spending lots of time around the local college, watching pickup games of football or volunteering at science department buildings on campus. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe first thing everyone learns about Greggory, is not to call him Greggory, Greg, or any variation of such a name. Greggory has had a small 'overbite' ever since he was a child, that would leave a single one of his front fangs hanging over his lips even when they were closed, and since early middle school everyone had taken to calling him Fang instead, and it seemed to fit him. He was a shaggy furred aggressive black wolf, and he liked a predatory name like \u201cFang\u201d far better than the name \u201cGreggory\u201d after his fathers uncle or something like that, he never made a point to actually remember. And when you meet Fang, you immediately understand that pretty much what Fang says, goes... or else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFang is big, massive, to the point that hes one of the largest living Lupines in history. Standing at a towering 7'10\u201d even most Dragons and Saurians find themselves looking up to the beast of a wolf. But he hadn't always been like that. Sure he was slightly tall for his age as a child, but when he hit puberty he simply started exploding in size, and from the span of starting high school and graduating, he had grown over 2 foot in height! But height hadn't been enough for Fang, oh no. almost every single day during high school, and even some of late middle school, you would find Fang in the weight room or on the football field. The same slightly faulty hormone production that had rocketed his puberty through the roof and made him a towering skyscraper of wolf had also super charged the rest of his bodily hormones as well, making it almost effortless for the wolf to put on mass. By the time he was a freshman in high school he was beefier than the football coach, and shortly before graduation he had found himself being scouted for bodybuilding magazines as that year's teen \u201cMuscle god\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd Fang was more than happy to pose for themselves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIts been a joke said many times over... though rarely ever within earshot of the massive wolf. The only thing bigger than Fang's body is his ego. Hes huge, hes massive, he could snap most of the other football players (much less anyone else) like a twig, and he had absolutely no hesitation in showing it off. He just loved attention. Sometimes Fang would come to school or practice in shirts purposefully a size too small, just so that as he started working out or practicing, they would shred apart and leave the wolf bare chested, which he would then happily flaunt his herculean physique for all those around. Women would croon and woo over the sight of the massive wolf showing off his sweaty, meaty form, and guys would find themselves glaring in jealousy... which only made Fang want to show off all the more. He wasn't afraid to speak his mind and take what he wanted. You had a soda he liked and he was thirsty, he'd just snatch it out of your hand and gulp it down himself. You were using a weight machine that he wanted to use, he'd reach down and simply lift you up off of it, sometimes with the weights included, and simply drop you off to the side so he could sit down and use it. He was a 'Bully' at times, yes. But one of those ones that at times, even if hes picking on you, you couldn't help simply admire him, even if it was simply in an intimidating 'oh god his arms bigger than I am' way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs far as Fang was concerned, It was his world, you were just living in it. </span></div></div>",

Fang grinned as he saw the ball flying in his direction, the ground starting to rumble with audiable THUMPS of his massive weight as he began running backwards. Massive, black furred lupine paws pounding into the Park's grass as he thundered his way farther and farther back. One of his other friends, a rather burly heavy set bear snarled as he leapt towards Fang to try to slow him down, only to have the wind knocked from his lungs and sent sprawling across the ground as Fang's body simply slammed into his more than foot shorter form, sending him tumbling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it! I got it!\u201d He roared out as he leapt into the air, arms raised high to snatch the small, at least to him, football out of the air and tug it down to his chest. Fang had been so wrapped up in the ball's path, however, he hadn't been paying any attention to where he was going. Midair, his paw caught on the edge of a park bench, sending him suddenly jerking forward, CRASH. And smashing down right atop a small wooden cart filled with various shiny trinkets and bowls. The meaty wolf groaned a bit and rubbed at his head, shifting a bit atop the wreckage and only further crushing it with his movement. The others started heading in his direction as if to see if he was all right, where Fang simply grinned widely and held up the football triumphantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem.\u201d A raspy voice coughed out beside him, drawing the large wolfs attention to the owner of the debris beneath him that had once been her cart. A rather old and worn looking Zebra stood hunched over, a deep purple dress covering her and a semi-transparent violet veil draped across her face and over her head. She stared intently at the wolf who had to be almost 3 foot taller than her, as he started to pick himself up off her ruined cart. He let out a deep, rumbling chuckle as he brushed a few bits of wood and ceramic from his fur, as she stared up at the looming fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, lil dude.\u201d Fang growled out, that grin of his never leaving his muzzle. His tone was devoid of any apology at all, in fact sounding more PROUD of what he had done, rather than sorry for breaking her stuff. \u201cgotta watch where the big guys are goin, eh?\u201d He Joked smugly, winking at her before turning back towards David and the others, football in hand, to head back to finish up their game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra simply glared at him as the behemoth of a wolf started to walk away with no real apology, much less compensation, for crushing all of her stuff. With a faint huff, she reached into her dressed and pulled out a small bone necklace, raising it up in Fangs direction, and muttered under her breath some indiscernible nonsense. At least, that's what it would sound like to anyone else listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou Great, lumbering oaf. So cocky and headstrong. You act so self-entitled, and don't fix that which you wrong. I curse you now, great lummox. You shall now pay for your crime. And suffer through my curse, from now to the end of time.

He ran back to the rest of his friends and continued their rough football game, smacking and shoving into people, though thankfully nothing else (Save for a park bench) got broken in the process. Hours had passed since their little incident, and long since had Fang or any of his friends forgotten about the little old gypsy.  Fang idly tossing the ball up and down into the air as he walked down the road with the large bear he had been playing with, the others already having headed their own ways home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, think I worked up way more of a sweat than usual today\u201d Fang complained with a growl, reaching up one beefy arm to tug at the front of his straining, skintight muscle shirt. It was tight normally, both from someone Fang's size always having trouble finding clothes, and from the fact he loved showing off, and thus always wore tight clothes, But today it seemed worse than usual. Each time he inhaled, his chest flared outwards and threatened to split the tight blue fabric right down the middle, Fang able to actually feel the fabric splitting apart lightly each time he took a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do look kinda pumped man\u201d the bear complimented, grinning toothily up at the towering wolf. \u201cYou been hitting the Gym more than usual?\u201d He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNa man, been slackin frankly, Had these two Chicks hangin out at my place for like 3 days straight, dude they could barely walk by the time they were ready to leave\u201d He growled out, a smug, cocky grin spread over his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that's just a work out of a different Kind, ya know\u201d The bear replied with a snicker, playfully elbowing Fang's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft. Barely worked up a sweat, chicks were exhausted\u201d he replied just as cockily as before, clearly proud of flaunting his sexual prowess as well as his physical. \u201cWell. I gotta get home, sick of these tight ass clothes\u201d He rumbled, giving the bear one last friendly shove... Which immediately sent the bear stumbling to the side and falling down onto his ass, knocking over a trash can sitting along the side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOF! Dude, what the hell!?\u201d He growled out, glaring angrily up at Fang, though quickly lost the look when he realized who he was looking up too. \u201cer... I mean, cmon dude, gotta watch your strength\u201d he muttered, voice sounding suddenly a bit more cowed than the friendly tone he was using before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cheh. Sorry lil guy... Not my fault\u201d he replied, obviously more proud than apologetic of how he had pushed the bear down without even trying. With one last wave he turned his back to the bear, tail lazily flicking back and forth behind him \u201cLates!\u201d and headed his way home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan... sometimes he needs to learn to control himself...\u201d The bear muttered out, then blinked as he watched the wall-wide wolf walking away... was that shirt always so tight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Fang had made it back to his house his shirt was visibly tearing down the front, a large V shaped Rip stretching down halfway down his pectorals, and his lowest set of abs were fully exposed at this point, fur jutting out over the skintight waistband of his shorts and the hem of his shirt. Grumbling all the while about Tiny, frail clothes he stripped off all but his underwear, even those straining skintight around his immense tree trunk thick thighs, and bulging, obscenely huge crotch bulge and lazily flopped down on the couch with a beer in hand, to watch some TV till he fell asleep... Though when the now 8'4 wolf woke in the morning, he'd have quite the surprise waiting for him... and so would everyone else. </span></div></div>",

Let the punishment fit the crime...\"</div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\nSometime later, after long and very rough round after round of practice and play, the team finally began to disperse, until evnetually it was only Fang, and the burly brown bear Burton, walking back home together, and that was only happening because the husky ursine's home being on the same path as the looming lupine's. But then, normally Burton had to hustle his fuzzy ass to keep up with Fang, but tonight, that wasn't the case. It seemed that even the big bad wolf had found a limit to his normally bottomless endurance and stamina, sweat glistening on his shaggy mane of headfur as well as on his snout, and seemed to be panting a little, though it was at the moment being drowned out by Burton's much more audible form of gasping. Of course, whereas Fang went for power through solid muscle, Burton's regimen fell more in a power-gut sort of style, a style best supported given his ursine nature as well as his penchant for eating. He could take a solid Grande Grand Slam from the local Denny's without missing a beat just like he could take a triple grand slam from three tacklers at once. He was a very SOLID individual. Either way, finally finding his third wind (his second having been used up in that last couple of rounds, he was unable to let  his normally physically perfect teammate get away without taking a stab at this peculiar state Fang was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Fang, I guess we were really at it tonight. I've never seen you like this, man. You getting sick, or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang huffed and stood up straighter, imposing frame looming easily over the shorter bare as he bared his fangs in an agressively \"friendly\" grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck no, fit as a goddammned fiddle, Burton. Nah, I just think my \"extra curricular\" practices over at my place might be draining far more outta me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear would grin lecherously, getting the tone in the wolf's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What...or who...would these practices be on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Momma Bear\" Fang shot back without missing a beat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kidding, Kidding, Easy, Baby Bear-Ton...Nah...you've seen those two Foreign Exchange Students in Professor Raschoft's Cultures Class?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear stopped in his tracks, the wide and toothy grinning wolf walking on, his hands tucked deep into his football jersey as he would swish his tail proudly...only for Burton to come hustling after him, breathily gasping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE SISTERS!? YOU SCORED WITH THE FUCKING TWINS!? Dude, NO one's been able to pick up one of them, much less BOTH of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang would look back, his wild mane spattering sweat on the gaping bear's face, winking, the infamous fang bared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking at the fucking Muscle God who DID!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurton let out a roar of laughter, clearly prideful of his teammate's great success, and without a though, slapped the big black furred wolf's broad back with a great resounding thump, meant to be a measure of congratulatory machismo. What Burton HADN'T expected...was Fang to stumble forward beneath the sudden blow by the bear. Burton blinked. He hadn't thought he put THAT much power into his slap on the back, looking at his large hand, flexing the fingers before looking back...and up at a very pissed off looking Fang, eyes burning bright and teeth bared in a snarl. Burton held up his hands in reflex, his fur practically losing several shades of color as he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Fang! I-I meant to pat you on the back! S-S-Sorry man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang would take a step forward, and Burton took a few steps back...but Burton would just stand there as Fang took a deep breath, expanding up and out to even larger looking proportions...only to deflate as he let out a calming breath, the bear beginning to breath again as well as he would wipe his brow as the fury he'd seen diminished to just frustration and annoyance...which was vented by a suddenly slug to the brown bear's left shoulder, practically numbing it on contact. The bear yelped and whined, rubbing his arm as Fang would turn suddenly, and stomp off to his house, which was not too far off from the pair. Burton would scowl after the wolf, muttering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeezuz man, you didn't have to punch me that fucking hard...not my fault I don't know my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurton stopped and looked after the looming lupine, making yet another observation. Normally, Fang's clothes were in the body hugging, \"practically painted\" on style, the wolf being known to leave very little to the imagination, being of the \"flaunt it if you got it\" mindset, but right now, from his jacket, to his pants, and even his shoes, seemed to be slightly lax on him, seeing wrinkles in fabric here and there. Shortness of breath, eskewed sense of balance, weight loss? Maybe the wolf was getting sick. Burton then slapped his hand on his face and made a disgusted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shit, and that fuzzball got sweat all over me, BLECH!\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"Dammit, BURTON\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snarled as soon as he slammed his front door behind him, his back still tingling from that fuzzy fatass's lumbering blow. He hadn't realized how much FAT hurt, but then, with how much the bear puts away in a single sitting, one can only imagine how many layers of muscle and mush was built up in the bear's body...got to keep an eye on that bear. If he ever got ideas to challenge the wolf...well, Fang would see to it who was the Alpha of the Pack, and it clearly was NOT Baby Bear-Ton...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get his mind off things, he would begin to strip right there and then, seeing how he lived alone normally, it was not a surprise he left his clothes about, much like a lot of things. His Letterman's jersey was slung onto a lazy chair, his worn old sneakers was kicked off back to the door, hitting it with dual thumps. A flick of his fingers and the belt was undone and tossed onto a doorknob, landing perfectly. Stretching out, Fang began to pose for his own pleasure, bones and joints a popping as he reached down and undid his jeans, pulling them down all while scrunching his large socked toes, slipping the jeans off. He tossed them aside without caring where they landed...not at all noticing how easy it was to slide his pants down. Normally, there was a bit of resistance, as if his pants didn't want to come off a fucking perfect specimen like him! But, they'd been pulled down without any resistance...actually, they might have even slipped a bit down on their own as soon as he removed the belt. But Fang, as \"perceptive\" as he was, it went by without notice, next being his t-shirt, which was normally like a second skin, especially when he works as hard as he had tonight, sweat soaking it entirely. Oh, sweat had soaked through, but Fang frowned as it seemed to have wrinkle here and there...and grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit...stretched another one out...ah well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was off and flung onto a lamp without a second thought, leaving him in just his old socks and a pair of tight red boxer shorts, which he murrled in a mirror, posing and flexing quite a bit, as it would accentuate his firm backside and definitely brought attention to his hefty wolfmanhood, which he would of course, stroke and fondle, mmmming. Still quite a hefty piece of wolfmanmeat in his hands. Though, he frowned, something was...off. He couldn't put his finger on it. Shrugging, he made his way to the kitchen, but as he made the reach for the kitchen door handle, he tripped! Snarling, he looked down...and saw his old socks seemed to have gotten a bit stretched out as well. They were definitely called \"old\" for a reason, darkened by sweat and stains, and hole-y, but it would appear that the elastic had finally lost the battle, as the socks seemed to bunch a bit at his ankles, and even a bit of extra fabric beyond the toes. Huffing, he reached down and tugged them off, flinging them to the trash bin, scoring two perfect baskets with each one. Flexing his large sweat bare furred feet upon the cold tiled floor, he would pull the kitchen door open and snatch himself a can of beer. Thumping off to the living room, dropping down onto his couch with a thump, mmmming as he popped open the can, kicking his meaty heels up onto the coffee table before the couch, airing out those damp behemoths he called his wolven soles, mmmming as he found a nice warm buzz already rushing through his mind as he tipped back the second can. He wasn't drunk yet, oh far from that, but combined with his exhaustion and odd sense of fatigue, the addition of alcohol was helping lull the big black furred beast to slumber...which he would begin to nod off, but not without a brief mental pause of contemplation...awfully literative a description when concerning Fang, but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was feeling so tired, so exhausted, so weak...was he sick? And something else was wrong...something...off balance...off scale? He looked at his boxer shorts and looked down with a sleepy eyebrow. He would reach down, a thumb claw hooking upon the hem of the boxer shorts...and tugged on it, seeing that there was some slackness...but the wolf's mind was overridden with self-pleasure as the other fingers rubbed upon his bulge...and with that, Fang drifted off, half emptied beer can in one hand, other gently cupping his own lap, the big black wolf went to sleep with a big ole grin on his fuzzy muzzle. But Fang was in for quite a surprise...or more appropriately, quite the rude awakening when...</span></div></div>",

Although, as it did, the still sleep fuzzy mind of the wolf did not recognize that his limbs rested forearms and mid-calves comfortably on those ends...and not over flowing, as his knees sometimes hung off, toe claw tips etching along the floor often when he crashed on the couch. Either way, he would rise from the couch, not notcing (of course) the delayed \"moment\" before feet met floor but he'd rise and scratch at his bare black furred backside, licking his chops as he made the trek to the bathroom for a nice, long shower...not at all registering the slightly loose boxer shorts he'd worn to slumber before had fallen to his \"big\" feet...and he'd stepped out of them without a single mis step. Of course, as sharp as his fangs were, his mind was not exactly as honed as his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of which, the football hero would stop in the hall, posing for a customized full body length mirror, flexing and pumping his muscled form, clearly not minding to show a bit of self-love. He was quite the specimen, his body well-cared and hard-worked physique, as well as blessed by fantastic genetics...most of the time. For you see, the customization of the mirror in question was that it was made to show off the entirety of a 7'10 superwolf rippling with muscle that would make Rob Liefield scribble like mad...and the wolf currently showing himself off was still packing plenty of muscle to make any football recruiter sit up and watch with rapt attention...but at 6'5'' and a physique which was certainly bigger than average, he wasn't as \"super human\" as he USED to be. But, ignorant to how he no longer filled out his special mirror as he used to, the big black wolf thumped off to the bathroom, bare ass shaking...but even his ignorance had limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's dawning realization to something being not entirely right began as he slipped into the shower, reaching reflexively for the shower handle...which wasn't there. He blinked and scowled, a bit more awake, seeing the handle in question...slightly higher then he reached for. Grunting with amusement, Fang shrugged it off and turned the shower on, murrring deeply as hot water basked him in its heat, making his body sing its pleasures...while providing his own, murrrling as he stroked his claw tips along his laps, the soaking shaft pulsating with long lasting morning wood, murrrling...long after when the shower was turned off, and the now dripping wet wolf would step out, unable to fight back instincts and shook himself off, which dried him off partially...but he reached for a towel, beginning to wipe himself...and certainly took his time polishing off his throbbing wolfwood, not sure why it felt especially good today...so good, he felt a great throbbing shiver shake his entire body. It was like cumming again and again, his fingers clenching on his wolf wood while his toes squeezed his big feet into fists, but yet, he had not came at all...but for one moment, he felt so much pleasure, he thought he mind as well have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps because the towel in question, another item made with the big bad wolf in mind, felt odd agaisnt at a smaller lupine's form...and especially good down there. Either way, the naked Fang would pad off to his bedroom, to finally get dressed...as much as it felt good to get his own jollies off, the sooner he get dressed, the sooner he might someone else to help get him off. He was grinning toothily when further evidence of something not entirely right with his world presented itself. Now, it should be noted, that as many items he's had customized throughout the home, the house was not made for him in mind, and so was on an average sense of scale...and that said, he always had to duck when clearing the way to his bedroom...but this time, his ears didn't even brush at the top of the doorway. He paused and gave it a scruntinizing look...and huffed, rubbing his scruffy furred chinned, tossing the towel on his bed...and stopped between bedroom door and dresser...and just stood there in his bedroom, scowling all around. The now freshly clean and more \"aware\" wolf would look all around...and knew that something was not right. Though he knew not the right words to properly say it, he could tell that his perspective, so long used to a certain way, was NOT as it should be. And he huffed with great annoyance as he would reach out for his underwear drawer and selecting a pair of tight red boxers, he would slip them on...and that very moment was when Fang's unrecognized fears became fully realized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...As those shorts began to slide right off of him without any hold what so ever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...the fuck...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled and tugged them up. Now, he KNEW that these boxer shorts were brand new, and show still be quite tight in hold and elastic. But as he kept hiking them up, they kept sliding down his lap and his thighs...before he stopped and tugged them up, holding them...and notice that the hem of the shorts was well passed mid thigh...and looking closer to knee. He held the shorts out slight, noticing the significant gap in wide, clearly showing that these were for a wolf of far larger size. But these were made especially with someone like him in mind, and if he didn't fit in them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let the shorts drop as he suddenly yanked open a drawer and grabbed a simple white tank top and put it on...and was shocked to find it too did not fit well on him. It held, but instead of body hugging and leaving little to the imagination, it wore baggily on him...and he blushed as he felt its hem stroke lightly along his still stiffened member, while a better expanse of his chest was shown around the neck. This too, was supposed to be a shirt made for him, it was supposed to be body hugging, not hanging off on him. Somehow, he'd either gotten a size bigger then his or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was smaller. Like that, the dominos fell as it all came together. His clothes not fitting right, the doorframe being bigger, the shower handle higher. His room...it was bigger and wider then normal...or, more to the correct point, he was smaller and shorter then he should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big bad black wolf would let the shorts drop and in just the baggy tank top, he would run down the hall and after some fervent searching he would collect a tape measure, and a black felt marker. Standing agaisnt a wall, he'd mark the tip of his head where it lay, and hurriedly measured the mark...and with a slack jaw and bulging eyes, he read a measurement of Six Feet Tall. Six Feet Tall EVEN. He'd nearly lost two feet in height...and after looking himself in the mirror, he could watch with dawning horror that his height wasn't the only thing he'd lost. His godlike muscle tone had suffered, dropping passed demi-god and now looked more in line to \"semi\" god of muscle, but barely even that! What the fuck was happening to him...and was it still happening? Was he STILL shrinking? The wolf could not bare to even think of that. It was a living nightmare to be just this small, to be so far from what he used to be, to even imagine he could get even SMALLER. Fang felt the urge to throw up, but swallowed it down dryly, rubbing his eyes as he would pace about the mirror, stopping to look at himself in the mirror and double check his height. He was still Six Feet Even...but for how long? What could he do? He'd dare not leave his house, less someone he knew saw him and then his life would otherwise be completely over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor that moment, he began to think of every woman he'd used, every jock and teammate he'd schooled and tackled, every other person he'd taken advatage of over his entire life...and shuttered, knowing for once, he might no longer be in control...and that scared the HELL out of him. He needed help. This was so beyond his realm of knowledge and understanding, he knew that even under threat of humiliation and pain, his salvation would be in someone else's hands, cause he had NO fucking idea where he should go from here. But, before that, he had to get dressed, cause going out like this was bad enough. Going out naked? Not happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a good part of two hours to put something together, and it certainly pained him terribly to do so, seeing how big his clothes were on him now, but soon, as he finally stepped out of his house, he'd come up with an outfit which would fit him for awhile, and would help disguise him: A white muscle shirt which had gotten shrunken in the wash fit him with some tightness but not as much as he'd like, a pair of boot cut jeans which hugged him in a few places but were still long enough in the legs to rest on his feet, which were currently clothed in a few layers of socks, stuffed into the smallest pair of black sneakers he had. But the crowning part of his disguise was a pair of shining black mirror glasses, biker's cap, and black leather jacket, pieces of a costume from years ago, in middle school where he'd given drama a chance, playing Felix in Ducktails and Bobbysocks...and it though the jacket was loose, it fit him perfectly. But, as good as it was, he grabbed his wallet and as much loose cash as he had in the house in case of new clothes, among other contigencies. Dipping the cap over his sunglassed eyes, the six foot \"greaser\" of a wolf quickly marched from his \"big\" house, and quickly made his trek to a possible cute ot his condition...and where he thought he'd get the help needed would be...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With his options before him, even for someone like Fang (who practiced his brawn over that of his brain), he could clearly see that that Tyler's shop is the logical choice (well, as logical as someone like Fang could be). His reasoning being, out of anywhere in town, Tyler's shop was the least likely for him to bump into anyone who was anyone, be that one of his \"friends\", a teammate, or one of his many \"conquests\", and this whole situation REEKED of all that scifi fantasy crap David's little brother sold...and if it WAS the little purple weasel's work, he's going to get his size back, even if he took his pound of flesh from the drake's own purple scaled hide! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though the trek from his house to Tyler's store was free of any \"surprises\" run-ins, Fang was VERY self-concious of the world around him. It seemed to him as if everything had finally caught up to him in growth. No longer did he tower over the crowd. No, now he walked amongst them, LIKE them. And Fang HATED it. A powerful sense of weakness and belittlement weighed down on him. He had no control over anything now, and it terrified him to his core at being stuck like THIS...or worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snarled as he slammed his hand upon Tyler's front door, the force of which thumped open agaisnt a wall as a choked jangle of a jingle servicing as the welcome/exit bell. This act did attract everyone's attention to him...and Fang basked in it. A very prideful person, the wolf devoured attention like his feral ancestors devoured their prey. Bearing his infamous namesake fang, bursting with pride, he strode in as if he owned the place (as per usual to his behavior under normal circumstances, anywhere...ever!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time, instead of a proprietor smiling shakely and fearfully beneath his great shadow, the guy working the register raised an eyeridge and huffed out sardonically up at the (at this point) larger lupine. \"Okay, I'll give you points for the vintage cosplay, but the next Rocky Horror Picture Show Midnight Event is not till Halloween, \"Eddie\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's good mood died the instant he heard that as his fang was now bared in a snarl...while Tyler looked up at the wolf, not at all recognizing him apparently, looking at him up down, expecting some threat or reaction to come forth at his verbal jab. The purple dragon was currently flipping through a copy of Astro City, dressed in what appeared to be  baggy jean shorts, black high top sneakers with socks rolled down over the top, a copper-grey over shirt with a black turtleneck beneath it. He'd begun to look back at his comic book when the wolf just stood there, but Fang slammed a large hand, palm down and leaned in, slipping the mirror glasses down to show his eyes to the dragon, hoping a bit more of his features might help \"remind\" the purple dragon who he was fucking with. \"Funny, Tiny Ty, funny...now are you done playing Comic Book Guy, and going to give me some service...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler froze in mid-page flip and looked up at the wolf with a suspicious glare \"No one calls me Tiny Ty but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang grinned, baring that fang again, and Tyler's eyes widen and sat up and pointed a finger up at Fang, who was grinning wide and proud as Tyler said \"You've GOT to be related to Greggory Nanthaniels! You must be one of Fang's cousins, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he were at full strength, Fang would've been in fear of giving himself a concussion as he slapped a hand on his forehead, removing the hat and glasses before leaning in, hissing a whisper as everyone's attention was back to their possible purchases, only wanting Tyler to hear. \"STOP being a diminuative dumbass for once, and LOOK at me! I AM Fang...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth wolf and dragon were glaring daggers at one another as both were getting really mad as Tyler's eyes darted around the wolf's form, grunting, while the bell was ringing in quick succession as most of the customers left the store, feeling the heat rise in the room quite rapidly. \"Well, I admit, even for a relative, you'd be a pretty spot on Fang...if you were a couple feet taller, a couple dozen pounds heavier and beefier, and an even bigger asshole, you'd be his identical twin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit ,Tyler, I AM Fang. I came here hoping to get your help cause I'm somehow SHRINKING! And since shrinking falls somewhere in your scifi fantasy bullshit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you might be Fang's cousin, but you keep talking about my livelyhood like that, and I'll kick you out myself, you mouthy bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GODDAMMIT TYLER, I'M GOING TO RIP OUT YOUR TH-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the threat was fully made, Fang gasped and pressed his hands flat onto the table as Tyler watched at first with confused agitation...then slowly dawning shock as he began to watch the large wolf begin to literally shrink before his eyes! The six foot tall wolf would curse inwardly as he felt the same intense pleasure like when he first stepped out of the shower pulse through him, his fingers digging into the glass countertop, crackes forming as his claws dug deep...while he sank down. His eyes were shut tight as it felt so damn good, his pants to be so damn tight with his arousal if he did not feel them loose on his legs and hips, his jacket feeling heavier as he lost five more inches of height, as well as even more muscle mass, looking now more like a buff swimmer or a really muscled minded olympic runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, when it was all over, the wolf now standing before the register was even further from how Fang was supposed to look, as Tyler just gaped at the now 5'5'' black furred wolf, dressed in fifties style greaser wear which had been slightly loose before, but nearly too baggy to be fashionable on him down. He was barely bigger then Tyler himself now. Fang was still scowling, unable to look Tyler in the eyes as he just waited for it, knowing full well that Tyler was going to laugh his scaly tail of, and embaress the wolf further. Fang was a shell of the super wolf he'd been. Hell, through all that pleasure, he hadn't even came! Out of all that, he didn't even get THAT satisfaction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when no snarky reply came, Fang looked slightly down to see Tyler staring at him with a smile...but not a sneering cruel smirk...but a genuine amazed grin beaming that for once in his life, he'd just seen the impossible right before him. \"You...you just shrank...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Fang sighed, feeling extremely weak and tired suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...JUST...shrank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I know, I've been shrinking, didn't I say that before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU JUST...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TYLER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stood up and shook his head, clearing his mind. \"Right right right. Focus. This...this is WOW...I mean...shrinking! Thats...thats like a super power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, real fucking amazing super power, ONE WHICH I CANT CONTROL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, you mentioned that...hmmm...what could have made someone like you shrink like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why're you asking me, I came to ask y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking aloud, sorry...hmmmm...\" Tyler rubbed his chin as he leaned in over the counter...and smirked \"Perhaps...those mega steroids you've been taking are beginning to wear off finally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Fang replied is with a very furious snort. He might be smaller, but Tyler knew when to stop kidding and shut up. \"Alright...now, how does one get shrunken...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pym Particles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth lupine and dragon would turn to see someone who'd been standing there waiting for a little while, a number of comics in hand. Fang would wince as he had to look up at this new guy, another wolf...who now was four inches taller then him, and nearly had the same musculture as him, though his fur was lighter grey and a far more leaner muscle, wearing a Silver Agent t-shirt, and baggy blue jeans with a pair of white and blue sneakers. He smiled at the black wolf without any hostility and looked between him and Tyler. \"Sorry, I don't often but into others conversations, but I sort of read a lot of those kinds of comics...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler would smirk and nod at the patron, recognizing him from many trips before \"Yeah, you would, wouldn't you? Alright, first of all, Pym Particles are a fictional substance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True...Shot with any strange lookign ray guns?\" Fang shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accidental Chemical Spills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we would have heard about that on TV...\" Tyler butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey wolf rubbed his chin , and shrugged \"Piss off any gypsys lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's ears perked right up and slammed his fist into his other hand, \"The old zebra from last night! She did this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey wolf beamed as Fang seemed to perk right up, trying to recall everything from last night while the other wolf set the comic books on the counter, Tyler ringing them up and handing them off to the other wolf, who looked at Fang's baggy clothes with a smile. \"Like your duds, daddy-o. Though my own cosplay kinda falls back on the Noir 30s. See you Ty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang would get in front of Tyler before the dragon could wave one of his favorite customers good bye. \"We need to find this gypsy bitch, and get her to change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler winced, \"Uh, go up agaisnt a gypsy who actually HAS magical powers, enough to curse a big dog like you into a shrimp? I think we might need to consider our options for another solution...either as a cure, or something to use on this gypsy...say, there is this store claiming to have real magical items and such...perhaps something can be found there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang huffed and crossed his arms, not convinced...but as he thought about his two choices, either chase down the gypsy or follow Tyler to this magic shop, Fang took a deep breath and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang sighed and rubbed his eyes, biting down a disgusted growl as he found the leather sleeve of his jacket slowly swallowing the bottom of his palm and snarls at Tyler, nodding with a rigid and regretful acceptence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, we'll go with your plan, Tyler, but you better not make me regret this, or I swear to God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler, the intial stunning and shocking effect of his formerly towering tormentor now brought low to close to his level before his very eyes having lessened...and the much more gratifying knowledge that he was now on even footing with the black furred wolf grinned and leaned over the counter and looked the lupine slightly up, to meet his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? May I point out that I'm probably one of the few folks who might want to actually help you, cause I'm pretty sure if a lot of other folks would rather take advantage of all this...and I'm not exactly sure if I wouldn't either. Cause from what I can see, we might actually have a pretty even fight, \"Fang\". Besides, I hate to point this out, but you're not in a position to make any threats. So, cut the alpha shit and lets just get going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's eye twitched and his quick trigger emotions snapped off another chamber as he snarled, claws and teeth bared \"Don't fuck with me, Tyler. I might not have the power or the size I once had, but I've got enough of it still to make sure you're cut down to size and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tyler watched with widened eyes as the wolf seemed to freeze in place and let out a groan as he shivered, hissing \"Grrr, Not Again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut indeed it was again, as Tyler's gaze went lower as Fang went through another shrinking spurt, his already ill-fitting greaser outfit now looking far too loose and baggy as the wolf lost another five inches in height and the equivalent in muscle as he shivered, the purple drake walking around the counter...and crossing his arms as he was looking in a horrified eyes of Fang...as they stood even with one another, one looking like the species opposite of one another, though Tyler would be amused to think that perhaps Fang might've lossed a little more muscle tone, and now seemed a bit runtier then even him! That could've been just his huge sagging clothes providing the illusion, but still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the clothes, Fang snarled as he flung off the leather jacket onto the counter, unable to stand how heavier it felt on him, and tossed off the cap as it slid forward over his eyes, setting it with the mirror sunglasses...and just looked with digust. The once tight white t-shirt hung off of him, his skinnier limbs having the leanest of muscle, barely looking masculine much less adult. He yanked up his jeans, as Tyler snerked as he could see a bit of the \"tighty whities\" beneath, and making a big of a black furred \"full moon\" but the wolf snarled again as he lifted his feet to turn...only to grunt as he lifted it fully free of the shoes and socks...and stood bare foot next to Tyler, his bare black furred soles flexing themselves on the smooth, warm wooden floor, while Tyler's own sneakered feet gave him an artificial boost of an inch or so, a toothy smile bared at his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I believe you were saying something \"cutting down to size\"...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more fucking word, Tyler, one more, and I swear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do, a lot. Now, calm down and just wait here...I've got some backup clothes out back that'll probably fit you. Just, get the stuff you'll need from your pockets and once you're redressed, we can get going. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang just gave a non-commital grunt and nodded, and began to fish his things from his pants pockets while the purple drake went to the backroom...and chose some particular fashion choices...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Minutes later...</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Fang, I got to lock up the shop. Just come on out, no one is going to recognize you by this point unless you keep acting up like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Tyler, are these the smallest clothes you have in this place!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I said I had some backup clothes, not my entire closet, so YES, those are the smallest I have. Its not myself you're losing mass as well as size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snarl emitted from the store, but soon, the \"big\" black bad wolf stepped out, not looking too pleased. And well, it was understandable. The sneakers, similiar black and white high tops to the drakes on, had a bit of room to them but fit him still, but not helped as the wolf had to bare foot it, so there wasn't extra padding to keep them on better, grumbling why the drake didn't have any extra socks (He did, but Tyler wasn't telling). The jeans held on but had too much fashionable bagginess then he would've liked but at least he could carry his wallet and other items in the many pockets. And though there was a semi-tight black t-shirt beneath it, the baggy white and red hockey jersey made him feel even runtier, the sleeves having so much room yet short enough they rested somewhere mid-forearm, while the torso hung loose over his jeans. But otherwise, the wolf was at least dressed properly and not hindered by the clothes. He was not at all happy, but he was going to have to just DEAL. Either way, he shoved his hands into his pockets and slouched, pouting like a sullen teenage wolf pup, which given his size and looks, might be a pretty convincing look. Tyler stood up straighter at an odd little noise he could swear he heard from the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are....are you whimpering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang stood up, and back arched in offensive stance. \"What the fuck you say!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler held up his hands, smiling weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy...look, I'm sorry, okay...I didn't mean to egg you on more...though I might regret saying this aloud cause well, you were a pretty big ass jerk when you're normal sized, but I guess it might not be ENTIRELY fair to have something like physical being slowly chipped away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn fucking straight....\" Fangn odded fervently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, No fucking <i>however</i>. It ISNT Fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Really? Tell me Fang, what good did you do with your size and muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was the fucking champ!...heh...\" he grinned toothily, fang bared \"Both figuratively and literally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you know what 'figuratively' and 'literally' means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WAS THAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYway...Besides personal victories on field and in bed, I mean, what benefits did it help to those around you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made the ladies happy...\" <i>\"Thats not what I...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I led all the teams I'm on to victory...\" <i>\"No, Fang, I mean...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not to mention the grants and money, and attention I brought to the university, which in turn benefitted the students and teams, not to mention local industries and business with tourism and such...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stopped, blinking at the little wolf as he walked on ahead a bit. As much of a moral issue the wolf was ignoring, he did make a pretty damn good point. Fang's reputation did sort of help in the greater scheme of things, and that reputation did come from his bodily superiority. Huffing annoyedly, the drake hustled after him, shaking his head. \"Thats not at all my point, but nevermind...we're here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed they were, as the pair of five foot folk padded through the parking lot...though Tyler had to nudge Fang along as the little lupine kept lingering, culture shocked as he found himself looking at a much bigger world, as dozens of fellow students from the univeristy were spilling in and out from the mall...and to the now five foot runt of a wolf, Fang was looking at a race of giants and giantesses, blushing with intense embaressment as he, with Tyler, walked passed a couple of \"off duty\" cheerleaders, a bouncy bunny blonde and a fanciful fox vixen...which he was chest level with, the duo giggling as they looked after the little wolf and drake, whispering to one another...and the wolf's sharp hearing exposed him to each hurtful word of \"shrimps\" \"dwarfs\" \"shorties\". His ears folded as Tyler looked at Fang sympathetically. This was HIS day on a daily basis, but to see someone who once had it all, but brought down to the same treatment, it seemed to be even worse, despite not happening to him directly. Still, maybe this will get the point he was TRYING to make to the wolf before, then trying to verbally put it across to him. Either way, they both entered the wall...and it wasn't exactly the busiest of times, it was pretty full with folks of many backgrounds flowing, constricting traffic in spots but otherwise, Tyler saw it as business as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Fang on the other hand...\"How the FUCK, are we supposed to find that magic shop...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler rolled his eyes, tugging the wolf alongside him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, roll back the dramatics, Fang. I know where it is, its this way. Now, if you'd stop oggling everything and everyone, hence getting folks to notice YOU, we can get there faster...or should I put out that thankfully, no one has taken a good hard look at you yet...and not RECOGNIZED you...or do you want that to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well that I don't Tyler, so shut up and...shut up and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake stopped and looked at Fang who'd stop and groaned, holding his forehead, stumbling out of the main flow and into the hall way leading to the restrooms, shivering as Tyler followed him...but standing at the mouth of the hall, he hid the fact that Fang was going through another spurt! And this time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bitty bad black wolf let out a very annoyed (and to Tyler, higher pitched) growl as he felt and saw himself shrink again, the borrowed clothes \"shifting\" and \"sliding\" upon him, and every now familiar \"feelings\" he felt...he just grew to hate even further; from the sensations of the sleeves sliding down his arms, to the spreading of space within his sneakers, providing plenty of toe wiggle room. All that, and more, not only compressed his size and mass into a 4'5'' shrimp, but also condensed his hate and anger, leaving a pipsqueak powder keg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the changes finally waned, fang and Tyler took a few moments to look over the littler lupine's further form...before Fang snarled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bitch is dead. I'm going to go out, and rip out her...\" he started to stomp out of the bathroom hall way, aiming to go straight for the exit, go on a hunt...only to come to a sudden, abrupt halt. the bitty black wolf blinked as he looked at his left arm, and the \"big\" purple claw gripping him tight with a vice-like grip. His eyes then followed up to meet Tyler's eyes...looking UP into his eyes. Tyler's snout was extremely serious (though deep down, he WAS grinning. I mean, come on! he now towered over his oldest of \"big bullies!\"), and said in a tone which to soothe the shrunken yet still savage beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregg...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FANG\" hissed Gre...'Fang'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Fang...take a breath. Think about it. You can't go anywhere like this, much less go after someone whose already cursed you. I mean, look at yourself! I'm big-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stro-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang growled even louder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm able to hold you back! What do you think SHE;S going to do to you!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang kept growling but eventually, the growling subsided, and Fang...sighed in defeat. \"You're...right. Dammit, you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler watched the wolf \"deflate\" in a figurative sense, the purple drake feeling a strong pang of guilt once more, and after removing his hand from Fang's arm, and placed it on his shoulder, and to his, and Fang's surprise, gave it a tight squeeze of companionable comfort. \"You'll get your chance...I promise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked up at Tyler, mouth agog by the gesture and clear honesty in the drake's voice. But, alpha dog programming kicked in, and he huffed, and shrugged off tyler's hand, shoving his own hands into baggy pockets, and slouching, shuffled off into the mall proper. Tyler, standing there, surprised yet NOT surprised by Fang's reaction, smirked and shook his head, catching up with the sulking shrunken lupine easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Fang's self-pity party and Tyler's focused efforts to find the shop in question, both were standing before what looked far out of place in the modern mall of America of 2012. It stood between a franchise video game store, and a larger chain clothing store, and it stuck out so effortlessly, looking someone cut out a wedge of the mall proper, and shoved in what looked like a curio store from the fifties, and even that had been plucked from some tiny town in the backwoods of the South, or high up in New England, especially with the shop's name \"Hearst's Desires\". Terrible pun...but...there was something clearly far out of place, and yet, it \"felt\" perfectly in place in the mall...when it shouldn't! Tyler let out a low whistle, feeling a distinct tingle along his spine, turning to look down at Fang...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Whom was already rushing off towards the closed wooden door, strong arming the door open...and instead of sending the thing FLYING across the store, it only opened it halfway...making the shrimpified Fang, furious by how weak he'd become, shove his form against it, the bell tingling above the door. Tyler, standing there a moment longer, stumbled after Fang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, he stopped dead after a few steps into the threshold of the store, just marveling at the sheer abundance of antiquities and heirlooms, items of such rarity and age, the entire store seemed to hold so many secrets, so much unquestioned power, that it caused his fine purple scales to tingle with just being in the same room! It was all...there was just so much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUNK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler blinked back into focus as he stared at a very unhappy looking little lupine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the fuck are the weapons? Holy Water, Silver Bullets, FUCK, where're the magic swords!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you're in the wrong place for \"magic swords\". Those are often found at the bottom of lakes, or embedded in stones...\" Both Tyler and Fang looked suddenly to a dapper old grey fox, dressed a century or two out of style, and fancied in those old-fashioned style a particular hue of fine coal black and deep crimson, like that of fine aged wine...or old blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore or less Tyler's height and build, he looked down at Fang with a quirked smirk, and raised eyebrow. \"...And aren't you a little \"young\" to use firearms, little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck you, Dumbledore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, no need for such language...and Dumbledore was a wizard, whereas I'm but a simple shopkeeper and dealer...so, perhaps Oleander might work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or how about Leland Gaunt...?\" Tyler offered, frowning as the fox smirked right back, all while Fang looked clearly out of depth in this conversation, as the purple drake and grey fox spoke over his head...both literally and figuratively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a reader! Yes, perhaps you COULD call me that...but please, Hearst shall work and for it should, for that is the name of the store's owner, and I am he. SO, gentlemen, you came here to find something, correct? Now what oh what, could it be? A good luck charm, or a gift for someone special...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang attempted to speak, but was pushed aside as the grey fox approached Tyler, the purple drake flinching as the shop owner smiled at him \"Secret little wish, a dream to come true...or perhaps it already has, and you need to realize it...or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at the diminished Fang \"A cure for a curse so unkind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang and Tyler's eyes widen and their mouths hung open in surprise at the smug looking old fox, but it was Fang's jaws which snapped with an audible click as he stepped forward, claws ready to tear. \"How did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy little one, I know like anyone in my...\"trade\", whose worth their salt, would know: Experience, Experimentation, and Excellent Service...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the FUCK does that last one have anything to do with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you do like using that word alot. Does your mommy know you're such a potty mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was ready to claw the older gent's throat out, only to be held back by Tyler, who despite his own horror at the verbal attack that the shop owner had made, was at least aware enough to stand between the fox and the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances, Tyler would not even have a snowball's chance in Hell in stopping Fang. But, with that said, Tyler was having an especially difficult time trying to hold back the shrunken football player back, looking at the shop owner with a variety of conflicting emotions, \"What the Hell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experimenting, Mister Matthews...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how'd you know my n-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I believe I recognize the source, but I need to confirm the trigger. There is a primary time based incantation, which insures that the little lupe loses a portion of his height and strength, and that alone is Romani in application and spell spectrum, but there is something unique which bolsters the central curse, either heightening or hastening its effects at times...an earthier, older brand of magicks, which I believe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"POINT, FUCKWAD! TO THE FUCKING POINT!\" Fang howled, jaws snapping, spittle flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grunting as he kept the widdle wolf at bay \"I really don't think you should tease him any...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet, little one. Puny puppies like you should be seen, and not heard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUUUUUCKERRRRR!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler could feel himself being pushed back. Despite losing so much of his size and strength, the widdle wolf's unstoppable will pushed him on, and that gave him power where he should not really have ANY. But, it was clear, that even that came with a cost as Tyler felt resistance fade, while Hearst smirked as the wolf dropped down to his knees, growning and shaking all over, nodding as he watched the wolf begin to shrink once more...but this time, it seemed to be stronger this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there is our secondary trigger! It feeds off of aggressive and negative emotion. Your little friend, Mister Matthews, is a bully. Not the worst, but not exactly a \"saint\" either...mmmm, yes, Aesopic in application yet connected with natural forces....It would appear that we're dealing with a...oh, I believe this spurt has finished...my my, what an adorable little pup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stopped looking at the shopkeeper in wide eyed amazement, and then down...REALLY down at Fang...and winced. It WAS worst. Fang didn't just get small. He was a full foot shorter then before, now 3'5''...and yet, seemed even smaller then that. The bitty black wolf panted as he stood on all fours, the heels of his saggily socked feet easily popped out far too much out of the sneakers, and now was swimming within the dragon's hand-me downs. He really DID look like a wolf pup who'd gotten into an older sibling's closet! Fang's eyes were closed...and the look of shame and misery was plain as Tyler only heard Hearst's voice as he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Gentlemen...I believe I have a couple of solutions to your \"little\" problem, but I need to know what you really want...so, be honest with me. What do you...desire?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Revenge!\" the tiny black wolf hollered, his kiddish voice ringing through the air. Yet neither Tyler nor Mr. Hearst took any heed of Fang's wishes. The former football jock-now insolent pup stomped his foot, trying to garner their attention. He opened his mouth, maybe the fucking little purple shit and the old fogey didn't hear him the first time. \"Reven-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler clamped the wolf's mouth shut, Fang's eyes going wide with disbelief; to think that Tiny Ty would have the audacity to stand up to him. Fang began to snort into the drake's slim purple fingers, his rage building. <i>Don't lash out, don't lash out</i>, he told himself. <i>You can get him back when your fuckin' 7'10'' again</i>. The small canine, bit his tongue and huffed, taking deep calming breaths, but never once did he stop glaring icy daggers into Tyler. <i>You're gonna pay, you little shit</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll just stick with getting Greggy back to normal,\" Tyler said to the shopkeeper. The drake took extra delight in using a diminutive form of Fang's real name. It fit well, such an adorable name for an adorable little tyke. Fang on the other hand, felt his rage building, he wanted to scream; how dare he? How dare he?! And that's when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang felt that familiar feeling of dread washing over him. He was shrinking again. He felt his strength leave him, the clothes draped over his body extra billowy, so loose in fact the jeans he wore fell to his ankles, revealing a set of child-size briefs. Sheer humiliation flooded Fang's existence, all his blood flushing through his cheeks, a rosy tint visible through his midnight black fur. He looked at himself and just knew; knew he had shrunken a good half foot again. What Fang did next surprised everyone. He brought an arm up to his face and began to sob into the red fabric of the jacket. \"I didn't even do anything that time,\" he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Tyler... actually felt sort of bad for Fang. He looked at Mr. Hearst, if the old fox felt any emotion for the wolf, he sure didn't show it, a true professional. The fox opened his mouth and said, \"The trigger is not just the act, but the thought. What did you wish upon your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not my friend,\" Fang growled, the demeanour so out of place with his shrill voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh, no more thinking like that, pup. Answer my question,\" Mr. Hearst said smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to kill him,\" Fang replied menacingly. He turned to Tyler, having to look way up, his 3' frame against Tyler's five. \"If I wasn't so damn weak, I'd have wrung your neck by now, you little-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, Mr. Nathaniel,\" the fox interrupted, his voice calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang knew he had no choice, he could not risk shrinking any further. \"Get me back to normal, gramps,\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have an accord then?\" Mr Hearst said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him back to normal,\" Tyler sighed. He didn't like the idea of Fang being huge again, the bully lording his size over him, making him feel pathetic, worthless even. But, unlike the narcissist sulking beside him, Tyler had a conscience. He knew it was the right thing to do, no matter how much he was going to regret it later. He gulped, \"So, what do you have that can help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well... as an entrepreneur, I have to admit I could've made more money if you boys had went with a hex, but you, Mr. Matthews have a good head on your shoulders now don't you?\" The fox sighed as he rummaged through drawers, looking for some odd trinket or doodad. \"Aha! Here it is. Here it is,\" he muses to himself. He holds out a rather intricately carved amulet, the surface etched with carvings that remind Tyler of Sanskrit and oracle bone scratchings. \"This amulet wards against all curses originating from the Orient, from Arabia to the Far East. Because the Romani have origins in the Indus Valley, I do believe it should work fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang leaped up and snatched the pendant from the elderly fox who grimaced in annoyance from the wolf's rudeness. Without hesitation, Fang strung the chain around his neck. No flash of power, no glint or hint that the bauble had worked. Fang looked over himself, why was he still small, he should be <i>huge</i> by now! He should've ripped these pathetic duds to shreds and be giving the old geezer and the runt of dragon a true display of what it is to be a man. \"What the fuck?! I'm still tiny!\" he roared. \"You're damn shit's useless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang could've continued... but he felt a familiar tingle run through his veins. \"No... no no no nonononono,\" he whimpered. This couldn't be happening again. He watched as his world got even larger, his puny frame shrinking even more, what little definition he had left disappeared, leaving him at a meagre 2'6'', barely the size of a yearling. If it weren't for the permanent scowl on his face, he'd look exactly like a infant; hell, he sure was crying like one right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Nathaniel, did I not mention that the amulet works only on curses from the Orient? Whoever weaved this spell is no regular witch, to blend magicks like that. The first portion of the curse, the temporal effect, is nullified. The second... well let's say that's more complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I fix it?\" Fang snarled, wiping away his tears on the back of his stubby little fingers. \"I'll do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good,\" the fox says calmly, coyly even. \"You see, the more powerful brand of magick truly has no physical counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" both Tyler and Fang say at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox chuckles. \"It's pretty ingenious, really. People often think curses are in place to take revenge, to make examples of the cursed. When really, a gypsy's curse is often to teach the bearer a lesson. Mr. Nathaniel already has all the tools to reverse the curse. If arrogance is his vice, then...\" The fox bends down and smirks in the wolf's face and pushes at the tiny guy's chest, eliciting a growl from Fang. Mr. Hearst, of course, plays it off. \"A dose of humble pie is the medicine. True acts of selflessness, Mr. Nathaniel, are your cure. You can piece your life back together simply by doing good. Ingenious isn't it; a living manifestation of the Golden Rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all I have to do to break the curse is be nice to people? And I grow back?\" Fang harrumphs. The wolf though to himself that that'd be easy enough; putting on a nice smile and kissing a few babies, easy-peasy lemon squeezey-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. You mistook me, pup. I never said it'd break the curse. That's a whole different ordeal, Mr. Nathaniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Fang sneered. He calmed himself, fearful of another shrinking episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you boys ever read fairy tales? It's simple really, to break a curse of this kind, all you need is a kiss from your true love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler began to snort. He couldn't keep it in; he began to hoot. Love? Fang knew nothing about love. Even from the wolf's conquests, it's well known Fang didn't make love to his partners, he fucked those girls raw. Could Fang even court a girl properly? All he knew how to do was flex his guns and get a girl to melt into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And something tells me, Mr. Nathaniel, you won't have to look very far,\" Hearst says coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler stares down at Fang and Fang at Tyler. The purple drake glares at the fox who's now smirking at the two of them. His lips curl into a sneer. \"Dont-\" the dragon started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-even,\" Fang finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you boys say.\" The fox makes his way to the till and rings up the amulet. \"That'll be $100,\" he says flatly. Fang reaches into the jean pocket hanging at his ankles and pulls out his wallet. Damn, was this thing always this heavy? He obviously couldn't reach and he looked at Tyler expectantly. Tyler rolled his eyes and picks up the little pup bringing him up to the register and the wolf fished out a card. \"Hmm, shouldn't you be paying for this, Mr. Matthews? After all, you are the one wearing the pants in the relationship.\" Tyler hissed and Fang snarled at the remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it was over, Fang practically jumped off the counter, the four foot fall felt like an eternity and he felt pain shoot through his legs as he landed. He was too small... he couldn't do <i>anything</i> anymore. Tyler shook his head. He didn't really know what to do, he really wanted to just leave Fang to fend for himself... but at the same time a small voice within his head told him that was wrong. It was strange, that's for sure, his nemesis - the guy who always said he was a waste of space, a tiny shrimp - needed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the wolf could burst through the door of the storefront, Tyler trotted up to him and wrapped the jersey around the wolf's practically naked frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing, Tyler?\" Fang squeaked, no longer able to intimidate the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it's easier this way, you play the infant, and I'll pretend to be a babysitter. I am <i>not</i> going to try to explain why a buck naked baby is walking around on two feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Fang just growled as lowly as his new register would allow as he conceded. \"Where are we going?\" Fang huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof,\" Tyler grunted. He might be over twice the wolf's size, but his thin, lean arms had very little strength in them, Tyler couldn't imagine what'd it be like if he became a dad one day and had to carry a child around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so fuckin' weak, Ty-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! You're shrinking again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Fang blurted, his tiny voice shrill in the air as he thrashed about to check himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy,\" Tyler smirked. He was going to milk this for all it's worth. \"C'mon Fang,...\"</span></div></div>",

It didn't take him long to realize these were Rebecca's legs, slowly Fang turns around. What he saw put him in awe, Rebecca sat there, leaning against her headboard, completely naked. Most of Fangs time at this size was spent in her panties, or mouth, now he could really take in the body he had been forced to be so uniquely intimate with. Fang wasn't sure if it was his size and perspective, or what, but without her clothes, this coon was really cute. For a moment, Fang fantasized about how he could have been the bigger dominating one in the bed, plowing her raw, and kind of regretted turning her down.

He had been running on instinct for half an hour now, exhaustion racking his frame when he dashed around a dingy street corner and directly into a pillar of pure masculinity. Fang, on the other hand, had just left the gym. Muscles burning pleasantly after an intense workout, the wolf, narcissistic as ever, was taking a moment to enjoy his muscular physique in the reflection on the gym windows when he felt something bump into him. Turning and snarling viciously, he peered down from his lofty height to notice a small raccoon begging and pleading for him to not hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThick you can pickpocket me, you little runt?\u201d snapped Fang, spit spattering over the frightened raccoon\u2019s black and grey fur. \u201cGo on, shake out those pockets!\u201d A thickly muscular, black-furred arm shot out to grab Rich by his scruffy shirt. Fang lifted him from the ground with a scowl, Rich watching those intimidatingly huge biceps swell to their full glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I just turn you upside down and see what falls out? Don\u2019t keep me waiting, you puny excuse for a mammal.\u201d Fang growled, smug superiority curling the edges of his toothy grin. He was in control of the situation, and boy, did he ever enjoy that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT...this is all I have! I swear, I just bumped in to you!\u201d Shaking, the raccoon produced a shining chrome... toy gun? The metal seemed real, but what on earth was it? Grabbing the device in a meaty paw, he dropped the raccoon unceremoniously down to the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow get outta here, before I change my mind about my generous offer.\u201d Fang snarled, less interested in the currently fleeing Rich than on the mysterious raygun he had foisted upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it? It barely fit in his oversized paws as it was, but the slender chrome \u201cgun\u201d had a simple interface built onto the handle \u2013 a dial with a plus and minus inscribed on either side, and what looked like a fire selector \u2013 semi, burst and full automatic settings present and accounting for. Marcus wasn\u2019t the sharpest crayon in the box, being that he was much too large to fit in the box of crayons in the first place, but he had a few ideas to test out. It probably wasn\u2019t a gun, as far as he concerned \u2013 a gun was a gun, and he couldn\u2019t even see where to put the magazine. Besides, guns generally didn\u2019t have volume dials. In the spirit of scientific exploration (boy would his old physics teacher be proud!) he twiddled some knobs, adjusted some settings, took aim and fired, watching as a blast of energy...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rich didn't even make it twenty feet when something hit him from behind. Green light enveloped him and the small raccoon knew what had happened. Too scared or stunned to speak, the little mammal desperately hoped that the wolf had instead accidentally grown him rather then shrink him. Nut Rich's hopes were dashed when he looked down and saw the ground getting closer. The raccoon gave a fearful cry and dashed down a nearby alley, knowing that he had both a better chance of hiding and not being spotted or stepped on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang watched bewildered as the little raccoon seemed to be getting smaller. What was happening? Was the already diminutive mammal getting even smaller? The wolf watched for a little while longer until the raccoon ducked into another alley. 'Oh hell no\", Fang thought as he chased after Rich. If the little guy really had invented a shrink ray, then Fang wasn't going to let this opportunity slip away. He had always been pretty big but now, he could be bigger then everyone else, but first he needed to know how to properly use his new toy. Thankfully he was about to get a little nerd who knew everything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking raccoon ran through the alley his surroundings getting bigger and bigger by the second. Then Rich tripped over an old can and hit the ground, not enough to hurt but more then enough to daze him for a bit. Then suddenly the green light which this whole time had still been covering his body, faded out. The mammal gave a sigh of relief before cursing under his breath, the shrinking had stopped but how small was he now. Rich looked around then noticed the can he had tripped over and saw it towering over him. He did some quick math in his head and deduced that he must be two inches tall. Things went from bad to worse though when he felt the ground shake and quickly hid behind the tomato can as the wolf's hulking figure entered the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang's arrived in the alley, chest huffing and breathing slowly. Adrenaline coursed through his body as his excitement grew. Looking down the alley he saw no raccoon and a brick wall on the other side. 'Perfect', he thought. No escape. Fang stood stalk still his ears twitching for even the slightest sigh of noise, and his eyes darting left to right for even the smallest bit of movement. Finally he began to lowly make his way forward a greedy and feral grin on his face. He sniffed the air as he moved trying to pick up on the little nerd's smell. \"Come on out little guy, you can't hide from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRich whimpered softly as he saw the wolf slowly approaching from behind his hiding spot. Wolf didn't feel quite right the canine in question looked more like a fluffy mountain. The ground shook violently as the giant moved closer. The raccoon racked his brain, both trying to find a way out of this and trying to figure out what the wolf wanted. Did he want to get rid of him, crush him out of existence? Did the giant want to keep him as a pet? What! What did he want?! Then he heard the wolf's voice again but this time much closer, so close in fact that the giant in question had to be standing right behind his hiding place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you little trash eater. I want to know how to use this new toy you've given me.\" Rich too scared to give a gulp continued to listen. \"I thought I was big before, but with this, I can really be the biggest, so why don't you come on out and help your new master.\" The raccoon heart sank and his body felt cold. He quickly stole a glance from behind the can and saw the giant's massive paws inches away from it. No way he was getting out that way. Then the tiny wet himself as a large voice above spoke. \"Ah there you are\" Rich looked up and saw the massive face of the giant smiling down at him. A foot resting on the can crunched down and flattened it. Then the tiny ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scoffed at this. As the little raccoon tried to run away towards the dead end. Reaching down the massive quarterback plucked the raccoon up between two fingers and very slowly but the small screaming bug up to his face. He looked at his little prize an evil smile on his face. Then using a giant digit pushed his finger against the raccoon's face. Covering his mouth in the process. Two simple words quieted the muffled screams. \"Shut up.\" The tiny immediately stopped and Fang removed his finger and very casually tossed the raccoon in the air and let him full into his open palm. The tiny started to but then stopped screaming when he saw Fang's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRich was to terrified to speak, never before had he felt so small helpless and afraid and it only got worse when the wolf started laughing at him. \"Good Lord\", he boomed, his voice shaking Rich to the core. \"Did you wet yourself?\" Rich tried desperately to hide his soaking pants but the giant merely pushed him down and leaned closer to get a better look. \"You did, you really did.\" The wolf continued to laugh. \"Man I thought you were a pathetic little shit before, but now. Now your more like a bug then a mammal.\" Rich tried to speak but the giant's laughter drowned him out. Rich could do nothing but wait for the giant to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang eventually calmed down and looked at the bug in his hand still smiling. \"So what's your name little bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRich thought he was being serious for a second but before he could get two letters out the wolf interrupted. \"Don't care. My name is Fang, and starting today I'm your master. And you are my little servant. So here's what's going to happen your going to teach me all the little tips and tricks of this size ray and then I'm going to use it to do...well whatever the fuck I want. Meanwhile you will continue to serve me in whatever way you can. Got it.\" Fang waited for a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little raccoon thought about it and decided to ask a question. \"What if I say no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang gave a toothy grin. \"Then I'm gonna see how easy it is to make you say yes. You were nothing special before but now\", Fang trailed off and pushed a talon under his chin. \"Now your even less then nothing. Whatever bully's use to put your little ass through will happen all over again, except this time no one will be able to help you. Hell they won't even be able to hear you. In fact let's just do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rich could say anything Fang pushed him onto his stomach reached behind him and in a quick yank grabbed his boxers pulled him up in the air with them alone. The raccoon gave a such scream that if he had been at normal height he would have broken glass. But because he was only two inches tall only Fang could hear him. Then without warning Fang tossed him into the air and began to juggle Rich smirking the entire time. This continued for a few minutes until Rich lost his lunch and ended up puking on himself in midair. Fang stopped and held Rich by his shirt by avoiding the vomit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang smiled at him. \"Damn pissing and puking yourself all in one day. Even bugs aren't this pathetic. The jock knelt down and gently let Rich fall onto the hard ground. Just as he thought it was over, Fang reached into his gym bag and pulled out a water bottle. He uncapped the lid, and shook out it's contents all over the shrunken nerd. When it was empty he threw it down next to Rich and crushed it under his foot. \"Now trash eater, are you gonna teach me how to use this or shall we continue.\" Fang watched as Rich...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang is big. Very, very big. And that's exactly how he likes it. Ever since he was in middle school, he started to realize how much bigger he was than everyone else, and it only got worse when he hit puberty and exploded upwards even further in size, ending up one of the biggest wolves in history. Even though he was a foot taller than all of even the biggest Saurians and Dragons, even though he was ripped and muscular enough that he could go into professional bodybuilding if he tried, it just wasn't enough. He wanted to be bigger. He worked out almost obsessively almost every single night, He tried every supplement that he could get his hands on, and hell, he'd probably try steroids if he wasn't so proud of where 'else' he was big... downstairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was yet another attempt in a long line of varying successful attempts to make himself even more massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had been talking to Fang one day after a game, and they had been joking about David's shrimpy brother, Tyler when David mentioned the little runt talking about some new experimental growth hormone that they had been testing in the area recently. Fang did his best to play it cool, but he poked and prodded as much information out of David as he could, and then all but rushed home to start looking it up. Now he was on his way to the pharmaceutical company where they had developed the drug, to be one of its first trial patients. The preliminary tests, from what Fang had read about it, had apparently made Lab mice grow to almost a quarter their original height and double their previous muscle over the span of a few months! He'd gone to sleep that night to wet dreams of walking around town with the tallest people in town at best as tall as his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building loomed massively over him and most of the surrounding neighborhood, situated on the edge of the city. If it wasn't for the large company logo sitting on the side of the building he might have thought it was just some old, abandoned warehouse. It looked rather run down and beaten up, as if it had been sitting there unattended for years. Following the directions he had gotten with the email from the company, he walked his way around to the side of the building where a small side entrance was hidden away next to a few parked vans. Fang couldn't help but grumble a bit as he pulled the door open and then had to not just duck down, but turn to the side to fit his towering, wide frame through the tiny door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid tiny doors\u201d He growled softly under his breath, and only once he had stood back up inside, ears brushing the ceiling, did his head turn and notice the petite, rather terrified looking rabbit sitting behind a reception desk. She couldn't be more than maybe 5'6 at best, and her body was thin enough that Fang's thighs were probably thicker than she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-e-er... a-are you Mister Nathaniel\u201d She muttered nervously, then giving a quiet meep when his lips curled back and he let out a soft growl out of reflex. Fang hated his real name, and hated when anyone used it, first or last name. Though he quickly calmed himself down when he told himself she didn't know any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea. Call me Fang though\u201d He growled out in the deep, rumbling baritone of his voice, which seemed to only further unnerve the nervous receptionist. \u201cDon't like people using my First or Last name\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry sir... erm... yo-you're here about the drug trial r-right?\u201d She stuttered out nervously, seeming to be ducking down a bit as if  trying to hide behind her desk \u201cJ-just go down the hall to... er. To the left there, and go in the first door on the right\u201d She murmured meekly, then quickly turning to start shuffling papers around to try to make herself look busy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang simply gave a deep grunt of acknowledgment before he turned and started walking down the hallway as instructed, each loud \u201cThump\u201d of his footsteps causing the receptionist to jump a bit in her seat. Upon trying to enter the room he, again had to duck down and turn to the side to fit through the, to him, tiny door. Inside he found himself in a small, somewhat generic looking examination room, like you might find in a tiny private physician office. He looked around a bit as if expecting someone to be there waiting for him, before grumbling a bit under his breath and walking over to sit down on the, to him, child sized examination table, which immediately groaned a bit under his weight. He hated waiting, and found himself idly scratching across the top of the padded 'table' with a clawtip, slowly tearing open some of the padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem..\u201d A voice caught Fang's attention, his head snapping up to look at the slightly chubby looking tiger standing in the doorway, wearing a large white lab coat. \u201cYou must be Greggory\u201d He murmured, to which a quickly replied growl of \u201cFang\u201d corrected him. \u201cAh. Er, well then 'Fang', As they told you over the phone and in the e-mail, we're testing a new experimental growth hormone. Primarily we intend to use it for those with degenerative diseases that deteriorate muscle mass, but we needed some healthy test subjects as well, to gauge its effect on an already healthy and...\u201d He paused briefly to clear his throat \u201cDeveloped... physique. So how this will work, is we're going to give you an injection of the hormone, and then we want you to go about your daily activities just as normal, but we want you to come back in twice a week, to be weighed and examined so we can calculate your progress, alright? Assuming that your information was correct that you work out consistently, we project that you'll start seeing visible gains in as few as two days. We also request that you take Nightly self photos so that we have comparative pictorial details. Do you have any questions?\u201d He droned on for what seemed like ten minutes, leaving Fang all but asleep by the time he was directly asked a question and snapped out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr.. yea. Work out. Pictures. Twice a week. Got it\u201d he growled out softly, obviously rather impatient and ready to get this over with. He didn't care about the stupid tests, he just wanted to get this over with and see if it worked. \u201cCmon doc, lets get this over with I got places to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger sighed and rubbed a paw across his forehead. He was too tired to deal with this. \u201cFine, Fine. Just roll up your sleeve\u201d He murmured, as he reached into one of the drawer's against the wall and pulled out a large syringe from a padded drawer, raising it up and testing pushing at the stopper. A thick, almost silver-looking liquid squirted from the tip of it. If Fang were a weaker man, he might be intimidated, but if anything he simply seemed all the more pushy at getting this over wish. It was as if, even to himself, he had to prove how tough he was, fearlessly taking a needle that would make others cringe and wince. He rolled the sleeve of his T shirt up, though really it was more like tugging it up with how tightly it clung to his bicep, exposing the thick black fur covered meat to the doctor. Carefully the needle started pushing into Fang's arm, and he clenched his jaw slightly at the strange sensation of that thick payload of liquid pushing itself into his bloodstream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, all done. Now, Just remember. Come back next Wednesday and Saturday, and take Nightly self pictures. If anything abnormal happens call us or come back immediately\u201d The tiger lectured to the looming wolf, who hopped off the table with a dull THUD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea yea, got it doc. Laters\u201d Fang growled out dismissively, ducking himself down and squeezing his way through the door and out of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later he was back at home, grinning widely at himself in the wall-length mirror covering one of his bedroom walls. His thick, meaty arm raised up to flex his massive bicep, as he leaned his head in to exaggeratedly lick over the swollen muscle \u201cOh fuck yea, You're a big mother fucker, aren't you Fang? He growled out loudly to himself, his other paw reaching down to rub over the massive bulge of his crotch straining the front of his deep crimson colored briefs, the only clothes that he wore. \u201cGod damn walking Tank\u201d He added, as he gave his sheath a hard squeeze. He didn't want to get too into it with himself tonight, as he planned to get up early tomorrow and hit the gym all Saturday. That didn't stop him from a little self tease, before he did as that fatass of a tiger from earlier told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was 'ready' he reached over to grab his digital camera, raising it up with one paw and grinning cockily into the mirror, half hard cock straining the front of his briefs obscenely. Perfect. The guy wanted pictures, right? Better give him his moneys worth. After a few side and back shots, he set the camera down, and then curled himself up in his re-enforced bed for the night... ready for what was to come tomorrow. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weirdness ruled in the dreams of the big black wolf \u2013 though he wouldn\u2019t have said it was weird. More the natural order of things. Fang sat upon a throne in a room decorated with gold, silver and countless shining jewels, a regal red velvet cape draped across unimaginably powerful muscles as pathetic mewling creatures worshipped at his paws. The wolf\u2019s titanic toes overwhelmed even the largest of the tiny figures, and as they knelt and bowed to the looming lupine a wicked thought crossed his mind. As their king \u2013 no, as their <i>god</i>, it was his right to do whatever he pleased to the worthless peons. As a large black footpaw came crashing down upon the worshippers, an echoing, booming thud rang out across the room, and Fang awoke with a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrgh. He felt like shit. He hadn\u2019t even been drinking last night. He sat up and rubbed bleary eyes with his meaty hands, looking over his sculpted body as he so often did, being a terrible narcissist. He noticed his blanket was all over the place, his feet sticking out of the end of the specially-constructed bed. Weird. Thinking nothing of it in his headachey state, the wolf cast the bedclothes aside and went to admire his toned, buff physique in the mirror with a few flexing poses. As his heavy footsteps thudded across the carpet, the wolf cracked his head on the lampshade hanging from the ceiling, sending the lightbulb wobbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was... unusual. Cocking a curious eye at his mirror, he noticed with growing anticipation that he seemed to be bigger, and not just a little taller at that. With a few long strides up to the mirror, Fang measured the difference with his previous height roughly with his hands, and came up with an estimate... half a foot. Six inches. Six more inches of muscular, handsome, buff, manly wolf... the wolf was snapped out his reverie by his growing arousal, raw red peeking from his sheath as he admired himself in the mirror, and he was not disappointed by what he saw in the slightest. His most important asset had grown to proportion as well! Silently congratulating himself for avoiding steroids all these years until he found something that worked so well, the wolf watched his massive musculature flex and tense in the mirror with something close to amazement. Fuck, he was huge! Utterly obsessed by the figure in the mirror, Fang found himself unable to avoid attending to his needy erection, eagerly stroking his length as he admired his heroic physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you fuckin\u2019 stud... lookit those pecs... mmm, check those biceps...\u201d Fang\u2019s thoughts turned to those of his supporters \u2013 the scouts for those bodybuilding magazines. They wanted a Muscle God? Well, they were going to get one, and it was going to be far too much for their puny minds to handle. The thought of the college girls swooning over his new muscle mass and his teammates on the football team fuming as he flaunted his size over them was indescribably delightful for the massive wolf, mesmerised by the juggernaut pleasuring himself before him. As each stroke brought him closer to climax, a thought dug tenaciously into his head... what if this was just the start? What if he could take more of that stuff, get even bigger? As Fang greedily rubbed at his cock he couldn\u2019t help but grin viciously at the thought of the pathetic folks on the street having to stare up just to look at his hefty sac. Even the not-so-pathetic folks like David \u2013 all would be nothing beneath him! He\u2019d be huge! Unstoppable! The thought was joined by a swell of pleasure as Fang shot his load onto the grinning wolf in the mirror, a few spurts from his significant length dripping slowly off the reflective surface as Fang roared in ecstasy. The wolf set himself down on his bed as he pondered his next move, still warm and sweaty from afterglow...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fang didn\u2019t bother to clean up his mess as he hit the showers. He was increasingly aware that underneath the fading afterglow, he was still feeling a bit shitty as his muscles started to ache. Well, he supposed he did just grow a hell of a lot overnight, his muscles were probably fatigued. Nevertheless, he was keen to give his body a good test run at the campus gym. The wolf snickered. If anyone happened to catch a jealous stare while he did it, then all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang walked stiffly back to his room to get dressed. He caught another glimpse at his now wet body through his cum drenched mirror, and had to stop and admire himself. Wow, over 8 feet. That was a significant milestone. He was one unbelievably powerful wolf. One in a million. No, fuck that he thought as he sneered. One in a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang had a happy dilemma. Pretty much all of his clothes were too small for his old frame, the ripped wolf preferring to let his valuable and hard earned definition read through to the world. But six inches was a lot to stack on, and he was ripping most of his shirts before he even got them over his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he settled for a plain white shirt that managed to hug his form without bursting, the only one in his closet, and some baggy basketball shorts that easily held his enlarged thighs and package but was nonetheless stretched quite taught along the waist. He couldn\u2019t stuff his junk into any of his underwear, and accepted that they could barely contain his balls let alone sheath.  He would simply have to accept that the elastic would only go half way up his sheath, leaving only his shorts to hide the rest of his manhood. Besides, even if he got unlucky and his dick slipped out, it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing to ever happen to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an effort to dress himself though. His muscles were burning with every move, and his joints just felt stiff. He did some stretches, but that didn\u2019t seem to help. He decided to walk to the gym through the park. It wasn\u2019t the quickest route, but he figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get some blood pumping though his stiffening muscles before he warmed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body deteriorated further however, and he was only half way to the campus before he found his strides shrinking through the muscle pain. \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal\u201d Fang rumbled to himself nervously. He realised that this was probably one of those abnormal things that doctor mentioned yesterday. Or was it a scientist? Whatever, did he mention anything about restrictive body pain? He didn\u2019t remember anything, but then again he wasn\u2019t really listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH FUCK!\u201d the massive wolf cried out in pain as his elbow flashed a sudden white hot pain. He tightly grasped his elbow.  Shit, did it just dislocate itself? The wolf barred his teeth as he scowled in pain. His elbow was violently throbbing bolts of the most acute pain he had ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then suddenly, it was like a switch flicked. Fang let out a feeble moan as the sharp stabs of pain in his elbow turned\u2026 pleasurable. Throbs of ecstasy were sent jolting up his arm as the warmth spread down his arm into his wrist. \u201cAh shit!\u201d the black wolf gasped through clenched teeth as he held his elbow to his chest, hunching over it protectively as if it were injured. His forearm felt was on fire. Hell, it felt like his had WAS fire. But damn, it felt good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burning felt as if it were pressing up against invisible containments in his hand and bicep, fighting to spread out across his arm.  \u201cUghah!\u201d Fang grunted as an intense pleasure shot down the length of his wrist. It was a feeling in some ways comparable to an orgasm, though it was a completely unique sensation in its own right. The wolf\u2019s heart pounded in his massive chest, breathing rapidly as his mind ran mostly on instinct as the experience played out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis forearm was growing. Slowly, almost too slow to see, but Fang could feel it. He could feel it grow wider as he nursed it in his hand. Every muscle in his body was tensed, and even though his shoulder was locked in place, he could feel his wrist snake across the fur on his chest as it grew longer. He could also feel and hear the popping of cartilage, the creaking of bones and the tearing of muscles and tendons as it swelled out in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the burning sensation broke through the invisible containment in his paw, shooting up his hand and several fingers. Fang could grunted in pleasure as the burn grew hotter he let his shaking hand out in front of him, observing his palm as it too shot with pleasure. And began to grow. Not uniformally as one might have expected. The numerous bones and tendons in his palm spasmed larger to their own beat, quickly leading to a very mangled mess accompanied by some sickly popping and stretching sound effects. The sight set off an alarm somewhere deep in Fangs mind, but such a thought was far from the centre of his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his index finger flared up to the height of his middle finger, the growth spreading up from one joint to the other quickly without resistance. His pinkie followed shortly after, the base joint popping out further from it\u2019s wrist, before the middle joint followed in suit like a falling domino, then after a brief futile pause of resistance, the tip of the filled out to complete it. His palm continued to pop and expand, a more correct form reappearing as the slower growing components caught up in quick spasms, joining the rest of the hand in what was to be its new size. The last fingers popped out within short bursts of each other, leaving the shaking wolf staring at his enlarged hand as the sensations faded, leaving only a burning ring that pushed against his upper arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Fang put his pams together and laughed in delighted disbelief. The finger-tips of his enlarged hand eclipsed towered a full joint above those on his other hand! Looking down lower, his new elbow jutted out at least two inches further than his old one, and the sheer muscle further accentuated the difference.  His whole arm felt heavier and looked clearly out of proportion, but the huge black wolf was ecstatic with what he saw. Greed and lust flashed through him. \u201cMore.\u201d He pleaded to his hand. More, he wanted more. More size, more of the insane feeling of growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed as the burning feeling broke free and shot up his upper arm, pausing only briefly before flooding over his shoulder and clavicle. Gasping, he rubbed his upper body with his unequal hands as the heat intensified, heralding the familiar pleasurable growth. The heat spread further before that onslaught however, up his neck and to the bottom of his jaw. Fang was breathing sporadically and unevenly as the pleasure finally burst up his bicep and spilled out onto his torso. He felt the corrugated growth as his upper arm and shoulder cracked and popped in protest as they swelled longer and wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang watched in delight as his swelling bicep and triceps pushed his t-shirt\u2019s sleeve further up his arm, only to have his swelling shoulders come up from behind the already taught fabric. The sleeve wedged in the grove between the wolf\u2019s bicep and shoulder and hung a moment before spontaneously splitting, the loud tear ripping several inches high and wide,  exposing a sliver of visibly expanding shoulder, the meat growing so rapidly that the wolf\u2019s tight shiny pelt seemed to be swimming across it. This was an image beyond Fangs wildest dreams and his deepest desires. Had he a freely standing erection, the sight, image and sound would have been enough to make him blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth spread across his head and to the tops of his ears. Eyes glazed and half closed, he simply stared into the distance as he focused on the feelings, letting them take him. His mouth hung open wide in a dopey grin, salivating freely as and his tongue lolled over the corner of his mouth. He whined pettily as the pleasure and growth crept up his neck, his vertebrate cracking and popping loudly in his hear as the growth enveloped the centre of his senses. He could feel his head creep slowly and unevenly higher as the base of his jaw suddenly expanded violently, dislocating itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should have been an excruciating experience, but Fang gasped in delight instead as his jaw shot a sharp feeling of sweet pleasure as his under bite flared out. His bottom teeth grew unevenly, tearing his gums into all sorts of unusual shapes. His tongue suddenly creped further out of his mouth as the growth spread through his mouth, saliva dripping more frequently as his glands were squeezed as he expanded.  The back of his top teeth were the next to grow, pressing up against each other and the gums that housed them as his jaw suddenly locked back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang looked down his dark muzzle as one side of it elongated, pushing his nose up and onto an awkward angle. His canines flared out of his mouth as his left eye swelled larger than the cavity that held it. Fang couldn\u2019t close it as it bulged out in bliss, leaving him to an uninterrupted view of his mangled muzzle as it corrected itself further away from his face than it had ever been before. One of his ears started to spasm as he heard his eardrum enlarge, the strange violent whistle of rushing air was the last thing he heard before he felt his skull move and he blacked out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was only for a few seconds, but by the time the growing wolf came back to his senses he was falling forwards. It took him several steps for his uneven mass to recover its balance. Fang stood straight as his ear came to rest, signalling the end of his growing in his head. He looked over his body and laughed. He had been too distracted to notice the growth had spread down his other arm, and the warmth had taken over his torso. He felt himself grow taller as the pleasure shot down his spine. He inched higher as his chest popped and crackled, the vibrations echoed deep as his chest cavity flared outward. It felt as if muscle was flowing into his pecs as they swelled larger than the wolf was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang could feel his shoulders pulling backwards as his lats thickened. Fang could see that his arms and frame were thicker than they had ever been before. His taught shirt rode up his seam, exposing a stomach whose trenches were deepening his abs hardened and puffed out. And still he grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat had spread down both his thighs and down one knee. It engulfed his already palmable testicles that were cramped in the underwear that already struggled to contain them. His expanding pelvis stretched his tight pants wider and lower as the top of his compressed sheath snapped out into to daylight, exposing the wolf\u2019s slight arousal as it too succumbed to theburning  heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elastic collar on Fang\u2019s shit was digging deep into his throat when he grasped at it with both hands, ripping it in half.  Talking advantage of this new weakness, the shirt tore itself open down to the bottom of the wolf\u2019s flared chest. Fang\u2019s torso was largely exposed, allowing him to admire the tail end of its growth  as his testicles came under increasing pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang\u2019s first instinct was to relieve his tender nads of their tightening constraints, but paused as realised that, like the rest of his \u2018pain\u2019, it was actually quite a pleasurable experience. So he stood and watched as his testicles dragged his pants further down and out while his lengthening thighs lifted the rest of him higher still. The experience filled his unrestrained cock, as inch after inch of the pink meat was elevated from its expanding enclosure, exposing itself to the morning air. The wolf\u2019s sheath stretched wider and retracted as the erection accelerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Fang was starting to tear at the pleasure of his testicles being squeezed like a vice, his underwear simply burst, sending his elongated testicles falling down one side of his tightening basketball shorts. Behind his heaving chest and engorging manhood, Fang could see the paws on his feet begin to spread out, the toes slowly buckeling as the wolf\u2019s enormous weight kept them  anchored to the ground. Fang splayed his stance in response, before leaning back and powerfully releasing a long, unnaturally loud and deep howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was over. The wolf stood shaking as he panted heavily. He looked over himself, at the bulging masses of perfect musculature that lay beneath his taught black coat. He was more ripped and buff than anyone he had ever seen in in one of those magazines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt heavy. Really heavy, like he was stone. But at the same time, he felt stronger than he ever had before. This combination of increased mass and strength made him feel truly powerful, a feeling far more vivid than that in his most lustful of dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween his legs jutted an erection surely too big to fit inside any mortal. At this point, Fang had lost his point of reference, but if it were to be held up against his chest, rather than jutting out from the mighty tendons that anchored it to his pubic bone, it would have reached his sternum. Two oversized testicles peeked from the bottom of his shorts that now rode tightly up his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looked around himself, and for the first time noticed ha had drawn a small if distant crowd. He smiled in response. He had no shame, in fact he was quite proud at what just happened. He was glad to share it with them.<br>\r\nFang looked at the path, the benches, the trees, the onlookers, the bins, and mentally measured himself against them. This morning he was excited by passing 8 feet. But right now, he would have to estimate he was pushing 9 if not outright conquering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his excitement turned to a greedy lust as he took all this in. More. He wanted more. More growth, more power, more pleasure.  But despite his desires, his body didn\u2019t respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigning, he simply returned his stare to his rock hard cock. He realised that if it were to happen again, he\u2019d just have to be patient. And if the hormones wore off, he knew where to go to get some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, he would just have to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The general rule of the gym was, no shirt, no entry. But one could forgive the fit-looking rabbit manning the entryway, as he saw the massive 9'+ Fang push open the doors, almost knocking them off their hinges. The wolf smirked at the look of astonishment on the rabbit's face as he made his way down to the weight room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle-bound wolf strode shamelessly into the room, his gigantic rod making an obscene gesture towards the few others working out early this weekend. He reveled in the heat he felt from their stares, imagining their intimidation, and perhaps even a little bit of fear. Out of three people in the room when he entered, one immediately fled while the other two hovered near the doorway, torn between fleeing the beast and entranced by the power he exuded with every footstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang, by virtue of his naturally large size, always made use of the weights designed for the larger, bulkier species such as dragons and rhinos. Today though, he was determined to top them all. He wanted to prove that he was the undisputed king of strength, and nothing was going to stop him from letting loose his inner beast on this pathetic gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to the largest bench. Picking up some 100 lb. rings (with hardly any effort, he gleefully noted), he racked as many as he could fit onto the 100 lb. bar, amounting to five on each side. the bar groaned with the half ton of weight, bending precariously near the ends (the weights would've slid off if not for the heavy-duty locks on the ends). With a quick stretch of his huge veiny arms, Fang slipped onto the bench, overhanging a little at the sides, and gripped the bar, clenching his teeth as he expected this to be a real test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar, weights and all, almost flew up out of his hands as he hoisted it up, once, twice....twenty, thirty...fifty times, before giving up out of boredom. He snarled at how pitiful of a workout that was for him. That hardly gave him a pump at all. Fang tried different workouts - forearms, standing biceps, behind the head tri's...hardly a workout fit for a muscled beast as supreme as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew bored with his workout options, maxing out on all the free weights. Fang took one of the smaller metal bars, and with considerable effort, bent the stainless steel into a loop. He took the loop and slipped it over his head, resting it on his tremendous traps and burgeoning pecs. He thought it made for a nice piece of jewelry, and evidence of the raw force he was capable of. The other furs finally lost their nerve and fled the room at this display of brute force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fang got a marvelous idea. He grabbed a bench and hauled it out of the gym into the parking lot, hardly noticing he set off an alarm. He set his sights on a lifted Ford pickup near the exit. Sliding the bench under the chassis, he relished the idea of a real workout. He lumbered into position, barely fitting under the truck. He snorted at how his pecs brushed the bottom of the truck, seemingly capable of lifting it on their own. Placing his paws apart on the chassis, Fang gave a mighty press upward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with great delight that he found significant resistance with this truck, coming in at perhaps three tons. The weight gave him a nice burn, but not enough to wear him out, it seemed. He marveled at his strength as he heaved up and down, the truck jostling with every flex and tap on the ground. As he passed twenty reps, his tongue lolled and his cock started to get hard again. This was real power, he thought! Fang muttered as he lifted. \"Fucking stud...I'm a beast...fuck yea....stronger, I need more muscle, more, more...I'll lift this truck one-handed...prove I'm a fucking monster...no one will ever fuck with these guns...\" His cock snapped the elastic of his shorts and stood tall and thick, leaking cups of pre onto his abs and balls, before pouring onto the ground like a faucet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim and drunk with power, Fang moved his hand into the center and pressed with all he could muster. The truck slowly climbed upward as he awkwardly moved into a standing position. He bared his fangs as he held the truck up over his head, one-handed, huffing from the effort and from the pressure within his leviathan cock. His muscled bulged with insane size, myriad webs of veins and sinew holding rock-solid slabs of meat together, every cut and curve plain as day. \"Fu....Fu...Fuck! Try and stop me now. Muscle, size, more....all of this is fucking mine!\" With his free hand, he began to stroke himself off, dollops of pre splashing out onto the asphalt like milky white paint. His eyes began to glaze over with lust, lost to the world around him but for his feat of strength and massive dick, an angry shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was close to cumming. Fang bet he could fuck himself through a cement wall if he wanted to, and the only thing capable of stroking him off right now was the strength of his own muscles. He was close, he could feel it...but he felt odd...something else also happened at the same time....</span></div></div>",

Similarly, he didn\u2019t recognise the burn as anything other than related to his exercise until it grew to an excruciating intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang snarled as the pain jolted down his arm, almost causing him to lose balance of the truck. Reflexively, he stopped masturbating, using the hand to grab at his pained bicep with a hiss. But as he started to put pressure on the pain, a switch seemed to flick. Although the intensity was the same, the pain felt different. It felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealisation hit the wolf with a quick burst of laughter. It was all the same feelings he had in the park. He was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see his upper arm grow thicker as it lengthened, the strained muscles bulging out further. He could feel his tricep expanding outwards faster than the skeleton underneath could handle. It took a concerted effort to stop his hand from straightening out and keeping the truck above him balanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation quickly crept up his wrist, causing his brachioradialis to flare outwards, his flexors gaining in definition as they pressed out against his pelt. Fang licked his lips as he watched new veins sprout up the thickening muscles like weeds. The truck above him started to inch higher as his forearm lengthened, the vehicle seeming to shrink in his hands as his fingers started popping in abrupt spurts of growth. His fingers strained as the buckled, the friction of the car keeping his thickening fingertips anchored as the hand grew beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang whined in approval as he felt the burn start to wash over his shoulder and chest, triggering his already hulking shoulder muscles to balloon further out. The expanding slabs of flesh seemed to suck more of the wolf\u2019s frame out as his chest began to broaden, his ribs loudly cracking as they distorted themselves. Fang murred as he saw his ripped pecs push further out, deepening the already cavernous valley they left down his sternum. He couldn\u2019t see it, but he could feel his lats grow thicker behind him, the sheets of muscle enveloping his back. And when he felt the burn skip again onto his spine, Fang could see the earth begin to lower as he started growing taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a booming chuckle as he started to rise further above the vehicles that filled the parking lot, lifting the truck in his hand higher as he did so. He felt the burn flow down his other hand at the same time it started to shoot up his neck. Fang could see his snout jut out further from his face as one by one his teeth popped further out of his expanding gums. He could feel his face contour into all sorts of unusual positions as his eye sockets expanded faster than his eyes and lids, but at no stage did it feel painful. Eventually, the growth evened out. There was a hissing noise in both ears as they expanded, the sounds of the world around him becoming muffled before his ears abruptly popped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis erect length quivered as the burn slowly worked its way down it. Fang bit his bottom lip as he watched even more of his pink flesh start to flow out of his sheath. His cock stretched further and further out as new flesh pressed against old, fresh veins adding to the expanding vascular network that serviced his shaft. Below his length, he could feel his balls grow heavier as they pressed against themselves and his thick thighs. Fang licked his lips again as he felt them inch lower, desperately fighting for space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was to become more desperate as the burn worked its way down his feet. The wolf\u2019s thighs swelled thicker as the muscles added more flesh faster than his femur. With a series of loud tears, the remnants of his once baggy pants fell from his body, leaving the wolf completely naked. He wagged his tail eagerly, the appendage growing heavier with each swing. Fang\u2019s increasing height seemed to accelerate as the burn flowed down his calves and ankle, the wolf\u2019s hock and paws thickening disproportionately to support the far greater weight that bore down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he felt his toes start to skate across the parking lot asphalt, the feeling of elevation finally subsided. The growth had once again passed, leaving a heaving ten and a half foot wolf in its wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was laughing manically. Picking the truck up over his head had been such a slow and careful process, but now it felt like nothing in his hand. He carelessly jerked the car up and down as if to accentuate the point to himself. Without even trying, he managed to get the car airborn, the wolf\u2019s flat grip proving unsuitable to cancel the momentum that had built on the way up.<br>\r\nHe started bouncing the truck on his hand in earnest as he stared up at it eagerly. The truck didn't look to be full size, but the wolf knew that it was only because he was so much bigger. He could tell that the physics were true, as his big black paw bashed and bent the steel every time it came crashing back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much as it amused him to begin with, he quickly grew tired. Sure, he could tell himself that he was big and strong, but he just didn\u2019t feel it. He may as well have been bouncing a beach ball for all the effort it took him. He didn\u2019t feel like he was playfully lifting three tons of steel. He could have stood there all day and not gotten tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a contemptuous sneer, fang looked around the car park, trying to get some inspiration form somewhere else. It was then that he noticed that he had attracted a small crowd, though the majority didn\u2019t dare to venture into the parking lot. There was one exception though. There\u2019s always an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone scrawny brown rabbit had braved the wolf, advancing carefully as he recorded the display on his cell phone. He froze as soon as the wolf had laid his golden eyes down on him, suddenly acutely aware that the four or five meters between them didn\u2019t seem as much as it did a moment earlier. Fang gave a wide, toothy smile. Not just because he realised that he was on camera, but because he loved the response he was able to elicit from the rabbit with a simple stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna put this shit on YouTube?\u201d the wolf asked cockily. The rabbit swallowed, but didn\u2019t elicit any other response. The answer would have been yes, had the wolf not sported the world\u2019s biggest erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang scowled at the rabbit. \u201cHey, I\u2019m fucking talking to you! What, are you tryin\u2019 to piss me off boy?!\u201d Fang snarled. With ridiculously little effort, the wolf took half a step backwards and lunged the truck forwards towards the onlooker. He had aimed to throw it just above the rabbit\u2019s head, but Fang had no sense of calibration with his new frame. Instead, he found himself laughing in disbelief as it sailed way over the rabbit and the row of parked cars behind him, eventually crashing into the side of the row after that with such force that it sent several nearby vehicles flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parking lot erupted in a deafening noise of crunching steel and shattering glass, with traces of skidding rubber peppered in for good measure. The sounds vehicles getting mangled was soon replaced by a chorus of car alarms. Fang laughed manically, unable to believe that he had so easily caused so much chaos. The fact that he had just completely destroyed the property of so many innocent students seemed completely lost on him. The world was his playground now, to do what he wanted with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he had regained his composure, he realised that the rabbit was gone. He growled in disappointment, there was still so much more he could have done in front of the camera. He liked the idea of his own personal documentary crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang struck a pose, arching his ten and a half foot body as he breathed in heavily. His length still ached for attention. He had left it alone in the park, and he had gotten so close just before he started growing again. There was almost nothing he would rather have done than attend to that unfinished need. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of his mind, fang was thinking about how he had grown. It had worked even better than he had imagined it could when he first signed up to that stupid trial. And even better, not only did the hormone seem to not be wearing out, it actually seemed to be ramping up. While the growth had hit him last night and again in the park without him having to do anything, he was convinced that he had induced this last spurt on his own accord. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould that be it possible? Could simply putting strain on his muscles cause him to feel that pressure that made him grow? If that was the case, then lifting weights, whatever they consisted of, would be the catalyst he needed to get even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang laughed as he decided what he would do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus Fletcher is an underappreciated athlete.  This 6\u20196\u201d tower of lean kangaroo muscle and raw kicking power plays for the local university football team along with one of the more \u201crevered\u201d players, Fang.  Even if \u201cthe kicker\u201d could have the chance to make a reputation for himself as a brute on the field \u2013 as Fang does constantly \u2013 Marcus would not ever have such a reputation.  Because although he can appreciate the sort of attitude that players like Fang bring to the game, Marcus much prefers to let his abilities speak for themselves, rather than add additional flourish by roughing up other players or showing off to the crowd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne could say that Marcus is an efficient player; he shows up for practices on time and puts in just as much work as everyone else, even if it might not be required for him to do so, as team kicker.  In addition to attending regular workouts and practices with his fellow teammates \u2013 and doing his routines with as little showboating as possible \u2013 he often plays pickup games of football with his teammates on the quad, where most of them take the chance to showoff in front of the small crowds of women \u2013 and some men \u2013 that gather to watch these muscular hulks play.  In these pick-up games Marcus feels even more out of place; he either is the designated punter for both sides or \u2013 if he\u2019s lucky \u2013 manages to masquerade as a decent wide receiver.  No matter which position he picks during these \u201cexhibition\u201d games, he\u2019ll often pick up the indistinct chattering of the ladies in the crowd with his tall ears.  Needless to say that more often then not he\u2019ll hear some of them asking who the kangaroo is, and why he\u2019s playing with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus we get to the real reason why Marcus isn\u2019t a showoff; there simply is no precedent or even a RIGHT for \u201cthe kicker\u201d to be acting like a brute.  Despite his high accuracy and impressive distance records \u2013 some which have come close to beating the Conference records \u2013 Marcus is simply expected to be perfect without getting any of the praise that comes with it.  A field goal is simply the disappointing consolation prize at the end of a failed drive, and - with this as his accepted role \u2013 Marcus will finish each and every kick to the best of his ability and say nothing more on it.  This third-year college player remembers a time when he tried to showoff and ham it up for the crowd \u2013 in his freshman year \u2013 but wouldn\u2019t get the satisfaction out of it like the more popular players.  Naturally, a bit of resentment has built up over the seasons while playing as \u201cthe kicker\u201d.  Though his fellow teammates and the coaches recognize his skill for what it is, the lack of crowd enthusiasm and praise from fans has deadened Marcus\u2019 flair for showboating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what has not been snuffed out is Marcus\u2019 enthusiasm for the game itself and for his teammate\u2019s successes.  In the locker room and on the side of the field Marcus is quick to acknowledge the feats of every teammate on the field, from the center to the wide receiver.  He\u2019s considered one of the most sociable and outgoing of the team, while not being a blatant showoff like some of the more \u201cstar\u201d players.  Because of this, he\u2019s made many friends on and off the team.  Even Fang \u2013 whose respect took a good one and a half seasons to earn \u2013 can see that Marcus has skill that, while being niche for the game, is admirable nonetheless, though that doesn\u2019t prevent the wolf from poking fun at Marcus from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite accepting his role in the university team there is still that spark of hope in Marcus that he might someday be recognized for his skills.  While he may not be the biggest or the fastest on the team, he knows that no one can best the strength of his legs or the finesse of his feet.  While he knows this may not be enough to show off with Marcus always as an eye and an ear out for a way for him to rise to the top\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a warm Saturday in spring. Marcus got up at 11 AM, messed around on his computer for a couple of hours, and did some research for a History essay that was due in two weeks. The season had been over for a month now, and the campus had just stopped talking about how close they had come to a conference championship -- they had lost in the semifinals and had to settle for a meaningless bowl game that was only shown on one of the lesser sports channels. Now basketball season was in full swing and everyone had moved on to talking about their changes. The playoffs were just starting, and it looked like they could make a pretty deep run this year. While the more important players of the football team were always going to be recognized no matter what time of year, the more obscure ones were just like any other college student now. And for a nice guy like Marcus, that meant he could be safely ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChances were that folks like Fang or his buddy David were already busy living it up. They were out downtown in a nearby city, or at the movies, or just starting the long string of parties that would stretch on long into the night. He just had a Brutus Buster marathon to look forward to and another Saturday night alone. The kangaroo sighed and tried very hard not to think about how boring that sounded. Maybe he could invite Justin over. The rabbit had an odd sense of humor and could be quiet to the point of annoyance, but he was good company. Maybe Jessica, too. She was loud, but anything but boring. Or maybe Chris or Rich? They were definitely weird, but they were better than being alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall marsupial was just about to pick up his phone when he heard a knock at the door. He flicked an ear and crossed the small dorm room to peek out at the hallway. He wasn't expecting any company. He smirked to himself and thought that maybe Justin was having the same reaction to the prospect of spending the night solo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no one there. All he could see was the door of his neighbor across the hall, Rich. He couldn't hear anyone walking away or anything, but someone had to have knocked. He opened the door and looked around. Then, just to make sure, up towards the ceiling. You could never be too sure that one of the guys hadn't hired a squirrel or something to be in on the prank. He saw and heard no one. As far as he could tell, he was completely alone in his dorm hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to shut the door when he noticed the box. It was a small one, about eight inches on each side, and it was wrapped with a ribbon. An envelope had been taped to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus couldn't help but grin. The gift was nice because it was so unexpected. He couldn't remember the last time someone had given him a present -- not even on his birthday. Around these parts, a night out to the local bar and double shots were the present of choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo picked it up and carried it over to his computer desk, leaving the door open. Sure, he was down to his boxers and a tank top, but he had seen people wear a lot less around here. He plucked a card out of the envelope and read the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Marcus -- I've been a big admirer of your work for a long time, stud, and I know it sucks not getting any recognition for it. So I thought this little present might help you our next season. Please enjoy. Love, Your Secret Admirer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his heart swell inside of his chest. He, the kicker for a minor college football team, had a secret admirer! Without giving it a second thought, he undid the ribbon and opened the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething leaped out from the box as if it were a jack-in-the-box. He was sprayed with some sort of powder that coated his face and ears, left a fine mist in the air around his head. He breathed out, coughed, but the powder felt like it was burrowing underneath his skin, singing his nostrils and throat as it coated them. The coughing got worse, and he fanned the air in front of his nose to prevent himself from breathing any more. It didn't seem to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it was getting hard to breathe. He kept coughing, and his throat spasmed too fast for him to catch his breath. He clutched the chair with one hand, leaned back on his tail, but he still couldn't keep his balance. The room spun. He thought he saw movement beyond his door; someone was coming. Someone would help him. He just needed to get to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus fell over before he took another step. He was unconscious before he hit the floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus woke up on the floor with a start. His eyes flew open and the first thing he saw was the blurred stucco of his dorm room ceiling. Then he was assaulted with the worst headache he's ever felt. It hit so hard and fast the kangaroo rolled up to sit and hold his head with a pathetic groan, his eyes squeezed shut against the pain. It didn't help. The ache rolled over him in waves, one awful throb after another, the feeling so intense it made his stomach roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, his stomach was empty enough to be painful. With every lurch it gave he could feel it gnawing away at itself, demanding to be fed. Marcus was confused. What had just happened? He had dinner a little under an hour ago. He shouldn't be this hungry already, like he hadn't eaten anything in days. Was this one of the side effects of...whatever he ingested? His head pounded hard enough that he almost gave up on the thought. He...had been dosed with something. There was some sort of powder that sprung out of a box, and knocked him out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked towards the desk. The box was gone. The powder residue was gone too, as if someone had wiped down his computer desk and vacuumed the fabric of the chair and the carpet around it. Someone had been inside his dorm room while he was unconscious and covered their tracks. It was...it was disturbing, is what it was. Marcus had been nothing short of attacked, and his safety was seriously in question. He should probably call the campus police right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach lurched again, as if it were going to leap right out of his throat and start looking for food on its own. Marcus glanced at the clock and saw that the campus cafeteria would be open for another fifteen minutes. If he hurried, he could make it. He'd get some food and then he'd go to the police to report what had happened to him. But first, he needed to do something about that damned headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed two ibuprofen, downed it with a large swallow of some flat soda he found underneath his bed, then bounded for the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headache mercifully eased on the way. He was able to notice other things at this point, like how his shorts rode up his heavy legs a little more than usual, and how his shirt felt snug around his torso. He didn't think too much of it, of course. His head was just beginning to clear, and he was still quite rattled by everything that had happened to him. Who would have done this to him? And why? Was he starting to fall ill, or did he have some kind of condition that could be contagious? Normally he wouldn't risk being around other people right now; he'd go immediately to the nurse or the police. But the hunger twisting his gut was so demanding he could barely think about anything other than food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe practically ran through the doors of the cafeteria and bustled his way through the line. Marcus loaded up on pasta with red sauce, bread, beans and rice, and a few desserts. He caught Justin and Rich sitting at a table and joined them with a grunt. He barely heard them as he quickly and methodically made his way through everything on the plate. He barely saw the strange look they gave him as he walked right back to the serving line and got a second helping. His tray creaked under the weight of his food, and he ate it nearly as quickly as the first plate. When he got up to grab his third plate, Rich's hand shot out to grab his arm. The raccoon's touch was light, and almost cool against the exposed fur of the kangaroo's forearm. That was enough to bring him out of his food-induced haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on with you, Marcus? You've barely said two words to us since you've been here, and you're gorging on way too much food. You're burning up, too!\" Rich looked up at the tall kangaroo, who blinked back down at him. Was the raccoon always this short?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I? I'm...sorry. It's just, something really weird happened to me and...I'm not sure what's going on.\" Suddenly, with the pounds of food he's just eaten sitting heavily in his stomach, he felt heavy and slow. His clothes were pressing into his fur and body now, and every time he moved it felt like they were bunching more uncomfortably. \"I just need to eat a little more, and then I need to...head to the police office I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuffled off to the food line again and returned with another plate of food. This time, both Justin and Rich were there at the table watching him intently. This time, the rabbit spoke up as Marcus began eating. \"Listen, dude, you need to tell us what's going on. You're really freaking us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus told them about the package between bites of his food, and just how weird it was that someone went through the trouble to remove the evidence. The kangaroo noticed the faces of the raccoon and rabbit grow more and more solemn as he recounted his experience. When he finished, he looked down at his plate and realized that it was empty. For a moment, he stared at the food line. It was technically closed, but the workers liked to wait until everyone was out of the cafeteria before pulling stuff away. Should he go back and get another plate? He found himself having trouble making the decision. His mind was stuffed with cotton or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...Marcus...?\" Rich sounded disturbed, almost panicked. \"You're...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What?\" Marcus said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, look!\" Rich stammered, pointing at Marcus' sleeves. The kangaroo always hated that he had to wear XXXL shirts, his torso was just too damn long to have slimmer fitting clothes that he wanted to wear, the woes of being a tall guy. Not to mention those shirts never looked flattering on him, the shirts designed to fit modern Americans; not the slim athletic guy Marcus was, and so he always wore shirts that were a little too billowy on him, never getting to show off his excellent swimmer's build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus used to take off his clothes and pose for himself in the mirror, wishing one day he could share off his hard earned physique with someone special, hell anyone at all! It was always Fang and David, the two huge guys on the team that filled their clothes to the brim. It wasn't fair. Those two got all the attention, sporting their musclebound physiques that bulged through their tight clothes while Marcus was left at the sideline, his strong but not as big build meant he didn't impress the girls as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the resentment didn't end there. It wasn't fair that he had to be the kicker. Hell, he was probably the best kicker the conference had seen in years. But Marcus didn't want to be just the kicker. He never told anyone, but he always believed he could've been a better quarterback than Fang. What could that asshole do that Marcus couldn't? Sure he wasn't as tall as Fang was, but he was definitely at the height to make some of the riskier passes down the middle. And for the kicker, Marcus took special pride in working his upper body in conjunction with his lower. Sure he couldn't throw as far, but who could run halfway down the field to catch one of Fang's longest throws anyways? David couldn't keep the defencemen off of Fang long enough for someone to get into that kind of position anyways. No, Marcus always knew Fang didn't belong in a position like that... He did. Marcus had the height, he had the skill, he had the speed. Fang was just an oversized brute who always got his way. That ass would always showboat in the kangaroo's face after a big game, telling him how he's 'just the kicker' and that the big wolf on campus makes all the plays before pushing out his chest and stretching the jersey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Just like Marcus' shirt was stretching out at the chest right now. Marcus' eyes widened at what he saw. That huge shirt meant to fit morbidly obese guys like Rick Bernard was being stretched out by the kangaroo. And it wasn't just at the chest, Marcus felt the arms bunching up and the sleeves. He looked down and gave it an experimental flex. The fabric groaned in protest, Marcus groaned in anticipation. He was getting bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus already towered over most of the team, big guys ranging from 6'-6'4'', only a select few ever reaching the coveted heights he, David and the colossal Fang had. But now? Now Marcus was getting bigger all over. He didn't feel a thing physically, but in his stomach, he was getting giddy. He could compete with them now. No, not now, but soon, just a little more growth, that's all he needed. He beckoned it, he wanted it oh so badly. More.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to will himself even larger, knowing full well that it probably wouldn't do anything. He felt his shorts becoming unreasonably tight around his burgeoning thighs. He always worked those the hardest in his workouts, and now definitely showed as they reached the size of his waist. Marcus realized that he wasn't just getting thicker, now the size of David, but he was getting taller too; he could see the bottom portion of his abs. He almost giggled with delight as he lifted up his shirt a bit to reveal a solid eight-pack awaiting him. He always wanted one, but could never get it no matter how hard he dieted and trained. Man... Marcus felt like the MAN now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know if he was done yet, but he felt something odd. That's when he realized Justin and Rich were gawking at him. He put on a big smile as he made eye contact with Justin, the rabbit biting his lower lip and looking away, as if he was ashamed he'd been staring at his buddy. Rich took a similar approach. There's something strange going on here, and it wasn't just Marcus' sudden growth. The kangaroo had a feeling these two know something he doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was about to say something to his friends when he heard a ripping sound. His shirt was splitting at the seams, his back much too wide as the kangaroo approached the size of a professional bodybuilder. Marcus was overjoyed, delighted with the latest development. He flexed his body all over, coaxing the shirt to just rip right off him. With a final flex, he finally managed to split it right down the back. Marcus' shirt was in tatters, but it didn't exactly fall off cleanly, bits of stringy fabric bunched at his shoulders, feeling almost like a tourniquet with how big his delts have become, and the majority of it still clung around his waist. With a small tug, Marcus ripped the bits and pieces of his shirt off, revelling in his strength to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't have long to admire his handiwork, his lower body was vying for his attention. His shorts had already began to split down the side, but because of the heavier fabric, Marcus felt like it wasn't going to rip as cleanly. And he was right. Instead of a tearing noise, a sharp rip rang through the air as Marcus' thunderous thighs burst through the fabric, revealing his enormous quads and hams. Marcus felt so damn good as he ripped off the remains of his shorts as well, the only shred of decency left were his undies and those didn't look too happy housing Marcus' thighs... or his bulge. Did everything about him get bigger?! Marcus looked at it and admired his basket; girls used to comment on how good he made them feel, all eight inches of lean kangaroo meat. But just how big was he now? Marcus was tempted to just whip it out and stroke it to see just how big he was where it counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was flabbergasted, Marcus was now a veritable giant. He swallowed dryly as his eyes moved over his friend. Marcus had always towered over him, but now that the kangaroo was even taller and practically twice as wide as he used to be, he completely swallowed the rabbit's view. Marcus just had to be 7' at least, maybe not quite at David's height, but could David match Marcus' new body? The kangaroo looked like a dead even match to Fang now. And Justin would never tell anyone, but he thought it was kind of cool that a herbivore like Marcus had gotten so big. It was what drew the rabbit to Marcus in the first place, how a guy like him could hang out with so many predator species and not feel out of place. In fact... Justin kind of felt out of place being close to Marcus now... Especially with the predatory look on the kangaroo's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Just? Think I'm big enough to compete with Fang now?\" the kangaroo boomed proudly. That's what Marcus was now, proud of his huge body. In fact... he kind of wanted even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Marcus, this isn't natural, we should- we should get you to the hospital,\" Justin stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, little dude, I feel fit as a fiddle,\" Marcus replied with a smirk. \"In fact, I think I feel better than ever! Must have been that powder or whatever it was.\" He looked at the way Justin squirmed and the way Rich just looked away at the last comment. If he was suspicious about these two knowing something about that powder before, he damned well knew they had something to do with it now. Marcus had a huge grin on, wondering what he should do to punish these guys for experimenting on him like that... or rather how he'd reward his newest fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus licked his lips and had his eyes trained on Justin, the rabbit adjusting himself awkwardly, trying to shrink away from the piercing, terrifying gaze Marcus was giving him. The big kangaroo brought an arm down and hoisted Justin right off the ground. Damn! Was he ever strong now! He could never do that before. And all that power and strength turned the kangaroo on a bit, his underwear plumping up a bit. He brought Justin up to his face and grinned evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin almost shrieked when Marcus brought his tongue and licked at his neck. Anthros never ate other anthros or humans, but due to Justin's prey ancestry, he couldn't help get a bit antsy when a huge guy like Marcus licks him, as if to taste him. And it was true, Marcus was tasting him. After all... Marcus had a big appetite now. He just devoured how many plates of food? And he knew that he could go for more. But not just in volume... he was cocky now, he could get riskier and riskier... and soon, no one could stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe,\" Marcus chuckled, his nose pressing into Justin's, the rabbit squeaking and shuddering with fear. Marcus was just so damn hungry, his appetite wasn't yet whet and Justin... poor Justin looked like the perfect meal for a growing guy like him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus cursed underneath his breath. Sometimes he hated being born this way. He was lean, he was mean - okay maybe not mean, but he was lean. Too lean to be like the bigger guys, like Fang or David. Shit, sometimes he found himself staring at their butts after practice, a little bit in admiration, a little bit in lust, but a whole lot in jealousy. Today, he almost got caught by David. Thank God, the dragon was as thick as a brick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had said, \"Hey, sup bud. You can use the shower in a sec, I'm almost done.\" That was a complete embarrassment. The kangaroo have never been so ashamed in his life. What if David had seen more? No one could ever know on the team, after what had happened to last guy that came out? Fang and the guys had a field day with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just Fang and the team. Last year, Marcus barely missed the mark for the Provost list. He wasn't naturally smart, he worked damned hard to get the marks. 'There goes my 4.0,' he had thought to himself. Everyone expected him to perform, he himself was no exception. His mom and dad told him it was okay, they were more than proud of him for excelling. But, why couldn't anyone else see his accomplishments?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure life wasn't looking to great for the over-achieving self-critical unappreciated roo, but he was going to fix it. The year had started rough for him, he screwed up a kick at the homecoming match, almost costing them a home game. Coach and Fang chewed his ass out for it, forcing him into more and more practice times. And that screwed with his studying. Someone lied when they said, 'oh, it get's easier after first year.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My arse,\" the kangaroo said out loud, kicking a pebble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why he was here. He wasn't going home, he was heading to the Medicine Science Building on campus. There was an ad for a drug trial. He had heard that it was supposed to boost concentration. He was nervous; he'd been clean his whole life - if he did this, would coach know? What would his parents think? But he needed it, he was falling behind on homework already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the steps, he looked up, admiring the architecture. He identified the building as part of the brutalist movement; commanding, stark, towering and honestly quite ugly. He didn't notice someone coming out of the door, the glass smacking into his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, I'm so sorry,\" came a feminine, but deep voice. Marcus stopped reeling from the pain in his mouth to see a giant t-rex girl standing in front of him - or perhaps, over him would be more proper - a worried expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no probs,\" he said, assuring her with a dorky grin. Marcus was no wallflower, he knew how to court a lady. \"Hey, Alli right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinosaur nodded and stood perplexed, a little flustered by the cute guy in front of her, before realization hit her. \"Hey, you're Marcus, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething gave the kangaroo the fuzzies. Someone outside the team knew his name? Somehow that made this big girl sort of more attractive than she already was. \"Yeah, long time no see. How've you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Allison replied. \"I'm working with Abby! Oh uh, Dr. Dresden, you know, the organic chem prof? She has me come down here to run NMR on her samples. Ugh, why can't they buy one for the chem building... Oh, sorry, I'm ranting, it's just, I mean you're doing research for a prof too, right? I don't get to meet many people I know working here.\" The dinosaur was looking at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry Alli, I would, but, football has me tied down,\" he replied softly, dreading if she'd probe further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis worst nightmare came true. \"So, why are you here, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, a drug trial,\" he replied. The kangaroo chuckled nervously, then cleared his throat. \"Um, sorry.\" Still, the girl looked away in embarrassment of asking too much. Marcus thought they'd make a good couple; a down to earth kind of girl, a down to earth - when he wasn't dreaming of illusions of grandeur - kind of guy. If only he had the confidence to ask her out... After all, who wants to date a nobody like him? Sure he made lots of friends, but he never took it further with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um... see you,\" Alli said shyly. \"You'll be at that awards banquet right, the one with the dean this Friday? I saw your name on a lot of the awards listed, you and this guy I know, Ryan, you guys swept up everything, congratulations. I got one in chem, so I guess if you're going... I, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was visibly blushing. Someone noticed him? \"Uh, thanks. I mean, I guess... yeah, uh...\" The two of them looked like two fish out of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two parted ways, not even trying to remedy the situation, both too embarrassed to speak anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo made his way inside, trying to shake the awkwardness of the encounter. When he arrived at the makeshift clinic inside, they asked some mundane questions, asked for his history, checked some of his vitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this... for a pill? He looked down at the single pill he had gotten in a dixie cup. Really? What a waste of time, how was this supposed to get him through the week? He stormed into the restroom by the exit of the building. In spite, he took the little blue pill and flushed his mouth with tap water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus stood in front of the mirror, watching, waiting. He didn't feel any more attentive. He sighed, he knew it was too good to be true. The kangaroo turned the tap back on and splashed his face with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when an intense pain churned in the pit of his stomach. The kangaroo wanted to scream, but nothing seemed to come out. He wanted to crumple to the floor, but his body stayed rigid. What the hell did he just do to himself? He realized that he couldn't see anything anymore, his vision gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was in for a surprise. When his vision returned he stared at himself in the mirror. But that definitely wasn't him. What returned his gaze was the largest kangaroo he'd ever seen. The brute had to be at least eight and a half feet tall, so large that he had to stoop as he stood, too tall to fit in the low ceiling building. But it wasn't just tall, it was wide too; muscles filling the roo's frame to the brim, fabric ripped off in all directions. This guy made Fang look like a shrimp. And that package; Marcus salivated when he stared at the thick length jutting out of the guy's torn boxers and remnants of jeans, the two plump testicles held within clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus tried to get a better look, bringing his gaze down. Only for his chin to hit his pecs. That kangaroo was him. He was huge! He brought one massive arm and flexed it front of his face. It only made him harder, the length bumping past his navel squirting a large load of his thick pre. Man, he was such a stud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he explored himself, flexing and rubbing down his own massive body, he noticed the door behind him swing open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck,\" he heard. The voice was familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus swung his titanic body around and grinned at the blue dragon. \"Oh, David, so nice of you to stop by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the big blue drake was sucking on Marcus' monolith of a cock as the kangaroo face-fucked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh, yeah!\" the studly kangaroo yelled. He was completely dominating this hunk. That's when the door opened again, a green t-rex girl's eyes opening wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David? M-Marcus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Alli, baby. C'mere,\" the giant kangaroo commanded. At his beck and call, the girl was suckling over his enormous testicles as David continued to service his cock. It wasn't long before he dumped his godly load into the dragon. \"Yeah, take it!\" Marcus loved fucking his bitch's mouth. And he still had one more to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus felt terrible. As he came to, the visions he had seemed to be a nightmare. He had forced David and Allison to suck him off. He wasn't like that. What part of that situation was sexy in the least bit? Two people barging one right after the fucking other? Heck, the kangaroo barely masturbated as it is. And he was fucking disgusting too. Who wants to be that big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat couldn't be what he wanted, right? But the wet stains in his jeans were an indicator that he may. This was so fucked up, he mused. The kangaroo was on the verge of tears when he heard his cell beeping. He groaned as he reached into his bag, pulling out his mobile, flipping it open and reading the message. The words turned his blood to ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Oh Marc. Did you enjoy your little fantasy? David Matthews and Allison Parker? Nice choices. Don't look now, but I think you're bigger.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus looked down. He was still clothed, but he could tell, he was bigger. All over. Not huge, but bigger, the swell of his biceps filled his sleeves all that much more, his chest pushing further than before, his crotch all that much tighter. He continued to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Done yet? That's twenty pounds Marc. I know you want more. Just do what I say, and you'll be Big Marcus. Just remember, it won't work if you don't do exactly what I command you, pumpkin. You're playing my game now, bitch. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus smacked his palatte and looked down. He should be spooked, shitting bricks that someone had watched him go through that. Hell, he should be shitting bricks knowing that someone was watching him at all! But, there was no denying it. He liked this... and he wanted more. He was hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe deciding to play along was a bad idea, Marcus just didn't realize how bad of an idea it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was this A? When does A strike next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the past few days, Marcus had been enjoying his new body. The new found strength he had was invigorating, he was kicking stronger than ever, getting compliments from nearly everyone on the team. Coach seemed to have back off a bit. Not only was football going well, but he felt confident about his academics as well, he was sharp and attentive in class, even the 8:30 ones. In short, Marcus was on the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one drawback he'd have to say was that with all his new blessings, came the increased horniness. Marcus wasn't one to masturbate, partially because he usually had no time, and partially he never felt particularly happy just beating off, scared of what fantasies he might have. But as of late, Marcus couldn't help but crank out a few wanks each night, splattering his jizz all over his laptop as he watched porn of all kinds; straight, gay, lesbians, even crazy shit that shouldn't be named. He just found everything appealing, but in particular, big girls and guys. He never really explored himself sexually, all he knew was that he liked the girls curvaceous like Alli and his guys built like David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of his latest session, he was watching one particularly large dragon dude fucking the brains out of positively huge wolf. He felt dirty when he replaced the images of the two porn stars with David and Fang in his head. But the taboo just drove him further. That's when a message popped up from his messenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Hey stud. Enjoying yourself?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus looked at the message. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Who is this?</span> he typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo's heart stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">So how's that porn cumming along?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Marcus blurted out. He was being watched again! He was glad his parents were out, he wasn't allowed to swear in the house. In a panic he shut the blinds and peered down the hall outside his room. Was A in his house? Another beep came from his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">You won't find me. I'm too smart.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Marcus said under his breath. How was this possible, was there a camera somewhere? Was his room bugged? He started turning over every little thing in his room, trying to find a mini camera, a mic, anything. His laptop rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Are you done yet? Let's play a game.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus bit his lip. He did want to grow bigger. But... what did A want? <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Okay, shoot.</span> he typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Hmm. That porn was quite hot wasn't it? Don't you think a big kangaroo would've been hotter than that wolf?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo gulped. Just where was A going with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Your parents are home.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Marcus' large ears picked up the front door opening, hearing his parents giggling as they entered. Oh, shit, he thought. Quickly he pulled on his underwear and jeans, throwing a top on quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo closed his browser, ending the movie of the dragon now cumming all over his wolf. There was a knock at the door before it swung open, his dad peeking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright, bud?\" his dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Marcus stammered. He leaned lack, trying to look relaxed. \"Everything's cool, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older kangaroo sniffed the air and cocked an eyebrow. He was no bloodhound but even he could smell Marcus' musky smell pervading the room. \"Marcus,\" he sighed. \"Get a boyfriend already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dad!\" the younger kangaroo shouted, a blush creeping up on his face. He came out to his parents as a bisexual, they were more than supportive of him, saying he can love whoever he wanted. He was lucky to have parents that were so understanding, yet cursed to have ones so forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older kangaroo just shrugged. \"Hey, means you can stay over at his place instead of stinkin' up our house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus groaned. He could hear his mother coming up the stairs. \"Derek, he's young. Let him have his fun.\" His mom popped her head into his room. \"Whew!\" she said, pinching her nose. \"No porn, young man! Not paying for internet so you can get your rocks off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that his mother smirked and closed the door. He could hear his parents making their way downstairs for their customary tea before bed. Marcus laid down on his bed. Why did his parents have to be so embarrassing? Before he could think further, he got another message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Well, wasn't that interesting? You're dad's right. You need a boyfriend. Tell you what, you tell them David Matthews, that hunky, studly, blue dragon's your man, and I'll give you a little 'boost.'</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo... Marcus was hungry for the growth, but he'd never tell his parents that. One, because he didn't really like David that way, or at least he hoped he didn't. Two, because he couldn't lie to his folks like that; they were... excitable folk. And three, every girl he's ever asked out had to come over for dinner. How was he going to accomplish that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided. He wouldn't play. He closed his laptop and laid back. He didn't need to be super big, this new body of his was plenty big enough. And with that he turned off his lights and drifted off into a light sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething roused Marcus from his sleep. He heard his room door closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Dad? That you?\" he said groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a gloved hand came up over his snout, a cloth held over his mouth and nose. As he began to lose consciousness, he saw the figure above him prick him with a needle of some sort, injecting some kind of liquid into his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' dream was tortured. He was a balloon, a disgusting blob of flab left sessile due to the enormity of his gut that spilled out. He tried to move, but his legs couldn't budge, the muscle lacking the strength to lift himself up. He could barely breathe, each breath ragged as he struggled just to supply his bod with enough oxygen just so he could take the next breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this dream, David was there, and so was Allison. The two of them were massaging his fat, occasionally bringing a piece of rich food to his hungry lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Marc,\" David purred. \"How did you get so big? You're so blubbery, I could just snuggle with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" said the dinosaur. The two of them, both huge scalies, looked small compared to Marcus' incredible size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to speak to them, but all he could do was whimper. This was just too gross. He was absolutely repulsed by what he had become. But they just kept feeling his flab, kept feeding him cake, pizza, and anything else made with butter, lard or grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Marcus felt horrible. He sat himself up and something instantly felt wrong. He felt so weak. Looking down, he realized his previous growth had been replaced with a new one. Gone were his swelling biceps, his bulging chest, even his crotch felt less adequate. It was all replaced by a light layer of pudge. His arms were weak, the fat rolling slightly as he shook his arm. He groaned as he looked at his chest, the start of manboobs evident. He lifted the band of his underwear and saw the sorry state of his genitals, they didn't shrink smaller than normal, but they were being swallowed up by the layer of fat on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his phone beeped. He got a text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">You shouldn't make me mad, Marc. Just look at what I can do to you. As you can see, I can do more than muscle. That's twenty pounds again, Marc. Though as you can tell, it's not exactly what you were looking for. Oh, by the way, check your desk.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unfit kangaroo made his way to his desk, two pills lay on top of it. His cell rang again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">This was a warning, Marc. I won't be so forgiving next time. Call this one a charity. Just don't disappoint me again. 'Cause one way or another, I'm going to make you huge. You're my bitch now. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus eyed the pills on his desk. If he took the pills, he'd probably get just as big as before. He could play this game, all he had to do was be obedient. But Marcus wasn't one to get played, he was a strong individual. If he took one pill, he'd be back to normal. He could put a stop to this madness. He could find out just who this A was and beat them at their own game. He picked up the pills and opened wide.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus took the one pill and swallowed it down hastily. He hesitated for a moment, staring at the second pill, white and unassuming, in his hand. He thought, rather dumbly, that it looked like an aspirin. He struggled for a moment; the muscle was tempting, and there was no denying to A or anyone that he savored being bigger and more muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no. The muscle wasn't worth being someone's science experiment. Marcus was resolute; he was his own person, no one should control him like this, and if he had his way, no one would ever control him like this. As he fought with himself over the decision, he began to feel sick, waves of nausea and stomach pain washing over him like a cold wave. Marcus dropped the second pill onto the floor, letting it bounce away into some lonely corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on the floor and slumped against the wall, the pudge making a awkward<i> thwack</i> as it slapped the plaster. Were those pills supposed to help him? He clutched his stomach as he began to feel dizzy. He tried his best to retain consciousness, but as he closed his eyes, he felt like he was sinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus woke up into a white abyss. He was scared, sweat drops of pure fear cascading down his brow. He looked down at himself; he was positively emaciated, nothing but loose bits of skin and gone where there was once strong muscle. He had no clothes on; his dick was a withered little thing, but that was the least of his worries. He tried to talk, to search his way through the white nothingness, but he felt so tired and weak. It hurt to walk, a brief gait felt left him as winded as a 100 m sprint.  He tried to shout. \"Help!\" His voice was weak and cracking, his throat sore, like he had been shouting all night. There was no response. Marcus began to panic, looking around wildly, for something, anything, that could help him. He sat down and huddled despairingly, a tear running down his face. It hurt to even cry. He hurt physically, and he felt alone and empty; if there is a hell, surely this must be it. He moaned and cried dried sobs until he drifted away into a mental oblivion; no thoughts or feelings, just emptiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus stirred awake, a dry tear on his cheek. He was back in his room. He was okay! With a start, he jerked himself from the floor and looked in the mirror at himself.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed a sigh of relief. He was back to his lean, old self. His muscles, toned if meager, stood firmly on his body where he dreamed there was nothing. He shuddered at the dream. As the chill began to recede, a second wave crashed over him as he heard his cell phone beeping. With some trepidation, he flipped open the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Marc, I thought we had a deal. Be a good boy and take the other pill. Now.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus grit his teeth as he responded back over the phone. \"No. Never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only just sent the message when another message arrived to his phone. The phone went off multiple times; it was not a short message. As Marcus scanned the messages, it appeared that their tone was much more alarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">I don't think you fully understand Marcus. That dream is only a taste of what I can do to you if you fail to do exactly as I tell you. I can change your body, play with your thoughts. What makes you think I won't turn you into skin and bones, or a fat slob? Or that I won't go after your parents, or Allison, or David? I could always just slip them a note from \"you\", and you won't like what I write Marcus. You may not wish to admit, but you are my bitch, sweetheart. If you love your family and friends, you will take that pill and tell your parents you're dating David Matthews. Oh, and let's be clear: this is your final warning Marcus. I have no qualms about hurting you or your family to suit my needs. -A </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus gulped. It was one thing to target him; he was the one who signed up for the drug test that started this whole mess. But to go after people that he had feelings for, that he cared about? Criminal. Cruel. He tosses his phone onto the bed forcefully. His mind was racing. Did he dare try and find A and end this as he was, or was he going to play A's game and take the other pill and confess a love he was unsure of?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus was sore after his workout. He had pushed harder, lifted heavier and fought longer than he ever had before thanks to the new mass he had put on. He had taken the other pill that morning, scrounging around on the floor like beggar would for a dime. Marcus wasn't about to be a 'good boy,' but he was a good person, he'd play along, if only to protect his family and friends. He'd find a way to get to A, but for now, he had to play the pawn in A's game. He sat down on a bench in the locker room and looked over his pumped physique. He liked it - a lot. The size he had, he loved showing off his new strength during the team's workout, a couple of the guys commenting at how beast he was going at it. But the cost...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face contorted into a grimace as he sat there, elbows on his knees as he stared off into space. He remembered the episode he witnessed as his body grew. He was huge like before, muscles everywhere. But there was no one with him. His gargantuan body was strapped to a machine, his powerful limbs somehow restrained as if on display for vivisection. The entire place was dark, except on him and the apparatus, a blaring white light beat down on him. His cock was stuck in a tube, the suction siphoning his dick as he was milked for his cum. He cried for help, moaning in his throes of orgasm as another light came on. A gigantic tub of gooey white liquid sloshed around, more of the slime being deposited as he came. He watched in horror as his titanic muscles spasmed again, another forceful orgasm ratcheting through him. Each orgasm could only fill the cylinder so much... and it wasn't even half-full by the time he began to cry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus snapped to when a hand landed on his shoulder. He looked up to see a blue paw resting on him. David had a worried look on his face. \"Hey, dude, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' heart stopped for a moment and looked around, there was nobody left in the locker room. Just how long was he out of it? \"Uh, yeah,\" he said hoarsely, clearing his throat. He remembered what A had said, he had to tell his parents he was 'dating' this guy. But he couldn't lie to them. If he was going to do this, he was going to it right... He gulped as he stood, his snout coming up to the top of David's swelling chest; the dragon seemed to just have finished his workout, extending it to get him really pumped. He kinda liked what he saw. The timing was perfect, he was here, David was here, they were alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, dude, you were a beast out there today,\" the dragon said as he grabbed a towel and started to make his way to the showers. \"Man, you look like you've been hitting it hard, how much've you gained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, twenty pounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit?\" the dragon stopped and turned around, his eyes going wide. \"Damn, good for you bro.\" Marcus grabbed a towel himself and followed David to the public shower, the dragon went to one stall and Marcus contemplated asking David right there and then. He always found it funny, David never closed the curtains when he showered, was he deliberately trying to show off? David draped his towel on the side of the stall and glanced at the kangaroo staring at him. \"Uh, dude? There's an empty stall right beside me, you don't have to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right,\" Marcus said embarrassed. What was he doing? He looked around, the place seemed empty enough, actually, it looked completely empty. He sighed and moved into the stall beside the dragon. David had already turned his shower on, a slight mist of hot steam rising from his stall. Marcus took his bottle of shampoo and began to lather up his fur. He could feel every crease, every crevice of his body and wondered what it'd be like to have even more. He looked at the wall separating them. He guessed, now was a good a time as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, Dave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was in the middle of humming a tune when he stopped and replied, \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wondering, what do you think of gays?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause. Marcus was worried that David would've connected the dots. \"Dude, a guy fucking another guy, that's so fucking wrong. Don't get me wrong, they can do it with whoever they want, but if one ever tries to touch me, I'd probably break their neck.\" The way the dragon was growling as he said it, it made Marcus cringe and his heart sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're friends, right, David?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Marc, why are you asking so many fucking questions? I'm trying to shower here,\" the drake grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't going to work. There was no chance for the kangaroo here. But he bit the bullet and tried anyways. \"David, will you go out with me?\" he blurted, shutting his eyes closed. There was a stunned silence as neither guy moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck?!\" came David's voice filled with rage. A loud bang on the divider came from his side. In a moment, the shower curtain was ripped open, a heaving drake standing at the exit. \"You a fag, Marcus?\" David rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, please, don't do anything stupid,\" Marcus said, holding his hands out defensively if the dragon were to attack. But then a spark of courage ignited within him. His stance changed, standing up straight and balling his fists. \"Yeah, so what if I am?\" he growled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake began to enter the stall, using his physical prowess to intimidate the kangaroo. The dragon brought one massive paw to Marcus' chest and pushed him into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, David?\" the kangaroo grunted, picking himself up off the wall. \"What's your problem?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those times... you've been checking me out, haven't you? Fuck, you thinking of trying to sneak a touch or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it doesn't work like that, David. I'm not a pervert,\" Marcus said, glaring back at the dragon with equal malice. \"'Sides, I'm not the one who leaves his fucking shower stall open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck you,\" the drake snarled, backing out pushing at the dividers as he left, rattling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus thought he saw a bit of a blush starting on the dragon's blue hide, but attributed it to the David just being angry. But David wasn't the only one who was mad. The kangaroo peered out of his stall to see the dragon walking out back into the locker area. \"Yo, where the fuck are you going, David? We're not done,\" Marcus yelled at the drake. He stormed up to the dragon and grabbed a hold of a blue shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you fucking touch me, Marc,\" the dragon snarled, not looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the kangaroo was persistent, he squeezed the shoulder and hissed, \"Don't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drake just tore Marcus' paw off. He turned around a punched the kangaroo square in the nose. Marcus was sent back reeling, falling on his ass as he hit the floor. The dragon had no words, but rumbled darkly as he turned around and left Marcus' view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for the kangaroo to gain his bearings. He solemnly finished his shower and cleaned away the blood that gushed out of his nose. He dried himself off slowly, all alone in the locker rooms now. He sat at a bench and sulked. He was all alone now, David was going to out him, he was ruined. He shouldn't have pressed further, but he was just so scared of what A was going to do to him, and more importantly his family. He stood up and banged his fist against his locker. \"Fuck!\" he screamed. That's when a familiar beep came from inside. He inputted his combination and rifled through his stuff, pulling up his mobile and flipped it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Marc, I didn't tell you to ask David out; I merely wanted you to tell your parents. But I have to admit, the theatrics were quite entertaining, so I'll let it slide.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus could feel his rage bubbling up. He roared into the emptiness, \"Where the fuck are you? I know you're here.\" He spun around trying to find any clue of someone watching him. He started to sob lightly. \"You think this is funny? Are you getting off on this? Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a response -  his phone went off again. He dived at his cell and glared at the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Fap fap fap. You know me so well, Marc. Actually, I have a great idea. Just for you, we'll do things your way for once; no need to thank me. We'll have your studly dragon around your arms before you know it. Check the back of your locker.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus pulled out his change of clothes from his locker to see a little pill sitting by its lonesome at the back in a corner. He pulled it out and examined it. It looked just like the others. His phone beeped and he looked down at his new message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">You're welcome. I know you'll put it to good use, wouldn't want an 'accident' to happen to daddy at work, now would we?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' father was a cop, just a regular constable. He gulped, just what was A planning to do to his dad? He knew he had to comply. His phone rang again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message read:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus revolted at the idea. \"Fuck you!\", he spat, tossing the pill across the locker room floor. Did he have feelings for David? Well, he never exactly explored the degree of his affections, but in short, yes. But he could never force himself onto the muscular blue drake. He would never put David into a position against his will, no matter how terrible the consequences were. The phone beeped with a new message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Pity, Marcus. People can be much easier to work with when you have leverage. But I'll acquiesce, rape is perhaps too much on your conscience. Open locker #12. Third from right.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus slowly walked over to locker 12, an unassuming locker that looked like all the others. He grasped the inset handle and found the door was unlocked. Opening the door carefully, he saw nothing but a single pill. He put his hand over his eyes in disbelief. The phone rang with another message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">You know what David wants? A big, strong partner. You know what to do Marc.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus shook his head. He spoke aloud, seemingly only to himself. \"I don't want to. Everyone will notice something. No one gets that big, that fast.\" The phone beeped again momentarily. The message was much darker than the previous two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">I don't care. Take that pill, or Mommy is going to walk into a house with a faulty furnace.</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bead of sweat ran down behind Marcus's ear. \"A\" must've known that Mrs. Fletcher was a realtor. A faulty furnace meant carbon monoxide poisoning. With extreme reluctance, Marcus picked up the pill, his hand trembling. He opened his mouth, and squeezed his eyes shut as he swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was almost immediate. He felt himself being whirled around as if on an amusement park ride. When he landed and opened his eyes, he was in an endless rolling field. The tall grass was a brilliant green, more vivid than any field he had ever seen, so bright it seemed to glow. The clear sky was a brilliant shade of blue, with the sun directly overhead. He stood up, Marcus looked absolutely massive, bulging from ever crevice and brimming with an intense strength. He also felt so much taller, although it was hard to tell without anything to get his bearings to. With some dim realization, Marcus looked and saw he was naked, erect, and big enough to make a porn star blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stud, been lookin' for you.\" He whipped around and spotted a stark naked blue drake, only up to his neck in size, but muscular and cut up regardless. Marcus was taken aback. \"D-D-David?\" His voice cracked, in fear, or shocked delight, he wasn't sure. He noticed David appeared to be as hard as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere you\", the dream David teased, swinging his hand behind the roo's head and pulling him in for a kiss. David's long tongue pressed against Marcus's lips, and where there was once nervousness melted away as Marcus responded back fully and passionately, playing his tongue over David's thin lips, his sharp teeth, and his tongue, which was playfully pushing back and driving Marcus wild. Marcus loved his firm hands over the drake's shapely body, as the hands on the back of his head and large trapezius muscles held him close. His cock was grinding against the scales of David's rock-hard abs, and the friction was quickly proving too much to bear. He groaned and breathed deep as he rapidly approached climax with the sexy dragon. He felt it, like a rocket taking off, he began to spew enormous wads of cum everywhere, and he panted into the drake's maw, lost in the feeling of his climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus awoke with a start. He was on the floor of the locker room slumped against the locker. But it was clear he had been doing far more than that. Huge streamers of semen lay on the floor in every which way, and someone could have been forgiven for thinking a water balloon full of jizz had fallen right where Marcus lay. It dripped down the lockers in milky globs, some as far as several feet away. Marcus looked around dumbstruck. He wasn't sure anyone had ever cum so hard in the history of the earth. When he came to looking at himself, the results were impressive, even under a coating of sticky fur. Abs like cobblestones pressed forth from underneath his fur. His Pecs were large and formidable, with two dark-colored nipples protruding from slabs of hard muscle. His arms were enormous, seemingly imbued with enough strength to out-press Fang on the bench. Hell, he looked like he might be able take over for Fang on the cover of those bodybuilding mags that the black wolf occasionally made appearances in. Marcus stood up, letting the still liquid strands of his essence roll off him and onto the floor. His legs looked like they could kick the ball across the whole damn football field, his calves bursting forth with curvaceous mounds of muscle. Marcus glanced at the locker; where the top once came to the tip of his nose, it was now just below with his chin; he had tacked on at least a couple inches, pushing 6'9\" at a low-ball guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, this was all incredibly hot, and Marcus would've loved to plop himself onto the floor and jack out another tanker-load right there; on the other, it was going to be hard to explain how he had tacked on three inches and nearly fifty pounds of muscle. He looked at his phone absently to check the time, but what he found was another message that must've arrived from A while he was tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Oh Marc, you're growing up. David will love it. I expect you to make him your boyfriend, one way or another, by midnight. But no telling him about our game, or some very bad things will happen. And amazing cumshot, stud, pornos would pay a fortune for a load like that.\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus grimaced. Glancing at his watch, he saw it was already eight o'clock. He quickly rinsed the dried cum off with a second quick shower and threw his clothes back on, a rugby shirt and dark jeans that were too tight for comfort, conforming to every part of his more muscular frame. At the very least, he felt energetic, as if an IV of caffeine had been hooked into him. He rushed outside an to his car, Officer Fletcher's police-auctioned four-door, the tired-looking sedan older than Marcus was. Thankfully, the car could accommodate a larger guy, and with a turn of the ignition, it lumbered off in the direction of David's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus had no trouble finding the home, he had been there plenty of times over the years for team parties and the like. He parked by the curb and jogged to the front door, ringing the bell and hoping he could at least talk to the drake, unsure of what he would actually say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard footsteps and bit his lower lip in anticipation. When the door opened, he started to speak, then realized there was no one in front of him. At least, til he looked down and saw a smaller, purple drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, hi Tyler, is David home?\", Marcus asked with a harried smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler blinked in confusion and stared at him a moment. \"Wait, Marcus Fletcher? You got big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus let out a breezy chuckle. \"Yeah, found a routine that really worked for me. Is David in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler smiled but shook his head. He had always liked the amiable roo, one of the nicest guys out of David's douchey coterie of friends and teammates. \"I'm afraid not Marcus, haven't seen him at all this evening. He might be hanging out with Jess, or you might find him at the campus library, I think he has an exam coming up. Sorry I don't know for sure. Hey, let me know what that routine is next time you're over, I'd like to get a little bigger myself.\" Marcus waved off the apology. \"Sure Ty, and thanks for the heads up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus waved goodbye and walked back towards his car. Jess was the crazy party girl that the football guys often had over at their parties. Nice, but not Marcus's type...although now that he thought about it, they did make out once while drunk. David wasn't there for that. Marcus didn't know where she lived, but he at least had her phone number. Or, he could drive back to campus and have a look in the library first to see if the blue drake was getting his academic game on. He glanced at his phone; no messages, but it was now 9 PM. Marcus was getting anxious; he still wasn't sure how he would win the drake over even if he did find him in his race against the clock.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus stepped out of his beaten-down car and began to walk towards the library. The tall building wasn't far, but even a short walk accentuated just how big he had become. People he passed by were staring at him; sometimes outwardly so. It gave Marcus a smug sense of satisfaction, knowing that he could draw a crowd just as easily as David or Fang now. Secretly, he wished to get even larger and completely overshadow the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stares didn't stop once he got inside the building. For some reason, it's instinct for people to look up every time they see someone come in - maybe it's the boredom, maybe it's hoping its someone they know to save them from the boredom; except, most of the time, you don't keep staring. And that's exactly what people were doing. Marcus knew he wanted more attention, but maybe this was too much. He couldn't help but blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Marcus?\" came a familiar voice. The kangaroo spun around to see Allison sitting at an open table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, hey, Alli,\" he said as casually as he could muster; he was hoping he wouldn't see anyone he knew other than David. \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay I guess. I'm just working here 'cause Jess has... a guy over,\" the dinosaur said shyly. \"You look different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' face flushed red. \"Uh, yeah, it was that drug trial thing. It didn't work like it was supposed to. I'm, uh, retaining water, they said it'll go down in a couple more days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo was praying that she'd buy it. No one retains water at this age, right? So she shouldn't be able to tell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" she replied. It was obvious to Marcus that the t-rex had her doubts. She looked down at her notes again and sighed, \"I didn't know it looked like that, you must feel awful, being bloated like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's not so bad, makes me look pretty buff, right?\" he tried to joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And tall,\" she added. Marcus' expression dropped; she wasn't buying it, she was just being polite and playing along. \"Anyways, I missed you at the dinner last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' ears flattened, he had completely forgotten about it. He tried to remember what he did that night; though he had his suspicions that he was masturbating furiously to porn, just as he had done all of last week since his transformation. \"Sorry, Alli, I completely forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it wasn't exactly fun anyways,\" the t-rex replied warmly. The big girl began to fidget with her hands a bit. \"So formal's coming up this year, huh? Are you going with anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus gulped, he knew where this was going. He shook his head reluctantly. This year's fall formal was a Sadie Hawkins dance; where the girls ask the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was wondering,\" she squeaked, \"If you'd like to go with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus had to admit, it took Allison a lot of guts to ask him out, especially since he knew she was the shy wallflower type, despite her great body. How could he say no? Not to mention, he did kind of like her back. A naughtier side of him wondered what it'd be like to bigger than this hot babe, imagining himself able to sweep her off her feet, literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli, I'd love to,\" he replied with a pretense of warmth. \"Yes, I'll go with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe t-rex girl curled up a bit, but she couldn't hide her excitement. She had just scored with a total hunk, he was the complete package; gentle, athletic and smart. \"Okay,\" she peeped, biting her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli, you said Jessica had a guy over... It wouldn't be Dave now would it?\" he asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison shook her head. \"She's with that big tiger guy, Kevin, tonight. She says it's 'cause he's easy.\" The t-rex's eyes went open and she covered her mouth. \"I wasn't supposed to say that.\" She stood up embarrassed and clawed at her papers and textbooks. \"I, uh, should get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus couldn't help but chuckle, picking up some of her stuff for her. \"So, I'll buy us some tickets then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked like she was about to have a heart attack; as if she realized that, yes, she was going to the dance with Marcus Fletcher. She nodded her head vigorously and stammered, \"Y-yeah.\" Before she turned to leave in a hurry, she added, \"David's by the cubicle's at the back; I saw him storm in. I don't think he's too happy with whatever he's come in here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Marcus said. Before he knew it, Allison was bolting for the entrance. He half-shouted, \"See you next week then?\" He never got a response, that girl could run fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone beeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Tsk tsk. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Fuck you.</span> he texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo made his way to the back of the library. David wasn't hard to spot. The bulging drake's frame was easily visible poking out of a single-person study space. Marcus quietly made his way over and sat in a chair beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't really notice Marcus come by, just snorting as he stared blankly into the textbook in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave?\" Marcus asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon closed his eyes, not looking at the kangaroo. \"Marcus.\" The drake looked away, trying to avoid looking at the guy he had just punched in the face earlier. \"I'm sorry, about those things I said,\" he started quietly. \"I didn't know you were-\" The drake paused as he turned to look Marcus in the eye. \"Holy shit, what the fuck!\" he blurted. \"How the fuck did you get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus had to think fast. David wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, anything would suffice. \"I, uh, I was like this before, you were just too busy looking at your own body to notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude, I fucking pushed you in the shower, you were definitely not this big,\" the dragon stated, almost angrily; he knew Marcus was lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus had made a mistake; sure David was stupid, but he wasn't blind. \"I- I've been taking some steroids lately. Trying to get bigger. This one I took leaves you a bit swollen after you use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does coach know?\" David asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please don't tell,\" the kangaroo whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I won't. I wasn't going to tell anyone about you being... you know,\" David said with a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus bit his lip. He needed David to be his boyfriend. He thought for a moment. He couldn't lie to his parents about a boyfriend... but he could lie to David about his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, it's just... The only reason I asked was because I told my parents I had a boyfriend. Y'know, to shut them up for a bit. But they kept asking me to bring him over for dinner. And I accidentally told them it was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?!\" David roared; more than just a couple of heads turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, alright? I fucked up,\" Marcus hissed through clenched teeth. \"I need your help, just pretend to be my boyfriend and I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the drake responded quickly and flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I do tons of favours for you, why can't you do this one thing for me?\" Marcus seethed. In reality, he knew David was acting normally; but he was just so desperate, knowing what 'A' was capable of. \"I'll help you study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grunted in annoyance. Marcus was probably one of the best students at the university and the drake was this close to flunking out, he's already on probation and at risk of losing his spot on the team. If there was anyone who could help him, it was Marcus. \"Fine, but only if you promise I'll pass all my courses,\" David grunted with resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus sighed, \"Deal... What are you taking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... One sec, let me check.\" The drake pulled out his laptop and flipped open the lid, typed his password in and waited for his desktop to greet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Marcus' and David's eyes went wide when it finally loaded; David hadn't closed his browser, the current page was on a porno, specifically it was the same porno Marcus had jacked off to earlier with the big dragon and wolf in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid instantly slammed the computer shut, and gathered his things without saying anything while he stood there darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" Marcus said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it, Marc. I'm not playing your game,\" the dragon snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" the kangaroo shouted. He looked around to see people staring. He didn't care anymore, he didn't have time; he needed this. He hissed menacingly, \"No, David. New deal. You pretend you're my boyfriend for my parents and I don't tell everyone you watch two dudes getting it off with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon just stormed out with his stuff without an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus sighed. He had lost the game, 'A' was going to crucify him, burn him at the stake. He wondered what was going to happen to him. That's when his phone went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">You and I are a lot alike, Marc; lying to both your friends like that. Don't worry, he'll be back. I'll make sure of it. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus didn't know what to think. David just blew up on him twice, plus he just called him a fag when he jacks off to guys too. 'A' was right, they were a lot alike. He almost had a bittersweet satisfaction knowing he could choose to let 'A' work their magic on David; to hurt him as much as David hurt him. He walks out the door of the library into the night. 10 o'clock. He only had 2 hours to get it right, but he didn't know if he wanted to anymore.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus held back for a moment, standing in front of the cubicle. He closed his eyes and cursed himself out for even thinking of blackmailing David; not a smooth move. But, considering A's twisted sense of getting things done, he knew he had to do something, because A was capable of far worse things than Marcus would ever do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran out the library door and scanned his surroundings. He thought he could make out the large profile of the big blue drake moving at a quick rate towards the main quad. Wasting no time, Marcus bolted after him, praying he wouldn't get clobbered in the face again if and when he caught up to David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were certainly more capable now, hauling ass faster than most of the linemen on the team. He almost ran over some poor chipmunk girl, knocking her books out of her hands as he blew past like a high-speed missile. He was catching up to the drake. \"David! Dave! Stop! Please!\". The drakes past quickened, now breaking out into a run himself. \"Go away Marcus!\", he yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus really had to fly now. With a speed that would impress an olympic sprinter, he chased after the blue drake. The distance was closing, with the drake's belongings slowing him down. Marcus realized he would never be able to get David to stop, so he needed to take him down. He was closing, the drake was trying to make distance. With a strained grunt, he lunged his massive arms out and threw his weight to one side as he latched onto David's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went down with a tremendous tumble, rolling on the neatly manicured grass. As they stopped, Marcus was able to maneuver himself on top of David, holding his arms at his sides. Had Marcus been at his original size, the muscular drake would've thrown him off with ease; but with the increased strength and weight, he was able to maintain some hold on the struggling David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid huffed and heaved in anger and frustration. \"Hngh! Urgh! Get the fuck off Marcus!\" Marcus looked at him, the drake moving his head and refusing to make eye contact with the large roo. \"Not until you hear me out David.\" The drake stopped struggling, his eyes meeting Marcus's, irate and perhaps somewhat fearful. They appeared watery, but Marcus couldn't tell whether that was from emotion or pain from the tackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sentences were fast, a verbal hemorrhage with every excuse he could work in. \"Dave, I've been sleeping with the guy who gave me the drugs to make me this big. My parents figured out that I was seeing someone and demanded that I bring him home and asked who he was and I said it was you because you were the first person I thought of. I can't bring A..Aidan home because my father would recognize him, Aidan's had run-ins with the law and my dad's a cop. I just need you to help me out and pretend to be my boyfriend for just a short time and please don't say no because Aidan apparently saw you walk out and texted me to say he would make you do it and he's a dangerous guy to cross so please just help me out and I should've never blackmailed you and I don't care if you hate me or not oh god I'm sorry I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared at Marcus, still processing the info overload. As it sinked in, his face turned to disbelief and fury. \"You got me mixed up with a drug dealer!\", he bellowed. \"What the fuck is wrong with you Marc! Are you out of your mind!\" Marcus turned and noticed a few people were watching the scene at a distance. Marcus crawled off David, and the drake lurched up and grabbed the roo's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus should've expected something like this, but the intensity of David's grip was still cutting off most of his windpipe. His beefier neck muscles were keeping him from being completely choked out. \"Uh! Da-vid! He'll hurt you! Erk!\" David loosened his grip. \"So you're telling me I have to help you, is that it? Otherwise this guy will take me out? Why would you do this to me Marcus! I thought we were friends!\", he hissed malevolently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus's voice was quivering. \"David, I'm so sorry, I'm so very very sorry! If I had known he would do this I would've never said your name! But he'll hurt you, he'll hurt my family, he'll hurt anyone to get his way. I'm trapped and I need your help!\" The last part had more truth to it than David knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid let go. Collectively, both Marcus and David took a deep breath. David looked at him, his tone stern, with hints of scorn in his voice. \"Marc...why would you do this to yourself? Were the steroids worth it man? This guy's controlling your life, and now you've got me in this. I'll help you out because I care about you and I want to get you out of this. And obviously, because now I need to protect my ass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus smiled, hope filling his voice. \"You will?! Oh David, I can't describe how grateful I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's expression, however, was one of dismay. \"I'm so disappointed in you right now Marcus. I thought you were a great guy with a good head on your shoulders. But, now that you've done this...I don't know what to think of you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roo visibly recoiled at the remark. His response was barely audible. \"I...I understand, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus stood up and held out a hand to David to help him up, but the blue drake pushed it away. He hardly looked at the shamed Marcus, whose eyes were shifted away. \"Four rules. Do not touch me, do not use your drugs in front of me, do not tell anyone about this, and do not talk about anything you saw at the library.\" David's voice was commanding, even a little menacing. Marcus gave a timid nod and a shy \"okay\" in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned to him. \"Let's go to your house now, introduce your parents to me real quick. Get that out of the way.\" Marcus gave another nod and they made the walk to Marcus's old barge of a car. David climbed in as Marcus unlocked the door, and the drive was silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived at the Fletcher household, Marcus unlocked the door and let himself and David in. As they entered the warm light of the hallway, Marcus peered into the living room, his parents dozing on the couch with a bowl of popcorn in front of them. It looked like tonight was a movie-at-home kind of night. It was kinda cute, the way his mother was snuggled against his father's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad? Mom? I just wanted to introduce David to you real quick before bringing him home.\" Marcus stood back a little ways, trying to play down his size. Mrs. Fletcher sat up with a start. \"Wha wha? Oh my goodness, uh, hello David,\" she stammered, trying to shake off her slumber. She nudged her husband in the stomach. \"Derek, wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Fletcher woke with a start. \"Oh, sorry, I must've dozed off.\" The lanky middle-aged kangaroo walked over to the drake, hand extended. \"David Matthews, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid but on a polite smile and shook his hand. \"Nice to see you, Officer Fletcher.\" The older roo brushed off the formality with a chuckle. \"Please, David, it's Officer Fletcher on the job, call me Derek on the outside.\" Mrs. Fletcher, a pretty doe with a few wrinkles, came in and gave David a hug. Her tone was as sweet as honey. \"David, it's so nice to meet you as Marcus's boyfriend. Derek and I were so happy when we found out you two were an item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave a stilted nod. \"Yeah, quite a surprise. Folks, I should be going, Marcus was helping me study for an exam I have coming up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Fletcher places her hands over her mouth. \"Oh, that's so sweet of Marc! He really is quite the academic, with his geology and mineralogy and geophysics stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Fletcher pat David on the arm. \"I assume you've been reciprocating. Can't help but notice how big he's been getting lately. Bigger than I was at his age, that's for sure.\" David shot a furtive glance at the roo, who looked away sheepishly. \"Yeah, he works hard in the gym. Really hard. Anyw-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Fletcher stopped him. \"David, Barb and I would love to have you over for dinner Saturday night. Are you free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid flashed a quick look over to Marcus, who was now looking quite nervous. \"Uh, yeah...seven sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Fletcher clasped her hands. \"Sounds wonderful dear! Can't wait! We'll let Marc take you home now, gotta get plenty of sleep for your exam!\" The Fletchers were effusively warm and pleasant as they waved goodbye from the doorway while Marcus and David climbed into the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus gave him a quick glance. \"Why did you say yes? Are you going to tell them?\" David responded without looking back. \"Have to make it believable, don't we?\" His tone was careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcus pulled in front of the house, David quickly gathered his things and slammed the door, not even looking back. As Marcus was about to drive off, his phone beeped. It was a message from A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Clever boy. It is now 11:47. I am pleased with the result. However, I am not pleased with the explanation. A little too close for comfort Marcus. Tell that story to anyone else and I'll make both you and David suffer. In the meanwhile, I look forward to Saturday night. I'll be watching. -A</span>             </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David sat awkwardly next to Marcus at the small dinner table. Mrs. Fletcher had prepared quite the feast. She apologized to David, for as almost religious herbivores, the Fletchers didn't indulge too often in meat. Still, she managed to pull off a roasted chicken, to which only David took to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was glad that David came at least halfway decent; a nice body-hugging shirt and tie, but wearing sneakers and jeans on the bottom. More than once, his mother would lean in and whisper to him, \"He's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Fletcher and David were in the middle of conversation about football when they stopped to look at Marcus. Marcus gave an embarrassed toothy smile and put some more salad on his mother's plate. The room went silent for a moment before his dad spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, David, when'd you and Marcus start seeing each other?\" Mr. Fletcher asked, using a knife to carve up more chicken for David. David waked his hands in refusal, but the older kangaroo put the meat on the plate regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, we...\" the drake started, giving a furtive look at his friend beside him. Marcus cocked an eyebrow to spur a response. \"Started... uh,... I caught him peeking at me in the showers, and we sort of hit it off from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' father roared with laughter and Mrs. Fletcher giggled as well. Marcus on the other hand wanted to shrivel up and die; that was the worst fib ever. To make it worse, it was close to the truth too. The young kangaroo tried to shrink in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek Fletcher wiped a tear away as he continued to chuckle. He looked at David and said, \"S'that so?\" He turned to Marcus, holding in his laughter. \"Never thought you'd be a peeper, Marc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' face was red. His mom put a hand on his to comfort him. \"It's okay, honey. So you got caught; it's not like your father didn't do it in his time,\" she said with a teeniest bit of spite at his father. He nodded and she continued in a falsely harsher tone. \"But just so you know, you're still not allowed to do that to your father and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus nudged his mom in the rib, to which she slapped at Marcus' arm playfully. Everyone at the table was smiling except for Marcus; this was a total embarrassment, as always. His dad was fighting back tears again as he giggled, his mom was smiling smugly at him and even David was chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the whole dinner, his parents revealed more and more things to Marcus' 'boyfriend'; how he sleeps in his undies, how he watches soaps on the television and changes the channel quickly when someone comes into the room, how he sings in the shower, to which his mother added that he does quite well with a Taylor Swift song, and things he thought he were complete secrets, like the little shoebox full of 'fun things' he kept underneath his bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus let out a sigh of relief as dinner was wrapped up with dessert, a simple preparation of fruit and ice cream. He was just glad that he didn't have to put up with any more embarrassing stories about him falling off his bicycle or not being able to climb down a tree. However, instead of thanking his parents for a nice dinner, the usual hugs and kisses goodbye and the 'it was so nice to meet you' and 'let Marcus drive you home,' David offered to help with the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Fletcher gratefully accepted the help. Marcus wanted to groan, but played along, piling up the plates and throwing the excess into the garbage before passing off the dishes to his mother and 'boyfriend.' David had rolled up his sleeves, revealing his impressive forearms. Marcus watched in horror as his mom leaned back and ogled David's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" he hissed through his teeth. His mother turned to him and gave him a wink. To make things worse, David noticed and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus went to his room; he couldn't take any more of this. What was David going to think of him now? Not only was he an addict being controlled by some 'A'idan, but his parents were complete freaks too. Marcus usually broke off with girls at this point; most thought his parents were cute, but for some reason he was usually too embarrassed to face them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sensitive ears picked up light footfalls coming up the stairs. In a moment, there was a light knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" he said flatly, staring at his ceiling as he lay on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother entered, closing the door behind her. \"Oh, Marc. I know me and your father can be a little embarrassing at times. But it's just for fun, you know that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus nodded slowly and sighed. \"Yeah, mom. I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down beside him, ruffled the fur on top his head and leaned down to kiss him on the forehead. \"I'm proud of you, Marcus. It must've taken a lot of guts for you two to hit it off with all those guys you tend to hang around with. I'm guessing neither of you have told your friends yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus shook his head and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Fletcher gave a small sigh. \"It'll come in time.\" She held out her paw and Marcus hesitantly grasped it, squeezing gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mom,\" he said hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" she said tenderly. She chuckled and her tone livened. \"Anyways, me and your father thought you and David could use some time alone together. So... we're going to head off to a late movie, maybe check into a motel or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus sat up and looked at his mother. \"No, mom, you don't have to, I was planning on just dropping David-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" she scowled. \"He's welcome here any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that can be later,\" he replied nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's too late, I've already taken your keys to the house and car,\" she stated proudly. She stood up and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Marcus got up and ran after his mom down the stairs. The two of them argued, both of the flustered by the time they were back in the living room where David and Mr. Fletcher were still engaged in a light conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, honey?\" Barbara Fletcher said sweetly, slightly out of breath from her shouting match with her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, Mrs. Fletcher?\" David replied, a look of confusion on his face as he looked past her and at Marcus mouthing, 'No.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to spend the night, David? Me and Derek are heading out for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" David gulped. Marcus was clearly trying to tell him to say no, but the endearing look on the kangaroo's mother... It was impossible to refuse her. \"Sure, I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was screaming in his mind. \"Whyyyy? What the fuck, David!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom grabbed her purse and pulled out a couple of square packages, handing them to her son discretely. \"Just in case,\" she whispered softly into his ear. Barbara and Derek made their way out the door, saying their goodbyes and a 'don't stay up too late.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he closed the door after them and waved as they backed out of the driveway, he turned around and glowered at the dragon sitting on the couch. \"What the fuck, David! Why'd you say yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled, obviously annoyed as well. \"How the fuck am I supposed to say no to your mom? Dude, just wait 'til they're gone and I'll go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned, Marcus dropped himself beside David on the couch. He stared forward at the black screen of the television. \"I'm sorry you had to see that,\" he said flatly and incredulously, still not believing all the dirty little secrets his parents had told David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, dude. Your parents are actually pretty cool,\" David said. It was hard to tell exactly, but it almost sounded as if David had a good time. \"If I brought a girl home, it'd be more an interrogation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus sighed before turning to look at the drake sitting beside him. \"Thanks, Dave. You don't know how much this means to me.\" Before he knew it, he had placed his hand on top of David's, touching him gently. The drake looked up for a moment, their eyes locking. Marcus felt himself leaning in, his lips getting closer to the dragon's. When he realized what he was doing, the kangaroo instantly retracted his paw, afraid of what David would do. \"Sorry,\" he apologized with a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's okay,\" the blue dragon responded, equally nervous. \"Um, I'm just gonna use your washroom for a sec before heading out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, sure, it's the second one on the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded and headed down the hall. Marcus laid back on the couch. What just happened? He felt woozy, like he had butterflies in his stomach. Did he and David just have a romantic moment? But that was impossible, this was supposed to be just for pretend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, groaning came from down the hall. To Marcus, it almost sounded as if David was in pain. He rushed to the bathroom to see that the door was closed, he fidgeted with the doorknob, only to find it was locked. He banged his open hand on the door and yelled, \"David? You okay in there?\" His only response was a pained howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone was beeping. He rushed to the mobile sitting on the coffee table in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Did you miss me? Look at you, Marc. Breaking David's first rule without my help. I'm so proud of you. I thought you could use some help with the second. Chickens these day; so full of hormones and chemicals, they're terrible for a dragon's health -  or are they? -A</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus ran to check the door one last tine; if it was still locked, he'd go get the crowbar. To his good fortune, the door was now unlocked. Marcus swung the door open and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was rapidly becoming a wheezing blob of fat. His clothes had burst, with rolls of fatty tissue rolling on his-once muscular frame, his arms and legs jiggling with extra mass, and worse yet, he was still growing. David had collapsed onto the floor in a rather pathetic waddle. Marcus realized the fat was closing on his windpipe; he might die without an antidote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heard a beep over David's pained breathing and pulled out his phone to find another message from A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Marc, there is a pill in the medicine cabinet in the ibuprofen bottle. I suggest you consume it, for only then will I tell you where the antidote for David is. Otherwise, David will expire within the next five minutes...if he doesn't collapse through the floor first, ha ha. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus roared at his phone. \"You sick bastard! Why him! I'm tired of your fucking game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no text response. Thinking fast, David opened the cabinet above the sink and saw a small ibuprofen bottle on the bottom shelf. Screwing off the cap, he found a solitary white pill. Without a second thought, he swallowed the pill, and his phone went off instantaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">I hope you've used syringes before, Marc. Look in the thermometer box. Inject it into his arm, directly into the vein. Better hurry!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus fumbled to grab the box and spill out a ready-to-use needled syringe. He was starting to breath heavily. He realized he was starting to trip. Biting his lip and holding back his distaste of piercing flesh, he pulled David's pudgy arm and scanned for a vein. He cursed, dragon veins were not easy to find underneath the scales. He though he could make out a few at the wrist, where the fat had pushed them close to the surface. With a prayer, he stabbed David's arm, the drake letting out a groan as Marcus injected the full contents of the syringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, things became too hazy to recall. Marcus wasn't even sure he had pulled the needle out before he closed his eyes to fight off the dizziness, and took a plunge into a darkness. He felt like he was being whisked down as if on a roller coaster. The feeling was not welcome, and he waited a moment before opening his eyes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus's eyes went wide with horror. He was back in the cum-harvester vision. He was laying face-up on a table. He could barely tilt his head down in the dark room, and absorb just how large and muscular he was. Eight and half feet? An even nine? And he was massive, his chest like two large hills separated by a deep crevasse. Marcus looked to his sides and saw that his despite his incredible strength, he was held firm to the table by multiple metal clasps as thick as a normal man's arm. Judging from the lack of movement at his feet, he assumed his legs were in the same predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was suddenly shocked into the full terror of his predicament when the tube came down from the ceiling as a large surgical light turned on overhead. He was erect, and enormous, and the tube slipped itself onto him, holding tight with with a pneumatic hiss. It began to suck at him, like the most powerful, and painful, blowjob ever to be administered. On an atavistic level, he realized he was eager for release, and he came momentarily, a quart-sized load spewing into the tube, which then sucked it away into a large steel and glass vat in the corner of the room. But the machine didn't stop. It kept violently sucking and stimulating his phallus, trying to draw as much seed as possible. Marcus realized he had no control over himself, no matter how much it hurt; he came by the minute, fresh loads being drawn away before they could even run down the side of his huge shaft. This wasn't enjoyable by a long shot; it was painful, and furthermore, the experience of being nothing more a cum factory was not pleasant. Marcus pleaded for someone to let him go, but to no avail. A tear began to run down the side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he shot up, the cold splash of consciousness reawakening his senses. The first thing he noticed was David, and he let out a sigh of relief that the dragon was back to his old well-built self. He was pressed against the wall in what appeared to be amazement. Marcus gave him a peculiar look before he looked down at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shreds of his clothes had bunched up at  his joints rather awkwardly, but otherwise they split down the seams, revealing fresh muscular development. His cock had actually pushed through the zipper teeth and stood erect, dripping with the remains of his last climax. He could see he had drenched the shower curtain with a spray of spunk, which continued down onto the ledge of the bathtub and a trail onto the floor. It wouldn't be completely impossible to clean, but it was like someone had thrown an open pint-sized milk bottle all over that half of the bathroom. With a nervous glance, he looked back at David, who was rightfully astonished. Words were failing him. \"Uh...uh...what just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus stood up, letting the cum wads plop onto the floor. He looked at his phone sitting on the edge of the sink. Another message from A had arrived a couple minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">What a hero. Do me a favor and let David know about us, it's unfair to keep him out of the loop at this point, and I think he'll be useful for my needs; but if you or him tell anyone else, little Tyler Matthews might be the victim of a robbery gone bad. Fap away, stud. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus contemplated for a moment, and texted back. <span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">\"But he's not a part of your drug test.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response reminded Marcus of a condescending teacher he once had. \"I have no interest in making him huge, only you. Don't pass your work off onto others Marcus.\" He glared at the screen before David interrupted his impure thoughts. He sounded rather indignant. \"Marcus, I think I have a right to know would like to know how I just became a fat blob. There's a lot more to this than steroids and Aidan, isn't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus noticed the syringe on the floor. \"Ar-Are you okay?\", he asked shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at himself. The elastic band of his boxer briefs was the only thing the failed to snap when he bloated out, and the fabric was stretched out, but it was enough to cover himself.  \"I feel fine, the syringe put me out and I woke up like this a minute ago, to catch your...uh, moment. I just feel a little sore, that's all. But I don't get how I turned into a giant fat ball and back again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus slumped against the wall again. \"There's no Aidan and no steroids, at least not exactly. I signed up for a drug trial and the person running it, who goes by \"A\", has decided to hold me hostage. A is determined to make me huge, that's how I keep getting bigger. \"A\" slips around, whatever he is, and he's everywhere David. He can turn you muscular, fat, skinny, and he says he can do worse if I don't follow his orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's anger grew. \"Well, I almost fucking died just now! A couple more minutes and I would've suffocated under a layer of fat. Call the police! Talk to your dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus brushed off David's advice. \"Dave, he threatens my family too, and friends, if I ever tell them what's going on. He only just gave me permission to fill you in. He's threatening to off your brother at the store if you tell anyone about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear in David's voice was palpable. \"Dude, he's out of his mind! He needs to be stopped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus looked away, remorseful that he ever involved David in this, forcibly or otherwise. \"I have no idea who \"A\" is, man. I've never even seen him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where did you first take a pill?\", David retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus thought back. It had been a couple of weeks since this started. \"The Medicine Science Building on campus. It was blue and I didn't gain height, only muscle. The one I had just now was white.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid extended a hand to help him up. \"We're going there. Now. They must have documentation somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus gave him a curious glance. \"David, it's Saturday night, the building's probably locked. My mom has my car keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's eyes narrowed. \"Now ask me if I give a shit, Marcus. You don't think the janitors have an unlocked door just in case? Besides, the longer we wait, the more that psycho can screw with us. I'm not putting my brother at risk because of some nutjob with a hard-on for big guys.\" Marcus shifted uncomfortably at the last comment. As David pulled him up, his eyes bulged at the roo's taller height. \"Holy cow, you're like 7 feet tall!\" Marcus gave him a frown. \"Another effect of the drugs. It makes it even harder to fit into clothes and keep this on the down-low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked down at himself. \"Uh, speaking of which, I need clothes, pronto. throw on some shorts, we're stopping my by house for fresh duds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus quickly threw on some basketball shorts that were now riding up his thighs. He tossed a similar pair to David. \"Sorry, it's all I got.\" David sighed as they were only slightly larger than the distended boxer briefs. Marcus stared for a moment before David crouched down to block his line of sight. \"Quit staring, Marcus.\" Oddly, the situation kept Marcus preoccupied, and he failed to really look over the nearly-naked David when they were in the bathroom. Marcus quietly cursed himself for not paying more attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus blushed profusely as they began to walk towards David's house. Seven minute drive, now a thirty-minute walk. And another thirty to campus. Marcus sighed. This would be a long night. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus clutched his own arm as he followed behind David on the dimly lit sidewalks of the suburbs; their path illuminated with the artificial light of flickering streetlights. He felt the new mass in his arms; felt the difficulty of moving even just one of his massive arms over his new chest. He and David weren\u2019t wearing shirts, going topless in the night air, a cool autumn breeze rustling through his fur. He tried his hardest not to stare and David\u2019s rippling back, or even worse, that nice butt that even his mom couldn\u2019t resist peeking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew David didn\u2019t like him ogling him, but it was just so hard to resist. Marcus bit his lower lip as he felt his dick start to tent his shorts. He prayed David wouldn\u2019t turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they turned the corner, Marcus\u2019 phone beeped, but not just his, David\u2019s cell went off at the same time. David spun around holding his phone in hand, both of them eying each other nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus started reading aloud, \u201cTwo bitches, trying to find the bad guy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Why don\u2019t you play with the big bad wolf instead? \u2013A,\u201d David finished. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t like it. Maybe we should just turn-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, fuck it, Marc. We\u2019re finishing this. Not putting my brother at risk \u2018cause you wanna get jacked,\u201d the dragon snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! You think I want this shit, Dave?\u201d Marcus spat back. \u201cYou think I like \u2018A\u2019 threatening my family and friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid snorted. \u201cYeah? Don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be friends after this, asshole. I\u2019m through with you. Sooner we get to \u2018A,\u2019 sooner I don\u2019t have to talk to you ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus could feel his heart sink and his rage boil. \u201cYeah? Same,\u201d the kangaroo replied staunchly, when really he could never feel more vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a rather large figure came out of the backseat of a rather large parked car in front of them. It took a couple moments for Marcus to realize it was Fang from the football team, the black fur sleek in lamplight. The hulking wolf bent down, peeking his head back into the car, his hands on the frame of the car stabilizing him as he giggled and smacked his lips with someone inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the wolf lifted his head out, he was surprised to see two topless jocks staring at him incredulously. He smirked, recognizing them as his buds from the team. A slim rabbit girl came out the other end of the car, her hair all tussled, her short skirt bunched up leaving her underwear visible in places. She adjusts herself and came up to Fang\u2019s side, the wolf bending down as she leaned up to give him a peck on the cheek. \u201cGoodbye, beau,\u201d she said with a thick accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus gulped when the rabbit turned to leave but stopped to take a look at the dragon and kangaroo standing there. She flashed the boys a suggestive smile and began to walk towards the driveway of what must have been her place. Marcus\u2019 mouth was dry from looking at such a beautiful creature. But to his greater surprise, a second girl emerged from the car, just as radiant as the first. Fang squeezed her ass as she walked past him, eliciting a shocked gasp and a playful slap at his hand, the girl giggling as she raced up to what looked like her twin sister, a rapid fire conversation of French ensuing as they entered their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus didn\u2019t have to look at David\u2019s crotch to know the dragon was tenting his shorts, heck Marcus knew he was tenting his from the sight. The wolf looked at the two and rolled his eyes. \u201cSup, dudes. Just bringing my latest kill home,\u201d he said smoothly, flashing them a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, the\u2026\u201d Marcus said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026exchange twins,\u201d David finished, equally baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang chuckled at their slack jaws and obvious boners. Of course they\u2019d be awestruck. \u201cI\u2019m the biggest stud in town, boys. Course I\u2019d get the twins,\u201d he said arrogantly as he bounced his enormous chest, admiring himself through his skin-tight clothes. It took him a bit of effort to stop and look at his buds. He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cSo what are you two doing here\u2026 without shirts on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was the first to snap out of his daze. \u201cUh, David here\u2019s been training me, helping me bulk up. We\u2019re just going for a quick jog,\u201d he pulled out of his ass. \u201cI, uh, help him with homework and stuff in exchange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned his gaze to the dragon. David shook his head to get himself back into reality. \u201cUh, yeah, just going for a jog,\u201d he said distantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWhatever, dudes.\u201d The wolf almost turned to open the driver\u2019s seat door when he did a double take. \u201cHoly fuck! Marc?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Marcus said nervously. \u201cTold you, been bulking up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck!\u201d the wolf exclaimed, standing back up to get a better look. \u201cYou\u2019re huge, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang was about to say something when a beeping sound came from the wolf\u2019s pocket. \u201cSorry, \u2018cuse me for a sec.\u201d He unlocked his phone and his brow furrowed. He tapped the screen. Marcus guessed he opened a video from the shifting colours of the faint glow on the wolf\u2019s face from the screen. His heart froze when he heard the audio coming from the phone\u2019s speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Dave, you don\u2019t know how much this means to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video seemed to cut off abruptly. Marcus knew what they were doing at that moment; he knew Fang would take it the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, you two kissed each other?\u201d the wolf snarled. \u201cYou guys fags for each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d David barked sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what the fuck was this?\u201d Fang snapped back, replaying the video for David; the dragon\u2019s eyes going wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-we were just studying,\u201d Marcus tried to lie stoically, coming off as wimpish instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, Fang, I didn\u2019t even know he was leaning in like that, I swear,\u201d the drake said defensively. Marcus shot David an angry stare. What was David doing? Was the dragon trying to cover his ass? At his expense?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDave, are you fucking stupid?\" Fang paused for a moment to look at the kangaroo, then back at the drake. \"No wait, you are. Dude, this guy\u2019s trying to suck your dick,\u201d the wolf snarled. He cracked his knuckles and leered maliciously at the roo. \u201cHold him. He wants to fuck boys? I say we fuck him up first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Marcus\u2019 horror, the dragon walked behind him and grabbed at his arms. He squirmed, but the dragon still had the size and strength advantage over him. \u201cDave, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it, fag,\u201d the drake hissed into the kangaroo\u2019s ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was left with bruises all over his face and a bloody nose as he watched David and Fang climb into the wolf\u2019s car as they sped off. They had dropped him off at the park, face-down in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never felt so betrayed in his life; for David to fucking turn on him like that. In a mix of sadness and rage, tears began to stream down his face. He was ruined; David said he wouldn\u2019t tell and he didn\u2019t. But \u2018A\u2019 did. His grit his teeth as his fury built; he didn\u2019t know who he wanted to kill first: \u2018A\u2019 or David. If he ever saw that asshole again, he\u2019d\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat up and wiped the tears away, he noticed his phone flashing. He flipped it open to read a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">I don't need chemicals to destroy you. Dirt'll do just fine. You'll never find me, Marc. Keep trying and I'll tell daddy about that needle in your bathroom. His perfect son, a juicehead. Be a good boy and play along from now on. \u2013A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus threw his phone on the grass as hard as he could; he couldn\u2019t even get the satisfaction of destroying his phone, the soft grass and topsoil absorbing the impact. He sat there in the dark for some moments, occasionally wiping the blood away from his muzzle and the tears away from his eyes; feeling sorry for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of his eye, he could see a figure approaching. He instantly recognized it was David; the traitor. The drake had changed into some clothes and it seemed he an extra set in his hands. Marcus turned his head away; he didn't want to see David - not after what the dragon's done to him and definitely not looking like the way he was right now. He felt a pair of strong hands lifting him up, or more accurately, hoisting him up. The drake spun him around.</span></div></div>",

Put the clothes on so we can head over to campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus seethed with anger. \"Why, so you and Fang can beat up the fag again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed and set Marcus down on the grass. He had to admit that that was not a proud moment. \"I did what I had to do Marcus. Otherwise, he'd have beaten both of us up. Besides, I'm not gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus snorted, a fresh rivulet of blood coming out of his nose. \"How long are you going to keep telling yourself that, David? Do you chant that while you jack off to two guys fucking to each other on your computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned around, fist readied. \"I told you never to bring that up. Or did Fang's fists knock your brains out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus but his meaty hands on top of his head. \"Go ahead, beat the shit out of me, if you think that'll chase the gay out of you. At least you don't have to look forward to Fang telling everybody on the team how much of a queer you are. Woo hoo,\" he finished sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood menacingly over the battered roo. \"I didn't ask to be a part of this Marcus. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus interjected. \"Oh, and I did? Let me tell you something, asshole. I didn't want to approach you. \"A\" pretty much forced me to. You didn't think I had half an idea how'd you react? I see you on campus, laughing at smaller guys and calling them 'little homos'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled. \"I'm not the one who started this. I didn't take a magic steroid and end up as some wacko's puppet. I helped you out. I didn't say anything to your parents. How they think you could put on 40 or 50 pounds of muscle in just a couple weeks is beyond me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus spat a bit of congealing blood onto the ground. \"Yeah, you helped me out alright. Thanks for pinning my arms back while Fang beat the shit out of me. How fucking sweet of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid roared at Marcus's face \"You dragged me into this! My family is in danger because of you! Fuck you Marcus!\", The muscular kangaroo didn't even flinch, his anger had made him defiant. \"Put the fucking clothes on Marcus, NOW. This isn't about you anymore, this is about people \"A\" will hurt if we don't stop him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus gave David a dark look as he made a motion towards the clothes. The streetlights played off his muscles, making him look even bigger and more menacing in the sodium yellow light. \"It was a mistake. Liking you, friend or otherwise, it was a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid muttered a cruel response under his breath as the roo fought to slide the clothes on his body. The big blue dragon didn't have much that would fit Marcus, so he brought a grey A-shirt and a beat up pair of khaki cargo shorts, leftovers from his high school days when he was a bit shorter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid smirked as Marcus straightened himself out. The blue drake's eyes wandered across the imposing image as he rubbed the dried blood from his face. He was hot, his arms and traps stood out impressively, the shirt contoured the curves of his large pecs, and even fit snugly around those great ab...\"no, David snap out of it, you're not gay,\" he mumbled. He shook away his impure thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid restored a cold composure and his eyes met the roo's with contempt. \"I'm parked around the corner. Borrowed Tyler's truck. We'll drive over to campus now. Bleeding's stopped, right? I can't get anything on his seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus snarled an emphatic \"fuck you\" before David turned away in the direction of the truck. He knew Marcus was following because of the footfalls of the large roo. Kangaroos always had large feet, it helped to make them great kickers and jumpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid unlocked the doors as Marcus silently joined him on the passenger side. David could feel the hate, like waves propagating in the air. He turned the ignition and turned the truck onto the road in the direction of campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drove along, he quickly glanced at the roo under the light of the street lamps, a quick image before passing the light and reducing the image to a dark visage. The roo was staring straight ahead, seemingly emotionless. David turned back to the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt bad about what he did. There was no way to conceal that. What he did was wrong, and it's a good thing a police car hadn't passed by, or he'd have been arrested...and that was before they found out it was Officer Fletcher's son he and Fang were attacking. Would've gotten him kicked off the team for sure. But the roo asked for it, right? Coming onto him and putting him in a situation where his life, his brother's life, were in danger? Marcus was just a horny queer with a growth fetish, and a drug user. That's right, a filthy little homo. David tried to reason himself with that line, but another part deep down was crying foul. Just because he watched two guys doing...things, didn't make him gay, right? He'd never make a move on a guy. Only gays actually sleep with guys. He would only sleep with women, and that made him straight? Right? Ri-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he snapped back to reality as he slammed on the brakes. He had almost rear-ended a car at a stoplight, a newer-model coupe. The brakes screeched as he came within inches of the bumper. The driver of the car, a 20-something otter, actually opened the door and looked to see what had happened. David facepalmed as Marcus snarled from the passenger seat. \"Are you trying to get us killed?\" David glowered in response as he waved away the otter with a breezy non-verbal apology. For the rest of the drive, he focused his attention on the road, careful to avoid thinking too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pulled the truck into a lot next to the Medical Science Building. He vaguely remembered having a class here, when he was still trying to figure out what he wanted as a major. It was an anatomy course, and his only take-aways were a \"C\" and a few decent fucks from the vixen who sat on his left. He lingered on the memory of her great anatomy for a moment, until Marcus slammed the door and shook him from his erotic memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brutalist monstrosity was almost completely dark, save for hallway and a couple of lab lights, probably some poor doctoral student experiencing a work crunch. As Marcus had suggested earlier, the front door was locked. However, David remembered there were three entrances, one on the side and one on the back loading area. As me motioned for Marcus to follow, he tried the side door: no luck. He then tried the loading dock door, which to his delight, was unlocked. He and Marcus made their way into the empty building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus glanced at a directory near the elevators. \"I took the pill on the third floor.\" His tone was less angry and more...dejected, David noted. He felt another pang of guilt radiate through his stomach. The two, seeking to avoid attention, used a nearby staircase, and quietly inched through the metal door leading into a overly sterile lobby area on the third floor. Marcus saw the receptionist's area - maybe the records would be there? He jumped over the desk effortless and starting thumbing through the file cabinets, while David kept watch in the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, what are you doing here? How'd you get in?\" David whirled around and found himself being interrogated by a 30-something lioness in a white lab coat, the stereotype of a scientist if there ever was one. Beyond that, she was slim, with an attractive face, and long brown locks of headfur, dyed brown. David awkwardly made the conclusion she'd be great MILF material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I left my notes here. I had an anatomy class earlier.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness stalked closer. \"Classes aren't taught on this floor.\" He glanced at her name-tag: \"DR. ABIGAIL DRESDEN\". His mind was a blank, his well of excuses had run dry. He knew Marcus was hardly thirty feet away looking at files; maybe he ducked under the desk when he heard her? The lioness pulled out a phone. Oh crap, is she calling the police? David's mind was flailing for an idea.       </span></div></div>",

I was hoping to find-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone with a keypass to the labs?\" the lioness sighed. She put down her phone and crossed her arms, rolling her eyes as she continued, \"You know, you guys need to start taking better care of your things. You're like the third guy I've seen in here after hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that a yes?\" the dragon asked nervously. He tried to glance behind the cat to see Marcus crouching down, trying to sneakily peruse the cabinets. The lioness caught David looking past her and spun around, only for the kangaroo to completely duck out just in time. When she looked back at the blue dragon she cocked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, kiddo. I don't have a keypass to get back there. My card only works for the NMR and MRI labs here,\" she said shrugging her shoulders. David pretended to disappointed, looking down at his feet to act dejected. The lioness brought a hand up to her forehead and sighed deeply. \"Fine, I know where to get one,\" she huffed and rolled her eyes, motioning for the drake to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Dr. Dresden,\" David said with mock shyness as he trudged behind her. He took a quick glance, making brief eye contact with Marcus. With his eyes, he told the kangaroo to hurry it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just call me Abby. It's what I get all my students to call me anyways,\" she said as she continued to lead him down a hall, thankfully not looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked down a long hall and came to a group of offices. Abby took out a chain full of keys and fiddled with them until she came to one that somehow unlocked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Dr. Dres- Abby, why are we at Dr. Arai's office?\" David said with a gulp. The dreaded Dr. Keiko Arai was probably the most intense professor at the school; first day homework sets, enough graded work to make the marking TA's hands bleed. The little cat practically demanded perfection in all her students, even the ones in her first year biology class. Some say she's just overcompensating, a rumour about her losing out on a coveted position at Harvard. Needless to say, drop rates from her classes were high and she' would have been put on probation several times for sometimes failing nearly a third of a class a year... before midterms were over, if she didn't have tenure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, she always leaves her cards in her office... And because Kei's my partner,\" the older woman said, turning her head slightly with wry smile on her face before disappeaing into the office. David couldn't help but gulp, imagining the MILF in front of him going all out with the tiny housecat that nearly flunked him out freshman year. Something about that just turned him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lioness returned, she smiled at the dragon and waved a card in her hand. Then, she led David down the hall and a flight of stairs to the lab entrance. She swiped the card along the reader and opened the door at the beep and green light. Coming up to another she opened it and flicked on the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid followed the lioness in. The anatomy lab always freaked him out. He never liked coming to these things, what with all the cadavers in the room. He scanned around the lab, looking at all the 'specimens' the university had collected over the years; jars full of fetuses with strange and rare developmental defects, various preserves of diseased organs on display -  it all creeped the fuck out of him. He looked at the lioness and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Go find it,\" she said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon made his way towards various benches, pretending to look for a lost notebook. He tried his best not to look at the people-shaped lumps underneath the covers, an irrational fear that they'd jump up and scare him. He was big strong dude, but that didn't mean he wasn't afraid of silly things. When he had 'searched' every station he returned to the lioness and shook his head. \"I can't find it anywhere,\" he said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby sighed again. \"Figures, it's probably in the lost-and-found, just come back Monday. And don't waste any more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" the drake said. He tried to look innocent, but then he heard the mechanism for the room locking. He looked up to see Abigail locking the door, making sure no one could get in. \"What are you doing?\" he asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness turned around, a hungry glint in her eyes as she licked her chops. Slowly, she began to come towards the dragon, taking her labcoat off to reveal a skin-tight tank top that left nothing to the imagination of her feminine curves. \"I think you know, stud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Dresden! Abby, please,\" David said nervously, placing his hands out as if to defend himself from an attack. \"I thought you and Dr. Arai were a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we are,\" she said sultrily. She began to lift off her shirt and unfastening her bra. David drank in the sight before him - he had a raging boner going off in his pants; this lady was seriously hot. David's defences melted as she advanced, hooking one leg around his. She blatantly reached underneath his shirt and felt up his abs. \"That doesn't mean I don't like to fool around with big strong men from time to time.\" She reached down and squeezed at David's erect length poking up through the band. \"And, boy? You are seriously big all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't do this. I have a girlfriend,\" David lied; sure him and Jess were starting to get really close, and he was going with her to the dance next week, but he wouldn't have called her a girlfriend just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness let out an amused laugh. \"You mean that kangaroo behind the desk?\" David's heart sank. She knew? \"Trust me, hon. You're lover's no girl. Guy must've been almost as big as you. Who's the top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, he's not... We're just friends,\" David stammered, almost at a complete loss of words. He was royally fucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, big guy,\" she snorted as she backed off and began pulling her skinny-jeans down to uncover a rather skimpy thong covering her privates. \"Tell you what, you have sex with me, and I won't get you and your 'friend' back there expelled for trying to steal or whatever it was you were doing up there. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you blackmailing me?\" he said through his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really,\" she said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon crossed his arms in defiance. \"And what if I tell Dr. Arai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that, and the outcome's the same: expulsion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked at the lioness and gulped. On one had, her hot body made him completely hard. But on the other, he knew if he didn't do this, him and Marcus would be kicked out; there was some sense of duty to protect the kangaroo, especially after what David had done to him. It was the least he could do for Marcus; after all, the roo was probably the most dependable guy there was; it if weren't for the crazy lunatic trying to turn Marcus into the Incredible Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed. He was going to regret this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon strolled back onto the third floor to see Marcus sitting patiently in the lobby for him. David made his way over and sat himself across from the kangaroo. He probably had just had the most mind-blowing sex he's ever had. That lioness must have had some cougar in her or something - the way she could just control a young guy's body with her moves. It was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dave, where's the doctor?\" the kangaroo greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... Took care of her,\" David replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus looked downcast, defeated. \"Take a look.\" He held out a file marked with 'Marcus Fletcher' on the tab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid opened the file. Blank page after blank page filled it to the brim. He couldn't believe it, the whole thing was a sham? There was no evidence that such a trial even existed. He flipped the pages until he came to one at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Nice try boys. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knew, David,\" the kangaroo said drearily. \"He knew all along that we'd try to come find some dirt on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you hadn't been such a fucking baby about this at the park, we could've gotten here early enough to catch them,\" David said through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fucking serious, David?\" the kangaroo spat back. \"You really want to go there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, I just saved your ass back there. Show some gratitude,\" David sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sure come Monday, I'll be so damn grateful to the rest of the team too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a beeping rang for both Marcus and David. The two held a temporary, unspoken truce as they fished out their cell phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Hope you boys like walking. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the message, David frantically made his way to the stairwell, muttering a ,\"Shit!\" on his way down. Marcus sat there for a moment. Why was David so testy as of late? He didn't know what he saw in the dragon before. The guy yelled, the guy insulted him, betrayed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Marcus finally made his way out, he saw what David had made all the commotion about. The dragon was standing by the truck, the tires slashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" the drake yelled. He spun around and pointed an accusatory finger at Marcus' chest. \"This is all your fault, you fucking brought this on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Marcus bared his teeth, they weren't razors like Fang's or David's were, but if he had too, he could bite if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck am I going to do, huh? Tyler's gonna kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Marcus replied:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk back to Marcus's place was less than pleasant. David was constantly grumbling and directing nasty verbal jabs at Marcus, but the fear of having to deal with an irate Tyler, who also happened to have David on a string since he was more financially secure, was enough to convince the drake to lay low for the evening. David wondered how much a new set of tires would cost; most of the money he had in the bank, that's for sure. He'd have to call for a tow to a tire shop too, that would cost extra. And in David's mind, it was as much Marcus's fault as it was A's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus, for his part, was sullen at the dead end he now faced. With nothing on file, he couldn't prove anything, and didn't have a clue where else to go. Well, there was always jumping off a bridge, but wouldn't be doing anyone favors. How big was A going to make him? What would happen to his life? What would happen to everyone around him, would there be more David-type cases where he ends up destroying a perfectly good friendship? Marcus was pretty sure that even if they situation did resolve, he and the big blue drake would never talk again, let alone be friends. There went those little fantasies of having David as a lover. Marcus sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus looked at the paper from the file, the only evidence he had that A was a living person. It was handwritten in navy blue ink, the penmanship a curious mix of cursive and print, neat and slightly slanted left....which, from listening to his father talk, he knew that A was likely an independent, somewhat repressed personality, and most-likely left-handed. Not exactly opening the door to any leads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus arrived back home. All he wanted to do was sleep, but he knew he had to clean up the mess in the bathroom left from his latest growth session. As for David, who he wanted to deal with as little as possible, he took out an old inflatable mattress and some spare blankets, hoping the dragon's hard scales wouldn't break the vinyl as he slept. David stood in the entryway, not moving, but at least he was silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David watched Marcus clean, he began to feel a little remorse. Tires could be replaced. Marcus's body couldn't. If A chose to do something to him that had detrimental consequences, Marcus would be nothing more than a bittersweet memory and a black memorial strap on the football uniform. It certainly wasn't an enviable position to be in, muscle growth or not. David bit his lower lip as he thought through the course of the night's events. Marcus's didn't really have a part in slashing his tires, that was A and A alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid cleared his throat as Marcus finished cleaning and was putting the solvents and cleaning tools away. \"Yo, uh...Marcus, I...realize the truck isn't your fault. It's not right to blame you for that.\" David's inner self patted him on the back for the polite gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big roo gave a tired shrug. \"It's okay. I got you into this, you have a right to be a angry. I'll cover some of the cost for the tire replacements.\" He sounded exasperated and rather depressed. David looked away from him, still feeling guilty about the beatdown he and Fang delivered earlier. Unrequited love, honest disinterest, or whatever he felt for the muscular marsupial, it wasn't okay to beat the shit out of someone for being a fag. Even on Fang's orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus interrupted his train of thought. \"Bed's made up for you on the other side of my room. I'm sorry I can't let you sleep elsewhere, but my parents will think something's up. I'm just going straight to bed when I finish cleaning, you don't have to worry about me trying anything.\" David gave a polite nod in assent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcus finished cleaning, he glanced at his phone one last time. With a pained sigh, he saw another message from A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">I give you respect points for trying. But, back to the matter at hand. Since you're taking Allison Parker to the dance, it would be useful if you coaxed her into bed, one way or another. I want her to be smitten with you by the time that night is done. Also, you can't \"break up\" with David either. I look forward to watching the fireworks, stud. Don't let me down. -A </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus let out an angry groan. He was too tired to yell. It seemed that A wanted him to fuck over as many people as possible. he resigned himself to the task of screwing with Alli's heart, not out of interest because he knew there would be no good alternative to disobeying A. In the meanwhile, he would have to be on the lookout for anything that might give him a clue on who A was and how he could stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was uneventful, the sleep restless, visions of marionettes in Marcus's mind. He could hear his parents laughing as they strode in, talking about their own night. He groaned in disgust as he heard Mrs. Fletcher say merrily to her husband, \"Derek, we've been married 23 years, and your tongue never ceases to amaze me.\" His father laughed heartily in response. David stirred and turned towards Marcus. \"Well, at least they had fun last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus frowned. As soon as his parents were upstairs, he and David stepped out of the bedroom, grabbed the car keys from the kitchen table, and drove to the nearest tire shop. Marcus sighed as he paid for half the tire bill; there went his drinking money for the next three months. David at least gave a polite \"thank you\" in return. Otherwise, the two were rather distant and awkwardly formal towards each other, more like two business associates than friends. At least David was able to have the truck back by noon, which resulted in only mild frustration from his smaller brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus picked up the tickets for the dance Monday morning. Alli might be looking forward to this, but he certainly wasn't.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus tapped his foot impatiently; it was his last class of the day. He hated coming to this lecture, he had decided to lighten his load this term, to artificially pad his marks with bird courses. Freshman macroeconomics was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reflected on what happened so far this week as the professor went on their drivel on the effect of labour unions. As expected, when he showed up for practice earlier that week, there was a rumour circulating of him being gay. He could feel his ears folding down as he remembered what some of the guys he thought were his friends say. \u2018Girl\u2019s locker room\u2019s that way.\u2019 \u2018Ha, didn\u2019t know kangaroos liked to shove meat down their throats.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the slew of insults, he was glad to see some of the guys trying to consolidate him; maybe not everyone on the team was a complete asshole. However, whatever small part of him still held onto the idea of being with David, or even just being David\u2019s friend was crushed; the blue drake had left the scene with Fang\u2019s entourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting mixed signals from the drake. On one hand, David kept pulling shit like that, siding with Fang like that at practice, pretending to not notice him when he was with the guys as they passed on campus. Yet at the same time, the dragon stopped by earlier that week to drop off some of his clothes off; something his mom thought deserved a kiss on the cheek. The way David blushed as she did, and the way he stole glances at him. Maybe he was sorry for all the stupid shit he\u2019s been doing? Maybe \u2018A\u2019 was forcing him? The kangaroo didn\u2019t know anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardest part was probably when Allison had called him one day. She had asked him rather quietly if it was true. Of course, he told her the truth. How could he lie to such a sweet girl like that? He told her he still liked girls too, and more specifically, he kind of liked her. He didn\u2019t know if it was genuine or if it was just the pressure from \u2018A\u2019 talking, but the words came out effortlessly. By the end, they were talking and giggling like a couple over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s why Marcus was so anxious to get out. After this class, he and Alli planned to go to the mall to pick up her dress and for him to get a last minute suit for the dance tomorrow. As the digital clock read 5:20, people already started packing up in the lecture hall and filtering out, even as the prof tried his hardest to finish up the last bit of lecture as quick as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus\u2019 phone beeped. His heart stopped, he flipped open his phone and was relieved to see the sender was just Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Hey! Meet us outside at Med Sci ;)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Us?\u2019 Marcus thought it was just going to be him and Alli. When he made his way up to the Medical Science Building, he saw David and Jessica loitering near the entrance. His brow furrowed. What were they doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Legs,\u201d the arctic fox with pink hair said nonchalantly, chewing gum and wearing her shades. Marcus rolled his eyes; she always had a strange way of coming up with insulting nicknames for guys. His in particular came from a time when he made out with her at a Halloween party a couple years back. He dressed up as Legolas, thinking the outfit accentuated his lean body nicely. However, as Jessica saw it, he was \u2018All-Legs-No-Ass.\u2019 Marcus smirked internally, that certainly wasn\u2019t true about him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, even Jess noticed the difference. She lowered her shades and gawked at the kangaroo. Her eyes went up and down the incredibly sculpted body Marcus now possessed; the swell of his impressive chest, the size of his thick arms, abs that could be seen through the tight shirt. She felt her mouth watering a bit; Marcus was seriously hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the fox could say anything, a tall t-rex girl came out of the building, her backpack slung around one of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hon. Hey, David,\u201d Allison said cheerily. She turned to Marcus, she knew he looked even bigger, but didn\u2019t say anything. Instead she just shyly swayed back and forth and near-whispered, \u201cHi, Marcus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm grin came across the kangaroo\u2019s face. \u201cHi, Alli,\u201d he said softly. \u201cUm, want me to hold your bag?\u201d The gesture only caused the green of her cheek to flush a bit red, something the roo liked a lot. He knew \u2018A\u2019 would try to sabotage him, and he felt a pang of guilt for doing this to Alli, but right now he was smitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I invited Jess and David, Jess is picking up her dress to,\u201d she said softly, as if to ask his approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, no probs,\u201d he said with a smile. He took a quick glance at the drake, supressing an uncharacteristic growl. David on the other hand, pretended he didn\u2019t see the kangaroo glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the mall was awkward to say the least. They decided to take the bus, as Marcus didn\u2019t think his run-down car could take this much weight. Jess and David just shrugged, but Alli looked down at her feet, a little conscious of her weight. Marcus saw her curling up and decided to hold her hand, something the t-rex warmed up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the contempt he felt for David and butterflies he was getting in his stomach being around Allison, he was having a great time. It seemed as if he finally got over the crappiness of this past week; completely forgetting what may come next with the ever-looming threat of \u2018A.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison\u2019s dress was stunning, the design was simple, the simple accents on her white dress modest, but they played off her feminine curves beautifully. The big girl curled up, thinking that it made her already ample assets look too big. Marcus wasn\u2019t complaining though, he had to shift a bit just so that his stiffening rod wouldn\u2019t show. To him, she looked like Helen of Troy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they went to shop for the guys suits, they decided to get some dinner at the food court. Of course, the guys had to pay. As the ladies sat down, Marcus turned to David and spoke to him for the first time. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were dating Jessica!\u201d he hissed through his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was I supposed to know you were going out with her roommate? I thought you were gay,\u201d the dragon said in a hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can like girls too,\u201d the roo mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were constantly at odds when it came to ordering, bickering about what happened at practice that week. But, coming back to the table with their food, they put on an air of friendliness. They set down the food, just some simple burger and fries for everyone. Of course, Marcus got the veggie burger; he could take meat, but it always left a bad taste in his mouth, not to mention a bit of indigestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew Alli also liked desserts, so afterwards he treated her to a sundae that the two could share. It was almost picture perfect, the two of them leaning in across the table, goofy grins on their faces. That is, until they both went for it at the same time, their knuckles bumping into one another, their hands playing a little game to get the first scoop, the pair giggling all the way \u2013 it was better than picture perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Marcus could feel something wasn\u2019t right. He bent down and clenched his stomach. His eyes went wide as he felt a burning sensation begin to crawl its way up. David, sitting beside him, noticed, his eyes going wide. \u201cExcuse us, girls,\u201d he said quickly, pushing at Marcus and helping the roo to the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid had to work quickly, dragging Marcus to the handicap stall. What happened? Was it just something wrong with the food? He looked at the roo, it definitely wasn\u2019t just a stomach problem, he could see the sweat glistening off of Marcus\u2019 brow, the borrowed clothes looking tighter. But what could it have been? There was no pill, they all ate the same thing \u2013 except for Marcus\u2019 sandwich, but how did \u2018A\u2019 get access to tampering with their food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t have time to mull it over, Marcus was groaning as he grew upwards and outwards. David gulped as he watched his friend grow to be just as tall as he was. And while the delirious kangaroo was just as tall and just as wide as the drake, he was incredibly cut rather than just beefy like David was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched in horror as Marcus\u2019 half-lidded eyes flitted to him. The kangaroo began to approach and reached out, his incredibly strong grasp holding onto David tightly. Marcus was giggling and said, \u201cMan, this one\u2019s so real.\u201d The roo leaned forward and planted his lips right onto David\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some sick reason, David couldn\u2019t push him off \u2013 or more accurately, didn\u2019t push him off. Instead, he put up a weak defense and soon melted into the kiss, wrapping his own hands around Marcus as they began to feel each other up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid could hear a ripping sound and looked down. Marcus\u2019 shaft had burst through the pant zipper again and began to spew his load onto their shirts. David couldn't believe how big the roo was down there now. He had to be at least a foot long and extremely thick. If he didn't know better, he'd say Marcus was a Greek god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus finally began to come to, but to his horror, realized he wasn't exactly coming to at all, the image of him and David holding onto each other didn't change, he just became more aware that this actually happened, that he and David just had a sloppy make-out session. He pushed off of David, the two boys stunned at what just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere, a gloved hand stopped the recording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus and David were in for a nasty surprise as they came out of the restroom trying to play things off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David and Marcus hurried to settle back into their seats. As they did, Jess gave a casual glance towards David and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! Did you break the faucet?\" From the midriff down, David was thoroughly wet, to the point where the occasional water drop seeped out of the hem. Alli gasped just as loudly when she saw Marcus was every bit as soaked, his clothes clinging tightly to his Herculean frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grunted weakly. \"Lunch didn't agree with him and he yakked into the sink. Tried to clean up, but the cheap-ass faucet broke at the base and sent water everywhere. Had to have a third guy call maintenance. It was a mess girls.\" He looked quite embarrassed, the actual events playing into his demeanor enough to make the story more believable. Marcus curled his finger and scratched against his temple, arms propped on the table in an attempt to hide his face from passerby. The awkwardness was so thick one could cut it with a knife and serve it on a plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli and Jess exchanged looks of bemusement before slowly easing back towards their normal selves. It seemed like the whole thing could be played off, as Marcus acquiesced to Alli on finishing off the sundae.But if the awkwardness before could be served on a plate, what was about to happen could have been served on a banquet table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jess who saw it first. Around the food court were some large flat-screens, normally tuned to some news channel or the sports networks, or whatever was the big politically-correct entertainment de jour. This, however, was anything but. Jess had only been giving the news channel on the nearest TV a cursory glance when the screen cut out to a black-and-white security camera. For a moment, she thought they had cut to some robbery video. But, as she looked closer, her eyes went wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid went to make a quick comment to her, and caught the look of bewilderment on her face. Confused, he followed her eyes to the TV. It took him a moment to realize what was going on, and as he did, his jaw slowly dropped in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was from the restroom. There was a security camera? No, David realized, it couldn't be, security cameras don't shoot directly into stalls. David grimly concluded that someone <i>was in the fucking bathroom taping them</i>. Was it A? It had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera showed, with great detail, Marcus reaching out to him and planting a kiss on David's lips. The camera was angled such that David's back was to the camera, but from his little horns and big bulky size, there was no way anyone would doubt it was him. Gasps and exclamations of disgust began to arise from some more vocal shoppers as they stared at the screens. David bit his lower lips as he quickly scanned the food court; there must have been several dozen people watching on the various screens, all playing the camera footage in sync. It was a nightmare coming to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus and Alli finally tuned back in from their own little world to realize the calamity breaking out among them. Marcus looked at the screens and placed his hands on the table; a cold sweat breaking out across his forehead. Alli's eye went as wide as saucers as she watched the screen, mesmerized, but still lucid enough to let out a halting \"Oh. My. God. Marcus?\" The last word was less questioning and more of a high-pitched plea. Marcus's heart was sinking like an anchor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only thing the video lacked was sound, not that it mattered at this point; mothers were rushing their children away, some people in the audience jeered at the queer fag homos, and even an old female skunk who turned to her daughter to quip, \"In my day, we called 'em 'Friends of Dorothy'\". Several more forward-minded citizens called for the screens to be turned off rather than \"hang the homos\", and at least one or two couples used it as an excuse to engage in their own makeout sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one saving grace of the tape was that Marcus's growth, and more importantly his sizable companion weren't discernible, although the aftermath was. David prayed that people would think it was urine; he certainly came enough to make that believable. But there was no hiding what he did; as Marcus kissed him, he kissed back, fully and passionately. There was initial hesitation, but afterwards it looked like any other couple giving way to the throes of passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess suddenly broke her gaze and began to punch David with her fists, trying to land blows on any part of his body she could. \"You sorry son of a bitch! You led me on! You led me to believe you liked me when you were secretly playing tonsil hockey with Legs! Why would you do this to me! Fuck you David! Fuck you!\" The little arctic fox jumped up with a start, tears streaming, and ran from the table, the other shoppers hardly breaking their stares at the screen to notice. Marcus watched the scene unfold, but Alli was still engrossed by the screen, and even though it was hard to tell if a t-rex was blushing, the musclebound roo was 99% sure she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David cradled his head in his hands as Jess tried to beat him up, the obvious size difference resulting in nothing more then some light bruises for him. David pulled his hands away from his face, glaring at Marcus darkly. Marcus looked away, unable to say anything. The poor kangaroo felt like a home-wrecker. David shot up from the table and away from the other two, sprinting to avoid being stopped by vigilante shoppers with a cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tape cut off as the two left the restroom, and the TVs returned to their normal programming. The shoppers continued to stand in small crowds as security made an effort to break them up. Marcus threw Alli's bag on his head. This had to be the worst day of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, he felt a hand grab his, and quickly pull him away from the scene. The t-rex was using her size and curves to drive her way through the crowds of shoppers, more than one calling after Marcus as they recognized his face from the video. The shouts, the jeers and the threats compelled Alli to run faster, her bouncing bosom making its own scene as they ran to one of the entrances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they slammed through the doors, Alli stopped outside the shopping center and began to heave. At first, Marcus thought it was for air, but then he realized she was sobbing as well. \"Marcus...why Marcus...I thought you liked me.\" Marcus reached for her. \"Allison, I do. Let me exp-\" She pushed his hand away and ran off, darting between the cars in an effort to limit Marcus's chance of chasing after her. Her dress bag was still in his hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Marcus could've willed himself to die, he'd have done it right then. He picked up his phone and sent a text to A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">How could you do this to me? Why?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a moment before a response came back to his phone. He grimaced as he glanced at the message.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus clenched his teeth as he made his way back to campus. How the fuck was he going to get Allison to go to the dance with him? At the moment, Marcus looked more like a raging bull walking down the sidewalk, as if smoke was coming out of his ears, than the lean kangaroo he used to be. He slung Alli's bag over his shoulder and held the dressbag in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo was furious. How could 'A' do this to him? For once in his mediocre life, he had found someone that made him feel special. And 'A' ruined it. Just then, Marcus accidentally bumped into another person on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo watch where you're going, asshole,\" a short raccoon sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus turned around and snorted. \"You talking to me, punk?\" The raccoon's eyes went wide as he saw a giant paw reaching down and grabbing him by the neck. Marcus lifted the smaller guy off the ground, shook the guy and snarled, \"I said, you talking to me, fucker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon squirmed and gargled in the roo's paw, unable to formulate any words as he felt his airway being cut off by the brute's hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, put him down, you bully.\" Marcus swung around to see a pair of girls going out for an evening jog stop in their tracks. \"Yo, I'm calling the police, jerk-off. Leave him alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your own fucking business, bitch,\" the kangaroo yelled to the girls across the street. He looked at the shrimp in his paws in disgust. This grovelling worm was pathetic. He threw the raccoon to the ground. The little guy crying out in pain as he landed and gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus spun around and continued on his way back to campus with a stomp. In the corner of his eye, he could see the girls crossing the street to help the poor little thing. As he stormed off, he could hear the girls taunting him. \"Lay off the 'roids, buddy.\" \"Yeah, maybe you'll grow your balls back and pick on someone your own size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus didn't know why, but he was just so angry these days. Like he couldn't fully control his growing rage. Maybe it was all this testosterone now flooding through his veins. At the moment, he didn't care. He looked at a mailbox at the edge of someone's driveway and in an act of impulse swiped at it, knocking the box off the wooden post. It was true, Marcus was turning into a giant asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus spotted another mailbox and was about to knock it off its post as well when his phone rang. He growled and reached into his too-tight pocket and fished out his phone. He looked at the number and his ears flattened immediately. It was Allison's. He looked back at what he had just done, destroying someone's property, almost choking a guy just for bumping into him. What would Alli think of him if she saw him do those things? He brought his phone to his ear and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Alli?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess again, dickwad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess?\" Marcus growled lowly. \"Put her on. I want to speak with her. Not you, bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, seriously Marc, what the fuck are you on? Since when'd you talk to girls like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just- just put her on,\" he said more calmly. Jessica was right, he never acted like this before. Maybe this shit 'A' was giving him really was making him overly aggressive, or maybe it was just all this shit 'A' was putting him through stressing and stretching him to his limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jessica said flatly on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the fuck not!\" Marcus roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, genius. Maybe because I'm not gonna let her talk to an asshat like you? I called 'cause she needs her stuff back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I now, your delivery guy?\" the roo rumbled darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be nice,\" she said sarcastically before sighing in resignation. \"Look, you want to see her? Bring her stuff over and we'll see if she wants to talk, got it, Legs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to get here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Alli gave me the address last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You better be able to explain yourself, Marc.\" With that, the other end went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus sighed and closed his phone. This was his chance to make it up to Allison. All he had to do was act calm and collected. \"Control yourself, Marcus,\" he whispered to himself as he began to jog. As he ran, Marcus thought of what he was going to say to Allison. He wanted them to be a couple. Heck, maybe his new size could be a blessing, Allison was a big girl, she needed a strong man to take care of her. He slowed down and smirked, though they didn't get to spend much time together, he really liked just being around the girl. For him, just holding her hand was enough. He remembered them giggling as they both tried to get that first scoop of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when Marcus' brow furrowed. He remembered their knuckles bumping into one another. Marcus was right-handed and Allison was sitting across the table, but she came in from the same side as he did... which meant she was left-handed. His mind reeled back to that note he found in his record. He was certain the person who wrote it was left-handed as well. Marcus' lips curled into a sneer. Could Allison be 'A?' It made sense. Her name started with 'A,' she was a chemistry major, she had access to the materials, and she took a keen interest to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus let out a low snarl. So 'A'llison wanted him to take her to the dance? Fine, he'd play. He needed more evidence, but if his hunch was correct, he could almost feel his paws wrapping around her neck and squeezing the life out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo made his way up to the small house near the university and rang the doorbell. He was sure this was the place. But, before anyone could answer the door, he felt something being jabbed into his thigh from behind. He looked back to see a hooded figure leaping out of view. When he looked down, he saw a syringe lodged into right hamstring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, no no no, not now!\" the kangaroo stammered. So it wasn't Alli? Or was it a hired person? He couldn't think straight, his senses beginning to become fuzzy. He slammed on the door. \"Jess?! Alli?! Open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door swung open and Jessica watched as the 7'3'' kangaroo fell to his knees on her porch. \"Oh my God,\" she cried as she jumped at the impact of his knees hitting the floor. \"Allisaur! Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison came bounding around the corner and went wide-eyed at the sight of a delirious Marcus. \"What happened to him?\" she blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, he just came here like this! Help me get him in. Oh my God, Alli, should we call an ambulance or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\" the dinosaur cried out. The two of the them pulled Marcus into their home and stood back as he began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck, is he growing?!\" Jessica said. She looked at the brute that laid on her living room carpet. Marcus was growing all over again, the sounds of fabric tearing at the seams echoed throughout the girls' home. The two girls watched incredulously as the kangaroo moaned and snarled as he writhed and contorted on the ground, pound after pound of thick muscle being added to his frame, his voice getting deeper as he went, his bones cracking painfully as he grew taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Allison's phone beeped. The t-rex grabbed at it and looked at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">You can save him, hon. Just look into your bag. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was this? Who was this 'A?' Allison didn't really have time to think of any answers, all she knew was that Marcus was in pain, that he was potentially in grave danger. If someone knew how to stop it, she'd listen. She fished through the bag Marcus had brought back, everything seemed to be in order until she felt something cold brush up against her hand. She grabbed at it and pulled out a syringe filled with red liquid and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Inject it into him. I promise it'll make him better. ;) -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison gulped and traded glances with Jess who was peering at the message as well. They watched as Marcus' shaft burst through the zipper and began to unload copious amounts of semen as he began to buck wildly on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there goes the theory of him using steroids, right?\" Jessica joked cautiously, trying to make light of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison hesitated to inject Marcus as he thrashed about on the floor. She'd wait until it was over, but Marcus just kept cumming over and over and over. It almost took thirty seconds before his semen stopped jettisoning out of his dick, and even then he involuntarily twitched about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was her chance, Allison brought her hand towards Marcus' shoulder and looked at him before she injected the contents of the syringe. That's when she noticed Marcus' half-lidded gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus, I'm going to make you better. I know something's happening to you, and I'm going to fix you,\" Allison whimpered, cupping his cheek and then stroking the fur on top of his head tenderly. She brought her other hand up and stabbed Marcus' shoulder with the needle, injecting the red liquid into his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison, no!\" Marcus yelled. But it was too late, he could feel the warmth spreading through his body as he began to convulse again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe t-rex shrieked and jumped back, she and Jess looking at the spectacle as the kangaroo began to grow yet again. As he bulked up to become impossibly huge, Allison's phone went off again. The girls practically dove at it and read the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Welcome to my game, bitches. -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them turned to Marcus and watched in horror.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Marcus convulsed on the floor, packing on pound after pound of muscle, Jess became dimly aware that the doorbell was ringing, hardly audible over Marcus's groans and heavy thuds. Jess adroitly leaped around the rapidly-growing roo and threw the door open, half tempted to run for her life, if it wasn't for the thought of leaving Alli alone with that...beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway was David, with a small box and card that said \"I'm sorry\" on the front. He looked completely stunned by the look of fear on Jess's face. \"Oh God, David, help us out here, I don't know what the hell is happening to Marc, but he's growing out of control!\" David looked past Jess and saw the gargantuan roo writhing on the floor. Although he wasn't shooting his load at the moment, from the look of things, he had already done so previous, copious amounts of spunk spread across half the room, and even from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, where's Alli?\" David asked urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess reached up and grabbed him by the shirt collar, hauling his face down to hers. \"She's somewhere in there! He started growing and I dragged him inside! We got weird text messages from a guy called \"A\" and he had Alli inject Marc with some needle, and he started growing again! Make it stop goddammit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pulled her hands from his shirt, alarmed. \"Shit, \"A\" messaged you? Shit, shit, shit Jess! He's a fucking psycho! Stay away from Marcus until he stops growing, he has freaky dreams when he's like that and you might get hurt!\" David shouted into the room. Where the hell could the big rex have hidden? \"Alli, keep away from Marcus, you might get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli poked out from behind the couch, several feet from Marcus. \"I-I'm right here! What's happening to him David!? Is he gonna be alright!? I only tried to help...\" Her voice trembled as she yelled, it is obvious she was shouting through tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid watched as the roo slammed into the legs of an end table, splintering the world and causing the table to collapse onto him. His eyes went wide as he saw the muscular roo grab the ends of the table top and and crush the wood in his grasp, groaning in some combo of pleasure and pain all the while. If someone's hand or foot found their way into his hands, he could do some extreme damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess pleaded with the big blue dragon, grabbing him for security. \"David, fucking do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid roared back in frustration. \"There's nothing I can do! It just has to run its course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess beat her fists into his muscular frame. \"Well--what--the--fuck--is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid held her close, partly to lessen the force of her blows. He tried to explain things, quickly and breathlessly. \"'A' has him drugged up like a lab rat! He did some clinical trial and it went bad, and the guy running it has made Marcus into his personal goddamned guinea pig! We tried to find the records but 'A' got rid of them! And whoever 'A' is, he'll hurt, you, me or anyone else he feels like in order to get Marcus to play along. I told you Jess, guy's a fucking psycho and Marcus is a pawn. That's what happened in the bathroom at the mall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looked up at him, fury in her eyes. \"Is <i>that</i> you're excuse for making out with him? Are you for fucking real David?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gritted his teeth. \"I'm sorry Jess. I can't explain what happened to me. I don't fucking know if I'm a fag or not, okay! I don't know! But I'll bet you anything that 'A' was the person who taped it and hacked into the TV feeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess began to tear up while still holding onto David. \"You don't fucking know. You don't know. Thanks for ripping up a girl's heart David. You're a swell guy.\" Meanwhile, Alli continued to cower behind the couch. In general, she was absolutely, pants-shitting terrified of the hulking roo. But, a small part of her felt turned on by the size and muscle on him. Which added a component of guilt to watching his growth sequence. She had always wanted a big, strong guy that would sweep her up in her arms, and make her feel as good as Jess looked when a guy swept her off her feet (literally and figuratively). And Marcus had seemed like a charming, sweet guy who might do just that. If there was some semblance of the real Marcus within that growing monstrosity, then she would keep hoping. Even if he was gay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, Marcus began to relax, his body resting on the ground, the giant roo clearly out cold. There was no other way to describe him but huge. Alli couldn't think of any kangaroo she had ever seen over seven feet. Most furs and scalies never saw the north side of 7 and a half feet, barring certain species like hers, and freak anomalies like Fang. Marcus was now a freak anomaly. If you took Fang, kept the proportions, and made him into a roo, you'd have Marcus. And even then, Marcus might even be a little bigger than that. He was close to eight feet, with a body that heavyweight bodybuilders would kill to have. He was simply a big, cut up mass of muscle. And that caused a stirring in Alli deep down, a generally repressed sexual feeling. She casually slipped her hand onto her lady bits for a moment, before common sense kicked in and she pulled away. This was a friend who was clearly in a terrible predicament, how could she think of having sex with him at a time like this!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marcus lay passed out on the floor, Jess turned away from David and stepped daintily stepped around the room, David following in his more lumbering way. \"What the fuck. Alli, I don't know what we got ourselves into. There's cum everywhere! I've never seen so much cum in my life!\" She turned and glared at David. \"That includes you, scales. And go on, keep making me feel like shit by making no attempt to tuck your boner away.\" David had only half-realized he had a sizable erection throbbing in his pants, and he hastily tried to readjust himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess stepped over to Alli and helped her into a sitting position, her hands on her shoulders. \"Are you okay sweetie? I didn't mean to leave you over here like that. I'm really sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli, timidly, looked into Jessica's eyes. \"Jessica, what are we going to do with him? We can't let him go home, his parents won't even recognize him. How can he even go to class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looked at David, and looked back at Alli.\"I have an idea.\"   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"David can take him. Lover boy can get what he wants,\" the arctic fox said coldly, staring daggers at the big drake before her, still eyeing the sizable tent in David's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" David started, but realized arguing with Jessica was like trying to fight a swarm of bees; you can swat it, but it just comes back angrier and angrier, more fiery than before. He looked down and cursed at his bulge. \"Stupid sexy Fletcher,\" the drake muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Jess said with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" David growled. He sighed before continuing. \"Why can't we keep him here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't want him in my house. He's dangerous,\" Jessica huffed, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that makes it <i>my</i> problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah it does,\" she sneers, pushing at the beefy drake's chest before turning around. She turned back to Allison and hooked her arm underneath the dinosaurs. \"C'mon, hon, let's get you to your room so gay-Romeo can get his boyfriend out of our house.\" She pulled at the dinosaur, but Alli wouldn't budge. \"Alli?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe t-rex shook her head. \"We can't just let him go looking like this. We should let him stay, Jessie.\" Allison's eyes were pleading with the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the fox replied, shaking her head. \"What if 'A' strikes again, hon? Legs is his target and I'm not going to let that psycho hurt you. David's a guy, he can take care of himself-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can stay too-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>not</i> having him stay here,\" Jessica blurted abruptly. Allison could see the hurt look on the arctic fox's face. Jessica balled her fists, squeezing them firmly. The fox always prided herself as the strong female type, but even now she could keep the tears in. David hurt her so badly. She always dated these kind of guys; the vapid assholes. But she couldn't believe she let herself fall for this one. Of all the guys she's ever slept with, the drake was the only one who ever took any interest in her antics; actually laughing at her jokes, cuddling with her rather than making out. It made her feel special knowing that there was a someone out there that looked out for her rather than her perky breasts and bikini line. Guess she knows why now: lady bits don't excite the blue dragon. David's never boned up for her like that before, but just one look at the huge marsupial passed out on her floor and the drake's practically ready to shoot. She should've known better. All men are animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison sighed and nodded, conceding to Jess. She looked plaintively at Marcus. She didn't care if Jessica saw the kangaroo as just some mass of muscle, she knew Marcus wasn't dangerous. He was sweet, kind, a gentleman; at least she hoped he was still all these things. \"At least let me clean him up, get him something that might fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Jess huffed. Allison went over to try and lift up the gigantic roo, but was having a bit of difficulty. Jessica turned to the drake that just stood there gawking. \"Hey! Thought gay men were supposed to be polite! Fucking help her, David!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up, Jess,\" David said softly, defeat in his voice. \"You don't know what it's like. I always thought I only liked girls. Girls like you. I dunno if I'm a fag or not, but just get off my case. If that's what you want, fine. We're through, you don't have to date a queer. Happy?\" The drake's eyes watered, expressing an emotion he usually never showed; vulnerability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you-\" the arctic fox started but choked on her words. David sauntered past her and she reached out for his hand, but the drake just swatted her hand away, giving her a hurt look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid bent down and hoisted the slumbering Marcus on his back. Though Marcus was definitely bigger than the drake now, David was as strong as an ox - probably stronger - he could piggyback the roo up the stairs to the girls' bathroom that they shared. David looked around; this was definitely a girl's bathroom, a fruity aroma wafting through the air, a cornucopia of beauty products lining the small countertop. It was such a stark contrast to the one he and Tyler shared, David shuddered at the thought of last time someone cleaned the sink, let alone the shower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison directed him to place Marcus in the tub and the drake gently laid the kangaroo down. David's shirt was ruined, the back covered in a drying layer of cum. Allison offered him another shirt, but he declined. As soon as David left the room, the t-rex turned all her attention to the still unconscious roo. She turned on the tap and took a bath sponge, soaking it in the warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over Marcus' giant form. He was huge, the expanse of his chest, his deep set abdominals, and his bulging arms. Probably the most remarkable part were his legs, they were massive, still proportional to the rest of him, but they definitely looked like his strongest feature. Well... other than the huge meat jutting out of his crotch. Allison never had a lot of chances to bed with men, but she's never met a guy who was this big. She gulped, and began to lower the sponge to Marcus' crotch, the area where the mess was the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand shot out and grabbed at her. Marcus was awake and he didn't look happy. \"Why'd you do it, Alli? Are you 'A?'\" he seethed. He quickly brought his other hand and brought it to close around the dinosaur's neck. \"Tell me,\" he growled lowly, his eyes fiercer than any predator's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Marcus,\" she whimpered. \"I never meant to hurt you.\" The tears were streaming down her face. Instead of trying to rip the brute's hand off her neck, she brought her free hand and gently stroked the one holding onto her's. \"Please, Marcus. You have to believe me. I was tricked. 'A' tricked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus' eyes went wide. She sounded genuine. But the most disturbing part was that even though she claimed she wasn't 'A,' she knew of him. But that meant... He let go of Allison's neck, not believing he could get that violent. \"Alli,\" he said, his voice cracking. The kangaroo began to sob, leaning into the dinosaur and crying into her shoulder. Not knowing what to do, Allison did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Jessica were downstairs cleaning up all the spunk Marcus had left behind, the fox on her knees and David reaching up to the ceiling. They didn't speak to each other, silently working on their own sections of the room, each of the furtively taking glances at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus descended the stairs, wearing some of Allison's more unisex clothes, a plain white t-shirt and a pair of girl's underwear, the only thing what would fit over his huge quads and hamstrings. He held onto Allison's hand as she followed behind him, leading her down. Jessica was the first to see them, and the first to remark at the rather strange apparel Marcus was wearing. \"Oh look, he's a cross-dresser too. You've got some taste in men, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't one of the boys who stepped up to challenge her. \"Shut up, Jess,\" Allison snarled, showing a side of her barely anyone ever saw. Jessica instantly shrank from the looming t-rex, not because she was intimidated by her, but because she knew Allison was emotionally invested in the roo as well, she was in the wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's time you two leave,\" Jess said softly, pointing at the door, staring right at David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison traded looks at Marcus before asking, \"Are you still going to the dance with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus lit up a bit from his sombre mood. \"I-I'll be here at sex- I mean six.\" His cheeks flushing at the Freudian slip. Allison giggled and nodded, letting go of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked expectantly at Jessica. The fox took his hand and led him to the door. Marcus followed them and exited the house first. As David took a step out of the door he turned around. \"Jess, will you go with me? To the dance?\" he asked shyly. However, Jessica gave him an icy look before slamming the door in his face, not even a 'thanks for the help' or a 'goodbye.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was stunned and felt his eyes watering but kept himself composed. He turned around and saw Marcus giving him an understanding look. Fuck, the last thing he needed right now was Marcus' sympathy. He unlocked Tyler's truck and hopped unceremoniously into the driver's seat and Marcus popped into the passenger side. Neither of them spoke for the duration of the drive, however, the kangaroo could feel the storm clouds gathering above David's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid parked them into the driveway, the two big guys unbuckling their seatbelts but not making a move to get inside David's house. Marcus wanted to say something to comfort the drake, but couldn't figure out a way to say it. Anything he could think of would probably be taken the wrong way and David looked like he was on the verge of breaking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was broken when David's phone went off. The drake unlocked it and looked at his new message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Well? Aren't you going to introduce your brother to your new boyfriend? -A</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, David began to break down, his head banging into the steering wheel as he wept into his paws. It was all too much; the stress 'A' was putting on him, Jess finding out he boned up for dudes, the fact that he boned up to dudes at all, and most of all... these feelings for Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus felt sorry for David and reached out to pat the drake on the shoulder. In response the dragon:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dragon pulled Marcus in for a kiss. It was awkward; there was barely enough space in the truck for the both of them, and his muzzle crashed into the top of his chest as soon as it was brought down. But the shock paralyzed him from taking action. He didn't think to pull away before he was melting into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo was stunned. This was something he had been waiting for ever since he started high school, but this wasn't the way he had imagined it going down. He watched David for a moment, wondering if the dragon was going to say something. After a few more minutes he couldn't wait any more. \"David? What's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" David sobbed. \"I know I've done some shitty things to you Marcus, I know I've said a lot to hurt you. I'm sorry.\" He took a moment to get a hold of himself. He was still crying, but he could speak at last. \"But this is so fucked up. What in the world are we going to do? I'm so tired, man. I'm tired of feeling like I have to fight everybody. Everybody hates me now, and I just need one person on my side. I can't take it any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was crying again, just like that. Without thinking, Marcus threw an arm around his shoulder and drew him close. The kangaroo winced to himself as he felt his forearm and hand crowd around the dragon's upper torso. The truck was so small, it was uncomfortable to do anything. His heart sunk in his chest as he thought about the mess he made of things. Was this going to be his life now? Too big to fit anywhere, with the tatters of his relationships behind him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave the dragon as much time as he needed, and David kept crying for several more minutes before he stopped again. He sniffed once and rubbed his muzzle with the back of his hand, glancing Marcus' way but not looking directly at him. \"Thanks,\" he said so quietly that Marcus barely heard him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" the kangaroo mumbled just as awkwardly. He didn't know what to say, but he knew he had to say something. \"Look, what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shrugged and shook his head with a heavy sigh. \"I don't know what's happening to me, man. If you're like...doing something to me or what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus bristled at that. \"What? How could you think--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean on purpose!\" David shot Marcus a look that was half-annoyed, half-apology. \"It's just...I don't know, maybe you have pheromones or some shit now that makes me...it's just weird being round you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus forced himself to calm down. He sighed, and his chest nearly brushed the glove compartment. He didn't know if he could ever get used to this. \"It's weird being me right now. Listen, David, I know that this is strange for you, but I'm not putting out pheromones that you would be responding to. That's just not the way it works. I think you have some feelings -- maybe not for me, but for dudes in general -- and you've never really acknowledged them. They scare you, and you don't know what to do with that. It's really confusing, I know. I had to deal with all of this on my own, and I'm really glad I had parents who supported me through it. When all this mess is over and done with, I'll support you through it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't say anything for a long time. Marcus wondered if maybe he had overstepped his bounds for a moment; the dragon had never been one to have deep emotional chats with people. His fears were assuaged somewhat when David finally gave him a weary smile. \"I don't know about that, dude. I mean, I've never felt that way towards a guy before. I mean, the way I feel around you. But even still, I'm really into Jess. I can't take it that she hates me right now. I just want her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Marcus said. He shoved aside his disappointment for the moment. There would be time to deal with that. \"We'll figure out what to do about Jess and Alli later. Right now, we just have to get through this. How do you think your brother's going to take...us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave a small, almost bitter laugh. \"Fuck if I know, dude. He'll probably be OK. Hell, I've always thought he might be a fag himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus turned towards the window, and David actually picked up on the abrupt shift in his mood for once. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo shook his head. \"It's all right. It's just when you and Fang use words like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid clucked once and opened his door, squeezing out of the front seat. \"Look, dude, get over that. I did it because I had to do it, all right? What did you expect me to do, stick up for you and have Fang beat us both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus got out of his seat, his legs grinding against the dashboard, front seat and door. He felt practically wedged into the truck. It rocked when he finally got out of it. \"You didn't have to beat the crap out of me too. You're afraid of what you are, but that doesn't mean you get to take it out on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid growled softly as he rounded the truck, but he didn't say anything. He knew that Marcus was right, that he did a shitty thing because he was too afraid to do the right thing. But he couldn't bring himself to apologize yet. It would mean he'd have to acknowledge it, and that's something he couldn't bring himself to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked up to David's house in silence. The floor of the porch creaked under Marcus' giant feet, and the dragon felt the wood bending severely under the roo's weight. How big was he by now? How much bigger was this psychopath going to make him before he was satisfied? The dragon shook his head clear of those thoughts. Wondering about that wouldn't do anyone any good. He just had to keep playing A's sadistic little game until he could find a way to beat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door and went inside, immediately thumping up the stairs to his room. Marcus followed behind, ducking through the door frame and turning sideways just to get in. The giant kangaroo had to take the stairs two at a time, and even then it was awkward. David could hear his ears brushing against the ceiling as he walked. It was unbelievable how big he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of going to his room, he knocked on the door to Tyler's. His younger brother came to the door quickly, looking annoyed for a split-second when he saw David. \"What do you...holy shit, Marcus. What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid planted a hand on his smaller brother's chest and pushed his way inside. \"None of your business, squirt. Sit down. We have to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler grunted, easily shuffled aside. He tried to push David back, but it didn't quite have the same effect. \"Hold on, you can't just barge into my room like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP.\" David's roar shook the walls for a bit, and even Marcus' ears folded. Tyler looked struck, and David regretted shouting immediately. \"Just...just sit down, OK? This isn't going to be easy for me to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler's expression grew more puzzled. He sat down at the chair in front of his computer desk and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...might have noticed that I've been hanging around Marcus a lot more now. We've been telling everybody it's because Marcus is helping me study for my tests, and I'm helping him get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler nodded. \"Though that doesn't really track with this.\" He gestured towards Marcus with a hand. The kangaroo filled one whole corner of the room, sitting back on his tail and hunching his shoulders, trying to make himself look as small as possible. \"No one gets that big that fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid put up a hand. \"Would you just listen for a minute? That's not what we're talking about here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what ARE you talking about?\" Tyler sounded impatient, his voice taking on that bratty whine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to tell you if you would just let me fucking finish!\" David's voice rose, but not too much. \"We're...hanging out all the time because...\" His throat choked on that last bit. Because he and Marcus have been blackmailed into doing shit by someone who could see everything they're doing? The truth would be much easier to say, but it was still so crazy. \"...because we're going out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler just stared for a moment. David looked down at the floor under that gaze, the only time he was unable to look his brother in the eye. \"Wait...you and Marcus are dating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just nodded. He couldn't imagine how embarrassed Marcus must be right now, though if the kangaroo was anywhere near as mentally exhausted as he was, he was probably beyond caring at this point. This was just another trial to get through, another slap in the face to be endured...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler got up quickly and hugged David, much to the older dragon's surprise. He froze immediately, curling his hands into fists just so he'd have something to do with them. This...out of everything he had been anticipating, this was the last thing he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome! David, I never would have guessed! Man, that's...wow!\" Tyler was genuinely excited, grinning from ear to proverbial ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stared open-mouthed at his younger brother. \"You mean you're not disgusted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I be disgusted, dude? It's a relief, honestly! I thought...you know how mom and dad feel about gays. I just thought I would never be able to tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's heart sunk. Oh no, this couldn't be happening. \"Don't tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler beamed and spread his arms out. \"It's amazing, isn't it? Maybe there's something to that whole genetic thing people were talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, David's phone went off. He knew exactly who it was before pulling it out of his pocket, his heart pounding in his chest. A would never let up, would he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled it out, excused himself, and read the text message. It said</span></div></div>",

We'll talk about this later.\" The little purple dragon opens his mouth to say something, but David's already dragged Marcus back out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quickly walked towards the car, Marcus close behind. \"Wait, what happened?\" David scowls as he looks at the roo. \"what do you think happened? A, as always, wants you to get bigger. I'm done with this, we're leaving the area until things calm down. Shit's getting out of control Marcus.\" David threw open the driver's side door and turned the ignition. \"You can get in or you can fend for yourself dude, take your pick.\" The giant roo hesitated before squeezing into the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shifted into reverse and pulled out onto the road, making quick time towards the main highway going west. He'd had enough of this. A was ruining his life, Marcus's life, everyone was having their lives thrown into disarray, all for someone's megalomaniacal fantasy. David couldn't think of anything more fucked up than the situation he was in right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned onto the highway, he noticed no other vehicles; the highway was oddly empty save for a few big trucks and semi's. Normally there was a substantial amount of traffic at this hour. He merged onto the right lane and held the gas pedal down as he sped towards the hinterlands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hardly noticed the king-sized pickup coming up behind, painted in black, its windows tinted. It was when the truck began tailgating him that he realized they were a little too close for comfort. Sure enough, the truck sped up, and rammed into the tailgate of the ute, a <i>BOOM</i> hard enough to jolt Marcus and David forward into the dashboard. The truck fell back a little bit, but was still close enough to give it another try. At first, David had started to pull off the road, but as the truck took another wipe at his backside, he realized the full extent of the situation. So <i>this</i> was how A was going to force them to get Marcus bigger - give him a pill, or kill them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid swerved into the other lane trying to shake the oversized Ford following behind. Marcus was desperately trying to take down the license and call it into Officer Fletcher - it might be another key in figuring out who A is, and getting out of this mess. The trick was, this was running on the assumption he would live long enough to talk to his dad. The big truck swerved, missing the rear left fender by inches. Marcus recognized it as a PIT maneuver, a tactic police use to try and stop high-speed chases. There was hardly a doubt at this point that if David pulled over, they'd both be in even greater peril. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus yelled at David to stop the truck. \"It's me they want David! Pull off and let me get out, I'd rather them run me down then get you killed!\" The dragon gave him a quick glance, as if he had just gone crazy. \"Marc, they will kill you. They're obviously trying right now. Here, grab my phone from my pocket, call the police and give them a descripti-  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOM</i>. The tailgate was now hanging down, substantially damaged, the rear bumper partially dislodged. The big truck had a dented bumper and grille, but was otherwise hardly worse for wear. David slammed on the gas, trying to put as much distance between them as possible. \"fuck David, there's not time! Pull into the median and drive onto the other side, it'll give me a moment to get out!\" David, caught up in the heat of the moment, shouted back at the muscular roo. \"No! I won't do it! I won't let them hurt you!\" The two of them exchanged shocked glances as a final slam, more of a <i>BASH</i> than a boom (probably a taillight being shattered) knocked them onto the side of the road. The big truck kept right on going, rounding the bend and not coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, David and Marcus heaved prayers from the battered ute, lying wounded on the dusty side of the highway. David picked up his phone to call the police when he saw another message from A, all caps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">DO AS I SAY OR I WILL KILL YOU BOTH. THE POLICE WILL NOT SAVE YOU. GIVE HIM THE PILL IN THE GLOVE BOX, NOW.</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shed a tear as he opened the glove box, to see a single white pill mixed in with the maps. He knew that was slowly destroying Marcus's chances on living a normal life. His lips were trembling as he grabbed it and walked towards the oversize kangaroo. \"I'm...I'm sorry, Marc.\" As Marcus began to step away, David launched himself onto him, catching him by surprise. He shoved the pill into Marcus's mouth before he could clench it shut. Marcus swallowed, while David stepped away, clearly ashamed to be playing any role in growing Marcus into a behemoth.Marcus looked at him, his eyes full of anger and dismay, before he collapsed onto the ground again, writhing in the dust. David did not expect what happened next.</span></div></div>",

As he watched Marcus writhe on the ground, the way Marcus' limbs flailed about, like the kangaroo was trying to put out a fire that burned underneath his skin. As he watched the spittle froth and foam at Marcus' mouth, the kangaroo venting the intense pain. As he watched the dangerous, deadly gaze the oversized marsupial was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pill... it didn't knock Marcus out. David gulped and took another step back. Sure enough, Marcus' fiery gaze followed him. David could see it, Marcus' intent to kill glinting obviously in his eyes. In a terrifying display of ferocity, Marcus flipped himself onto his feet and rose to his full imposing height. David took another step back, unable to keep his footing and falling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" the kangaroo seethed, his voice incredible, impossibly low. David watched as Marcus loomed over him, the bestial marsupial's chest heaving in pain.

He watched as Marcus displayed his power as his shoulders widened, lats flaring, arms ballooning up with a surge of strength. Marcus cracked his neck, adjusting to his new bone structure. To David's horror, he saw Marcus licking over his lips, as if he revelled in his new changes, the changes that continued to ravage through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo bent down, his massive body crawling over the drake. David's heart was racing and almost peed himself; Marcus was just so much larger than him now. It was painfully obvious he was larger than Fang, the kangaroo's arms thicker, chest stronger, and if what David was feeling grinding into his own chest, Marcus was much much larger down there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus,\" the drake whimpered. \"Don't do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\" the kangaroo hissed, a manic joy coursing through his expression mixed with the intense pain of his continued growth. Marcus grabbed the side of David's head lifting it up to brush their snouts together. \"Didn't you say you didn't want them to hurt me, David?\" He took a deep good look at the fear in David's eyes, lapping it up. He slammed the dragon's head into the dirt, revelling in the acute pain he was causing the drake. \"They didn't hurt me, David. You did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus,\" David mouthed, tears rolling down his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Marcus roared into David's face. \"I'm not gonna stop.\" For emphasis, Marcus began to rub David's head along the ground. \"I trusted you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dragged me into this, you fuck,\" David spat back, the dragon has his hands grasping at Marcus' forearms, a desperate attempt to peel Marcus off him. Though he tried to act defiant, he knew he was no match to giant Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus chuckle derisively. \"You've betrayed me for the last time, David.\" The superior look on Marcus' face disappeared as he began to sneer menacingly. \"You beat me when I come out to you. You deny that you're a faggot like me. You let Fang maul me. You grew me.\" Marcus was snorting like a bull, low rumbling resonating from his chest as he grew and grew. \"You know what you are, David? You're weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to save your life,\" David cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save my life?\" Marcus laughed mirthlessly. \"You're ruining it,\" he says lowly. Marcus sat up, crushing his whole weight into David's torso. A wicked grin spread across his face. \"I'm gonna ruin you, David.\" The drake's eyes widened as he felt Marcus get onto his haunches and turn around to rip David's pants right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus! Please,\" David cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a say. Just like I don't have a say when I grow. From now on, you don't get a say whenever I want to fuck you. Whenever I want to make you my cumrag like the little faggot you really are,\" the kangaroo sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus, I'm sorry-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" Marcus chuckled. \"No you're not, you like watching me grow, don't you? Is that why you're fucking hard right now?!\" David winced as he felt Marcus' incredibly strong paw close around his shaft. \"Admit it!\" David shook his head with fervour. Marcus brought a hand up to strangle David, his rage building to new heights. With his airway blocked, David began to nod his head to get Marcus to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith forced consent, the drake felt a sharp pain around his butt; that's when he noticed Marcus' hand down there, forcing his fingers into his tailhole. \"Marcus, don't. I don't want this,\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I do,\" the kangaroo hissed. \"Either take me up the ass, or guzzle down my load.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid peered down to look at the giant cock jutting out of Marcus' groin. The oozing head of the shaft bobbed just underneath the marsupial's shelf-like pecs. It was too big; much much too big. That monster would rip him in half. David gulped a shuddered. \"I'll suck you off Marcus,\" he whimpered, tears rolling down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" Marcus grunted as he began to shift up, rolling his giant testes all over David's strong body. \"Open wide,\" he snorted. David obeyed and Marcus mercilessly fed the head of his dick into the dragon's mouth. David whined as he felt it enter. The flavour was musky, tangy even; the taste of Marcus' pre flooding his senses. But David didn't have time to realize just how much he liked the taste, because Marcus was a relentless master. The roo pushed his cock further and further into David's maw. David had never put a dick into his mouth, he never even tried sucking himself off even though he was flexible and big enough. And because of his inexperience, he pricked Marcus' shaft with his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis angered the beast Marcus had become. \"You fuckin' bite me again...\" Marcus showed no mercy, in an act of retribution, he forced another inch of himself into David with each word. \"And I'll... split... your fucking... head... in half.\" David was trying in vain to push at Marcus' abdomen, weak hands grasping and pushing at the expanding landscape of the roo's stomach. David couldn't breathe, his eyes beginning to roll back as Marcus rage-fucked his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing David suffer drove Marcus wild, exciting the kangaroo. Here David was, the dragon he swore he loved in high school, the dragon who systematically ignored him for so many years. And now? David couldn't ignore him. No one could. He felt his growth stopping and stopped to look himself over. Eight feet, he had to be eight feet even now. Before he looked like Fang. Now? Now he was superior, dwarfing the runty wolf. There was no doubt in the new Marcus' mind that he'd have his revenge against Fang. He giggled with manic glee and thought how red's such a nice colour on the midnight coated wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExerting his power, exerting his dominance. Marcus loved it. He felt himself beginning to let loose into David's mouth. The giant kangaroo bellowed into the early night sky as he released into David's mouth. He winced as he left his cock throb, the seal so tight in the drake's maw, with each colossal pulse of blood into his shaft, he could feel his dick pushing into David's fangs. The mix of pleasure and pain sent fireworks through Marcus' brain, the sex addling him and he found himself losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus felt his eyes flit open. He felt dirty and lifted a paw to his face, he was covered in dust and grime. Where... where was he? He sat up and looked over himself, a sickening feeling washing over him. He was gigantic, the largest guy in the city. Fang couldn't even compare to his build, the wolf looked like superheavyweight bodybuilder; Marcus looked like a bloated freak of muscle. He... he felt like freak now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt sorry for himself he heard something. It sounded like... sniffling. He turned around to see David on his hands and knees, heaving. He watched as the drake brought a couple of fingers into his mouth. The next moment he saw the dragon begin to retch, milky white liquid being expelled from his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?\" Marcus said cautiously. Did he do that? He looked down, there was semen smeared all around his crotch area, the cum just beginning to crust on his fur. He looked back to the dragon who was staring at him with... With fear? Marcus began to crawl over to the drake. David reacted by backing away, reflexively shrinking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from me,\" the drake gargled through the liquid in his mouth, spitting the last part out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, I-I'm sorry,\" Marcus pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not,\" David panted, sitting down to face Marcus. The kangaroo approached slowly. David was stilled scared of the kangaroo; Marcus had just raped him, almost suffocated him. And when he felt Marcus' arms wrap around him, he feared the worst. However, instead of feeling Marcus' paws wring his neck, he felt himself being pulled into a hug, the giant that encompassed him shuddering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't me. You know I'm not like that,\" Marcus sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you are anymore,\" David replied flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus felt his anger beginning to stir, a newfound rage building in him. He felt the urge to swipe at David, enact his fervour. But before he had the chance... there was a beeping coming from the tatters of David's trousers. Marcus got up and made his way over to it to look at the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Don't you ever fuck with me again, boys. But I'll show you some mercy, I called daddy to come pick you up.</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTwenty six dollars and ninety nine cents, thank you.\u201d A new year, a new apartment. After his lunkheaded roommate flunked out last semester, Marcus found he was only able to afford a stunningly drab building with no view, no decoration, and no fun. Most of the time, he decided to hang with friends to escape the sheer boredom of his sanctuary, but there were some things he could only do at home. To liven the place up, he had decided to visit the antique shop and pick up some exotic piece of the old world to add an air of mystery to his apartment. He had picked out a strange brass orb, warm to the touch and inscribed with bizarre and arcane symbols. It looked cool, as far as he was concerned, so he figured he\u2019d buy the thing and put it on his coffee table. Marcus passed a fistful of cash to the shopkeeper, an elderly fox wearing a faded purple suit who just wouldn\u2019t stop grinning his wry grin. With the vague, ominous feeling that he had just been scammed, Marcus took his change and his mysterious ball home with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk home brought the \u2018roo back, climbing up several stories to his door. He slipped himself in and set the antique on his table, admiring how it glowed softly in the middle of the room. A good purchase, he thought to himself! Marcus left the orb sitting quietly on the table as he went to the kitchen to make himself something to eat, unaware that deep within the sphere something was stirring. Having laid dormant for centuries, a powerful force awoke with Marcus\u2019 life force prodding it gently. Slowly it gained awareness of the dingy apartment it was held within, plotting and planning its next move while Marcus chopped up some vegetation in the other room. The marsupial finished up, inelegantly plonking his food down on the table and switching the TV on, putting his large, valuable paws up on the coffee table next to the orb. He had to look out for those puppies, being that they defined his football career! As he ate, watching the mindless drivel spewing forth from the television, he sighed with boredom. There wasn\u2019t anything good on the sports channel, boring reality TV crap on the mainstream channels, rerun after rerun on the comedy channel... he glanced around his room, finding his laptop laid under a vest that smelt vaguely like the locker room. Throwing it across the room with a grimace, he picked up the computer, deciding to log on and check out some more... sensual material. If nothing else, it\u2019d cure his boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned as he checked out his usual series of sites, clicking through the same old tired shit. His circle of friends, all of whom were generally bigger and more outgoing than the relatively meek marsupial, tended to dominate the field when they were all out on the town, meaning Marcus came home alone more often than he liked. This hadn\u2019t done wonders for his porn browsing habits \u2013 he was so desensitised to everything he saw! With a frustrated grunt, Marcus wondered if he had really seen everything, moving to close the page he was on when something caught his eye. In a thumbnail, a stunningly attractive gryphon leered at him, her body the image of aggressive femininity. His attention suitably captured, he loaded up the video with a grin, loosening his belt in preparation. Marcus watched entranced, unable to stop himself pawing vigorously at his throbbing member as the sultry gryphon gracefully flitted across the screen, sensually playing with herself and posing for the world to see. Hypnotised, Marcus didn\u2019t notice his paw creeping across the table, as an errant jerk of his leg sent the brassy orb falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he did notice was the awful racket it made as it shattered, cracking against a table leg and exploding into thousands of pieces. It sounded as though the heavens themselves were sundered, a large cracking noise booming through his apartment and startling him from his reverie. As he looked around the dingy room, worried, he felt a peculiar sensation grab him deep within his chest, as though someone was ripping his heart right out. He gasped, breathless, as strange energy flooded into his body and a whispering voice called out to him...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Marcus stared, horrified, the glimmering energy in the room burned brilliantly crimson for a moment before solidifying, a lean, grinning goat with sharp, sharklike teeth and a forked tail emerging from the light. He wore a finely tailored suit with a dark, blood red tie, and deep black eyes  which stared murderously at the marsupial, who found himself somewhat at a loss with his pants around his ankles and his rapidly wilting junk staring the figure in the face.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease allow me to introduce myself. I\u2019m a man of wealth and taste.\u201d said the odd creature standing before Marcus, his thick, syrupy voice holding the bewildered roo momentarily entranced. \u201cI\u2019m joking, of course, I just always wanted to use that line. I\u2019m Asmodeus, and you\u2019re my ticket home, so thanks for that. I really appreciate it. You\u2019re a stellar guy.\u201d Marcus gulped as he stared into the strange goatlike monster\u2019s permanent toothy grin, the sharp teeth cutting an imposing presence in the room despite the figure\u2019s relatively unimposing physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me cut to the chase, Marcus.\u201d purred Asmodeus, staring out the window as he admired the barren view of the next building\u2019s wall. \u201cYou did me a favour just then. I\u2019d been trapped in there for quite some time, and well, let me tell you, if you\u2019ve never been stuck inside a ball for thousands of years, it\u2019s not something I\u2019d personally recommend. I\u2019m blathering again. I have a reward for you!\u201d Turning on the heel of his delicately shined shoe, Asmodeus turned to face Marcus, who was ogling the figure, regarding him with an unsteady suspicion. \u201cSee, we have a connection now, you and I. I\u2019d like to think I understand the problems you face. Like Fang, for instance. And David. How awful of them to constantly showboat and leave you out of the spotlight! A handsome fellow with finely defined calves such as yourself... it\u2019s a sin, Marcus, it really is.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW...what the fuck?\u201d stammered Marcus, staring slack jawed at the horned figure before him. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense \u2013 how do you know that? What are you?\u201d The goat took a moment before diving right back into his fast and furious oration, every inch the picture of a salesman from hell.<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a connection, Marcus. A connection! Me and you, buddy, against the world. We\u2019ll give \u2018em hell, my friend, you\u2019ll see! Those clumsy cretins with all their expertly defined musculature and their killer size and weight advantage... that reward I mentioned will level the playing field, and soon the crowd won\u2019t be chanting for the big bad wolf. All eyes will be on you, amigo. All of them. I can make you huge. I can make you rich, famous, an object of desire \u2013 every guy wants to be you, every girl wants to be with you! But don\u2019t just say yes. Let me show you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... don\u2019t really understand.\u201d Marcus mumbled, the cogs in his mind churning as they failed to process the madness of the situation. Asmodeus strode up to the ruminating roo, standing over the couch and offering him a hand with wicked, black claws. <br>\r\n\u201cErr, should I put my pants on?\u201d asked the roo, confused as he stared up at the figure before him, reaching out slowly to take his hand...<br>\r\n\u201cEh, I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d said the creature with his demonic smile, plunging his claws deep into Marcus\u2019 chest. With a yelp of surprise, the roo lashed out with powerful legs, but merely managed to flail around and get tangled up in his waistband as a burning sensation spread from his chest outwards. The goat\u2019s unwavering, staring smile seemed to diminish slightly as the peculiar feeling agonizingly turned from pleasure into pain, every individual muscle on the roo\u2019s body feeling caressed and deeply massaged by the strange energies. It was like working out with none of the effort, and all of the sweet payoff, as he noticed... wait, was he growing, or was Asmodeus shrinking?<br>\r\n\u201cBoth, actually. Oh, sorry, I do forget it\u2019s rude to read minds once you\u2019re inside someone. I\u2019m giving you my very special gift, and I do hope you appreciate it. For legal reasons I do have to tell you that stealing the essence of your fatheaded footballer friends \u2013 including size, muscle mass, genitalia size, and general well-being \u2013 does directly benefit me. But that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re buddies, right?\u201d said the goat, his voice still silkily wrapping itself around Marcus. <br>\r\n\u201cOh man, if I can do this shit to Fang, yeah, I think we\u2019re buddies.\u201d said Marcus, breathless with pleasure as he looked down at his pants. Pulling them up, slightly, he noticed they had become an incredibly tight fit! His normally-powerful haunches seemed even more packed with muscle, and tan fur outlined the sheer strength behind the abdominals peeking out from under his t-shirt, which was becoming uncomfortably tight. <br>\r\n\u201cSix inches should do you for now.\u201d smiled Asmodeus with a wink, looking rather less imposing as he shrunk in his suit. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on you. Just promise me one thing \u2013 make sure you enjoy my... not so little gift. It\u2019s tricky at first, though. Get lots of practice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash, he was gone again, brilliant red sparks announcing his departure. Closing his laptop quietly, He stood to his full height, admiring the new definition in his muscles as he flexed them, testing their power. A quick glance down at his cock revealed it had grown with him \u2013 an impressive eight inch slab of meat jutting from his crotch. It seemed a little bigger than he remembered, but was he going to complain? Not one bit, good sir. He slid his pants off, a wry grin forming on his muzzle as he checked out his muscular legs, tracing his paws gently against them to test the thick, powerful muscle. Grabbing his baggiest sweatpants and workout top, Marcus decided to hit the town with a splash of cologne, leaving the apartment in order to head out to the college\u2019s sports bar. Fang would no doubt be there, and if David\u2019s dorky brother Tyler wasn\u2019t busy making him dress up in silly costumes, he might find the big blue dragon hanging out too. As the roo walked the streets, brimming with confidence in his 7\u2019 form, he bumped into somebody along the way while lost in narcissistic glee and malevolent eagerness to make himself the hugest guy on the team... maybe even in the town.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marcus was startled from his narcissistic reverie as the sounds of hissing, spitting and swearing erupted from under his paws. With a worried look down, he noticed he had bumped into David's little brother, the diminutive dragon Tyler.<br>\r\n\"Goddammit, Marcus, watch where you're putting those oversized hunks of meat!\" spat Tyler, dusting off his jacket as he picked himself up, staring up at the marauding marsupial. A grin crept across the roo\u2019s face at about the same time as gears started to turn in Tyler\u2019s head, a puzzled look twisting the corners of his mouth.<br>\r\n\u201c...fuck, man, have you been working out? You\u2019re huge!\u201d stammered Tyler, staring at the tight sweatpants that outlined perfectly the definition of the roo\u2019s powerful thighs and calves, not to mention the tight bulge prominently displayed ominously close to the dragon\u2019s snout. \u201cYou... uh, gotta share your workout routine with me, maybe I can finally put David in his place.\u201d He added, jokingly.<br>\r\nTyler watched with hesitation as the roo clapped a large, muscular arm on his shoulder, strong digits digging into his leathery hide with an iron grip. <br>\r\n\u201cShare my secrets?\u201d Marcus said, growling with pure pleasure. \u201cHmm... I think I can share them with you, little man, but it\u2019ll be me who puts David in his place. Fang, too, along with anybody else who thinks that they can get away with ignoring me.\u201d Tyler\u2019s eyes widened in fear as he began to struggle against the roo\u2019s steely grip, as a strange, awful feeling began to flood into him. He felt sick, head ringing and stomach churning like the aftermath of a bad hangover, and he began to feel weak and shaky. Marcus, on the other hand, purred with pleasure as burning passion wracked his form and growth took hold of him once more. He stared down at the purple drake as inch after tantalizing inch was sucked away from Tyler, adding themselves to Marcus\u2019 lengthening frame as muscle and bone thickened to accommodate the extra height. Tyler took on a shocked look of realisation as he began to understood the situation \u2013 the roo was stealing his meagre size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcus? MARCUS! Stop this, please!\u201d pleaded Tyler, frantically thrashing in the roo\u2019s growing handpaw as he tried to escape. \u201cI\u2019m too small already! If I get any shorter, David\u2019s gonna make my life even more miserable! Please, Marcus! What if I took you to him? I know where he is! Fang, too!\u201d Tyler gulped as he looked down to see Marcus\u2019 already straining waistband struggling with the effort required to hold back his beastly endowment, diamond-hard as pleasure surged into the marsupial. \u201cC-come on, Marcus, don\u2019t do this to me...\u201d whined the dragon, a headache throbbing through his skull as Marcus started panting with sheer ecstasy, tongue lolling and eyes rolling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the stuff.\u201d Marcus growled, as half a foot in size transferred itself between him and Tyler. The purple dragon\u2019s unimpressive physique became less so as he shrank, what miniscule musculature he had obtained by the mundanities of everyday life diminishing before his eyes. Marcus, on the other hand, swelled up and out, his tight t-shirt beginning to rip over his thick washboard abs and the powerful biceps that were beginning to form. His powerful legs shredded the sweatpants clinging to his thighs, relieving some of the pressure and maintaining a parody of modesty as the fabric barely hid his thick, meaty cock. And meaty it was \u2013 though Tyler was in no condition to notice, the mammoth member had stolen a fair proportion of his considerable length, leaving the erect endowment at almost a foot in length, palmable nuts outlined against the straining fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping Tyler to the ground with his now-outsized clothes, the roo pinned him to the sidewalk with a heavy paw as he breathed a deep sigh of satisfaction, running a hand across the member trapped against his ruined sweatpants. 8\u2019 of solid muscle leered down at 4\u2019 of scrawny dragon, who gawked up awkwardly in fear.<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, you\u2019ve done me a favour, but now you\u2019re going to do me one more...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In truth, Chris was a genius. He was gifted in math and science to an absurd degree, out-teaching some of his professors by his sophomore year. He was so good in fact that he had started doing after class projects, and helping professors with some of their graduate work, or even their university mandated research. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with great genius came great sacrifices. Even though Chris had always been an attractive, if average guy, he was still very much a virgin. He had had girlfriends come and go, but had never felt comfortable with them. He had even tried it out with a guy at one point, but all that proved was that he was bisexual. After twenty years of virginity, Chris had all but given up on relationships. He loved his work and figured that after a breakthrough, after something big happened in his life when it came to the field of science, maybe then he'd start working in other realms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a man has his needs. And Chris, above all others, had -needs-. For all his talk about how he didn't mind being a virgin, about how science was the most important part of his life, Chris was one horn-dog of an individual in private. He had more kinks than even he found reasonable, and none greater than the thought of being able to use his abilities to create something masterful, something powerful. Or specifically... some-one- powerful. He fantasized about making growth rays, or hormones and just... feeding someone who he was attracted to, watching them react as they got bigger and more powerful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, nothing like that had managed to come up at college. Hormone treatments stayed in the realm of unfortunate reality, made to treat people with deficiencies, not with the need for more. Growth rays had been rumored, but normally ended up being hoaxes, just taped together bits of plastic with a rock in them. Chris, beyond his better judgment though always looked into people claiming they had the next best thing. Treatments for overly short furs, like mice or other rodents, who had trouble living in a world of variable sizes. Treatments that promised women that they could get the leg up on their man, and get taller and more powerful. Nothing seemed to be finished. The few that worked seemed to be unstable, giving unpredictable and sometimes destructive results. But secretly, Chris had been taking notes. He noticed what failed, what succeeded, and made sure to ask plenty of questions of the happy Q&amp;A staff when he saw something with promise, the staff normally just happy that anyone showed up at all and willing to give out what were in essence, trade secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was his getting to the end of his junior year. He was obsessed with his work, still a 20 year old virgin with plenty of time, and plenty of school materials that he could utilize to help him in his goal. He had started to work tirelessly on this new project, even going so far as to ask professors for their opinions or their help. He got nothing helpful of the first, and none of the second, but he had pressed on. After a couple of months of constant testing, he finally had something he could be proud in. It may still have some flaws, but as he looked down, he couldn't help but be proud of his...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After his months of hard work, Chris had finally come across the secret formula to making an actually stable high powered hormone treatment. High doses of growth hormones, mixed with a various assortment of blockers and a healthy dose of pain medication combined together accidentally created the perfect ratio for him one day, making his lab mouse balloon up to twice its former size, adding on a tad bit of muscle mass as well, with no foreseeable side effects. It was a wonderful discovery for him, all those months of sleepless nights, of droning over old books and his notes he had taken from other failed attempts finally paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he even began to search for a test subject, he had made a good two hundred pills. He had no illusions about what he was doing after all: he was going to be creating a monster with this. What he had created had little to no medicinal value, and only a small aesthetic value that he could market. No, this was entirely an example of him producing something for himself. He wanted to see someone grow, and so he went about creating the perfect formula for such an occasion. And here he was, holding that formula made flesh in his hands. It was a beautiful thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who to use it on? Chris had thought about this for weeks. He had a particular fondness for saurians, reptiles, and dragons, but he also had fond memories of his former boyfriend, a wolf anthro. He had even thought of just going with a human, before writing it off. While it would be just as entertaining, he wanted to go all out. His fantasy involved the 'stranger' species, those that aren't human. He has come this far, is willing to do so much for this, willing to potentially sacrifice his entire livelihood, if not his life itself to see it come true. Why go half way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled as he finally got all of his experimental pills sorted into individual bottles, and shoved them all into a big knapsack. Two hundred, split evenly in bottles of twenty. He breathed deeply as he left the lab, thinking of what he was about to do. Part of his brain was outright rejecting the thought. He had to admit it was insane. He half believed throughout the entire research process that he'd hit a wall, that he'd realize it was just impossible, give up, and return to the world of the normal and living to find a girlfriend his own size, and live out the suburban dream. A wife, two and a half kids and a dog. But now that he had one of his deepest, darkest, filthiest desires staring back at him, he couldn't help but use it. Who would? He had the abilities to become a supervillain... no, he had the abilities to forge a -god-. To throw that away now and just pretend like all this work was for nothing was as insane as him starting it in the first place. He had signed his deal with the devil, now it was time to create an even more powerful evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, all that was left was the choice of a test subject...</span></div></div>",

Chris knew he was a bodybuilder, and generally loved looking down at people. Hell, Chris had been the butt of a couple of Fang's jokes in the past, which almost made Chris write Fang off right there, but... but. There was a certain special something that Chris couldn't help but overlook when it came to Fang. To see someone so powerful, just get even more so made Chris weak in the knees. He'd love to just toss his medicine at him, and watch as Fang went to town, literally, on everything around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Fang could also be unpredictable. He'd have no way to control him. Once he handed the first bottle of pills to Fang, he was putting a big \"I know how to make you even stronger\" sign over his head. There is no telling that Fang wouldn't just gobble his entire knapsack full of pills and get unfathomably large within seconds. No fun in watching someone go from seven feet to seven million in a matter of milliseconds... least it wasn't what Chris wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also Ryan, the rather shy introverted wolf, almost the exact opposite of Fang in every way except one: Ryan was also a star athlete. Ryan was one of the star swimmers of his College's swim team, and he looked the part. A bit dorky, but beautifully cut. Chris had to admit that Ryan's body more than suited what Chris liked in a man, but... but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's psychological profile was a bit more iffy. From what Chris knew about him, Ryan had never shown too much interest in much of anyone or anything. This lead to a bit of a blank slate for him, which Chris didn't like the chances of. After all, a blank slate could go one of two ways: Ryan could be like Fang, and toss back all of Chris's pills in a matter of seconds. Or, Ryan could laugh Chris off and leave him without a test subject at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men had their pros and cons, now it was just time to pick...</span></div></div>",

Nice to meet you.\" Ryan shook Chris's hand apprehensively, before just looking down at the knapsack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you got in there that made such a racket, a bunch of glass?\" Chris blinked, and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no actually, its... well, let me explain. Ryan, have you ever found yourself wanting to be a more powerful athlete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan backed up, blinking, before standing up. \"No, I don't want steroids dude, I don't know what you are trying to get me do but it ain't happening. I stay clean for my own health and so I don't get kicked off the swim team. Thanks but no thanks creep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-no! Its not steroids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan paused and looked back at Chris curiously. \"Then what was that about wanting to be a more 'powerful athlete?' You implying there is a pill that just gives me that and isn't a steroid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well... yes. You see I've been working on modified growth hormonal treatment for people who are uh... vertically and muscularly challenged. Species like mice, and other rodents have always had a hard time getting into sports due to their natural prey nature. However, before we test it on any mice morphs, and especially before we bring this miracle drug to market, we wanted to test it on a current athlete. You know, to see the effects on a body already made for sports. We may also use you as an advertising agent, paid of course, if everything goes well.\" Chris turned to his knapsack to hide a sigh. He wasn't sure where half that stuff just came from, but he hoped it sounded convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 alright? I had heard something about some new stuff coming out of the pharmacology department. Never expected them to be working on a new sports wonder drug, what with all the eggheads in there normally thinking sports aren't important for a college to have.\" Ryan shrugged, before looking down at the knapsack. \"So...how many did you bring? I mean, I'm guessing this is going to be like a once a day thing? And is there any paperwork I need to sign? Seems kinda risky for the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, no paperwork. You take two to three pills once a day. If you start getting results, we would like you to use more at your own discretion, but stopping after a bottle a day. There are twenty pills in there. This way we can do a few weeks worth of strenuous research on you in about one week. Its a cost saving measure, and the pills have not been known to have any side effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 an entire bottle? You sure? Wouldn't that make me into the hulk or some shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the increased mass is perfectly within safety guidelines. Here.\" Chris finally managed to grab a bottle, and put it into Ryan's hands. \"Try two here, I'm curious to see how they work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan looked at Chris incredulously. However, Chris couldn't help but smile as Ryan finally seemed to just buckle under peer pressure. He popped open the bottle, and shook out three pills, before popping them in his mouth and swallowing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 okay. How long until thes-...\" Ryan started to ask, however he was cut off. Chris looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, they should be rather... immediate.\" Chris looked at Ryan as Ryan's eyes went wide. He was looking down at himself, and already Chris could see the effects hit him. Ryan's shirt, tight as it was, was starting to rip already from the sudden influx of muscle mass. It finally gave way, revealing Ryan's swimmers body had grown even more toned and cut, his muscles not getting bigger so much as tighter, more efficient, only adding mass to areas that were a little soft before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh, that worked... -really- well.\" Ryan said, looking down with a bit of disbelief, but also fascination about his new body. However, it wasn't over. With a sudden yelp, Chris couldn't help but stare, mouth wide, as Ryan started to grow upwards as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you didn't tell me this was going to make me taller!\" Ryan looked down at Chris, looking somewhat betrayed at first. However Chris saw Ryan's eyes close, and his shocked expression turn to a smile. \"Mmm, though I have to admit this feels.... r-r-really good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's pant started to rip, the baggy jeans not being able to carry the excess size of Ryan's growing legs. His entire body had shot up by about two feet, leaving him at about eight and a half feet tall. His shoes had been ruined, Ryan's big clawed toes sticking out the front. And Chris couldn't help but notice with a goofy grin the outline of Ryan's shaft against his much tighter pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now...\"</span></div></div>",

But this stuffs... legal right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-perfectly.\u201d Chris said, getting a bit worried. He wasn't sure how much growth would occur if all those twenty pills would do, but he couldn't argue that he didn't want to see it. \u201cT-though...\u201d he started, before realizing Ryan had already tossed the bottle back, not even really waiting for any other prompt. Chris swallowed in time with Ryan, though for much different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan groaned, before a big goofy smile took over his face. He could feel it, that wonderful rush return. He felt his shoes snap and break off his feet, the hard leather not standing a chance over his growing paws. He felt his jeans start to snap, the denim fraying and going loose before finally snapping and falling off him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to grow, growling into the air, eyes closed, he could feel his shirt going next,the thin fabric of his undershirt quickly evaporating, blasting into a thousand individual stitches, before the shirt he had over it started to rip and shear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he opened his eyes, and couldn't help but choke on his own spit in surprise over how big he had gotten. He should have known, what with two pills giving him a few feet... but as he looked around the campus, he was probably somewhere close to thirty or forty feet, muscles thick and gorgeous. He snickered a bit as he flexed his bicep, kissing it for the crowd. He could still feel himself grow a little bit, but for the most part it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmpf....~ God that is some good stuff....\u201d Ryan said, still panting excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had been silent this entire time, as were any other spectator up until this point. Stunned from the sudden rise of this new... well, this new God of sorts, right there in front of them. He could only watch as Ryan just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Never seen a wolf before?\u201d Ryan said, a new confidence being found in his voice as his hand trailed across his toned stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm... I could get used to this view...\u201d Ryan said, a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes...\u201d Chris said shakily, a mixture of pure lust and terror filling his voice. His dream had come true, that darkest desire sat right in front of him. That big paw was not but a foot or two away from his shaky outstretched hand, and yet every fiber of his being was telling him this was wrong, that he should turn away now and run for the hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhats wrong, I thought this was what you wanted?\u201d Ryan said, chuckling down at Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it was...\u201d Chris said simply, pressing his hand against the side of one of Ryan's new massive feet. \u201cI... d-didn't expect so quickly...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do I get the acting gig?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-.... what?\u201d Chris said, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the commercial. I thought you were going to use me as a testimonial? Cause this stuff rocks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris paused for a moment, not even sure what the hell he was saying, before it all came back to him. His lies, his cover story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh! Y-yes of course...\u201d Chris said, sighing as he moved his hand through the soft fur of his first real test subjects toes. \u201cY-you got the gig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, nice. I dunno little dude this stuff does seem to have some side effects though. I definitely am a bit more comfortable with people now. Though I guess maybe most of that is knowing I'm the best hunk around.\u201d He thumps a hand against his chest, before giving Chris a goofy smile. \u201cThough really, I think its the dick that's the coup de grace.

On second thought, Chris disregarded the form and just placed the ray into his backpack and putting his jacket back on. It was quite rainy outside and Chris couldn't think of a perfect night to test his new invention. Closing his dorm door, and stepping into the nights rain, Chris quickly ran to his friends house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing in on his friends house, he could only hope that Demitry was in the mood for another round of testing. Having been the subject of some of his previous, non-lethal projects, he knew Demitry would either have to be all in or all out on this new escapade. Of course convincing him to let him in would also be a huge step too, as Demitry was a force to reckon with.

The dragon looked down and frowned at the sight of his friend. \"Oh... hey Chris.. what is it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was just wondering, y'know, if i could just come inside for a bit, or something, just to um-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemitry held out his hand to stop Chris from talking anymore. Slowly rubbing his forehead the Dragon had to reply reluctantly to his somewhat intrusive friend. \"Look Chris.. i'd love to test some sort of growth hormone or whatever kind of serum... but not today pal.. i'm kind of tired, and i had a hard day at work.\" The large lizard began to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Demitry, you owe me one remember? Last saturday? That red light you almost missed had it not been from my nagging to eye the road.\" Demitry bit his lip and couldn't help but remember that fateful day.

Chris could only marvel at his large friend before rummaging into his backpack and pulling out the growth ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue lizard walked into the room placing a shirt over his head, obstructing over his eyes. \"Alright Chris, whats on your mind buddy..\" Finished clothing himself Demitry met the gaze of the barrel of the ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suprise big guy.\"</span></div></div>",

I get it completely\" Chris stared up to angry looking behemoth of a dragon, arms crossed and a solid frown expressed on his face. \"I told you Chris, i wasn't up to anymore more tests. But now this? Not even a waver? Not even a warning?\" With his hands on his hips and a glaring grimace bending down over Chris. \"Am I just some kind of test subject to you?\" Chris stared awkwardly into his friends eyes, wanting to just shrink and run away... shrink. Wait a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demitry i can...uegh.. explain.. really.\" Chris tried to be reasonable but he knew he couldn't stand up to his friend.. up until he found that Demitry was beginning to become taller. \"Uhh Demitry..?\" The dragon raised a brow to his friend as he noticed that he had to lean even more and more. \"Demitry, whats going on..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue lizard stared at his friend as Chris began to shrink and shrink and.. \"Oh this, this is just perfect.\" Demitry chuckled to himself as he stared st his small friend, only becoming smaller and smaller, his clothes beginning to not fit him, his sleeves becoming baggier and baggier. Chris started to panic and the feeling of shrinking was beginning to toll on his vision. \"Well, i guess you got me to grow, but in the way you expected did yah?\" Chris swallowed at the thought of his uncontralable shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Chris had been brought down to nothing as he was trapped inside of his clothes struggling to get free, until a massive talonned hand wrap around his waist, thankfully not fully encasing his body. Chris could feel the static on his body as the clothes whipped past his face, only to be brought up to a grinning relaxed face of his dragon friend. \"Isn't this funny Chris. You, planning on using whatever the heck 'this' was-\" Demitry held the device in his hand, twirling it a bit \"and now you've ended up shrinking down to Barbie size. Heh heh, oh this is rich.\" Demitry sat down and reclined on his couch, holding Chris above his snout. \"Let's just you're getting a taste of your own medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Demitry, turn me back to normal, i swear, i'll never ask you to do anymore tests... PLEASE!\" Chris was now dangling in front of his friends face fearing for his well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry Chris, you'll be back to normal in no time...\" Demitry stood up and gave Chris a poke. \"In the mean time, im in need of a good-\"</span></div></div>",

Getting up, the dragon walked to his bathroom at a leisurely pace. He could only chuckle when he thought of what to do with the miniscule human in his hands. Chris's worried face stared longingly at the ground, hoping for the release of himself and being set down on the ground. Demitry took note of this and brought his friend higher up right in front of his face. \"You're scared Chris, mind explaining why? You're in good hands, and i promise by the end of tonight i'm sure you'll start enjoying yourself.\" Demitry began entering the bathroom, switching on the light and placing Chris on the sink counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course i'm scared man! You...\" Chris couldn't help but tremble at the thought of his gargantuan friend hurting him. \"Look, im sorry that i never asked, but... Just please don't hurt me Demitry, i'm so, so sorry.\" Chris was on his knees, pleading like a child to his behemoth friend. He couldn't help but feel the tiniest of sparks of arousal in him since he was looking at the largest dragon he had ever seen, subsequentally succeeding in his endeavors to grow him. \"Demitry, please, change me back.... im...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Chris, calm down i'm not gonna hurt, in fact,im gonna treat yah to something i think you've been wanting for a while.\" Chris raised a brow at his friend. Bending down to the cabinet beneath Chris, Demitry brought out an array of different scented candles, further increasing Chris' curiosity. \"I know you're a virgin Chris.\" Chris blankly blushed in front of him. Demitry smiled at his friend, \"Aww, hey nothing to be ashamed of.\" Placing the candles all around the tub Demitry finally stood in front of his friend now getting ready to strip as he turned the faucet on. \"I also know you've been giving me plenty of looks.\" He unzipped his pants. \"I heard you were bi too, so that explains some things.\" He slowly began to slip down his pants till his boxers were the only thing left, filled with the bulge of his draconic manhood. \"So Chris, what im saying is you get a front row seat of me tonight.\" He slowly slid his fingers into his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.. do you mean?\" Chris could only stare at the massive package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean.\" Demitry turned around, lifting his tail a bit as he slowly started to slide his boxers down. \"stay a while.\" As the fabric slid across the Dragons bare cheeks, Chris was introduced to the most erotic scene he had seen in a while; his friends ample buttocks slowly exposing themsleves to Chris, right in front of his face. Each slab of flesh was chiseled perfectly, slyrocketing Chris' erection past comfort. As the last of the boxer slipped beneath the Dragons cheeks, Demitry bent over and exposed his shapely pucker as the cheeks began to part a bit of ways. Chris sheepishly tried to get a better look in between, of course it was connected to one of his private fetishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemitry stood back up and turned revealing his massive mating tool to Chris. \"So, enjoying the show buddy?\" Chris couldn't hide his emotions, of course he was finding this highly entertaining and erotic to mention the least but he couldn't figure his friends motives. Chris nodded in embaressment. \"Good, in fact, if you're up to it, you might get a bit more in touch with my backside, but for now\" Demitry turned off the water, ignited a few candles with his breath and grabbed CHris once again, waling to the light switch and shutting it off \"lets just enjoy the water, it's been a hard day for me.\" Demitry slowly entered his tub, taking care as to not let Chris get dunked underneath the water. Finally reclining and sighing, he placed Chris on the ledge sid against the wall. \"Now, what to do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He always had to fight for everything he ever earned in the world, never receiving much in the way of support from his parents or many siblings. At an early age, he had to turn to crime in order to make ends meet for his family. Rich spent years honing his craft, becoming a master in the field of theft, burglary, pick pocketing, larceny, robbery, and stealing of all sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis appearance is about as generic as could possibly be for a raccoon, very skinny with the standard fur pattern, which gives him the added advantage of being difficult to track amongst other raccoons. And at only 5 feet and 6 inches tall, he is plenty able to get into some smaller places for his sneaky business. As a child, getting into fights with his siblings taught him that he wouldn\u2019t always win with strength alone. So he developed smarts, and a silver tongue to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an adult, he has taken to attempting bigger and bigger crimes, hoping to either make a name for himself in the world of theft, or get himself out of poverty. He always has a plan, and a backup plan in the back of his mind, even in the most mundane of situations. He currently stalks all manner of museums, banks, and science labs, eavesdropping and slinking around to get all the latest gossip about treasured artifacts or armored car deliveries. Rich is beginning to get a reputation as being sleazy due to all his lurking, which isn\u2019t entirely unwarranted as a thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, Rich wishes that he didn\u2019t have to spend his life stealing. It would be much easier if he just didn\u2019t have to worry all the time about money and food. He longs for a free life, without fear from the cops, and wants to be able to do whatever he wishes when he wishes to do it. At one point, he even attempted bodybuilding, in the hopes that gaining some muscle mass would help him fight off muggers and other thieves around his neighborhood (or at the very least help in his constant wrestling matches with siblings), but he never was able to produce any results. If only some stroke of good luck would come to him, Rich would seize the chance in a heartbeat and never look back. For now though, life continues to get him down. He won\u2019t complain out loud about his desires, so long as he continues to avoid capture... but it\u2019s always in the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is a big day for Rich, he's planning a big job! But he doesn't realize that this particular crime will leave his life changed forever...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tonight was the night, the raccoon kept repeating to himself as he made his way back to the college. He was taking a big risk being out this late in his neighborhood given the constant muggings that had been going on in the area, but the risk was going to be well worth the reward. If tonight\u2019s job was successful, all his problems would be over. This crappy area and all the low life\u2019s who inhabited it would soon be a distant memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the day the coon was doing his normal rounds around the campus. He had started volunteering on campus hoping to, not only to get some easy cash from a wallet or pocket, but also to get the layout of the area and building itself. There had been rumblings around town for days that the science department was up to something big, and big to this thief usually translated into expensive. Hearing that this mystery object was being tested out today Rich made his way towards the east wing of the campus where he heard a loud commotion coming from a lab down the hall. His pace quickening, the nimble thief slipped into the room and ducked behind one of the various tables in the room. Raising his head the coon saw a group of students and professors clamoring over what looked like some sort of sci-fi ray gun with a large dial on the side. With a light groan the disappointed raccoon shook his head unable to believe he had wasted his time. The thing looked like it was a prop from an old alien movie or something, yet these egg-heads were acting like they had just found the cure to the common cold. He watched as they carefully pointed it at an apple sitting on the counter. Chuckling, he started to make his way quietly out of the lab. They acted like the thing was going to actually fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzz quickly filled the room as the coon\u2019s attention was quickly pulled away from making his exit. A beam quickly came out of the ray\u2019s tip, striking the apple dead on. Quickly diving back to his spot Rich watched on was the ray eventually cooled down. The room was completely silent as everyone present stared at the fruit. Then after a few seconds it did the most unbelievable thing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started to grow <br>\r\n     <br>\r\nIt slowly seemed to build up and up keeping the same shape but taking up more of the counter until it eventually came to a stop, topping off at the size of a fully grown watermelon. The students and professors let out various yells for joy, shock hands, and gave many other forms of congratulations while Rich sat on the floor in the back of the room. He figured whatever was being made in the labs would fetch him a few bucks to a rival group or something, but this\u2026it seemed impossible! Assuming this simple gun could shrink things as well, this group could become famous! They could single handedly solve world hunger, shrink down massive object and transport them wherever they pleased; the list went on and on! They would make millions if not billions in a matter of days\u2026and with that thought a devious grin slipped across the raccoon face. Making his way out he waited on the side for the group to come out of the lab. They were still congratulating each other, riding high on success, to notice the coons hand slip into one of their lab coats pulling out an ID card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to tonight as the thief finally reached the campus grounds. Security was light surprisingly enough given what treasure was being held inside the building. Still the coon wasn\u2019t going to complain as he jumped over the fence and made his way up to the east wing. Making sure the coast was clear Rich came to the door of the science department. With a quick wish the coon slipped out the ID and placed it in the reader. With a quick beep the light when from red to green as the door unlocked. Grinning, he opened the door slightly and eased it back, not wanting to take the chance of it slamming shut. Crouching down the coon quickly went back to the hall and after another swipe of the ID he was in the same lab from this afternoon. As his eyes adjusted to the dark the coon made his way to the back his heart increasing in speed as he spotted a silver briefcase on the counter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUnable to contain his excitement the thief flicked open the two locks on the side and flung open the case. There it sat nestled in by the spongy material of the insides. Letting out a nervous laugh the coon grabbed the handle and lifted the ray out to give it a look over. Nothing seemed to have changed from this afternoon, the design still looked ridiculous but now getting a closer look at the dial Rich spotted a \u201cG\u201d and \u201cS\u201d that it could be set to. It didn\u2019t take long for him to figure out what those stood for as he kept looking the device over. Such a goofy looking thing yet it held so much power. The raccoon\u2019s head raced with thoughts. Who would he sell this to? For how much? What WAS he going to do with all that money? Lifting his head up from the gun the coon smiled at the thoughts, only to catch himself in a window reflection. Taking a good hard look at himself he gave a light sigh. Sure, for most he seemed like a perfect size and height, but to him it wasn\u2019t enough. He had lost count of the number of times thugs from the neighborhood had beaten the crap out of him, taking what little he had at the time. His eyes drifting back to the gun he looked at it long and hard. Maybe he didn\u2019t need to sell it off just yet. Maybe he could test it out a bit first\u2026see how it worked with a live subject\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guess it'll have to be me.\" He lowered the safety, then brought the gun up to his chest, placing its barrel squarely between his slender pecs. He then closed his eyes, his finger resting on the trigger. But before he could bring himself to fire, a sudden panic gripped him. \"Wait a minute, what am I doing?\" he asked himself. \"I mean, just because this thing works on an apple doesn't mean that it'll work for me. What if it kills living creatures or something crazy like that? I mean, it <i>is</i> kinda screwing with the laws of physics...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to bring it down, just as he saw a fly buzz past, landing on the countertop in front of him. \"Hmm,\" he thought. \"I suppose it wouldn't hurt to test on this little guy to see if it's safe. I'll just make sure it's on the lowest setting possible.\" Glancing down at the dial, he turned it from 4, where it was at, down to 1. \"Okay,\" he said, holding the gun out and aiming at the fly, \"Hope you don't mind a bit of an experiment, little guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fired, a dim beam of light shooting out and hitting the counter around where the fly had come to a rest. \"Did I hit it?\" Rich wondered. Indeed, the insect didn't even seem like it knew anything had happened, but as it took off again and flew out of the room, the raccoon could swear that it had gotten just a tiny bit bigger. Or maybe his eyes were just playing tricks on him. \"Well, that was a bust,\" he sighed. \"Screw it, I want to know. I'm sure if it was harmful the apple would've exploded or something, like in that movie, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping the dial set at 1, Rich pointed it once again at himself, took a deep breath, and squeezed the trigger before he could have second thoughts. The beam hit his chest, a warm, tingling sensation spreading through his body, not altogether unpleasant. \"Ooh, this isn't half-bad,\" he murmured, grinning. Looking back up at his reflection, he waited several seconds to see any signs of growth, either visual or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he had given up on seeing any results, he felt the fabric of his shirt start to grow tighter around his shoulders, and looking down at his feet, he noticed the hems of his pant legs were now a couple of inches above his ankle, well higher than they had been. Glancing back up, he saw that his belt line was now level with the counter, whereas before it was several inches lower.  \"It worked!\" he exclaimed softly. \"I've grown, a few inches at least! I wonder why it didn't grow my clothes, though?\" He thought about it, then shrugged. \"Maybe it only works on organic material, who knows? Still, this is a toy I think I'd much rather have some fun with before selling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon grabbed the briefcase but stuck the gun in his pocket, making sure to engage the safety before doing so. Turning to the door, he glanced through the window, making sure the coast was clear before opening it and sneaking out...</span></div></div>",

The window must have had a sensor on it to tell when it was opened after hours! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCursing under his breath, Rich quickly clamored his way out of the window and onto the ground below. Already he could feel that he had been slowed down considerably by his new 5\u201910\u201d size. It wasn\u2019t so much that his larger size made him slower, but the fact that all of his clothes were now a bit too small were causing them to pull tight at all the joints and restricting his range of movement. Despite this he struggled on to dash down the side of the building, heading for the residential street behind the university. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnfortunately for Rich, by the time he got to the end of the alley between the two buildings, he could hear the crackle of a radio and see a flashlight sweeping across the grass ahead. The campus security had already caught up with him, looking for whoever set off the alarm. The raccoon\u2019s tail whipped around him as he pulled a quick 180 on his heels and started to run back in the other direction. He reasoned that everyone would expect him to be heading for the nearest escape from the campus, so no one would expect him to run deeper onto university grounds. With that thought in mind he made a B line for the mostly unlit quad in the middle of campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time he got to the middle of the quad he already knew he had screwed up. He could see flashing blue and red lights lining the edge of the campus, blocking off that exit. Behind him the campus security was sweeping in from between the various campus buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was trapped <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGlancing back and forth between his two blocked escape routes, he tried to think of a way to get out of this. He couldn\u2019t run, Fighting was never an option and he certainly wasn\u2019t going to turn himself in. Then, an idea struck him. Tentatively the raccoon reached back behind him, shirt stretching across his chest from the movement of his arm and torso, and wrapped his fingers around the handle of the size ray. When normal plans don\u2019t work, it\u2019s time to get creative\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She grew up in a somewhat rough neighborhood. not quite a slum or getto, but certainly no pristine gated community either. there were clicks, groups and sections of kids that would travel together and sometimes act like they owned the place. and Samantha never listened to any of them, at least, when it came to telling her what to do.  Everytime some little gang would come up and be like \u201cThis is our spot\u201d or \u201cThat's our swing\u201d or other such declarations, as if simply for the fact of challenging them.

When high school came around, even as she blossomed into a rather tall, towering buxom bombshell of a woman, she found the company of the guys, hanging out after school in the parking lot and tossing a ball around, far more enjoyable than she did sitting with the girls gushing over which guy was cuter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was almost weird, some of the time. The guys she always hung out with continued to notice her more and more as she developed. Turning from that 'just another one of the guys' gunpowder gray colored wolfess, into a towering 6'8\u201d amazon of leanly muscled buxom power. Despite her gruff appearance she took very good care of herself. Constant shampooing and conditioning every night kept her fur silky smooth and fluffy to the touch. The constant games of football, basketball, baseball, or whatever sport the guys were in, mixed with at least two trips to the gym a week, kept her toned and fit, even a bit 'muscular' at times. All that added to her 6'8\u201d height, and mix in a massive pair of DD cups straining every sports bra or T shirt she ever wore, and she was quite the knockout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe never really 'fit in' at school, however, at least not when high school came around. When the women became more obsessed with looks and started forming their own groups, they started seeing Samantha, or Sam as she was now almost always called, as a 'threat'. She was beautiful, and they hated it. They hated it even more that she was always hanging out with most of the guys that they all liked, such as the various sports teams or even some of the 'bad boys' in school. They never seemed to realize that she simply hung out with them cause she related to the guys more than the girls. And the guys started to take notice of Sam's \u201cChanges\u201d, and started finding themselves drawn to her, which only further infuriated the other girls. Occasionally Sam would show some interest. She was a woman after all. And more than once one of the football or track teams would find themselves bragging the next day about how they got with Sam, even despite how she obviously 'took charge' in bed, as she did everywhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen her Junior year came she started to get 'bored' of school. It just didn't keep her occupied. She had no desire to do anything with her life that involved heavy math or science backgrounds, and hell the only reading she did were sports almanacs, Westerns or sci fi action books. So about halfway through her Junior year, she simply dropped out, much to many of the guys surprise and disappointment, and Joined the army. There, she flourished. Her constant physical activity and workouts had kept her at the peak of physical prowess. Her constant 'scraps' throughout her life, and her simple love of confrontation had afforded her a natural Knack for CQC, or close quarters combat. And she had always been a great shot when she would fire off a few rounds from her dad's rifle behind the house (Or in the arcades when her and the guys headed out there). She loved the military, and the military was happy to have such a promising cadet added to their ranks. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat about Corporal Rosette?\u201d The bury bear growled out softly. Head slowly swinging from side to side as he looked out of the 4th story window of the military research complex, watching drill sergeants marching new recruits around the compound.  One of his paws idly reached down to scratch at the thick globe of muscle and fat that strained the front of his uniform, Typical border-lining on stereotypical of his Ursine heritage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm... let me see..\u201d the mouse murmured, raising the large tablet computer held in his arms and starting to sort through files on it. His tail occasionally twitched somewhat soradipcally out behind him, shifting the fabric of the large white lab coat that he wore. \u201cTop of her class in hand to hand combat, excellent marksman with both large and side arms. Blood type works out... Psychological profile.. mmm... that ones a bit iffy. Shes shown aggressive and confrontational tendencies, border-lining on insubordination before,  though she got off because the drill sergeant was deemed being 'too demanding'? Whats that mean?\u201d he asked, looking up curiously at the thick bear of a general beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were drilling the new recruits that were in the same squad as her, shortly after she joined. Sergeant got a bit over zealous when one of the recruits fell down in the mud. Plopped a boot on his head and ground his face down into the mud till the kid couldn't breath. So she grabbed him, and flipped him halfway across the field. He got pissed, and tried to attack her, so she broke his nose. We'd had some problems with him before, but we let him go after that. The kid nearly suffocated from being ground into the mud like that.\u201d He explained with a bit of a smirk, clearly amused by the concept. \u201cThe other recruits got a kick out of seeing her kick the sergeant\u2019s ass though. I think she's a great choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so sir...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what exactly did I get signed up for again?\u201d Sam grumbled a bit, arms lazily crossed behind her head as she followed the scrawny mouse down the corridors into the research facility. The pose did little to hide her ample endowment or hard muscled curvature of her body, and seemed to keep the mouse in a constant state of fluster, which seemed to only amuse the looming 6'8\u201d wolfess. She'd never gotten to actually come into the facility, hell no one really did. At least, none of the recruits. The closest she had ever come was seeing a truck delivering barrels of something at the loading dock, and getting a peek into the loading bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo summarize\u201d The mouse replied, occasionally stammering a bit, and constantly keeping his eyes averted away from her immodest form and demeanor. \u201cBasically. We've chosen you for psychological and physiological reasons to be the first test subject for Project Titan, an experimental project with the intent of creating a new line of super soldiers. And yes, we know the name is a bit cliche... the think tank that came up with it thought it would be funny to name it something out of a cheesy movie.\u201d he continued, quickly tacking on an explanation at the end to preempt any taunting at the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean. I know you already told me about that stupid clause in the contract when I signed up... but do I really have to do this?\u201d She murmured, glancing down at him and lowering her arms. \u201cYou're not gonna turn me into some kind of wolf hulk thing are you? Cause, if you haven't noticed-\u201d She paused, grinning as she slid her paws down her sides, along her taunt abs and then across those plump, muscular hips and thighs in an obviously provocative gesture \u201c-I like my figure.\u201d She clearly was enjoying further flustering the already nervous and blushing mouse. And it wasn't exactly hard to make someone as, even slightly, timid as him, blush and stutter with a figure like hers, and with no shame at showing it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr... I ah... um... n-no... at most there might be a mild increase in visible muscle mass, but the primary function is to increase overall size, muscle density, and bone density. You'll be taller, stronger than you would be normally, and your body will be more durable as well.\u201d He explained, adjusting the large rimmed glasses sitting on the edge of his nose. \u201cI-its actually fairly simple. we... er.. we use nanobots, tiny machines that will be injected into your bloodstream, and then when they're given fuel, in this case food, they will use the nutrients to start adding to your muscles, bones and body to enlarge and enhance it. \u201c He finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe mouse pushed open a door into a large empty room. Though at second glance she realized it was the loading bay, and whatever had been stacked in it had either been moved away, or pushed against the far wall, leaving her in a roughly 30 foot tall room about half the size of a football field. In the middle of the room was a large wooden crate filled various high nutrient foods and bottled water. At second glance, the two could see a small 'observation' box settled in one corner o the room with large windows looking down into the loading bay. Though the distance made it hard to make out through the windows, Sam and the mouse could both see shapes moving around inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, we're going to inject you with the nanites, and then give them the activate command. Once that happens, you'll become very, very hungry. So we've prepared some food for you to eat to fuel the process.\u201d He explained, gesturing to the crate of food, as he picked up a small silver box sitting beside it.  He punched in a code onto the small keypad on the box, and with a faint hissing it slid open, revealing a hypodermic injector gun filled with what looked like a thick, silvery goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I just tell you about my figure\u201d Sam joked as she grinned down at the crate full of food. Though her demeanor faltered ever so briefly when she saw that needle. She'd never admit it out loud, but she'd always hated shots. With a sigh she pulled up the sleeve of her camo T-shirt \u201cLet's just get this over with\u201d She growled out softly. Her fingers curled into a fist and she barred her fangs in response to the gun suddenly stabbing a thin needle into her arm. Normally such a device made injections all but painless. But it felt like they were shoving something solid into her arm, as that thick gooey silver substance forced its way into the vein along her arm. You could actually see a small bulge under the flesh of where it was seeping in, before the 'goop', actually thousands if not millions of tiny machines, started spreading out through the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over she finally unclenched her fingers and raised her other paw to grip where the needle had injected her, finding herself inexplicably panting a bit. Why was she so suddenly out of breath? The mouse stepped back a bit when she let out a rumbling growl... that she didn't make. At least, she didn't think she did, till she realized it was her stomach grumbling, loudly.  She gave a faint groan when she felt a light cramp shoot through her abs, clutching at them out of reflex and grasping the edge of the crate for support<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh... god damn, you weren't kidding about the hungry thing\u201d She huffed out a bit breathlessly. Slowly her eyes trailed over to the crate full of food, practically salivating at the sight of it. Within second she was snatching up energy bars, dehydrated food, and bottles of water out of it, stuffing her face with as much of it as she could get her hands on. Despite her shoveling the food down her throat she never seemed to ever get full. If anything, it felt like she was just getting hungrier. Bite after bite, mouthful after mouthful pouring down into her belly where nanites immediately tore it apart and began using it to 'build. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse took a step back as he saw Sam start tearing into the food, blushing a bit at the glutenous display. He glanced up at the observation booth and gave a nod in its direction, before a tearing sound pulled his attention back to Samantha. He saw the sleeves of her T shirt, already rather snug around the firm curve of her bicep, starting to tear open as her arm started becoming thicker. Her military pants were pulled skintight around her legs and riding up well past her ankles, and her bosom looked like it was ready to tear the front of her shirt open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear a series of loud POPS as her expanding footpaws began popping the laces of her boots open, then tearing the sides apart as they outgrew the thick leather. Sam let out a soft groan of relief when she felt the shoes give away, the pressure having been rather uncomfortable, borderline on painful before they were free. Her shirt started to tear down the front and back as the width of her torso and the girth of her chest became too much for it, and within seconds it was splitting apart and exposing her massive tits, straining her pitifully undersized bra to the point that the straps snapped, and that too fell uselessly down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready she was cresting the 10 foot tall mark, barely even seeming to realize what was happening too her as she continued shoveling more and more food into her mouth. Her muscular thighs tore her pants apart and left her in just a pair of now skintight black boxers that soon shredded apart along with her pants, leaving the 12 foot and growing wolfess now stark naked. Each second brought more food into her mouth to be swallowed (soon not even bothering to unwrap it anymore!). And with that, brought the nanites more fuel to work with... and with that, brought more and more size to the growing giantess of a wolf. </span></div></div>",

Carli is a bit possessive of Spike constantly at his side whether he wants her there or not striking up conversations with on lookers and strangers. The giant quiet Timber wolf and tiny chatterbox Chinchilla make for an interesting combination.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At a high school graduation, one of the many rehearsed and overly used lines by the valedictorian is: \u201cRemember, these will be the best four years of your life.\u201d Of course, everyone who\u2019s ever made it past high school will tell you, \u201cThat\u2019s a load of bull.\u201d However, for one poor soul, it was pretty much the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick had always been a big guy; captain of the wrestling team and a star linebacker at his small high school on the very outskirts of a small town just outside the main city\u2019s jurisdiction. Back home, he was large and in charge, the king. He could walk down any hallway and have girls fawning over him as he filled out his letterman jacket, his jock buds at his back. Hell, when it came to booty calls, he was the man; getting a girl to bed with him every weekend. And boy, did he ever impress with his thick chest and arms big enough to compete with, though he still had a bit of tummy, being a bear and all. \u2018More of me to love,\u2019 he used to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was a hard worker; he fought hard on the field and mat, he tried his best to keep his marks up, he worked his body to the max, lifting and eating right to keep him big and strong, and most of all, he worked hard to keep the ladies satisfied with his slightly more than modest endowment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it should be mentioned that there should be an emphasis on <i>was</i>. Rick <i>was</i> a hard worker. These days, if you went to the local university, you\u2019d see a very different bear. Sure he\u2019d still sometimes wear his letterman jacket, just don\u2019t ask him to button it up \u2013 he can\u2019t. Over the years, Rick had ballooned up to a ball of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s just big boned. He\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s just in a bulk up phase. But the truth of the matter is: Rick\u2019s let himself go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many kids from his town made it out and he was lucky enough to be picked up by the nearby university to play football. With the hopes and dreams of his folk and pretty much the whole town, he set of for college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, like many kids who made it, things aren\u2019t what they expected. Rick was a hotshot, arrogant prick back home, a place where an attitude like his could be afforded due to the level of skill he possessed. Come freshman year, and the playing field is more even. Suddenly, Rick\u2019s star didn\u2019t shine so bright in the faces of the football team\u2019s all-stars, such as Fang and David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that hit hard. Suddenly, he was the guy giving the pats on the back instead of getting them. Reality hit, and it hit hard; Rick was just a small town boy playing in the big leagues now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost college age students worry about the freshman fifteen, the dreaded layer of fat that deposits on one\u2019s tummy after a year of decadence; party life, eating out with your friends and getting less exercise. For Rick, it was more like the freshman fifty. After finding out he wasn\u2019t the cream of the crop, especially when he found out he wouldn\u2019t be on the starting defensive line-up, he hit rock bottom and ate more than a child in Africa does in a year each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, after years of feeling sorry for himself, he\u2019s the bear you can see today; his once strong jaw swallowed up by his doubled double chin, an envious pair of pecs replaced by manboobs that make most girls insecure about their bosoms and overall, just mounds of adipose deposited all over his body. Usually found sitting at the edge of the pack of footballers, the only guy willing to even associate with him being Marcus, and even then, the kangaroo was getting more distant these days. As if he too was fed up with Rick. The bear couldn\u2019t blame him, who would want to spend time with a loser like him anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, as Rick came out of the shower with a towel around his waist after a team workout, to which he barely participated in, even sneaking a few snacks between sets, he got the usual taunts from the guys. \u201cLook at tubby go.\u201d \u201cAh, the force of gravity\u2019s too great!\u201d Rick\u2019s gotten used to it, even putting on a faint grin, not letting anyone know how sensitive he was about his weight. He\u2019d cry about it later with a big tub of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s tonight, but for now, he just put on a brave face and acted disaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, no amount of bravery could save him from Fang and David, his two best \u2018buds\u2019 on the team. David would pull down his towel and laugh at the stub that was his endowment, his once crowning jewels and monolith covered up by his belly or having long been swallowed up by his mounds of fat. He\u2019d just sigh and cover himself up again. Make that two tubs of B&amp;J\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the coup de grace for today was when Marcus, the only guy Rick could actually consider a friend, a maybe friend, shoved a clipping from a local newspaper at him. He read it to himself as the rest of the team left to go on their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 As head cheerleading coach, Yolanda Yates, at the university divulges, \u2018I don\u2019t know how they did it, but Crisco somehow got a mama bear to copulate with its shortening to create a monstrosity like that. It\u2019s fat, it\u2019s gross and probably smells just as bad if you left it out in the sun\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s no surprise people are angry with the football team\u2019s latest losing streak and comments pinpointing weak links are getting more common amongst the fans\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick had enough at that point. With watering eyes he looked up to see Marcus standing there, glaring back at him and shaking his head. \u201cYou brought this upon yourself, Rick,\u201d were the kangaroo\u2019s only poignant words as he left the bear all alone in the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was tired of being the joke of the team. Drying his eyes a bit, Rick vowed that from now on he\u2019d never be the same. Little did he know just how right he\u2019d be.</span></div></div>",

Franky, or simply Frank as most of his friends like to call him, rejoiced in his head as he made his way down the street towards his workplace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a well built dragon, with bright red scales, a yellow underbelly, and curved horns. But the most noticeable, or perhaps obscene, feature of his body was the sheath where his manhood was hidden. Behind it was a pair of firm balls, barely even moving as he strolled down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost dragons did not have this part, but their balls and penis were hidden inside their bodies. It was luckily not illegal for Frank to be nude (a law that was only valid for ferals), so as long as he kept his penis inside its respective place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardware store was titled Kayses, a small store at the end of the street. Frank, since he was twenty years old, had been working there. It didn't see much customer, but Andrew, one of Frany's friends and owner of the shop, believed more would come if the advertised more.<br>\r\nHe was saving money to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky walked into the store, and was greeted by Andrew, a average height human. He had brown eyes, brown air, and was thin. He was currently busy organizing a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Cranky,\" he greeted in a mocking way. Usually Franky would have exploded with anger, but he was used to Andrew mocking him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he said: \"Morning, Andrew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tired tone in his voice, and Andrew immediately picked it up. \"Who, someone doesn't sound very energetic today,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't sleep well last night,\" Franky admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky took his seat behind the counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" To be exact, it was anything but nothing. Last night Franky had a dream that he was a giant, stomping the city to pieces with his huge paws. He woke up from that, but from fear or excitement he did not know. His second dream involved his balls growing to a monstrous size, a amazing feeling that left Franky's covers soiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those were only dreams, right?</span></div></div>",

Frank raised his head from the counter, which he took pleasure napping on for a few moments, to growl softly in annoyance at the fellow employee that entered the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving blond hair, an attractive body, an overenergetic personality, and dull wits, Kim was a cheetah that had an ability to peeve Frank in so many ways. He was glad she was at least not bitchy, because that would have set him off the edge, making his, hers and Andrew's life a living hell, but, unfortunately, that one annoying characteristic was replaced with another one: Kim was rather sensitive, so the red dragon kept his distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why it was so odd he could not help but steal a few glances at Kim's rear as she came skipping past. The cheetah had a habit of wearing tight clothing, and today she was wearing a t-shirt and tight jeans. I felt the sensation of blood flowing to my member and my perky balls tensing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, no,\" I thought, bitting my lower lip, blushing, \"Not now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down and witnessed the tip of my red penis peeking through my sheath, and I looked around nervously. An erection in public would be far too embarrassing for me, even though there was few people to observe my arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to do something fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the overweight man again, Franky saw that he was examining a drill with interest, but then he shook his head and placed it back before picking up another one. It was a sign that he would be browsing this hallway for a while, granting the feral dragon enough time to do what he had to do, and Frank left his post, going to the back of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathrooms were actually meant for the employees rather than the costumers. The red dragon went to the first stall, closed the door behind him and locked it. He closed the toilet lid and climbed on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky had to admit that he was nervous about masterbating in there, for it was not the first time he did it and got caught. It happened when he first started working at Kayses. It was on a slow day like this, and the red dragon decided, with nothing to keep himself occupied with, to go to the bathroom and pleasure himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, foolishly, he stuck in there for quite a while, and a concerned Andrew came looking for his employee. Frank was noisy when he worked on his cock, moaning and mumbling things to himself, and the human knew immediately what was happening in there and called him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe received a scolding from his boss (though, Andrew was more disappointed at him than angry), and Franky was ashamed of what he did, but luckily Andrew was a reasonable person and he allowed the red dragon another chance, provided that he did not do such an act ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt guilty of doing this again, but it had to be done. With a sigh, Franky allowed his imagination to run freely, his cock emerging from his sheath, growing stiff and throbbing, begging for his attention. He reached down with his clawed hand and began to stroke delicately, the friction warming up his organ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happens while he pounds his cock?</span></div></div>",

Frank only groaned. O, how he hated Mondays! How he hated his job! But whether he liked it or not, he still had to work to sustain himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack hunched, shoulders and head drooping, Frank made his way to his station. He took his seat amongst the chaos of paperwork, files, stationary, and empty coffee mugs. He placed a fresh piece of paper in the typewriter and began to adjust it, but then he heard a voice that he both dreaded and despised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frank, what the hell!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice cut through the air like a hot knife through butter.

He tucked at his cloak and began to make the long journey home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking several blocks, getting soaked to the bone, he noticed up ahead several contraction workers fixing the road and some damaged building. If there was one thing Frank was genuinely curious about it was the monster attacks that had been plaguing the city for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey appeared out of nowhere, insane insect or dinosaur-like giants, roaring in fury and rampaging through the city, knocking buildings down like sand castles and leaving massive holes in the pavement. Frank had seen a few of them in his life, but always from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were usually brought down by the military or the superheros that protected the city. Frank wondered why no one asked questions about these beings origins. Perhaps they were just too happy to be protected from crazy monsters to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious or not, he knew that his usual route back home was blocked off, meaning that he had to take an alternative one. He turned left and walked down a narrow street, which was eerily deserted. As he walked, he was blissfully unaware that someone was stalking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in a van in a alleyway, two figures watched Frank walk into the street. They started the vehicle and slowly drove into the street, parking somewhere nearby where he was walking. They climbed out and the first man crept up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, at that very moment Frank was wondering if his day could get any worse when he felt someone jump on him. He felt a very strong arm wrap itself around his neck and a hand clasp around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what the hell!\" he cried, but his voice was muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank tried to break free, grabbing the arm at his throat, kicking wildly, and wiggling himself, and he almost had success, but then he felt something hard smash against his head. The world turned dark and he fell to the pavement unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hand the second figure held a wooden club. He and the first man stared at Frank's limp body for a while, making sure that his lights were really out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, the first man said, \"Okay, let's get him to the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey picked him up and carried him to the van, throwing him into the back. They climbed back into the vehicle and drove off into the rain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't you find that a little odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDough shrugged, taking a sip of his coffee. \"I dunno,\" he said, \"I never thought about it, but, hey, you'll get used to it. You newbies always think like this in the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelina sighed, looking out of the window again. Perhaps he was right. Perhaps she was just acting like a newbie. She had been serving on the team for two months now, fighting alongside the biggest heroes in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelina's powers were amazing to most average people, being able to fly and feel and manipulate emotions, but compared to the rest of the team, who could lift trucks with no effort and run at a impossible speed, it was rather mundane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if used right, it could be a powerful nudge that could give the team victory. Whenever a monster attacked, she invaded its mind, throwing in strange emotions that made it pause to understand what it was feeling, almost sending it into a trance. It was then that the others' chance to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during that time that Melina felt something else between the insect or lizard-like monsters' insanity. It was a cry for help, so distant that she had to strain her powers to make sure if it was real and not her imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then they begin to attack, and that plea for help vanished in a instant. It always left her wondering what it was. Could there possibly be something deeper going on with these monster attacks? Could it possibly be that these creatures were ones something else, perhaps even human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't ponder any further on this question, for a ear-perching wail filled the room, something flashing red and green brightly. Looking up, Melina saw that the building's emergency detecting system had activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA recorded voice began to speak. \"Alert! Alert!\" it said, \"All superhero's report to the station immediately! A code number one has been detected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCode number one always meant a monster attack, for. Melina couldn't help but frown, staring out the window quickly, seeing no monster in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDough got to his feet. \"Show time!\" he exclaimed happily, \"Come one, Melina, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could take the first step, he was already out if the room in a blur. Melina sighed and followed, her mind still troubled by her questions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank felt horrible today. Well, to be honest, he always felt horrible, but today he felt even worse; his head was throbbing and his muscles ached, and not even painkillers seemed to ease the pain. Whoever those muggers were, they seriously did a number on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was knocked out stone-cold, he woke up in a hospital. The nurse told him that his unconscious body was found in a alleyway by a police officer, who took him to a nearby medical centre. He couldn't identify his attackers, so there was no use making charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, non of his money, the little he had, from his wallet or his possessions were stolen. Frank guessed that what he owned was useless to them so they just left it. The more he thought about it, the more he realized how pathetic his life was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO, well, back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator's door slid open, and Frank Parker stepped out onto the floor. He tucked in his shirt, pulled up his pitch black pants, took a sip of his coffee, extra strong with extra sugar, and surveyed the room with tired eyes and a miserable expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fellow employees were working in their respectful cubicles, working on paperwork and taking calls. None seemed to care that he had arrived, or even notice his injuries. They all just sat there, working and moving passed him as if he didn't exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Frank wouldn't care about this, but, suddenly, he felt anger begin to boil deep within him. Who did these people think they are? None of them cared about him, but they were always watching, being privately amused, whenever he was scolded by his bitchy boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank felt his heart begin to race in his chest, his breathing quickening as his rage begin to build. His brown pupils narrowed into two vertical slits, like a reptile's, and he hissed like a snake. But as quickly as they anger came it disappeared, like a dark clouds moving away from the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank blinked, his eyes returning back to normal, wondering where on earth his sudden rage had come from. He decided to shrug it off and go to his station, but then a voice he was all to familiar was cut the air like a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frank, get your fat butt to my office, now!\" his boss demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anger began to boil again, but this time it revised to relent, fighting against his suppression. If anyone was looking (which they weren't, for they were all staring at their boss, who stood outside her office), they would have noticed that Frank began to change in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew an inch taller, his muscle mass building up, his flabby features disappearing and his body growing more muscular, straining his work clothes. With silent rage, Frank turned around and made his way to his boss' office. In her office, he took a seat, his expression blank, listening as she scolded him, his rage growing worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lazy bum you are!\" she was saying, \"Gone for two days, and for what? Because you got a few scraps and bruises? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you this instant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank didn't reply. He only stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, you lazy, good for nothing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't hold his anger anymore. It tore through his suppression like paper. \"SHUT UP!\" he literally roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so loud that it could be heard loud and clearly through the office. Workers stopped their business, peering around the walls of their cubicles in confusion, staring at the office and wondering what was going on in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's boss fell into her chair, her mouth open and eyes wide, both shocked and terrified, watching with horror as he began to transform in strange ways before her eyes. Taller and taller he grew, his clothing tearing off his body, unable to handle his increasing bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange bumps began to form across his skin, developing into hard, dark green scales. His jaw lengthened into a long snout, his teeth growing sharp and long, a few fangs portraying out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick tail ripped its way out of his pants, followed by spikes that grew from its base all the way to his head. His arms and chest bulged with muscle, but his large pot belly revised to go away, instead growing firm and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over her with his rapidly increasing height, jabbing a huge clawed finger at her. \"Listen, you,\" he said, his voice several octaves deeper and sounding hoarse, \"I had enough of your crap! I slave this lazy butt off every day! And for what? Just to get treated like dirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't say anything, staring at him with quivering lips. He was growing so tall that his head was pressing hard against the ceiling, causing it to crack badly, chips of plaster raining down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, SHUT! YOUR! FACE!\" he roared again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey workers were very concerned when they heard the noise, and grew even more so when their boss came running out of her office as fast as her fat legs could carry her, her eyes wild and screaming in terror, waving her arms around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they had little time to investigate what was going on, for a huge crocodile-like tail smashed through the wall of the office. It swept the cubicles away like a rack clearing leaves away, and a few workers were caught under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others didn't waste time. They ran to the nearest exit as quickly as they could, infrastructure collapsing around them as the monster grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
