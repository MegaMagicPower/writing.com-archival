It is responsible for concocting new identities, surgically and chemically altering witnesses to fit, then rehoming them. After giving testimony, witnesses may be returned to normal or, in cases where there remains an ongoing threat to their lives, they may be given permanent new identities, spending the rest of their lives under the watchful gaze of the program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulk of witnesses are ex-cons turned informant but may be any citizen unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalse identities are meticulously crafted, randomly distributed, and it is known that Doctor Yamato has begun to venture beyond mere human disguises. There are tales of entire sections of the National zoo populated by ex-Mafiosos, and rumours of even more alien, disturbing disguises, spoken of only as hushed whispers in cop bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Officer Charles Olson</b> - Those who were around when Officer Olson first joined Witness Protection twenty years ago remember him as a squat balding man in his late 50s. He has since matured into a swarthy, statuesque 35-year-old stud, a transition that may have something to do with his close relationship with plastic surgeon Doctor Yamato and the unsolved disappearance of several items from the evidence locker relating to the investigation into the Doctor's past misdeeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath his handsome exterior, Olson remains a dirty old man, rotten to the core. He is a slippery character, somehow dodging two investigations into police corruption, as well as retirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Officer Jennifer Summers -</b> A well-meaning agent who cares deeply about her work. She has personally rehomed a number of witnesses in her own home, despite her allergies to cat and dog hair.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary Ford looked at her reflection in her vanity\u2019s mirror as she clasped a sting of pearls around her neck. In the months since she and her family had gone into witness protection and being drastically transformed she\u2019d learned quite a bit about makeup and how to dress her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TFPD had done a terrifyingly good job of transforming her from Max Miller, a teenage boy, into Mary Ford, a 37 year old single mother of two teenage girls. At first it had been incredibly jarring to see an adult woman staring back at her in the mirror. There was nothing in her reflection that tied her back to the boy she had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at their new home, in their new town, it became apparent that the TFPD wasn\u2019t going to take any chances. Nothing in the house connected them to their old house. The clothes Mary had found in her closet were decidedly feminine. Gone were her rock band t-shirts, comfortable jeans, loose clothes or anything that wasn\u2019t designed to show off her MILF figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls, her former mom and dad, had very much the same experience. There was nothing in the house that spoke of who they used to be. Anna, her former mom, had taken things in stride. She was happy to be young again and still the same gender. She and her husband-turned-sister had been young parents and she had regretted losing out on certain things in order to start a family so early. She saw this as a second chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the beginning Anna had helped Mary figure out makeup, how to dress, how to handle her time of the month. They had bonded quite a bit. As far as the world would know, it was now Mary who had been the young mother, having apparently had Anne at 18. The story the TFPD had crafted was that Mary had become pregnant in high school, she had apparently been quite the heartbreaker in her day, and she dropped out soon after. Three years later she became pregnant with Dakota. The supposed father in their cover story had apparently left Mary to raise her daughters on her own. At some point in this made up life Mary had gotten her GED and had worked a series of jobs over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was a fantasy, but it was the fantasy they were supposed to tell if they were asked.  The TFPD had gotten Mary a job with a local company as an executive assistant, all built on a fake work history for a person who hadn\u2019t existed a few months before. What was strange was how the cover story had slowly become more and more real to her. Heck, the TFPD had given her stretch marks to make it quite apparent that she\u2019d supposedly given birth before. It was easier to believe the lie than to believe the truth of who she used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota had had the roughest time in accepting who she had become. She had become the quintessential blonde beauty you see on TV, at least physically. The three of them had been given curvy bodies that were undeniably female. For Dakota the change had been radical. To go from a towering, masculine father, to a 16 year old girl with looks that were straight out of a teenage boy\u2019s dreams \u2026 well, it had been too much for her mind to take. She had a nervous breakdown only a few days after they arrived at their new house. Mary had called their handlers in the TFPD and they had sent some specialists to help, but in the end they said that sort of thing sometimes happened with people who entered the program. All they could do was monitor Dakota and let her sort things out for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she started to come back she had embraced a new persona that was completely separate from who she had been. She wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge that they had been different people anymore. Her personality became just what she appeared to be, a typical blonde, air-head. Mary and Anna had tried to help her remember in the beginning, but ultimately decided it was perhaps better if Dakota just embraced her new life and forgot the horrors she had seen leading up to their transformations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smoothed out her outfit as she got up, stepping confidently on her high-heels as though she\u2019d been walking in them for years. Sometimes she missed who she had been, and she always marveled at the immense changes they had all undergone, but she had to get the day started and a mother couldn\u2019t waste too much time lost in thought.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As her arm brushed against her bust, she glanced down to see the mountainous chest she now had, the canyon of cleavage between, and her eyes going wide in horror, and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...!\" This time, the tone was more pleading than inquisitive. She wanted someone to tell her she wasn't the woman she so clearly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine's gaze dropped to the still dozing woman on the bed beside her.

You might be in protective custody for months.\u201d Officer Jennifer Summers said back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call it safer....We call that cowardice. No wonder you can\u2019t catch up to the family with a snitch like me.\u201d Edward said sarcastically as he rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here creep. You would be facing 25-30 years for trafficking if not for cooperation. If you don\u2019t want to spend the next 6 months tossed away in some tiny cell you are just gonna have to get over it. Besides it might be good for you to live with a pair of tits for awhile. Give you a little insight into what you helped do to all those innocent people.\u201d Officer Charles Olsen said slamming his hands on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward wasn\u2019t stupid. He saw through the good cop, bad cop, routine here. If he had things his way he never would turned away from the life like this. He was a trapper and a damn good one. Using his charm and good looks Edward or Eddie as he preferred to be called would lure people, usually tourists, immigrants, and people to dumb to know better to the secret lab of the transformation mafia. There the mafia would use their stolen tech to turn their victims into all sorts of things.  Most common though was they were turned into sexy women to be used as hookers and strippers. They were treated like slaves told to obey if they ever wanted to be changed back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Eddie didn\u2019t think to hard about what happened to the people he lured. He would take people to local bars and clubs owned by the mafia and party and get drunk with his victims until they didn\u2019t know better. There he would signal the enforcers to come and take them while they couldn\u2019t fight back or cause a scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t how he wanted to make a living but when the mafia offered him a thousand dollars a head he couldn\u2019t refuse. Three years later he became the best trapper in the city. Until....Until he made a choice. One that cost him his job, status in the mafia, and put a heavy price on his head. Now the TFPD was his only chance at staying alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you turn me into a chick for the next few months while you build your legal case? I hide out in another town working some crap job as a waitress while you protect me? Then when the time comes you change me back and I testify and then I\u2019m free? Sound about right?\u201d Eddie asked hating his new situation but what choice did he have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it Mr. Thompson. Officer Olsen and I will go undercover and be keeping tabs on you. Any attempts to run, expose your true identity, or reconnect with your mafia pals and the deal is terminated. We move forward with full trafficking charges on you. Got it?\u201d Officer Summers said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn lucky you are. Way better deal than you deserve.\u201d Officer Olsen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine....Deal.\u201d Eddie said as he signed the contract that was put in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright let\u2019s begin.\u201d Officer Summers said.</span></div></div>",

It was clear to Eddie how each of them saw his situation. Olsen hated it and thought this was a waste of time of resources. Better to just lock up or even better force him to talk. Summers seemed to see this situation as an opportunity. A way to learn, observe and hopefully end a terrible human trafficking ring that has plagued this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie just wanted freedom and safety, whatever the cost. He knew there was no going back at this point. He figured having tits for a couple months was a small price to pay in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay step into the chamber Mr. Thompson.\u201d Summers said to Eddie after they had led him to what looked like a public shower of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie obeyed and stepped inside the white tile room as Olsen came over and undid his handcuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow strip....\u201d Olsen said to him with a dark tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the way?\u201d Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo your bare ass...now strip. I don\u2019t wanna look at your junk any more than you do.\u201d Olsen said as Eddie began to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m curious Mr. Thompson. Did you ever watch any of your victims change? It\u2019s a rather fascinating process.\u201d Summers said curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...The last I ever saw was them being escorted away by enforcers. Why do you ask?\u201d Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what\u2019s abiut to happen is powerful radiation is about to hit your body changing your DNA on the culllar level. We simple program in a specific design into the computer and your body will be forced to change to adapt to the profile we create.\u201d Summers explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you asking me what I wanna look like? Look I really don\u2019t care just as long as I\u2019m not some ugly or fat chick you understand?\u201d Eddie said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no Mr. Thompson. We already have your profile set. I was just curious because well....I am a firm believer in Karma and well....You will understand.\u201d Summers said with a smile as she closed the door to the white cell locking Eddie inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of profile did you....are you kidding me?\u201d Olsen said as he glanced over at the design on the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s ironic. However his cover requires a body like this.\u201d Summer explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d Olsen said shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie waited patiently walking around naked in the cell until he suddenly saw the white lights above him begin to change. They began flashing before turning a deep red color flooding the room with crimson light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr Thompson. Please try to relax. The transformation can be...well...uncomfortable.\u201d Summers said through the intercom.</span></div></div>",

The sound far more sensual, far more sexual and needy than she ever wanted to hear from her own lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConchita's curves exploded to ripe new dimensions. Her ass, already perfect grew beyond magnificent to seam straining fullness. The top lost all bagginess, as her shoulders started to ache.

As Eddie struggled towards consciousness, leaving behind some erotic dreams, he started to recall his situation. The days of visiting 'the girls' for free, as a perk for a good capture were behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something troubling at the back of his mind, as he fought to organise his thoughts. Something very urgent that needed to be remembered. Groaning softly, as sleep tempted him back to unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, a memory of a photograph sprung to mind. A blonde haired cutie, but there was still something troubling about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flood of memories, it all came back to Eddie 'The Sleaze', that was going to be his disguisee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting aside the sheets, he rocketed from the bed, to sit on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather she did.

She gritted her teeth, not wanting to give the agents any more satisfaction than this already humiliating body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, they'd modeled her new form after the girls she liked to capture. As Eddie used to think of them Blonde Bimbos, and give their life purpose and save them from any unneeded thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her wishes, a pain spiked through her torso, and a hand instinctually slapped to her chest. One lush breast pressed against the inside of her skinny forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... that'll be the final adjustments.\" Officer Olsen informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starting with a male, there's more body mass to deal with. You're a petite woman, and that weight has got to go somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned by Officer Summers words, Mindi breasts started to warm, and surge. Growing fuller and heavier with each passing moment, Mindi gibbered as her bust grew and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/81/19/56/81195605e9dcc36c915ebf98bc07dd7a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/81/19/56/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear God... no!\" she squeaked in protest.

Mindi couldn't look either of them in the eye. Unbidden, too many memories resurfaced, of all the blow-jobs that she'd received as Eddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands dropped limply to her side, as another surge raced through her.

It all feels incredibly forced, and you think of the original strategy of inducing agoraphobia to stop the girls running away. When Jane waves for her to come out, Conchita steps fully into the doorway, no longer half-hidden by the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the pieces fall into place, she was an early experiment, with only an ass-expansion, the agoraphobia, and a compulsion to suck cock. It had felt so perfect at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/ad/1b/3fad1b2224a10d9f506f9ae753b89a49.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/ad/1b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas now, she'd never suck your cock ever again. You shudder from head to toe, as you imagine yourself on your knees. A man looming over you, his stiffening cock in your face. A strong hand on your head, steadying you, keeping you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding your mouth start to water, you realise the agents left a little surprise in your disguise. You share that curiosity, that compulsion with Conchita. Even the idea of cocks, makes you wet, makes you timid. Your thighs press firmly against one another as you try and press that need from existence. You try to picture your former body... Even that makes you blush, and tremble with anticipation.</span></div></div>",

Today, he'd testify by video confirming once more the truth of his statement, and role he'd played, in getting the victims, to trust 'The Surgeon'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door announced the arrival of the postman. Nervous, he knew not to answer, his protection detail would deal with anyone who came, but curiosity drove him to observe through a half-open door. His heart was racing, there shouldn't be any deliveries for this address. But, it was probably an innocent mistake, someone stopping for directions, a mis-labelled parcel or something mundane like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for Bill, that was a risk he wasn't willing to leave to chance. Every noise made him want to jump, at the same time, the routine was driving him up the wall with boredom. So he pressed his face to the gap, and slowed his breathing, keeping it as quiet as possible.</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t recognize this new night team but they flashed their badges and had the right paperwork so the other guys accepted it and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new guys stood guard for a bit before one of them knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man you hungry? We picked up a pizza on our way here.\u201d The guard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill couldn\u2019t deny his hunger. This safehouse he was in sucked. He ate mostly re heated microwave meals which were tasteless. It was against the rules to open the door for anyone however except special Agent Milton. The TPD special agent in charge of your case. However...the rumbling in Bill\u2019s stomach and the smell of the pizza outside was too much to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019ll take a slice.\u201d Bill said as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the door was open however the agents burst into the room grabbing Bill by the neck and shoving him against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that worked.\u201d The one gaurd laughing to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...you are a lucky one. We normally just kill our targets but The Surgeon said we couldn\u2019t kill you, he had a special plan for you.\u201d The other gaurd said pulling out a syringe filled with pink liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Bill called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctors\u2019 new bimbo forumla. The most powerful one yet. Just one full injection of this is enough to cause a permanent body transformation and totally rewrite your sexual desires and memory. You will become a total at headed Barbie bimbo with no memory of your former life. Good like testifying tomorrow.\u201d The gaurds said laughing as they stuck Bill  with the needle and began injecting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had almost finished with all of a sudden there was a loud gunshot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaurd injecting Bill suddenly fell over as the last 10% of the formula. The part designed to wipe his brain and memory fell to the ground and was destroyed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreeze imposters!\u201d The former gaurds from earlier had come back because one had forgotten their keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other fake gaurd holding Bill released him as he suddenly reached for his gun. However not before the other two gunned him down as well....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill fell to the ground as his body was already starting to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did they give you?\u201d The real gaurds asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBimbo...formula....Oh...oh...God!\u201d Bill cried out as looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo mounds were forming on his chest as he began to rip off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBills short dark brown hair was getting longer and lighter. It was growing rapidly down his shoulders. It grew all the past his back till it touched his butt. It also turned a bright platinum blonde color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBills hands were next as they shrunk getting smaller and dainty. His nails grew longer and feminine as they seemed to turn a deep red color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bones were cracking and snapping as his body reshaped. Getting smaller and shorter, while his hips grew wiser and butt grew larger and his legs longer and slimmer. His body turned to a total hourglass shape in a matter of minutes.His feet grew smaller as well as his toenails changed color too matching his fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mounds growing on his chest had also formed definitive breasts and were growing rapidly. They surged past traditionally normal sizes quickly growing past DD cup status. Once they reached this level they seemed to lose their normal tear drop shape. They tuned round getting larger and larger hanging off his chest like two perfect spheres. When they finally stopped he had a rack any porn star would die for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes hit his stomach and crotch as his waist pulled in him and tight and flat tummy. Lastly his manhood shrunk and slithered away leaving only a smooth and feminine slit behind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change only last minutes but Bill was now in the body of busty blonde bimbo...</span></div></div>",

His hips making the trousers looked painted on, as they were plastered to his plump, perfect ass, and gorgeous round hips. The bust was stupendous even hidden beneath his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a child playing dress-up, it hung loose, his narrower shoulders, and shorter arms made him look ridiculous, and oddly vulnerable at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\" Bill swore, but stopped immediately, hearing her new voice. It hadn't sounded like anger, or frustration, instead, like an invitation, a demand to be satisfied. The agents tried to reassure her, \"We've seen the transformation, we can testify that you are still the same man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill stamped her foot, \"Well, I'm not still the same man, am I?\" Her voice rising towards the hysterical, as she scratched at her arms. Hugging herself, Bill tried to crush her bust back, to somehow restore a flatter, masculine chest. Instead, she only confirmed the size, heft, and sheer size of her new bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking impossibly pert, and firm. Bill's nipples were pressing her shirt forward with a passion it was impossible to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Bill took in her new body, her lower eye-line, her body she felt a twinge of pain. Instinctively, she started ripping off her clothes. Tossing the jacket on the ground, her bust gave a heavy shimmy, as she threw it down. But, that didn't ease the pain. Moments later, she was scrabbling for the buttons on her shirt. The long crimson nails making it far more difficult than she could've believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agents looked on horror-struck, confused, concerned that this was a bimbo side-effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It burns... it burns...\" Bill wailed, as she ripped the shirt free from her trousers waist. Again her bust shimmied, side to side, as she pulled it off over her head. Stamping angrily on the shirt, she stood on the collar, until the sleeves, surrendered to the inevitable, shredding and falling to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin revealed, it was inflamed and red. The damned injection had made her allergic to clothes. Everything she wore felt like it was made of nettles, any contact with her skin agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belt was easy, her small waist meant it was already several inches to large. The zipper slid down, driven by the strain from her wider hips, and full ass. Realising her pain, one of the agents jumped to help her undress. The boxers followed, not tailored for the contours they contained. Bill's feet were red as lobsters, as they were pulled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFanning herself with the her arms, Bill was left face to face with her image half-reflected in the window. The Surgeon had certainly got his revenge. This humiliation, worse than he could've imagined. Briefly, he considered the sweet oblivion that would have come with the full injection. The blissful ignorance, of not waking to find this damned body every morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain faded, as quickly as it arrived, leaving her naked and embarrassed. Not even the temptation of covering her nudity could ease her indignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a9cec28f828be03c86d80d72858399a/tumblr_oong61JRRv1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a9cec28f828...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked every inch the bimbo.

All those innocent young women he mislead. Most of them tourists or immigrants. All led to the surgeon and turned into bimbos just like him. However they were all sold off like slaves in the end. To which he took a percentage of the profit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...deserve this...\u201d She said sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later there was a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill it\u2019s Agent Milton can I come inside?\u201d The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill recognized the voice as she said yes. Opening the door Agent James Milton of the TPD stepped through the doorway. In his arms was a large bag full of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard what happened so I thought I would bring some clothes to try on.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bill would have just of thought as Milton as another guy. However in this new body she saw him as...handsome...sexy...even. Trying to shake those thoughts from her head she looked down to the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...can\u2019t...this bastard built in so many fail safes. I can\u2019t wear normal clothes...\u201d Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilton tried not to stare at Bill in her new body but even a trained agent like himself was still a warm blooded male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...we need to figure everything out so let\u2019s give it a try I bought almost everything here.\u201d Milton said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began to play a messed up version of dress up. However it seemed each time Bill tried something on it burned or itches like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeans...No...cotton t shirts....no...not even pajamas...Regular underwear didn\u2019t work either.\u201d Bill said frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some serious trial and error they found out that only the sexiest, lightest, clothes would work. As for shoes anything less than a three inch heel felt like stepping on glass. Underwear had to be satin or silk and bras needed to be lace. As of now they only found a few light and very revealing dresses that worked for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey at least we figured this out.\u201d Milton said trying to stay positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat...now I\u2019m just a bimbo who can\u2019t wear anything not sexy....\u201d Bill said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about your mind? Your memory. That is the most important thing here. It is the weapon we need against the surgeon.\u201d Milton asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine...the injection wasn\u2019t completed so I\u2019m still myself...mostly I think.\u201d Bill said trying to ignore his new urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s great. I\u2019ve spoken to the judge and my boss as the TPD. Unfortunately we can\u2019t move forward with your testimony. A new jury must be selected. One who will understand your situation and listen. This will time. In the meantime we will place you in a witness protection program. Set you up with a new identity and everything.\u201d Milton said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere can I go like this? This was all part of the surgeons plan! No matter where I go I will stand out!\u201d Bill said in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have several options trust us. Is there anything you want to tell me?\u201d Milton asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m fine.\u201d These were the words Bill told his brain to say even though it was an obvious lie. However...the words the actually came out of his mouth were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really fucking horny...\u201d Bill said. It took him a second to realize it before she covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Milton asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to say that! I don\u2019t know what came over me.\u201d Bill said embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, probably just shock from the transformation. You gonna be alright tonight alone?\u201d Milton asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...I will be fine.\u201d Bill said to his brain to tell his mouth to say these words....Howeber what she ended up saying was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...I want you to stay and have sex with me.\u201d Bill actually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? I didn\u2019t mean to say that!\u201d Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? Here...try as lie and something sexual. Tell me I\u2019m ugly and to leave.\u201d Milton said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are ugly and I want you to leave!\u201d These words pounded in Bill\u2019s mind. However his mouth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are hot and I want you inside me!\u201d Bill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat bastard...He made it so you can\u2019t lie about anything sexual....Like that old movie Liar Liar. Anything sexual your body has to tell the truth about.\u201d Milton noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god...no...Please...don\u2019t leave me. This body...I\u2019m getting so horny right now I\u2019m not sure how to handle it!\u201d Bill pleaded </span></div></div>",

Nick had ordered the driver to take you all to Jay\u2019s Tattoo shop on the other side of town. \u201cTake them to the house so they can get ready for tonight,\u201d he had told the driver once you and him had exited the car. The driver gave a curt nod and drove off. \u201cWhat\u2019s tonight?\u201d you had asked. \u201cGive me a second, doll,\u201d he gestured with a finger. Nick sent a flurry of text messages on his phone and you wondered how you would type anything with your significantly longer nails once you had a phone again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome, we have lots to do and not much time. We have to get you ready for the party!\u201d Nick seemed giddy as he lead you towards the tattoo shop. \u201cParty? Huh?\u201d you had asked. \u201cOh, that bimbo expression of yours!\u201d Nick said and you blushed. It was scary how naturally you slipped into your airhead persona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m throwing a party tonight to show you off to prospective clients. Brandy, Cindy and Cathy only got caught because they got careless walking back from a job yesterday. I\u2019ll have to have a talk with Brandy about that, by the way,\u201d he opened the door for you and you stepped in, \u201cI\u2019ll have the top spenders in the city drooling over you tonight. I know you\u2019re gonna be one of my top girls in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, you had never imagined you\u2019d be working for one of the top criminals in the city, let alone as one of his top hookers. The girl behind the front desk, sporting impressive tattoo sleeves, immediately recognized Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick! It\u2019s great to see you! It\u2019s been a while,\u201d she walked behind the desk and circled around you, inspecting you as if you were nothing more than a piece of art or a new car. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy, Cherry. You know how it is.\u201d Nick replied with a smile. \u201cOh, I know. It\u2019s been pretty crazy in here too. We always have time for our best investor though. The usual?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I was thinking of something extra for Candy,\u201d he said, giving you a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you straddle the tattoo artist\u2019s chair you discovered two new things about yourself. As Candy your pain tolerance was a lot lower than it used to be. Also, there was a pleasurable edge to that pain that you had never experienced before. You had never felt excited by such things before, but now a moan escaped your lips as the artist did their work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think that the artist is done, but they move to your left side and start on a second tattoo. You look up at Nick who was talking to another gentleman, possibly the shop\u2019s owner. He sees your questioning look, \u201cThink of this as a bonus, doll. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you feel a slight thrill at the pain from the tattoo needle and you wonder what other surprises your new body had come with. \u201cAll done,\u201d the artist declares. Nick graciously helps  you get up off the chair and brings you over to a full length mirror for you to check out your new tattoos. The one on the right was just like the one you\u2019d seen on the other girls. It marked you as belonging to Nick. You weren\u2019t exactly comfortable with that, but in your current position it was better than being completely alone with only a shred of an identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your right butt cheek you found a cute design of a piece of candy in a teal wrapper, with white lines on the edges of the wrapper. It looked like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/45/b3/82/45b3825b175ef6b14143a86e89b8569f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/45/b3/82/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Nick asks, his eyes never leaving your rear. \u201cOoh, it\u2019s so cute! It\u2019s so me!\u201d you say excitedly, feeling more afraid of how the Candy persona came to you easier and easier each time. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, though your ID said you were much younger than you had been originally, 21, you had supposedly been first picked up for soliciting at 18. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jack had created your cover\u2019s background more as a joke than anything else at the time. There wasn\u2019t much need for a detailed background if all you were going to do was look pretty on a street corner until someone took the bait. However, due to the extreme level of your transformation it was necessary to create identification for your new body and you\u2019d both gotten carried away creating your background as Candy. All it had taken was a few clicks and the system had generated records and documents that solidified your identity. \u201cWhy not?\u201d you had said to Jack at the time, shrugging and jostling your breasts with the movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you found yourself trapped by the identity you had both created for a few quick laughs. Only Jack had had the password to the file that would prove Candy was just a cover. You would never had thought he would have a heart attack and leave you stranded. You had an ID, and a criminal record, but no education, you hadn\u2019t bothered to create even a high school diploma for your cover identity. There hadn\u2019t been a need and Jack had said, \u201cFace it buddy, the only education Candy got was how to spread her legs,\u201d you had punched him for that, but he just laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and down the street. You were in lockup long enough that the sun is already coming down on the following day. All you have is your ID and your release paperwork squeezed between your breasts, the slutty clothes you were wearing and that was it. To the world you were a criminal, high school dropout and a prostitute. You had no family, no place to live and no hope of returning to your old life. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You only have a brief moment after you strip off the stinking skin, still reeking from the smell of the cells. The odour of cheap perfume and desperation get sloughed to pile around your feet. You spare a brief scratch, as you step out of the skin. The tan Latina skin at least looks and smells fresh. It'll take a little getting used to, but you slip your legs in, and pull it up around your waist. Smoothing out the wrinkles, you give your arse an appraising pat. It certainly won't be the last you'll receive. Your arms winnow away to almost nothing, as you slide them on like sleeves. You'll need your 'charm' if you get in a tricky situation, and won't be able to fight your way free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slip the last piece into place, you feel the wave of long, straight hair pour down your spine. You roll your neck experimentally, getting out all the kinks. A pretty face looks pensively back from the mirror. However, you doubt many people will be looking at your face once you start dancing. Your ass, is big, round, full and firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short walk back to your boss, is enough to drive home how different this all feels. Each pace sends a ripple up your spine. You try hard not to imagine wrapping one leg around that brass pole, and pirouetting for the leering approval of the whooping audience. But your own imagination betrays you. It's just such a seductive image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of your boss, you see him sitting there. <b><i>Eww</i></b>, he covering his crotch. You're getting him excited. Concern and disgust battle over your features, as your lip curls up at one corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your whole body warm, every inch suddenly rising in temperature. You give out a chorus of denials. Your voice rising, \"No... No... No... No...\" However, the sensation is too familiar. He blocks your weak punch, batting away your tiny fist. It's your own skin, being eaten away by the flexi-skin. You're in this for the long haul, it'll take weeks until your own skin grows back, and you can take this form off, and return to your normal manly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say this was deep cover.\" you snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll scan you, should you succeed. They know about synth-skin, but they'll only do that once, and then you're safe.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From your investigative research, you were familiar with Big Tony.  He controlled most of the girls on the West side.  You could feel Big Tony\u2019s eyes going up and down your body.  He finally grabbed you firmly by the arm and whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assumed your partner would be the one who was bailing you out of jail.  As Big Tony practically drags you out the door, your heels barely can keep up.  Big Tony has a driver waiting and he pushes you into the back seat and climbs in.  Now inside the tinted windows of a car, Big Tony glares at you and slaps you across the face.  You scream quickly in pain wondering what is happening.  Big Tony shakes his head, \u201cWhere the hell have you been Vicki?  Did you honestly think you could just skip town and not pay your debts to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour female hormones and small body caused you to suddenly cry.  Big Tony just called you \u2018Vicki.\u2019  Who was Vicki?  You thought.  You quickly realize that Vicki was a hooker\u2019s body that was probably used by other undercover agents before.  She must have been on Big Tony\u2019s payroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Tony grabs your hair and pulls it, \u201cStop crying!\u201d  You manage to stop the tears and Big Tony\u2019s demeanor changes.  He gets a more sincere face and asks, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to thank me for bailing you out?  I could have left you in there for a week with the other sluts.\u201d  Big Tony runs his fingers down your cheek and smiles, \u201cI missed having one of my most popular girls around.  I can\u2019t believe you were trying to work alone again.  Haven\u2019t I always been good to you Vicki?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and Big Tony smiles, \u201cGood.  I\u2019m glad you are back.\u201d  Tony tells the driver, \u2018Stop at Frankie\u2019s place.\u201d  Big Tony looks back at you and says, \u201cYou remember Frankie don\u2019t you?  He has been asking about you for months. You better give him a good time.  I promised him one on-the-house when you were back in town.\u201d  The car stops and Big Tony pulls out a mirror with a line of cocaine on it and holds it near your nose, \u201cGo ahead Vicki.  I know it\u2019s a shame to work for free.  At least you can enjoy this while you entertain Frankie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the line of cocaine, you realize you have no choice.  You have to keep your cover and take the drugs.  After snorting the line, Big Tony opens the door and pulls you out.  He briskly ushers you into Frankie\u2019s place and whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about running this time Vicki!  My driver will be watching you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you nervously head into Frankie\u2019s place, you wonder if this was all a set up.  Normally on your prostitution stings, you have never even had to do much more than flirt with a guy before they arrest him for picking you up.  Now you are inside and Frankie is waiting for his favorite girl, Vicki.  Will your partner suddenly snap into action and make a bust? It\u2019s hard enough in the heels to keep up, you are now inside and desperately look around for any sign of your partner.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thought of walking and listening, doesn't fill you with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>~This is no simple Hump and Dump. You're going after the big fish.

The girls, the other girls, lounge about with you assume a couple of customers wandering nervously from girl to girl. They nervously eye the bouncers flanking the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot half as nervous, as they make you feel. Your escape absolutely impossible with those two slabs of men. Each over a head taller than you, and twice your weight (all muscle). You couldn't beat either let alone both of them.</span></div></div>",

A once respected magazine, its now grayish pages contained what seemed to be gossip from all around the globe - with headlines such as, \"Russian ships are a provocation of new war!\", \"The Chi-coms are taking over this economy.\", and \"Will Toranpu's secret love affair finally spark a debate?\" It's all nonsense -- a result of the CIA abandoning the sinking vessel and cutting all of its lines of communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still reading that crap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance upwards as your roommate Igor strides into the room. Tall; short, sandy blonde hair; chiseled musculature; and what girl would describe as 'handsome', he was the target of men's envy and women's desire. Born in Boston to a pair of Russian and Ukrainian immigrants, he was recruited to the TFPD at a remarkably young age and trained by the brightest counterintelligence agents. Hailed as a genius, this was all owed to a special genome that was present in him since birth. Remarkably, it allowed him to essentially mutate his body: turning fat into muscles, control the flow of blood within his veins and arteries, and hair growth, among others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, on the other hand, were recruited at an old (for a counterintelligence officer!) age, at a ripe 19, and thus were considered to be an upstart, given your position. Your recruitment story is also quite unorthodox, considering you were just a normal civilian who studied in college, aiming to become a mechanical engineer. Yet that all turned about when Igor, having been chasing after a high profile target, committed a blunder by stabbing your lung after he rounded yet another corner in chase, surprised by your presence. Fortunately, the resources of the TFPD kept you alive, but the near-death experience also awoke something deep within you -- a genome that resonated with Igor's -- that held quite a few secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet now, after being promoted to corporal within the ranks, you were one part of the famous duo that thwarted world-ending crises using wits and skill, deviously combating madmen to ensure that people get to see another tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's not even that interesting,\" you reply, tossing aside the journal. A swift press of the button and out comes the champagne bottle. You gently twist the cork and pour yourself a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already drinking this early in the morning?\" Igor tuts, clearly displeased. \"Seems you haven't been drilled enough. To think that an ace of the prestigious counterintelligence division is drinking his ass to a stupor! How shameful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut it, will ya? It's not as if you guys aren't putting me through the runner in each day. I haven't had a break in so long... give me some slack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs his shoulders. \"Considering that you're on duty now, I don't see why I should.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan, \"The old hag's got another mission for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mission never ends, friend. The world is always in danger and we, the counterintelligence agents of the TFPD, are always here to save it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sounds a hell of a lot of work for me,\" you sigh, slamming the champagne bottle back into its ice bucket. \"What's the disaster this time?\"</span></div></div>",

Large breasts, wide curves, etc.\u201d Igor said going over the assignment with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have done seduction missions as bimbos in the past, making friends with a horny young man in his early 20\u2019s should be a piece of cake.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait there is more here. The mission states we have to pose as students on the college campus where he is staying. We are to become his new world. I have to become his new best friend and you have to become his new girlfriend. We have to support and encourage him in whatever ways necessary to make sure he develops a solid social life and passes his remaining classes and graduates this summer..\u201d Igor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...Fall quarter just started and summer quarter won\u2019t end till August. That means we will be stuck in these bodies for almost a full year!\u201d You said in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the assignment says. If the son fails school it will show very badly on the president who is running for re-election next year. He has promised to fully fund the TPD is this mission is a success for the remainder of his term.\u201d Igor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...This isn\u2019t so much a mission as a bribe...Get my kid a life and through school and I will make sure you are funded. This is why I hate curropt politics.\u201d You said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so...The director of the TPD has already agreed to the mission and assigned us. It\u2019s our mission now. You ready for this?\u201d Igor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy for you to say. You just to lose a few years and become a hot college guy again. I get to bring out my buxom bimbo look. I\u2019ve never spent this long transformed as the opposite gender before. Are the TPD scientists sure it\u2019s safe?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything negative. If anything comes up HQ will alert us. Shall we begin?\u201d Igor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...see you on the other side partner...\u201d You said with a heavy sigh. The things you do to protect your job and department really pushes your limits before but this was on a whole new level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to your private room you opened up your private black briefcase you kept locked and hidden under your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the case inside was a variety of transformation pills all labeled and colored for the varied types of women you had to become in your line of work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransformation into another gender was a serious process that caused severe strain on the body and mind for most. It took years of training for you to adapt to it and even still the process took its toll on you. That\u2019s why you were selected for the girlfriend role. Not many agents could handle such a task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the bright pink pill labeled \u201cBimbo\u201d and shook it to activate the nanomachines inside. You only did this form rarely and it had been years since your last time in this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the pill you swallowed it whole as you waited for the transformation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later your body was burning as it was twisting and turning as it changed shape rapidly. Huge breasys erupted from your chest as long brigjt blonde hair grew from your scalp. Your body shrunk as your hips widened and skin turned smooth.

The receptionist at 'The Bunny Hutch', was open once again. Working as a receptionist in a legal brothel wasn't what most secretaries would consider impressive in their work history. However, as a temp it was meant to be a step up for Belinda, as Barry had chosen to name his new persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelinda Miami, had a convincing set of IDs and paperwork and now a convincing real background that could withstand scrutiny by the sleazier section of society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the legalisation of prostitution it was still a seedy business even as it tried to disguise itself as executive services.

She wasn't applying to be one of the girls. Thank God, she thought with a shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview passed in a blur, with remarkably little competition. Just as she'd suspected none of the other candidates were so enthusiastic to win the job. Given her recent experience it was understandable. But, Belinda presented herself as if she were taking it as a step upwards. She was getting a permanent full-time job and security and leaving behind the insecure temping life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next day, she was being shown her work position and the computer booking system.

All law enforcement dealt with awful things but her department got the ones where no rational explanation applied.  Looking at the poor twisted creature in the cell she felt only pity.  A creature that might be called a minotaur in ancient Greece stared at her.  A genetic splicing freak that now could not contain its fits of rage.  Every so often he would bash his head against the metal bars to no effect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinosa hoped the techs could get the auto translater to figure out if the noises it made meant anything.  She didn't even know if it was originally human or not.  She glared at it looking for some sentience in the eyes when it ran up and repeated its cycle of bashing its head against the cage.  The detective just shook her head and moved on without flinching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meandered to her office wondering where to start.  Several files lay strewn on her desk.  What rabbit hole should she explore today.  Spinosa opened a small file on the right side of her desk revealing the photo of young woman and her baby.  Only the picture deceived for upon perusal the file revealed the baby to be the young ladies husband.  A man who suddenly began deaging and only stabilized when he reached infancy.  The cause remained unknown.  She flipped the file shut opening another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne file she didn't bother opening she knew it well.  A series of human cyborgs kept getting discovered.

She was gorgeous, with curves in all the right places, and the cops had initially assessed her as yet another wayward young woman fallen to prostitution and drugs. The station saw no end of their ilk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet in the morning, she was no more lucid. She just rambled incoherently. She couldn't give them a place of residence or even a name that made sense, and when asked basic questions like what year it was or who was president, the 'Jane Doe' had given answers like \"1955\" or \"Eisenhower\". When pressed, she had become angry and confused, and lashed out at one of the interviewers. For all her beauty, she had a mean right hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police ran through a number of likely theories. They tested her for alcohol, which came back negative, and sent off a sample of her blood to be checked for drugs. When she failed to sober up, they began to suspect she was a drug mule, that most likely a package of narcotics smuggled in her gut was leaking into her system. She was rushed to hospital for an X-ray. To their confusion, the x-ray revealed that underneath her pretty exterior, she was sporting bilateral prosthetic hip replacements, was fitted with a pacemaker, and that her bones showed signs of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and repeated breaking and rehealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the results of the blood tests came in. They were <i>very </i>positive, except instead of recreational substances like cocaine or heroine, it was a cocktail of the sort of medication you'd expect to see in a pensioner - drugs for treating hypertension, heart arrhythmia, Alzheimer's and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey suspected that the woman had been poisoned, and opened an investigation. Finally they ran her fingerprints, and that's when things got even stranger. With 99.9% certainty, the database came back with a match... for an 80 year old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetective Spinosa looked over the matched ID in the folder. Mr Donald Watkins. Born 22 May, 1936. Retired accountant. His only criminal record came from four years ago, when an altercation with his wife had alarmed a neighbour enough for them to call the police. Mr Watkins had been brought in to the station and his prints taken, though his wife gave a statement explaining that Donald often became agitated on account of his dementia, and that she would not be pressing charges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaffled, the police had finally done the sensible thing and contacted the FBI. The FBI took one look at it and forwarded it to the TFPD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious Jane Doe had been transferred to a comfortable waiting cell in the basement of TFPD headquarters. Spinosa had requested further tests including a DNA analysis before she allowed Doctor Yamato in on this. Yamato wasn't known for his bedside manner, and there was no need to have him poking and prodding and terrifying her interview subject before it was absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinosa considered her options...</span></div></div>",

Spinosa set the file aside and headed to the canteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brown envelope was waiting in the in-tray when she returned from lunch, the word <span class=\"cred\">Urgent</span> written on the front. The contents were a printout of densely worded scientific jargon summarizing dozens of gene sequences and blood components. She flipped through to the summary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Sample: haem, Ms Jane Doe#3397<br>\r\nSemblance: Human, caucasian, female, ?late teens<br>\r\nPresentation: found streets in confused state<br>\r\nResults: Y-chromosome positive.

It hadn't even occurred to her that Jane Doe was three days off her meds! Quickly Spinosa leaped to her feet and dashed through the station, taking the flights of stairs to the basement three at a time. She badged herself past the electronic doors and hurried to \"Jane\"'s cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it was empty. An unpleasant odour greeted her nose and a janitor was mopping up a brown smear on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? Where's Jane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had a little bit of <i>accident</i>,\" the janitor said breezily. \"Poor girl couldn't get to the toilet in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean she-\" Spinosa wrinkled her nose. \"-soiled herself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you gotta go, you gotta go,\" the Janitor smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Brandon took her to get cleaned up. Taking his time getting her back though...\" he said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take a great application of her detective skills to find where Officer Brandon had taken \"Jane\". A thin brown trail ran out through the door, along the corridor and to the shower facilities that stood next the cells. She couldn't help but feel pity for the poor \"Jane\", what she had no doubt was this Donald Watkins. Somebody out there had taken this poor, confused old man and methodically, surgically cut-apart and mutilated him into the shape of a fetching young woman. For what end, she couldn't say for certain, but she'd seen enough in this job to make an educated guess. She couldn't even begin to fathom what he must be going through, how confused he must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trail led to the far cubicle. On the other side of the door she could hear the sound of a running shower. There was no sign of Officer Brandon. She tried the handle. It was locked. An uneasy feeling began to form in the pit of her stomach. Brandon was a rookie - the typical ambitious, hypermasculine meathead that tended to got filtered out in their first year. Hoping against hope, she pressed her ear against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-oh yeah. Oh yeeaah. Dirty girl. Mmm. You just can't help yourself, can you, you dirty, ugh, dirty, filthy girl,\" came the lustful, breathless grunts of Officer Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Spinosa hammered against the door. \"Openthisdoorrightnowwhateveritisyou'redoingintherefuckingstopitorIswear togodIwillbreakthisdoordown!\" Hearing no reply, she took a step back, braced herself, and kicked in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jane''s scant clothes were bundled with up atop a police uniform just inside the door. Officer Brandon was cursing loudly as he desperately tried to extricate himself from Donald Watkin's pussy. They stood naked beneath the shower. \"Jane\" was turned towards the wall, legs spread, hands flat against the tiles, water pouring down her arched back. Brandon stood behind her, balls deep in her pussy, his hands gripping her in such a way that it was obvious to Spinosa that he was the only thing holding \"her\" up. Donald looked near to collapse. Her knees were shaking, her breath came in worryingly ragged gasps, and her face looked ashen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain!\" Brandon gasped, sliding his turgid, dripping manhood free and trying to conceal it with his hand. \"She came onto me. She...she kept grabbing onto me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he can barely stand up by himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but she was drooling all over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he's an eighty-fucking-years-old pensioner with dementia, you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what! Look you can't tell anybody about this! It was a mistake. I just got this job. They'll take my badge-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think they'll just have your <i>badge</i> for this?\" Spinosa roared. She grabbed a towel and moved to wrap it around the poor ex-man's slender shoulders. Yet as she did, Jane's grey eyes went suddenly wide she clutched her chest. Her whole body seemed to seize up, then go limp, and she hit the floor with a wet, hard smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck.\" Spinosa knelt beside her. \"Can you hear me?! Jane- I mean, Mr Watkins? Donald? Can you...\" Her voice trailed away as she searched for a pulse, and felt nothing... </span></div></div>",

The family looked up in alarm and pale-faced worry, but that quickly turned to joy at the Doctor's cry of \"success! The surgery was a complete success!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter, whatever-her-name-was (he never bothered to learn the patients' names, there were so many of them) rose from her seat and came to grip his hands in her own, wrinkled own, thanking him profusely. Doctor Mandeville assured her that her gratitude was needless, that he only got into this line of work for the selfless act of helping others, and could she redirect her praise to the clinic's facebook or twitter pages where other clients could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe granddaughter, a far more comely girl in her 30s, asked \"when can we go in to see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? See who?\" Mandeville beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, grandfather. The man you've just been operating on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right of course!\" the Doctor beamed, spinning on his heel. He stared down the corridor, confused for a moment at its emptiness, before remembering the remote in his pocket. It was the size of a TV remote and covered in buttons that governed all sorts of functions - except instead of 'volume' or 'channel', these buttons controlled things like 'pace' and 'gait'. He pressed the 'home' button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swing doors at the far end of the corridor swung open. A silver-haired old man in a surgical gown emerged and walked towards them, his gait unsteady, a little <i>mechanical </i>perhaps, but remarkable for a man who, until yesterday, had been so riddled with arthritis as to be bedbound. \"Remarkable! Truly remarkable!\" crowed Bernard, staring at his own legs with incredulity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family erupted into cries of surprise and awe. \"Bernard, you're walking!\" cries the man's elderly wife, looking like she might collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I am, my dear! Why, I daresay I could dance if I wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandeville beamed. Happy to oblige, he thumbed the 'Dance' button on the remote. Bernard suddenly broke into an animated jig, skipping and jumping about the clinic's corridors like an Irish dancer. He finished with an acrobatic leap. Bernard could barely believe his own eyes. He clutched his chest, wheezing from the exertion, even though it was the servomotors in the joints that had done 95% of the work. \"Warn me next time you do that, Doctor,\" Bernard puffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this even possible?\" the granddaughter cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing really. Jesus was making the lame walk two thousand years ago, I've just improved on his work is all,\" Mandeville said humbly. \"It's really not much more than a standard hip and knee replacement really. The only difference is that we replace the entire joint, not with a prosthetic joint but with a servomotor equivalent. It's useful in cases where the muscles have atrophied beyond the ability to manipulate the joint - really the motors are doing all the work, your grandfather is just along for the ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what a ride it is! I've never seen him this happy. We can't thank you enough. Are you sure you don't want any payment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved away her comments. \"The only payment I need is the joy on my patients' faces. Aaand of course we will be housing your grandfather in our facility for the next few months while we perform tests to judge the efficacy of this groundbreaking treatment. In exchange for waiving the $320,000 fees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we completely understand. What sort of tests will you be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing how the patient adapts. Checking his mobility, and balance more importantly. These devices are to be fitted in very frail patients - we can't have them falling over due to improperly calibrated motors or glitchy software.\" He pressed a button to make Bernard swivel on the spot, and gestured to the gap in the surgical gown where a gnarly, fresh surgical scar could be seen running from the old man's coccyx to his lower thoracic vertebrae. \"We had to take out most of the lower spinal column to replace with the motors and computer hub that detects and maintains balance. That is the main section we're concerned about - how it interfaces with the legs and how it compensates with the movement of the limbs of the natural body.\" He sucked air through his teeth, like a plumber about to add an extra zero to a tricky job. \"That's the tricky part - having only half of a mechanised skeleton. The machine half has to compensate for the unpredictability of the human remains. There's a possibility we might need to fully replace the shoulder and elbow joints if that becomes a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that likely to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who can say,\" Mandeville replied, the flicker of a wicked smirk tweaking the edge of his mouth. \"Who can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we able to visit him at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's out of the question. The clinic is completely sealed to outside eyes. This is cutting edge work we're doing here after all. You understand, yes?\" The grand-daughter looks crestfallen at his words, but fortunately Mandeville has never been burdened with an excess of empathy. He claps his hands sharply, and jabs the remote at Bernard like a parent switching off the children's TV at bedtime. \"That's enough for today. Our patient needs his rest after all. Say goodbye, Bernard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Ere, I 'adn't finished talkin' to them yet,\" Bernard remarked indignantly as his legs began to frog march him down the corridor, away from his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you'll see them again, Bernard,\" Mandeville lied, walking a few paces behind his patient. After they turned a corner, he eagerly tapped a few settings on the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servomotor skeleton of metal and plastic whined as the joints that had once been the old man's hips shifted into a new configuration, switching the previously stiff gait into a smooth, swaying motion, the old man's saggy ass cheeks sashaying from side to side with each mincing, feminine stride. The ramrod straight spine angled forward into a smooth curve, forcing the backside to jut out proudly. The ankle servomotor joints tightened, lifting the feet on to tiptoes, as if the man was wearing invisible stiletto shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernard twigged immediately that something is different, though naturally he had no way of guessing that his doctor had given him the gait of a broad-hipped catwalk model, and he would have been powerless to do anything about it if he had - the motors were 10x more powerful than anything the geriatric's atrophied muscles could muster. Mandeville relished the intoxicating feeling of power watching the unfortunate man strut himself for the Doctor's personal enjoyment.</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t be late.\u201d  Tossing a sheet with details of time and place.  She left Spinosa to gather the lecture material.  Spinosa understood that it helped keep them ingratiated with the scientific community.  It occasionally led to recruits.  An added benefit of keeping the public informed.  But Spinosa simply hated public speaking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene fiddling with the wiring harness trying to trouble shoot the problem.  Professor Weiler told him the genetic synthesizer kept cutting out during critical portions of analysis.  Probably overtaxing the computer but they paid him to make sure of and run diagnostics.  The fine layer of dust inside definitely gave him an idea that maintenance and basic care might be at fault for any malfunctions.  Shrugging his shoulders figuring he got paid by the hour it didn\u2019t matter.  With goggles and a mask on, battling dust bunnies a hazard of the job.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting out scratching his head thinking over a mental check list.  Double checking cord connections\u2026check.  Replacing any frayed wires\u2026check.  Individual systems functioning\u2026check.  Nervously he decided to power up the whole machine to see how it ran together.  A humming noise sounding the device springing to life.  No explosions the first good sign he laughed.  Moving over to the chamber entering to make sure the injector powered up.  Satisfied that the back light showed green he ran his eyes down the tubing.  Rolling his eyes at finding specimen vials screwed in.  They probably congealed not being refrigerated.  Clogging up the tubing causing all of the problems.  Unscrewing the vials he deposited them in a biohazard container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the chamber to clear out the lines the injector activated. Laser guided targeting sighting him in.  It stuck him in the arm.  After pulling free Gene rubbing his wound.  Next heading to the first aid kit washing it clean and putting a band-aid atop it.  Shutting off the machine shaking his head.  He didn\u2019t put it into targeting mode.  It must have been left activated when turned off.  His removing of the vials clearing the blockage enough to operate.  Reminding himself that no deadly disease research only basic genetic research and trying to gain better understanding of the building blocks of life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlushing the lines he forgot his injury.  He wrote up a note asking the professor to check the programming because injector fired off without a set target and of the vials being left in the machine.  Gene locked up the lab and headed to class.  His side work paid well and got him access to many professors notoriously dismissive of student interaction.  If you could fix their equipment they often came to you.  Classes passed without any incident.  Gene slipped in on a visiting Tfpd officer doing a guest lecture on ethics in transformation and the hardships of the job.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer sharing fascinating and often graphic pictures of the misuse and abuse of science.  A man subjected to a growth ray that caused his head to rapidly enlarge till it snapped his neck.  A woman trying to achieve a young look found themselves deaging mentally and physically stuck as a toddler.  Sports stars looking for an edge falling prey to illicit options.  All of the examples going horribly wrong.  One boxer attempting to get a granite jaw found himself little more than a statue.  A memorable transformation that made headlines Arthur \u201cThe Arm\u201d Macnally.  Throwing a deep pass during a game on live TV his arm elongated several feet before it flopped to the ground.  Medical staff coiled it atop him as they carried him off the field.  Never played a game again.  In an interview he talked about shoulder and arm issues.  He thought he would get a few years in with his treatment but he ended up needing to have it amputated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the lecture Gene grabbing a card from the officer wiping his sweaty brow.  He must be coming down with something.  Back to his room his vision blurred.  It cleared with his head throbbing.  He thought back on it injection his churning stomach guiding him to the toilet.  Regurgitating remnants of his last meal.  Standing on his wobbly feet attempting to reach his cell phone.  Gene\u2019s eyes rolling back as he fell on the carpet.<br>\r\n              </span></div></div>",

Any officers that spent time there found how tough the unit really was and would get the scars to prove it.  Frequent visitors to Doctor Yamato the job often involved brutal tasks taking down beasts and monsters others couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieutenant Bryson led the unit with military discipline.  He didn't tolerate fooling around or lack of  awareness.  A tall well muscled man with a synth skin covering portions of skin where the minotaur gored him.  This is why he regularly tested those under him to make sure nothing could surprise them.  With the strange creatures they faced Bryson tried to keep them on their toes.  The only gentleness his officers saw in him was to the canines in their unit.  He knew they wouldn't lose their edge if he showed them kindness.  He cared for the members of the unit but worried about getting close in a tough job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryson currently walked down the batch of new dogs sent down for training.  They sat obediently awaiting the next command.  A mixture of dogs made the line up to fit in with varied needs of the K9 unit.  Hounds that could track almost anything, guard dogs whose obedience over road fear of whatever they were tasked to take down.  Even some smaller dogs to go after smaller targets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began having some officers taking individual dogs through their paces while he observed.  He needed to weed out those that couldn't obey before they went through an expensive enhancement process.  Genetic and cybernetic processes to help the dogs better perform up to the stresses of the Tfpd.  Sadly few dogs would reach retirement due to the dangers of the job and the strain the enhancements did to their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of Bryson's eye he saw one of the German Shepard's go into a fit.  He called out, \"Call Dr Harrison and let her know we have a dog having a seizure.\"  He ran over to the dog which twitched of the on the with drool formed a puddle on the ground.  He lifted it noticing a lot of fur fall to ground as he hurried to the door.  As he moved the dog began to gain weight.  Bryson looked down to see that all of the hair fallen off the dog.  He stared as the paws grew into hands.  The tips extending out as the claws became clear and flattened over them.  Bryson didn't know what was happening but knew he couldn't help the fragile creature in his arms so he continued to Dr Harrison's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Harrison maintained an office and laboratory in the sizable headquarters.  Top of his class in biology and trained as a veterinarian she came to the department to further his understanding of the possibilities for genetic enhancement.  He loved the fascinating cases that came across his table.  He enjoyed trying to work out how to reverse the transformations.  The liberty he was given with no fear of being put in prison for his experimentations made this job ideal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Harrison looked in excitement at the creature Bryson brought to him.  A strange mixture of human and dog it took a minute to realize shape was changing before his eyes.  The snout shrank back into a human shape.  The black nose turned into a light pink color angling into a straight small nose.  Brunette Hair poured from the head hanging down across the now human features.  A feminine face who moaned in pain but showed no other sign of wakefulness.  Bryson laid the body on the table asking, \"Can you do something for her pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to attach a neural inhibitor that should help.  It will numb any pain she is feeling.  I got a call about a German Shepard having seizures is this it?\"  Dr Harrison  place a half circle metallic device with suctions at the ends that he attached to the temples of the creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryson answered, \"It is the same dog have you seen anything like this before?\"  He calmed down slightly seeing the female stop seizing and relax as the inhibitor took effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen splicing victims before but only after the fact.  I have watched  confiscated video of the procedures being done but never without equipment controlling the rate and maintaining the vital signs of the subject.  This must be some new technology that I am unaware of.  I wonder if she is a dog or a human reverting back?  Where did you pick her up from?\"  He took out wireless sensor and attached it between her budding breasts.  On either side a circular portion of the skin darkened into nipples that hardened in the cool air of the exam room.  The nipples on her stomach faded into her skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a service that does basic training with the dogs and then brings them in if they think they are ready.  They purchase them from reputable breeders'.  I will have to check my records to find out where she was purchased.\"  Bryson looked away feeling embarrassed to look at the naked young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's breasts filled out taking on a modest size.  She began to wake stretching out her now shapely legs.  She opened her dark brown eyes to Bryson's turned back. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We mean you no harm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of Dr. Harrison\u2019s voice, she turned to face him.  She made no vocal sounds just stared at the source.  Bryson turned back to face the Dr.  Harrison and the woman shocked to find the girl awake.  He grabbed a lab coat placing it on the woman\u2019s shoulders to give her some modesty.  Startled she bit his hand.  He pulled away quickly realizing his foolishness.  The doctor stuck her with the sedative during her distraction.  She twisted around leaping at Dr. Harrison causing him to reel back stumbling a bit before falling on the hard floor.  The young woman clumsily missed disoriented by the medication.  She stopped suddenly giving a curious look to Dr. Harrison.  She tried to stay awake groggily she spoke out, \u201cWho are you?\u201d  before succumbing to the medication.  She slept quietly on the cool floor with Bryson observing with drawn stun gun waiting for any movement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think she might\u2019ve been human originally Dr. Harrison?\u201d Bryson asked while he kept his stun gun trained on the slumped figure on the floor.

Dang, this is the sloppiness I try to drill out of my people.\u201d  Bryson looked down at his hand shaking his head.  He walked over to a cabinet picking out a can of synth skin spraying it on leaving sheen to his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harrison lifted the petite girl back on the exam table and activate the restraints.  Dr. Harrison said, \u201cCould you contact Doctor Yamato and see if he is available?  I think he might like a look at her if he has the time.  Don\u2019t beat yourself up, this was hardly an expected development.  I will run some tests and give you call when I know more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I might head out after the call.

For all the benefits of the amnion implant, it has left your muscles weak and your joints laxer than they should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want A&amp;E, we don't officially open until 9am,\" the man grumbles. \"You'd best hobble on over to the old building.

You've got a lot of high tech on display, over a billion dollars in robotics in one building alone. That sort of money tends to draw attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the latest in security measures too. I'm not the only one set to be out of a job soon,\" he says to you with a grim smile. He extends a hand for you to shake. \"Doctor Gurdeep Singh.\" Now it's your turn to look him up and down. The guy looks a mess, unshaven, eyes bloodshot as though he's been drinking for days, shirt flapping in the breeze. If he works here, he stands in stark contrast to the gleaming modern hospital. Definitely a man long passed giving a fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rummages in his jeans and pulls out an ID badge, the smiling, shaven photograph on the front evidently from happier times. \"I'll let you in. About all I'm good for these days, a doorman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swipes his badge and the doors slide open to reveal the foyer, all marble and polished metal and glass. You're about the step inside when the floor begins to slide under your feet and you are smoothly conveyed forward towards the reception desk. Dr Singh curses loudly as he and his collection of cigarette buts are conveyed alongside you. What first looks to be a flat, grey rat scurries across the floor and begins to hoover up the detritus around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn many ways it resembles an airport check-in. There are dozens of monitors set-up all the way down the length of the long desk. When opened and at capacity, this hall will be processing thousands of patients per day, though currently it is deserted aside for the sanitation robot now spraying down the region around Gurdeep with antiseptic. The conveyor belt splits, sending the doctor to one monitor, while you to another. He waves his badge angrily at the monitor and it swings aside to allow him entry to the other side of the desk with a remark of \"Welcome to the Automated Infirmary, Mister Singh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Doctor</i> Singh.

I want to go shopping...I wanna look sexy...I think you are super cute and....\u201d The woman said as she was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough...We get the picture.\u201d Detective Tanner said holding up his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two detectives left the room as they drank their coffee trying to figure this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the third case this month....We have a permanently feminized subject showing signs of mental feminization as well.\u201d Erik said to his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has to be something new...All the legal feminization drugs have a 12 hour change limit built into them mandated by the FDA. Mental changes are also strictly forbidden. Do you think the rumors of Efemoral are true?\u201d Marcus asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEfemoral was the base drug used in all feminization products. It rewrites the DNA to become a highly sexualized female. The distribution and control of Efemoral is highly secret and it never hits the streets. That\u2019s because it\u2019s raw form Efemoral is too potent for a normal person. It causes permanent transformations that also affect the mind often causes the subject to lose their memories and become a total over sexualized female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why legal feminization products take the Efemoral and cut it and dilute it down to ensure the transformations are always temporary and never affect the mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever word on the street was a couple months ago a government supply truck was attacked by cartel gangsters and its cargo taken. That would mean there was an untold supply of uncut Efemoral running around somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erik and Marcus spoke another TFPD officer showed up looking for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetectives....we have another one...transformed female saying she was a male but hasn\u2019t been able to turn back. However this time she claims to not have taken any TF drugs at all...\u201d The officer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForceful transformations...this is getting worse...I will question the new victim see what you can get out this one.\u201d Erik said as Marcus nodded.</span></div></div>",

He made sure to keep his eyes above neck level. \"We can turn the air con on if you're warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just these clothes. They're so constricting,\" she murmured, squirming in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus made a note, wondering if the rejection of male clothing was a sign of mental change or if her new proportions were simply badly matched to her male attire. \"We have some clothes that you can change into if you'd like. We're going to assign you a transition counselor, somebody who can help you through this. They can help you find things that fit.\" For the first time, the victim's demeanor brightened noticeably at the mention of chosing clothing. <i>Definitely some mental degradation</i>, he noted. \"They can also work you through changing your ID with the appropriate databases. Though we don't recommend it, we do understand if you would prefer to keep your changes from friends and family. If you decide on it, we can assist in establishing a new identity for yourself, though if this is something you'd like to consider, you need to decide now rather than later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe victim's lip wobbled, tears coming to her eyes. \"So there's no way of changing me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That remains to be seen. If it is uncut efemerol we're dealing with... then no, but there are other substances on the streets that could reproduce these effects, and there's a chance those might begin to wear off in a few days or weeks. In the meantime, we're going to do everything we can to catch the creep that did this. I'd like to go over your description of the woman you met. Do you remember anything specific about her, anything that might help us identify her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman thought. \"She was tall for a woman. Like my height-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your height as a man?\" She nodded, glances down at herself as she realised her reduced stature for the first time. \"Which was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6'1\". And she had a tattoo on her shoulder, kinda like a knot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus pushed his notepad and pen across the table, and she did her best scribbling in from memory a type of celtic knot symbol. Her brown furrowed as she read the note above - \"hey, what's this about 'mental changes'?\" she said, looking at him with wide, terrified eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay focused on the woman for a minute. Did she have an accent or way of speaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't know. Maybe european. Irish maybe, or Scottish. What 'mental changes'? What's happening to me? I keep thinking these thoughts, only they're not my thoughts. I keep thinking about... dicks. Why can't I stop thinking about dicks? Oh god, what's happening to me? I don't want to be a woman. I want to be a man.\" Tears had begun to run down her cheeks, and Marcus quickly retrieved his notes before they became waterlogged. Confronted with the outburst of tears, he shifted uncomfortably. There were people at the station who had received years of training on how to help victims of forced feminization, but Marcus wasn't one of them. He preferred working with facts, not people, and especially not women - or at least the sort of hyper-emotional parodies of women that overdoses of synthetic hormones tended to create.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes he tried feebly to press on through the blubbering, but it was little use - the victim had begun to cry uncontrollably, questioning every thought that entered her head. Intrusive thoughts of female sexuality were beginning to overwhelm her, and it was apparent she was on the verge of a mental breakdown. Pushing back his chair, Marcus bid his leave. A maternal-looking counselor stepped into the interview room as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe in a few hours she would have calmed down enough to be of help again. For now, he had a few leads to go on. The celtic design was popular among the Irish mob in the city, or the small-scale dealers that associated with them, and would be a place to start. 6'1\" wasn't outside the realm of possibility for a natural woman, though it was likely (particularly judging by the aggressiveness and voracious sexual appetite the victim had described of his assailant/lover) that she had originally been a man, and had simply been using a short-lasting drug to give herself temporary, superficial feminine characteristics, without sacrificing her height and strength. For the assailant, the effects would have worn off by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming she, or he, hadn't taken another hit of efemerol. Or any of the other miriad chemicals on the black market capable of dramatically altering appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. Working for the TFPD was never easy when the suspects could change their appearance from day to day.</span></div></div>",

Definitely drugged. She was a pretty high up executive at this plastic manufacturer downtown. Sounds like someone spiked her coffee cause she said she was fine until a business meeting mid way through the day when the transformation hit her.\u201d Erik said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus looked up from his notes a bit. \u201cA plastic manufacturer? That\u2019s nothing special, why target someone like that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds weird too. They make things like plastic baggies and hard plastic containers for food. I mean it\u2019s not like they are some revolutionary company or anything.\u201d Erik said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus\u2019 eyes suddenly widened as he saw a connection somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was the name of the company?\u201d Marcus said standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik thought for a moment before looking back to his notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...O\u2019Brian Plastics. Family owned company for over 40 years. Founder was an Irish immigrant Jacob O\u2019Brian. Now his son Jacob Jr, runs it. Our victim was one of financial executives who had only been with the company for three years.\u201d Erik said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! Our early victim swears she remembers seeing a Celtic knot tattoo on the girl she met at the party. I\u2019m thinking there might be an Irish mob connection here.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik thought about it for a moment. \u201cWhy the hit on the plastic company? You think the owner is dealing dirty with the mob?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould be...However it could something else. You know uncut Efemoral is highly volatile right? If you wanted to transport a large enough supply of it you would need special plastic containers. What better place than local Irish company? Perhaps the mob reached out to them and they refused. This could be retaliation or blackmail.\u201d Marcus noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a chat with Jacob Jr is in order?\u201d Erik said with a smile seeing this was their best lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr we could...sneak in and do little bit of investigating? See if their plant has any secrets to tell?\u201d Marcus also suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded more dangerous but could lead to a bigger result....Thinking it over they decided to</span></div></div>",

Marcus checked and rechecked his equipment, making sure that every buckle of his stab-vest was tightened, while Eric sat nonchalantly, his stab vest lying on the seat next to, regarding his partner with mild amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anybody look so serious before one of these things. Have you ever raided a squat den before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've rounded up plenty of squatters before,\" Marcus replied seriously. \"Those people are desperate and vicious, and they've always got shivs hidden somewhere. I'm not taking any chances, and neither should you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not <i>squatters</i>, man. <i>Squats</i>. Did you miss the briefing or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShamefaced Marcus admitted that he had dozed through much of it, what with it being the last of six 14-hour-shifts. With somebody flooding the city with drugs, the TFPD had never been more in demand, which meant shifts had doubled and officers had to get their rest where they could find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik grinned widely from ear to ear. \"Boy, are you in for a tree. Not every day you get to do your first squat raid. Okay, guess I'll go over the briefing again, so... Squat is a drug. The junkies that use Squat, we call them Squats, easy to get confused with squatters, I know, but there's a big distinction. Or, rather, a <i>small</i> distinction. Other names for Squat are Bonsai, PygmyUp, MiniMe, and a bunch of others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van was pulling into a rough part of town now, shuddering through the potholes on the crumbling roads. The buildings eeither side of the street began to show decay, graffiti and shattered windows. Hunting grounds for the TFPD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, on it's own, Squat might not sound like much. What it does is it activates some gene somewhere, and it makes the user start shitting out their guts, basically. Morning, noon, and night, shit, shit, shit. It aint pretty. They don't eat much either. Anyway, all this shitting and not eating, they start to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...starve?\" Marcus ventured, who looked aghast at the tale of shitting, wondering to himself if there was a limit to the type of filth these junkies could shove into their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong! They don't get thinner, instead they shrink! The activated Squat gene means that, as the body runs out of nutrition, it gets smaller to compensate. Everything shrinks - fat, muscle, even bone and brains! They grow in reverse, getting tinier and tinier, but their proportions stay the same. Eventually they become little miniature people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was almost speechless, but it didn't help promotion prospects to look to surprised about new discoveries in the TFPD. Fellow officers started to look at you as if you're naive. \"How small do they get? And what's the point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's really no lower limit. Most lose maybe a foot or two of height. With chronic usage, you might get abusers that are a foot high, or less. Who knows? This is fairly new on the market, the boys in the lab haven't exactly had time to study it, but I wouldn't be surprised if they just keep shrinking until they're just too small to put the handcuffs on. Maybe eventually they just float away on the wind, or get eaten by rats,\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But<i> why</i>? Do they get some sort of high out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pun intended, right,\" Erik winked. \"Nah, no high, at least not directly. The thing you have to understand is that there's very few Squat addicts in the world. None of the Squats take it because they want to. It's a simple question of weight rations. Y'see, if you make a man half the size, his weight is actually 1/8th of his original weight, on account of him being halved in three different dimensions. Half as high, half was wide, half the gut. And a person that is one 8th the mass requires only one 8th the food to eat, one 8th the water to drink, and one 8th the cocaine to get high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I said there aren't many Squat addicts. They take it because, to a serious Squat, a spliff can look like a goddamn tree. A baggy of cocaine is like a holdall stuffed with it. Most of these are serious addicts to other substances, and they take Squat because it allows them to afford their habits. They live like kings. Tiny, off-their-face kings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus looked down at his normal-sized handcuffs. \"Wow, I was really <i>not</i> prepared for this mission. Next time I fall asleep in a brief, kick me. So what exactly <i>can</i> we expect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing too dangerous. It's not like these guys are going to be carrying around heavy weaponry - the worst you can expect is a cut from a dirty-blade and a trip to the doc for a tetanus shot. But there can be a lot of them. These Squat dens - typically they stick together for mutual safety, against other humans or even animals - so there can be upwards of a hundred squats living in a single house. It's kinda funny really when you see these places - most of them live in cardboard boxes, some even in doll houses, and they're like mansions to them. Most of the time they'll have at least one normal-sized person there to look after them, somebody who can actually go out, buy food and score them all drugs without worrying about getting trodden on. He should be the only one you need to worry about. The minute things kick off, the Squats are probably going to scatter, start throwing things, and its going to be manic. Just try to keep your wits about you. Keep your gun holstered, because you aint going to be able to hit these tiny fuckers anyway, and try not to run - if you tread on them, it's going to be a lot of paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus was starting to wonder if a vacuum cleaner might have been a more suitable weapon than his sidearm, if his partner's description was to be believed. \"Anything else I should know?\"</span></div></div>",

The region didn't have many coca trees, but it did have plenty of humans, and so criminal chemists had figured the ingenious plan of using CRISPR gene splicers to insert coca tree DNA into humans. The coca proteins would then be filtered from their blood, milk, urine or even faeces, and processed into something that almost resembled cocaine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quirk of the drug was that the gene splicers used to produce it remained active for a long time, constantly fragmenting the DNA of the poor hosts the cartels used to manufacture it, spitting out billions of little plasmids of random host DNA that were too costly to filter out of the final product. These plasmids would lodge in the cells of anybody taking cocasian, giving the user the appearance of the ethnicity of the host (or hosts) used to produce it - typically a mixture of South East Asian, though there were rumours of afrocaine on the market too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocasian was everywhere now, mixed in with and tricky to differentiate from the real cocaine.

He was there with his girlfriend Denise that day. He had actually planned to propose to her that very night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise had gone for a swim when the commotion started. Jack was laying down drinking a beer when he saw people starting to collapse. They were writhing on the ground as men started sprouting breasts and women started to turn more and more sexual by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking he looked around for Denise trying to find her but the sounds of moaning were filling the beach so loudly as everyone was starting to turn into beach blonde bimbos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Jack could find Denise it was too late. She had already turned and was desperate to tear his clothes off right there. Jack managed to push her off and carry her to safety off the beach as he called in backup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack however was not immune to the exposure himself. He soon found himself growing breasts as long blonde hair grew down his back....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-30 Days Later\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month as passed since the Bimbo Beach incident. The situation is mostly under control now however there are still many unanswered questions. When the barrels of Bimbosys were retrieved, and the ship carrying the found capsized in the ocean. Nobody knew where the barrels came from. They were not on the ship\u2019s manifest and crew had all been turned so they couldn\u2019t provide any answers. How such a large supply of illegal feminization drugs made it on board and what the intended purpose of it was now the TFPD\u2019s top priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-Back at Detective Murphy\u2019s\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline Murphy stepped out of the shower as she began drying off her long platinum blonde hair. Wiping the steam off the mirror she stared at her female body and let out a long sigh. She had been a woman now for 30 days and yet her reflection still felt like a strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline had a flawless bimbo body. She had two huge breasts that were perfectly rounded and perky, like a porn stars. She had a tight flat stomach with hourglass curves and a nice bubble butt. Long legs and cute feet with perfect arches to wear with heels. She had long platinum blonde hair down to her waist, perfectly tanned skin, and long nails that were painted a bright pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her exposure Jack was changed into a bimbo like so many others but fortunately for him he was lucky enough to avoid any serious mental changes. He still felt many bimbo urges every day. Heightened sexual desires and the need to always dress sexy. However she managed to keep those in check...mostly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise had not been so lucky. She was upstate now at a facility with so many others undergoing treatment to try and reverse what had happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacqueline got ready she slipped on a tight black mini skirt and white blouse that barely covered her massive tits. She was wearing a matching black thong and bra underneath along with black heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strapped on her pistol and grabbed her badge as she finished up her hair and makeup. Today was her first day back at work since the change. She wasn\u2019t sure what to expect but Jacqueline knew she had a job to do and wouldn\u2019t rest until she found out who was responsible for all of this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacqueline spent the day working through the tedium of reports and bland forensic papers.  It helped her to get prospective on the case.  Separating her personal feeling and trying to fully understand the scope of it.  Manifest records spoke of a chemical shipment from a bogus manufacturer to a fake laboratory.  Bimbosys not listed on the manifest.  It led no where.  It might help if the origin point wasn\u2019t San Marcos a small Caribbean island.  It didn\u2019t recognize TFPD authority or any outside their own.  Getting local help as likely as a snow tomorrow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSan Marcos a haven for illegal trafficking.  Money the only authority that they recognized.  The drugs might of originated there or any number of places.  A small bribe to use their import stamp and you could say anything.  Normally, customs looked over shipments carefully that arrived from there but it didn\u2019t arrive in the traditional way.  That told Jacqueline that this might have been a deliberate spill.  To accomplish what?  A test for a bigger target or to cause the uproar it did?  Jacqueline twirled her hair as she thought.  Another habit picked up with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching gears she turned to the lab tests which didn\u2019t help either.  The substance degraded quickly once free from the containers.  Rescuers tried to save victims and protect themselves not the transforming agent.  A clean sample remained unavailable.  Mostly theories and suppositions followed.  They inferred from those affected that twin agents were involved.  Physical and mental transformations were experienced by the transformees.  The physical one needed less saturation to achieve desired parameters.  Jacqueline agreed with that.  She didn\u2019t appear any different than those in direct prolonged exposure.  Her mental state remained primarily intact due to her low dosage.  The next portion frightened her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt talked about secondary contact by the transformed.  They found no antibodies in victims.  They remained as susceptible.  If not more so as they lay further along the scale toward a state of perpetual bimbodom.  This didn\u2019t deter her from continuing at the prospect of losing herself to a vapid existence.  She\u2019d continue into the lions den and beyond to bring these criminals to justice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline made a list of what she knew.  There weren\u2019t any dealers pedaling this on the street.  No, bimbosys was new.  The quantity large to be filling oil drums with it.  No backyard manufacturer could manage that.  Advanced development and probably time involved to create it.  It took effort to produce a creation so thorough.  Body and mind created to one purpose.  This triggered an idea in Jacqueline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the search database in her computer she typed in keywords for type of transformation bimbo.  That brought up the beach incident.  She looked back ten years and found a case with a Dr Arnold Hulstead.  His work altered a grad student of his into a simplistic bimbo.  Reading further his reasoning that he wished to rediscover the atavistic nature in all humans.  Connecting us to our primitive self.  The gender change had been unintended.  He thought that he could reverse it given time but got caught before allowed to continue.  The method said chemical which definitely left bimbosys in play.  The rest of the information pretty sparse.  Putting a pin in this for further review.  Jacqueline emailed Dr Yamato for his expertise.  He might be able to eliminate it offhand if it didn\u2019t amount to anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe report on the ship said that it sank due to weather conditions but that didn\u2019t satisfy Jacqueline\u2019s suspicious mind.  She knew that all it took to upset a ship was an autopilot device planted to initiate the sinking and deleting conflicting data for the ships computers then a quick self destruct.  No one the wiser.  Autopilot devices at the basic level controlled data coming in and going out of a vehicle.  Advanced models could seize control of the vehicle itself.  She ran across various types when she did accident investigation.  From the simplistic that told the car computer that you were always going to speed limit.  To the elaborate where in one case an incendiary attached to it helped in the elimination of DNA evidence that would prove the body wasn\u2019t the insured.  A husband and wife team tried to fake the wife\u2019s death for life insurance.  Jacqueline\u2019s pressure got the husband to crack.  Accident or not she needed to find the manufacturer of the drugs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting the streets to talk to contacts would have to wait for tomorrow.  Looking at the time she planned to drive out and visit Denise.  She\u2019d put it off long enough.  Driving upstate to visit and check out the facility.  There she might even get a better grasp on the chemical that effected her.  She\u2019d arrive after visiting hours but she found a badge got you in most anywhere at anytime.  Jacqueline thought there would be a smaller chance of people thinking her a patient and thus an object of pity after hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the drive her mind turned to her next steps.  She could check with Chief Haywood about sending someone into San Marcos undercover.  Checking to see if Dr Yamato responded to her inquiry.  Sometimes it was best to go to him directly.  He kept a busy schedule.  Hitting the pavement to hear what her informants knew.  She didn\u2019t feel confident but at least she had leads to follow.  The case wasn\u2019t dead in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the large facility she felt trepidation.  An old asylum repurposed and retrofitted with modern technologies but retaining that ominous appearance.  A leering guard buzzed her in without asking for any ID only peering down her cleavage.  Jacqueline\u2019s heels clicking approaching the entrance.  The number of cars in the parking lot surprised her for the late hour.  Buzzed in at the door greeted by passionate cries and moans of patients in the throes of passion.  This disturbed her but she remembered the state Denise was in when she last saw her, an attractive sexpot.  You could hardly sedate them all the time but how could you work in such an environment?      </span></div></div>",

She was still armed and well trained but her new bimbo body was still reacting to their gazes in ways that made her uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the check in area a man she was familiar with. Dr. Harvey was standing next to a nurse giving her some instructions as he looked up and saw Jacqueline heading towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective Murphy...So glad you came to see us again. How can I help you?\u201d He said twirling a pen in his hand as he held a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to see Denise. I want to see the progress she is making.\u201d Jacqueline said trying to maintain the stiffness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...Well...now is not a good time. As part of their therapy those heavily affected by the bimbosys have given a new task. A job that helps them deal with their urges in a controlled environment.\u201d Dr. Harvey explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the cars out front? How busy does a mental health facility need to be at 10pm?\u201d Jacqueline asked getting more suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...We treat out patients with the absolute best care. It\u2019s just this situation is...unique. It requires a different approach.\u201d Dr. Harvey said as small heads of sweat began to form on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline knew they were hiding something. As she began to push harder on the subject she suddenly heard something....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs...is that music?\u201d She said hearing a loud thumping noise down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective! Without a warrant I must insist you return during visitation hours!\u201d Dr. Harvey said running after Jacqueline who was now heading down a long hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music got louder and louder as Jacqueline pushed open a large door and froze at what she suddenly saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the gymnasium of the asylum. It had been changed and retrofitted into some kind of dance club...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a stage with bimbos on it stripping...Private booths and a bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Jacqueline said looking around horrified. The bimbo patients here had been turned into strippers and exotic dancers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand Detective! They begged us for this! We have tried everything with the patients but their desires couldn\u2019t be ignored. It was getting dangerous to isolate them.\u201d Dr Harvey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou expect me to believe they wanted to be like this? To be your little sex toys that you sell out like property?\u201d Jacqueline said with a hand on her gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want this life, but this is the best we can do for them now. They are starting to show progress this way. Many of them are starting to remember their old lives.\u201d Dr. Harvey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very idea of this made her sick. How could this be the best treatment for these people? On the other hand...If this was showing results who was she to stop it?</span></div></div>",

Do you know what you've just done?\" Dr Harvey screamed at the stunned security guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had a gun and I could see she was about to grab it!\" Karl said trying to defend himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she does, shes a detective with the police department, didn't you check her in as she came through?\" Dr Harvey questioned the security guard but knew the answer by the way Karl looked down at his feet. \"This is very bad, not only will she see this new treatment get shut down immediately but we will also be out of job!\" he screeched, \"my career is completely ruined\" he muttered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Doctor, its past visitor hours so just expected she was one of the transfers we were getting this evening\" Karl said to try and defend himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Dr Harvey suddenly realised that not all hope was lost. With Detective Murphy not being signed in and the security cameras disabled for the evenings experimental treatment nobody would know that Detective Murphy actually came to the facility this evening and with Karl reminding him of the transfers taking place this evening he could make this disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Jacqueline as she started to stir he looked back up at Karl. \"As you said, we doing transfers this evening and since you never actually had her sign in as a visitor we can make your mistake disappear\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl was eager to fix this since this was the first job he has had in 3 years and didn't want to loose it for one little mistake and just stood back and watched Dr Harvey go over to the drugs cupboard, draw a thick clear liquid from a vial and inject the detective. \"That should give us a few hours at least to prepare, take her to one of the empty rooms in the the locked ward and get her dressed like the rest ready for transfer, I'll get everything else sorted\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note Karl slung the unconscious Jacqueline over his shoulder and took her to get prepared as Dr Harvey opened the transfer records.</span></div></div>",

She felt something strange. A rocking motion as she slid around as she heard the splashes if what sounded like water outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she on a ship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up slowly Jacqueline saw her uniform and entire outfit was gone. She was wearing nothing but a loose fitting hospital gown now. Her ID, badge, and gun were all gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window her fears did in fact come to light. Jacqueline saw the waves of the ocean out the window and also a land mass that was approaching in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taser had blacked out the last memories Jacqueline had. She remembered being at the facility. She remembered talking to Dr. Harvey about something....then Black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on? Where am I?\u201d She asked herself seeing that she was alone in a small cabin like room. She tried to open it only to find it was locked tight. There was however a small window hatch open in the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps outside her room made Jacqueline rush to the door. She saw a sailor sweeping the decks and mopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline presses her fingers to her mouth and let out a loud whistle which got the sailors attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...Salior! Where are we? What I am doing here?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salior was a young man maybe around 19 so when seeing Jacqueline wearing only a small gown he blushed a bit seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am...The captain said In not supposed to talk to you. However don\u2019t you worry. We are off to bimbo island. It\u2019s a wonderful vacation resort that\u2019s been retrofitted for those of you affected by the Bimbosys incident. You are going to have all the fun in the world.\u201d He said smiling before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBimbo Island...This was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline had heard of the former vacation resort island that was now nicknamed \u201cBimbo Island.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Bimbosys incident many of the infected needed places to stay but there wasn\u2019t enough space in mental health facilities. A private resort company sold the rights to their vacation paradise island and now its being used to house dozens and dozens of bimbos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally this wouldn\u2019t brother Jacqueline until stories started to emerge that was resort was selling tickets to rich guys who wanted to visit an island inhabited by beautiful sexy women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr Harvey you Bastard...\u201d Jacqueline said realizing why she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have found out something bad and was knocked out and sent here as a way of keeping her silent. With her bimbo body it would hard for anyone to take her seriously.</span></div></div>",

I am an officer with TFPD.  If you like I will recite my identification number.  Dr Harvey is setting me up to get me out of the way.  If you help me it will be a feather in your cap.  You fail to do so it might mean a demotion.  You know the navy they will look for a scapegoat when it plays out.  For a moment do you think an officer will be blamed.\u201d  Jacqueline said hoping to play on the natural antipathy between sailor and officer.  She pressed further checking his name tag, \u201cListen, Thorne you tell the officer about this, you\u2019ll have it on record and they can\u2019t put it on you.  Say I am lying, really a total bimbo.  Seems unlikely with my ability to use non monosyllabic words.  But say I am, you only brought concerns to a higher up.  Not something they should frown on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThorne considered what she said.  He said, \u201cI am going to leave for a minute.  Don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I going to go?\u201d  Jacqueline said to the back of the nervous Thorne.  She lay back in her cell hoping for the best.  For interminable amount of time she waited till she heard activity outside her cell.  Hearing the lock release and the door slide open a welcome sight.  She sat up but didn\u2019t stand to ensure she made no hostile gesture.  Then she said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChief Haywood asked me to keep an eye on you.  Her concern over your ability to perform continue despite the boards clearing you.  I suspect she is concerned how you are doing under the strain but she didn\u2019t say such.\u201d  The young man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t.  I\u2019d question you calling her Chief Haywood over mother but I work with her.  I am glad you are here.\u201d  Jacqueline said to Ray Haywood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think you needed me.  You convinced that sailor to come talk to the officer on duty.  Nice work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will consider it nice work when I have my gun shoved up Dr Harvey\u2019s ass.\u201d  Jacqueline said her anger rising.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can stop on the way to the precinct unless you think we need backup.  You can borrow my shotgun if that works for you.\u201d  Ray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline smiled, \u201cYou know just what a lady likes.  Let\u2019s lockup some dirt bags.\u201d  Ray nodded in agreement.  A set of pants and top shirt donated from the crew she left the ship.  Throwing on a jacket from the car with the TFPD logo.  The top few buttons undone on the shirt providing valley views.  Ray drove the car as Jacqueline did a rundown of the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think Dr Harvey is involved with bimbosys?\u201d  Raymond asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline considered it fro minute shaking her head, \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like that, I gotta say no.  His back round doesn\u2019t indicate that.  He is mostly an administer.  Playing at treating the victims.  It has laboratory capabilities but not to the extent of a full research station.  It is a refurbished facility for patient management.  Before this he was an assistant director at a psychiatric facility.  His psychology degree doesn\u2019t give him the know how for drug development.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mastermind wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the chemist.\u201d  Ray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t strike me as a mastermind, more a bureaucrat.  None of his records show anything exceptional.\u201d  Jacqueline said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay took in the information and commented, \u201cYou know a lot about him and the facility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy girlfriend is there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d  Ray said simply at the revelation.  He didn\u2019t want to press her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I am not upset.\u201d  Jacqueline said.  Their conversation broke up with their arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey detained Doctor Harvey and Karl Novak the security guard who helped him without incident.  Resisting her urge to introduce her gun barrel to Dr Harvey\u2019s colon.  Jacqueline and Ray set themselves up for hours of homework.  They reviewed tapes and files till they went cross eyed.  Dedicated individuals eager to prove themselves.  Ray that he was worthy of his position and responsibility.  Jaqueline Murphy that she could still do the job.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapes confirmed their suspicions that Dr Harvey didn\u2019t have anything to do with the bimbosys.  He profited from it certainly but the plethora of easy to access information on his criminal activities.  No criminal genius ever used password as their password.  Jacqueline turned away seeing Denise giving herself freely to a man.  Federal agents arrived in the morning to take care of any further arrests and manage the facility till patients could be transferred in their entirety.  With a cup of coffee and a massage of her temples she decided to visit Denise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunching up the room on the viewport screen using a faux card.  Faux cards could copy security cards when placed atop them.  With Dr Harvey\u2019s card she now had complete access.  A perk of being TFPD, all the cool gadgets.  Seeing Denise\u2019s body distorted from the one Jacqueline loved.  A caricature lay in her place fitted body hugging lingerie.  Another swipe of her card and pressing unlock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise\u2019s mane of golden hair hung to the bed as she lifted her head.  \u201cIs it time for man fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, do you remember Jack Murphy?\u201d  Jacqueline asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise dredged her limited mental capacities.  Foggy images came to her of a man.  Special somehow.  A candlelit dinner across from him, a swim together, and a kiss under moonlight.  \u201cI liked kissing him.  Is he here?\u201d  She asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline didn\u2019t think Denise could understand the nuance to the answer.  She said, \u201cNo.  You can go back to sleep.  I just wanted to say hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she waved saying, \u201cHi.\u201d  Then back to the sleep of the truly unburdened.  Not even questioning the strange conversation. </span></div></div>",

Jacqueline was exhausted and just wanted to sleep in her own bed tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ray it wasn\u2019t the easiest task. Jacqueline wasn\u2019t wearing a bra and her nipples were clearly visible through her shirt along with a valley of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow...how do you do it Jackie? How do you stay a cop after what happened to you?\u201d Ray asked. Ray was still a rookie and had looked up to Jack before the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline looked back to him and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy...trust me. Every day is a battle with who you are on the inside versus what you look like on the outside.\u201d Jacqueline said as her breaths were starting to get a little heavier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ray said as he saw beads of sweat building on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...I just need to get home. My titties are getting super sensitive.\u201d Jacqueline said rubbing her breasts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was a bit put off by this. Jacqueline hated being in a bimbo body and never made any sexual references to herself before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...you sure you are okay?\u201d Ray asked again getting worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....I....Just....No.....not now!\u201d Jacqueline said as she suddenly let out a very girlish giggle that many of the infected bimbos would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective! What\u2019s happening to you?\u201d Ray called getting worked as Jacqueline began squirming in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pussy! It\u2019s so wet! I\u2019ve gone too long without it! She\u2019s coming and I can\u2019t hold her back!\u201d Jacqueline said tearing at her shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-3 Weeks Earlier-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d A newly bimbofied Jacqueline said as she sat in a hospital gown undergoing rehabilitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor who had been treating her since the Bimbosys incident had made remarkable progress with Jacqueline, however her level of exposure was more than originally thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Detective. Your Bimbosys exposure was higher than we expected. The Bimbosys in your system is slowly rising this treatment will help suppress it.\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline held up the large purple Dildo in her hand. It was a specially made vibrator just for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou call this treatment!\u201d Jacqueline said furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...Using that vibrator to bring yourself to orgasm will suppress the Bimbosys in your system temporarily, Preventing your condition from getting worse.\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any other options?\u201d Jacqueline said humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly the most natural one...Sex with men, sex with females would only make the Bimbosys increase..\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow often do I have to use this thing?\u201d Jacqueline asked embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA couple times a week to be safe. Three times a week should be enough but more wont hurt.\u201d The doctor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens if I don\u2019t?\u201d Jacqueline asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t the Bimbosys levels will continue to rise and rise until....\u201d The doctor said pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil what?\u201d Jacqueline asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil another transformation occurs....A new bimbo personality will take over your mind. Your body will become even more hyper sexual.\u201d The doctor said nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this happens...Will I be stuck that way forever like all the others?\u201d Jacqueline asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...most likely just until the new you successfully has sex with man.\u201d The doctor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-Present\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been almost a week since Jacqueline has used her toy and made herself cum. She had been so wrapped up in work lately she had forgotten and with this recent incident she was unable to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was speeding now to Jacqueline\u2019s apartment. Something was very wrong with her and she needed help. He tried to radio for an ambulance but she swatted his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey can\u2019t help...only you can...listen...I can\u2019t on any longer...you....You....have....to...to....FUCK ME!\u201d Jacqueline said as her body began to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as a bimbo Jacqueline did everything in her power to keep her appearance modest. She kept her nails trimmed and her hair normal. She had to dress a little sexy but she never went overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden it was like the modest switch was turned off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline\u2019s blonde hair began get brighter and brighter turning a bright shining silver that seemed to almost glow when the light touched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grew longer and longer going down back her butt and down past her ankles. It was easily the length of her body now as it touched the floor of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already impressive breasts began swelling even more. They grew several cup sizes larger while remaining perky and round. Massive tits were the only accurate way to describe them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin also changed from a normal white to a deep bronze like she just out of the tanning salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingernails grew longer and longer almost an inch long as they actually changed color too becoming a bright hot pink color. Her toenails changed to match the color as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips grew puffier and also turned a bright pink color. Her hips also widened a bit as her butt swelled a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jacqueline was already a sexy bimbo before than this thing she was now was a sexual force of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there sexy...is that for me?\u201d This new bimbo said as her hand reached over and began feeling Ray\u2019s growing erection through his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJacqueline are you okay?\u201d Ray asked pushing her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jackie\u2019s gone sweetie...she is sooo boring and serious all the time. I\u2019m much nicer and sweet. You can call me Candy.\u201d  Candy said with a seductive grin as she began unzipping Ray\u2019s pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could protest Candy had already pulled out his member and began giving Ray the best blow job he had ever had in his life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Ray could pull up to Jacqueline\u2019s apartment Candy was already tearing her clothes off and trying to get off Ray\u2019s.</span></div></div>",

The need to navigate so she didn't singe her bust with the base of the mug, or send that same bust into jiggly motion with a brush against the edge of the desk herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the simplest, most innocent of contacts could shatter her concentration for minutes at a time. Her skin was hyper-sensitive, and everything.... every-fucking-thing seemed made to turn her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suppressed a groan, as she spotted the new figure sashay into the precinct. Bust so full, and hips so wide, her physique was clearly a result of the beach contagion. She recognised her... knew her from before, but her contamination was too severe, no therapy could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver raced down Jacqueline's spine, as she saw a future she'd almost shared. There was confusion on Jill's face, a normal enough look for a bimbo, but also a vague familiarity. Jill turned up at the precinct every day, incapable of being a cop any longer, the routine was deep in her bones, and for the others... for the guys, she brightened up the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was never sad, always smiling giggling and interested in the guys. Even for the rest of the squad it was uncomfortable to lose a colleague in service, but -damn- those curves were hard to ignore... and being here meant she wasn't in danger and roaming the streets for any predators to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill's dress was made for the bimbo inclined. Simple to wear, and simple to remove. It was slinky, and sensual, designed to be pulled on, and cling to any curves however extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcd804b621f2066408b42dd457ea2d4a/tumblr_pjxe0q60lo1w2lwkto5_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcd804b621f2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, she still triggered some unsettling responses in Jack...

When her new body's instincts surfaced, she was just as needy, just as horny, and just as shameless as Jill, in her pursuit of what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a guy, her drive and intensity made her a good cop, as a woman she was still a good cop. Alas, when she was a horny woman, she usually got her man, too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The department mills about as you try to complete the paperwork that had been sitting on your desk for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustratingly, your speed is still slower than before your \u2018incident\u2019. It\u2019s probably just residual prickles of lust dulling your focus, you tell yourself, not wanting to consider, well, the alternatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, Jill is walking about again. You cast a pointed look at her as you go about your work. Of course, nothing is different; the same guileless smile to complete a vapid expression. One particularly lascivious coworker whispers something into her ear and she breaks into a giggle that reverberates throughout her entire body, her arse and bust shaking n turn with her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head in disgust. She probably didn\u2019t even know what it meant. Once again, you turn your focus to the forms. Daureen Millers: Committed to a  detox facility for overuse of cosmets, particularly Herptage\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeeeeyyyy, sisteerrrri~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA disgusted sneer almost makes its way onto your face as you look up at the familiar face. Of course, it\u2019s Jill, leaning down in a way that nearly makes her sumptuous bust pop out of her slinky dress. The sight would\u2019ve driven any red-blooded male \u2014 which definitely included you, two months ago! \u2014 but now only sent a short spark of phantom pain and a good helping of sympathy (and a bit of envy, though you\u2019d never admit it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was a genuine recognition of your similar conditions, or maybe it was just a shallow acknowledgement of your similar forms, but Jill had taken to acknowledging you as her \u2018sister\u2019. This would be all well and good, but this bond apparently meant constant propositions to \u2018lez out\u2019 to give the department a show, or constant invitations to \u2018like, share this totally mega-hot hunk I found!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou preferred to satisfy your\u2026 \u2018cravings\u2019 in private, not make a show, thank you very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou deliver the rehearsed speech. \u201cNo, Jill, I don\u2019t want to go clubbing right now, <i>no</i>, Jill, I don\u2019t want to \u2018double-team\u2019 the janitor, and <i>no</i>, Jill, I don\u2019t want to make a \u2018titty sandwich\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to your mild surprise, Jill doesn\u2019t break into her usual pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, you\u2019re such a ditz, Jackie! It\u2019s not even noon yet! I just came to give you this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fishes around in her cavernous cleavage with an expression of intense concentration for a few seconds, before producing a vial with an all-too-familiar color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart pounds in your chest, and your eyes widen in shock. It was Bimbosys, the drug that changed you, and had <i>destroyed</i> who Denise, Jill, and hundreds of others. The thing that ruined your fucking life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, you hide the container in a sheaf of paperwork and stuff it in your desk before anyone else can spot the shock of neon pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could ask you what was going on, you grab Jill\u2019s hand and drag her towards the women\u2019s restroom \u2014 A room only used by you and her; the former for its intended purpose, the latter primarily for hookups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even, like, have to pee!\u201d Jill whinges as you drag her along, earning a few amused glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the department barely bats an eye; Jill occasionally pesters you to join her for \u2018gal talk\u2019, so most assume that you\u2019re just throwing her a bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heels clack across the tiles as you herd her into a corner. You\u2019re still able to sweat perps, but playing hardball with Jill\u2019ll get you nothing but a sobbing bimbo and a department full of dirty looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you suppress most of the burning questions bouncing around in your head and stick with \u201cJill, where\u2019d you get that?\u201d in the calmest tone you can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe taps a finger to her overstuffed lip for a second, before lighting up surprisngly quickly.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, I was walking to work, yeah? And I was, like, saying hi to all the people, an\u2019 the cats an' the dogs, an\u2019 then I felt a hand grab my arm all like \u2018BOOM!\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises her hands for dramatic effect, once again sending her bust rippling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, like, I turn, and it\u2019s a guy, yeah? So I think to myself,  \u2018He totally wants a quickie!\u2019, so I grab his willie and mash my titties on him, then he \u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what happened after that?\u201d you interject. You don\u2019t want a twenty minute erotic interlude in your story, and truth be told, her stories do sometimes\u2026 <i>excite</i> you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jill waves an especially long fingernail at you in mock disapproval. \u201cNo, like, he didn\u2019t do anything! \u2018cept, I guess he pushed me off. Weird, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJill, when did you get the vial?\u201d you ask, teeh gritted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe vi-wuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... the pink stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization once again flashes on Jill\u2019s face. \u201cOh, like, the guy gave it to me right after that! He told me something too\u201d She  squares her legs as best as she can and leans over towards you, attempting a threatening pose, but only managing the menace of a kindergarten teacher. \u201c\u2018Make sure Jack gets it, and tell her to not trust the chief! Then I told him that\u2019d be mega-super easy, \u2018cuz we\u2019re totally sisters, but he was gone! Then I started walking here again, and the yellow-hat-guys\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t hear the second half of her sentence, the name stopping you dead in your tracks. Don\u2019t trust the chief? Chief Haywood? Dave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slump against a wall and slowly sink to the floor, hating the small pri. You sink to the ground, Jill\u2019s chattering slowly fading into static . Chief Haywood had something to do with this? He led the case where you caught fifteen tonnes of smuggled Cocasian! He covered your ass when you beat the perp who\u2019d tested his \u2018new formula\u2019 on innocent children. Chrissake, he was the one who helped you through <i>fucking therapy</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright, Jackie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar voice pulls you out of the haze of doubt and fear. You look up at Jill, her face twisted in an atypical frown of concern. You must really look bad if <i>she</i> can tell something\u2019s wrong with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force a smile and respond, \u201cNo, sorry, Jill. Just started getting cramps from my, er, period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe studies your face for a worrying amount of time before she snaps back into her usual glassy smile. \u201cAlright, gotcha!\u201d she chirps, before wiggling out of the room, leaving you with your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you awhile to collect yourself enough to walk out. When you do, you\u2019re met with looks of mild disgust and sympathy. Inwardly, you smirk to yourself. If there\u2019s one non-erotic thing Jill can be trusted with, it\u2019s to blab a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drift through the rest of the paperwork with even less enthusiasm than you usually do. There was a story around Bimbo Beach, and the chief might have something to do with it? It sounded like some crazy conspiracy, but it did seem like it had a grain of truth. You clench your dainty hands into fists, your fingernails digging leaving crescent-shaped trenches in your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, maybe it was too crazy to be true. Your eyes alight upon your bottom desk. You might be able to dust the vial for prints and catch the guy who\u2019s trying to turn you against Dave. You\u2019d have to keep it quiet though, on the off side he\u2019s telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar sound of giggling interrupts your plan. Your gaze falls on Jill and a couple of coworkers surrounding her. From what you can hear, they\u2019re having a competition to bounce quarters off her rear. Jim from accounting swears he got one to hit the ceiling, and Jill bets that he could get it to break through if he hits it hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lustful gazes and Jill\u2019s occasional shrieks of surprise and pleasure are the backdrop for a much darker train of thought in your head. \u2018You don\u2019t have to think about things like that,\u2019 it whispers. \u2018The key\u2019s in that drawer right there. One sip, and you can giggle and jiggle with her forever. No more jealousy, no more pain.\u2019 You pale at the intrusive thoughts. How on earth could you even think that \u2014 You might even get to see Denise again.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt disappears as quick as it came, leaving nothing but an unsettling pit in the center of your stomach.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Desperate to hear if their annoying neighbours' barking dog is commiting an offence. Or if that loud party could've been an offence. Or vague, wandering question about <i>a friend</i>, and what they've done, and if that's a crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking your watch, you can't wait to finish. You have a pile of real work to get done back at the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last of the snitches, whiners, and nervous leave. It's half-an-hour before you're meant to leave. But... You know... Fuck it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidying up your stuff, you head for the door with your case in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors crash open, and a barely dressed woman fills the doorway. Her eyes are wild, and panicked. Her clothes are street-legal, but not suitable for church. Not that you object. A first guess, would call it a dressing gown, soft and satiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/a7/f2/11a7f25dedee59364751f27f3215d958.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/a7/f2/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bury your instincts, and act like the trained officer you are.

Exuding confidence and calm you hope she picks up on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the basic details, you ask her name. Keeping the question smooth and steady. But her eyes widen, none-the-less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...\" she's struggling... \"I'm a man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze quickly takes in her body. Professionally, double-checking your initial assessment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your gaze is caught, snapping back to her bust. As she gives a heart-rending wail... Her bust surges forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bd/c5/97/bdc597450e6757517f6427c167d4e2e5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bd/c5/97/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Amanda... I'm Amanda....\" her voice quaking, as she corrects herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognise the symptoms. Her hands tremble in her lap, and you pat them, as if they were a trembling kitten. She's been dosed with nanites, and their collective intelligence works to stymie any progress. Some further changes are triggered by strong emotions, or particular hormones. Some by attempts to reveal their past identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to guess, this wasn't her chosen body. Her first answer, suggesting she wasn't always a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out a sheet of paper, and a pencil you try to get her to write the details. You steady her hands in your own, but she sobs once again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bimbo...\" she wails... \"I don't wanna be a bimbo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly you repeat your instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't...\" she wails, \"I can't read and write now...\" She snaps the pencil in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll stick to yes or no questions, and I only want you to nod, or shake your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sobs, sniffles, but nods her head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a man?\" you ask. You keep the question without sub-text. Many people switch sex these days, without prejudice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. Opening her mouth, to speak, She stops herself, a glance to her bust, cautioning her to silence. She doesn't want to get any bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the size she is already you doubt the nanites have much more energy to exert, to punish this former man. However, you don't want to traumatise him with false hope, as she gets another unwanted bust boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was unwanted?\" You ask. \"Not a mistake... a crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who did it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand rises from her laps, gesturing that you're almost right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ex-wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, and her head drops again. Her hand circles in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot liking where this is going, you ask none-the-less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, once more. A cautionary look to her bust, to see if it's grown. Her shoulders sag in relief, that they haven't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the hand stops circling, holding it in the air, she extends her three middle fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your girlfriend<b><i>s</i></b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emphasis needed for clarity, but she blushes, her cheeks colouring and warming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are... were a gigolo?\" You hate correcting yourself in front of her. And as you dreaded she flinched, as the <i>are </i>changed to <i>were</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry... I'm not a gigolo! I'm not a cheat!  I'm weak... I loved them all...\" her tone was begging for mercy, for understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love, Marcie, Jill, Billi, and Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raced through their names then she stopped. The reason obvious to both of you. As her bust surged, once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/3a/73/e23a73d1c693226fea801cd980f7e3ad.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/3a/73/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tell-tale ripple, this time. The nanites having reached the end of their programming. She wasn't going to be punished any further for talking. Somehow, you doubted that'd be much comfort for her. You refrain from telling her this isn't going to get any worse... As she'll hear it as <i>'this is your final form'</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitches...\" she snarls, snaps. Understandable given the heft of her bust, and the strain it must be putting on her shoulders.  But, you also suspect that she's not going to be using that language now she's fully a woman herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your name is Max Schrader, your 25 and fresh out of training. At the academy you performed well and got excellent marks in both physical and mental exams but deep down you were very nervous about going out on patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt probably had something to do with the area of the city you were assigned. Some guys on the force jokingly called it \u201cThe TF Slums.\u201d It was the roughest area of the city stricken with poverty and crime and where people either addicted to cheap TF drugs or were permanently transformed with or against their will and had no where else to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slums were divided into areas mostly by the kinds of transformations you saw there. There was Fantasy Court, mostly filled with people turned into all sorts of mythical style creatures. Animal Avenue, where all sorts of animal changes were located. Lastly Human Street, where you saw human to human changes, mostly things like gender, race, age, and body shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese slums were hated by the general public and the cops but currently the only safe haven for those affected the TF crises going on right now. The citizens there had no love of police either and it had become a hotbed of tension in recent years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Rookies were never sent in to this area but with your scores in the academy and the desperate need for more officers in the area, the chief assigned you to a senior officer as a partner so you could start learning the area and hopefully make some sort of difference here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your patrol car you saw your partner. He was a grizzled looking older man. With a long mustache and look on his face that showed he had seen way to much in his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Carl Griswold.\u201d He said shaking your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned the hand shake a bit nervous as you buckled up and went out on your first day as TFPD Officer. </span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t grow up in the city. I grew up in a small town a few hours away.\u201d You replied as Carl pulled off the freeway towards the slums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...small town boy huh? Explains a lot. Good look, good grades? Probably a hot shot back home right? Well Rookie a couple a things you gotta know to survive out here. None of the stuff you learned up till now means squat...TF slums have their own rules. Half the people here would shoot or stab you the first change they get, and the other half would do the same...except they would torture you first.\u201d Carl said letting out a loud burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad? I mean I know people here have their problems, but it\u2019s our job to keep them safe right?\u201d You said with your typical hopeful optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSafe? Who told you that? Our job is to keep them from killing themselves or worse going out and killing innocent folks in the city.\u201d Carl said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the slums drew closer you stared in awe as the huge wall became visible. The slums were walled off from the rest of the city. A huge concrete barrier surrounding the entire multiple city blocks the slums took up. It was a very controversial thing when it was added a few years ago but the city voted on it and it barely passed. Mostly proposed as an idea to separate the \u201cNormal\u201d people from all the TF addicts or victims from everywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s get some ground rules down first.\u201d Carl said turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst rule...Nobody leaves the slums without a transport permit. No permit...no leaving...plain and simple. There are only two ways in or out of the slums. The main gate here or the back gate down south. Border patrol is always there 24/7 armed with fully automatic weapons. Don\u2019t listen to anyone who tells you they need a ride or someway out of town...it\u2019s the easiest way newbies like you get scammed.\u201d Carl said finishing his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrote down this on your notepad as the two of you pulled up to the barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRule two...never believe anything these people tell you...everyone is a liar...don\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a giant lizard man or a 7 year old human girl...they are all liars. For all you know that giant lizard man is actually a 7 year old girl or that little innocent person is actually a 40 year old felon. TF drugs are so powerful now we have no idea who\u2019s really who out there until they get scanned.\u201d Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrote this down too, getting a little nervous at what you planned on seeing inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRule three...and this is the most important...never...never go anywhere private alone. Never go inside, someone\u2019s place, an alley or whatever. I don\u2019t care what you see. You always call it in and wait for backup. If you go in alone it\u2019s your ass we can\u2019t protect you...understand?\u201d Carl said again in an even stronger tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made sure to write this down too. Taking a deep breath as you nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Rookie...them be the basics...now comes the hard stuff...you ready?\u201d He said with a chuckle as the two of you passed through gate and into the slums. </span></div></div>",

Of all days...\u201d Griswold said getting out of car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sure exactly what to do so you got out as well and followed him as Griswold went up to the Sergeant in charge of one of barricades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Griswold yelled as the deafening sounds of the protests made it hard to hear anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother Protest about containment!

They say it\u2019s too hard to get a transport passport out of the slums, their living conditions are in humane, so forth and shit. I mean can you believe that?

It seemed like to you that these people regardless of their TF state deserved basic human rights. However as a cop you had an obligation to protect the general public. However didn\u2019t that also include these slums? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a dangerous and volatile situation that seemed to be at a boiling point. All it could take was one small thing to set it off....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few steps back back the organized chaos as you had no idea things were this bad right now. There had to be someway to regain the trust of the people again right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a deep sigh as you looked down as suddenly a large hairy palm suddenly emerged from the alley way behind you and dragged into the darkness before you could scream or grab your gun...</span></div></div>",

A large furry hand covered your mouth and grabbed you kicking and struggling into the shadows of an alleyway as you heard a door opening as you were tossed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral other people were there as you were quickly grabbed and tied up. A gag put over your mouth as they took your weapons away. You were now helpless and at the mercy of these strangers as you heard the door slam shut as the lights turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in an abandoned garage of some kind it appeared as several people...or transformed people looked down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf of them was a huge wolf man. Over 8 feet tall ripped with muscles and only wearing a tattered tank top and shorts. His dark brown fur smelled like an animal as his tail swished back and forth. He looked like a monster werewolf from a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him was kind of snake woman. Her lower half was a snake and just one long tail white her upper half was more human like but still covered in scales. You believe they called this a Naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her there was a goat man hybrid. A Satyr you think there were called. He had the legs of a goat and horns and a hair body, but the body and face of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a human, a beautiful woman wearing a skin tight leather corset and mini skirt and boots. Her body was that of a porn star as she tossed back her long black hair to reveal her face which was half covered with a black mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there Officer. I see Griff got you to accept out little invitation.\u201d The human said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got him! Now what?\u201d The werewolf Griff said in a deep and grizzly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about sssss...some torture? I could give him sssssome of my venom?\u201d The Naga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...we did this to send a message! Remember we are not like the rest of them!\u201d The Satyr said in a wise sounding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see Officer my friends and I have a problem. We were all transformed against our will. Various circumstances aside we found ourselves in these bodies permanently. However unlike the others who chose this lifestyle the government just tossed away in here like all the others. We can\u2019t leave, we can\u2019t see our families. To you we are monsters like everyone else. I myself was a 50 year account named Jeff two years ago.\u201d The human woman said standing up with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was grad student studying programming!\u201d The werewolf Griff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was a house wide and mother of three!\u201d The Naga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was an athlete, I was trying to be a pro basketball player!\u201d The old satyr said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is we are all real people...with real lives. You cops and those assholes in power think of us all monsters. It doesn\u2019t matter if we chose this life or not. Since there is no cure to permanent TF serums it\u2019s easier to just lock us in here like everyone else. Your Transport Passport system is a joke. It takes years to even get considered for one.\u201d The human woman said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down she slowly undid your mouth gag to let you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...I\u2019m sorry...None if what has happened to you is fair. However I\u2019m just a rookie. It\u2019s my first day.

That\u2019s why we chose you. We have a little surprise for you. A permanent TF kind of surprise. Once the cops see their new star rookie is transformed we will see their attitude and true nature. Will they let you stay or just toss you in here with the rest of us.

They were one of the first TF drugs on the market. Their whole idea was to let men become women for a time. Live our their wildest sexual fantasies then return to their life. Problem was...if you took even the slightest amount over the recommended dosage the changes became permanent...pretty soon men everywhere woke up to their new female bodies unable to go back. It didn\u2019t take long for the mobs to start using it as a trafficking drug to make themselves sex slaves. Next thing you know Feminol is illegal and all known deposits are destroyed. Nowadays you have Feminmax. A way safer a easier to handle TF drug. No permanent risks and everything.\u201d The human woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see where this was going as you struggled against your bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t so lucky you see. My wife and I wanted to spice things up one night. Do a little role play reversal. So I bought us some feminmax and Maculix to give us a spicy new night in the bedroom. Only problem is...my dealer gave me the wrong drug. He had some old school Feminol and got it mixed up. We did have a wild night my wife and I...problem is the next morning I woke up still looking like this...We tried everything. The Feminol changed everything down to my DNA there was no going back. She couldn\u2019t stand looking at me anymore and next thing I know she\u2019s reporting me to the TFPD and I\u2019m getting tossed in here like an animal...\u201d The woman said holding back her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachel please...\u201d The Satyr named George said patting her on the back gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...I know your are angry but this won\u2019t solve anything! Changing me won\u2019t make me a martyr! It will only show the TFPD that you are beyond reason!\u201d You said trying to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...that\u2019s where you are wrong...I\u2019ve got a nice hyper dose of Feminol here. Enough to make you an incredible sexy woman forever...Use this to get those pigs at the top to listen to you. Maybe you can help us bridge the gap.\u201d Rachel said preparing the drug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was it!

Bx 15 a genetic mix of bull and man produced a creature similar to the mythical minotaur. Now they might be investigating him. He needed the money though to get a better genetic synthesizer. He knew dwelling on the mistakes of the past would not help him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight be time to contact officer Charles Olson and see what else he knows. Olson let him know they held BX 15 in their cells. Wetting Gregor's desire to know more but knowing Olson would only get more information for a price. A quick scan by a dna lock opened the door to his private work shop. He made his way past the various experiments fermenting in varied states of completion to his private office. He slid a wooden panel on the wall open and keyed in a code to a wall safe. With the safe open he grabbed a handful of money to use to ply openness from Olson. He put the money in his pocket. An inconvenient phone call later he set a meeting with Olson. Retrieving BX 15 would be ideal but he didn't imagine the tfpd officers letting him walk it out. Olson might be able to alert when they decided to transport and he could hit them. He did not need this. His work would advance humanity beyond its fragile form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor nodded to Olson acknowledging him. He turned on an electronic scrambler. The device prevented any recording or video from being used. The park that they met at offered multiple escape options. Olson looked around for any observers before going into a men\u2019s room with an out of order sign he put on it. Gregor nervously looked about before rushing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlson waited for the twitchy Gregor to enter. His smile displaying his eagerness for the pay off. He asked, \u201cWhat do you want know? I am an open book after a mutual understanding is arrived at.\u201d The scientist tossed a pile of money on a sink disinterested in haggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor sneered saying, \u201cI need to know all that is known about the BX 15. Am I suspected? And all details about the transportation of it like when and where. Is there any way that you could sneak it out of the station. I can provide you with a genetic deconstructor if you can get close enough to it. It is a liability I need to either reclaim or properly disposed of.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlson thought about the profit and risk. Alerting Gregor of the transportation information on his pet wouldn\u2019t be difficult. On the other hand eliminating the creature himself would be lucrative but risky to carry out in the station.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is two weeks before Christmas. All through the town a heavy snow is falling through the 2am darkness, filling the streets of the city with deep drifts and summoning the plows and salt spreading trucks out into the night. With a spray of grit bouncing off your windshield, you hitch a lift in the wake of one of them, the three bald tyres of your dad's Reliant Regal Van slipping back and forth across both lanes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather is a nuisance. On the positive, the streets are clear, the drunkards have had the good sense to stagger home hours ago and even the homeless have found somewhere else to sleep for the night. Good. No witnesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a left into the town square. With a hard thud the front tyre hits a buried curb, bouncing the car on to the plaza that sits in front of the city hall. Concrete bollards guard the perimeter. You hit the brakes and skid to a halt a few meters from the ten-feet tall glass doors of the front entrance, rocking gently on the front axle. The engine is purposefully left running. There's no guarantee that it will start again, particularly in cold like this, and you like your getaway vehicle to be able to actually <i>get away</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city hall looks grand in the snow and the spotlights, festooned in red and gold decorations and twinkling with fairy lights. The entrance hall is particularly fine. It had been decorated by the children of the local primary school earlier that day. Crayoned pictures of Santa Claus and reindeer hang beside the old oil paintings of dead mayors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 8-foot tall Christmas tree stands in the center of the hall. Its thick foliage sags under the weight of gingerbread and candy canes and multicolored shiny baubles upon its branches, and it has been practically lashed to the wall with tinsel. Under its bows sit four red velvet sacks bulging with gaudily wrapped presents, toys donated by charitable souls to be distributed on Christmas eve to the needy orphans of the city. So they think anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flash the headlights once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the entrance hall, nothing moves. <i>Please tell me the old man hasn't fallen asleep during a heist again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously you wait, one ear pricked out as always for the wail of sirens. After a few minutes, a security guards sidles into view and you shrink down behind the dashboard. He strolls across the entrance hall with a slow, bow-legged plod, mouth pursed in a whistle, twirling a torch by its strap around his fingers. He steps up to the tree, admires its festive grandeur and leans forward to smell the rich pine scent on its needles. His brow furrow as he notices the surprisingly large number of Alpine Fresh Car Fresheners hidden among the baubles, just barely concealing an underlying air of stale cigarette smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, you give one blast on the car horn. The security guards stands sharply to attention, spinning around to inspect the vehicular intruder upon the plaza outside. The tree shifts, a wooden branch very much like an arm raising itself out of the foliage behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy-lights out, buddy,\" a gravely voice whispers in his ear as the branch thuds down on his head. The guard crumples to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fling open the car door and jump out. The freezing night air cuts right through your thin clothes as you race to the door. The Christmas tree rocks back and forth in its tub. Its thick trunk split vertically as it lifts a pair of leg-shaped roots from the soil into which it has been planted. Mud pours off its gnarled feet. It takes a few awkward steps, tearing itself free from the tinsel and lights that bind it. With baubles falling from it and shattering against the floor, it stoops to pilfer a bunch of keys from the guard's belt before grabbing a sack in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope they have CCTV</i>, you laugh as the tree lumbers to the door. <i>We're going to be in all the newspapers. This is going to be the heist of the century. We'll be famous. Well... infamous.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree crows through the door. \"You should have heard me, son! I said 'fairy-lights out' and then I hit him over the head! Like 'lights out' but with a Christmas spin to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's not the time for dumb jokes, dad, get the door open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree fumbles with the keys. \"Alright, alright, one moment, here we are.\" Next moment it is flinging the doors open and racing towards the van, throwing the haul into the back and itself into the passenger seat. You lug the third sack back to the van and dive into the passenger seat, skidding away from the crime scene in a flurry of snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's cramped in the cabin, squashed as you are between a Santa's sack of stolen goods and an 8-foot tall tree guffawing to itself. \"The perfect crime, boy, <i>the</i> perfect crime! Now those stupid kids will get exactly what I always got for Christmas - nothing!\" The tree pats itself down before withdrawing from some unknown crevice a crumples packet of cigarettes. It maneuvers one of them into a gap in its needles that must be its mouth. \"That machine is everything I dreamed it could be.

Get that heating on before my toes freeze off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes are focused on the road ahead but you look over as he lights up. \"I don't think you should be smoking in that costume, dad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh? Cause I'm a tree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, cause its made out of rubber or something. It's probably flammable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignores you to take a deep drag on the cigarette, glowing embers tumbling down the suit. After enough self-satisfied puffs to fill the cabin with smoke, it said, \"Yep, things are going to really turn around for us now, Nick. You and I, we're gonna be rich. With this baby, we'll be able to go anywhere, steal anything, and there's <i>nothing </i>the police can do to stop us. I mean what are they gonna do, check every tree in the city? I don't think so!\" He takes one of the presents and tears through the wrapping paper. It is a knitted dolly. With a tree-shrug, he tosses it, ripping through more until he finds one filled with candy, which he shoves into his cigarette-hole. \"Haven't eaten in two days,\" he grumbles around mouthfuls. \"It's your turn in the suit next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car has reached the docks. The car thuds over broken concrete, skirts crumbling factories. You pull into the empty shell of an auto-motor garage that has served as your hideout for the past month and switch the engine off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sirens. Not even the distant jingle of bells. Just the soft silence of falling snow over the dockyard. The van's tracks lead back into the darkness. \"We should cover them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" your father replies. \"Get me out of this suit first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine is exactly where you left it, thank god. It resembles a large corrugated aluminium suitcase with the words 'This side up', 'Deliver to the Institute of Technology'  and 'Prototype Macro-Scale Additive Printer' stenciled on it. The two of you had found it while raiding shipping containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you flick a catch, the suitcase lid springs open and it smoothly unfolds itself into a platform large enough for a man to stand on, surrounded with four articulated arms. Beneath the platform are four canisters of viscous cyan, magenta, yellow and black goop. A touch screen slides out and lights up, waiting for a command.</span></div></div>",

Every year, a Christmas tree was erected at the town hall to showcase the generosity of the citizenry - well protected by security of course, but nobody would ever suspect the tree itself of the crime! After dressing your dad for the part, you'd snuck into the Christmas tree store.

The interior is ribbed with rings, no doubt for the pleasure of anybody using the doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube is sculpted and left for a moment to set, before a pair of robotic hands take it and maneuver it into position near his ass. At the same time, other mechanical hands grip his legs, widening his stance. With a single smooth motion and a loud shriek, the ribbed sleeve is slid up inside his ass. The inch of so of protruding material is flattered back against the ass cheeks, which are then coated in a generous spray of rubber flesh, padding them out layer upon layer as the machine sculpts his backside into a juicy sexdoll ass to match his new, ribbed interior,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face has gone beetroot red, which stands out from the skin of his neck and upper body, which has already been given a coating of rubber and is now a glossy, tanned tone. \"What the hell was that!

When it's done, you're going to be indistinguishable from any of the hundreds of other fuckdolls that store sells over Christmas!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-molted rubber of his tits still steams in the cold winter air, but the plastic has cooled enough that the machine detaches from them, allowing them to hang freely. Perfect orbs, they bounce elastcally with every slight movement off his body. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://realistic-sex-dolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/theresa-14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://realistic-sex-dolls.com/wp-conten...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine has begun to prepare a mask.

On the interior of the mouth of the mask is another of those ribbed sleeves used for satisfying any cock pushed between them. The machine grabs the end of this sleeve and manauvers it towards his mouth. It waits until he opens his mouth to protest before slamming it home, causing him to gag and choke as the sleeve is forced down his throat. The molten mask seals into place over his furious features, quickly attaching with an unbreakable bond as it dries and cools.</span></div></div>",

It is sealed inside its second skin - only the machine or a very competent surgeon could remove it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips move but no sound emits.

The dolls were delivered with all sorts of fun extras - remote-controlled dildos and vibrators wedged into each orifice. If you're returning it, it wouldn't do to return it incomplete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't exactly small though. The doll gives a twitch as you brandish the two 7-inch purple, soft-rubber dildos. You slide them home gently but firmly, taking your time working every inch of it down the ribbed anus. The doll spasms and vibrates as you do so - accurately infact, as fortunately the sex dolls were designed to respond to stimulus by vibrating and pulsating the cocks of their owners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ring gag is slotted between the lips, keeping the mouth open and ready for cock. Finally you wrap dad up in bubblewrap before slotting him into the soft padding of the packaging. Finally you slide his restained form back into the box. He stares out through the cellophane front of the package, looking like a barbie doll a young girl might buy, only much bigger and with his tits on display and pussy spread, and the packaging covered in all sorts of lurid invitations to 'try me!', 'spank me!' and 'play with me!'.</span></div></div>",

His patient already unconscious on the operating table, the injuries severe and life threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Cochrane looked at the sealed tube of nanites, as his escape. Inside that phial, invisible to the naked eye were billions of microscopic machines, with a program to follow. His eyes scanned the contents of his reinforced case. His life's work safely stored in padded slots, carefully labelled to avoid mistakes. A mistake could be costly, and/or humiliating. Not all were programmed to save lives, and repair injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome were crafted for snitches, an animal form complex enough to house a human brain without damaging it's mind, but incapable of speech, and further betrayal. Personally, he'd inflicted that fate on half a dozen former men. Their battered, and abused bodies replaced with healthy animal forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome sentenced to live as docile cows, milked daily, and kept quiet by a heavy hormonal cosh. Others humiliated as mares... broodmares, breeding the next generation of race horses. The sound of approaching feet, charging down the halls, was met with gunfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscape would be impossible, every exit watched, you know capture is inevitable. The chaos and noise, panics one of your nurses. The term rather loosely defined. Their role purely cosmetic to please the recovering patients. Each one pneumatic, and with bare bimbo instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible option occurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers tremble as you pull the 'nurse' phial from your case. You don't want to break it just yet. Life as a bimbo working some over-inflated lips, and carrying some luscious titties, and a perfect round, full ass doesn't appeal. Certainly not the bimbo part. You can fake the mental effects, and that body will distract the most dedicated officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping it into the EM pulse programmer, you rewrite that part of their code. Closing the case, you slap the locks closed, and type in the wrong code. Destroying the evidence, your work is hard, but necessary. It doesn't make your fingers stop shaking around the phial, as you think about what you're contemplating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pale grey wisp escapes the case, as the contents are vaporised. The sound of gunfire lessened, fewer people alive to fire, and the noise of the police closer... louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whimper, you clench your fist. It breaks in your palm, the glass fragments cutting you, and the nanites entering your bloodstream directly. Shaking the fragments of glass to the floor, you watch, as your hand heals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nanites already working their magic. Your hand looks perfect, turning it back and forth, you see the effect as your hand slims. Your fingers slender, the nails gaining a glossy coat of crimson. A permanent feature, designed to match the glossy over-inflated lips. You spent a long time perfecting her mouth. Those lips slightly apart always inviting a cock to slip between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders crack, as you run your hand over that sleeve. The difference between your arms already clear. Your pulse quickens, as your torso changes. You feel the weight building before you see it. You chest narrowing, giving you a slender, more feminine body shape. Your clothes hang baggily from your shoulder. But, it's not long before your bust demands your attention. The girls firm, and sensitive topped with some impressive nipples. A whimper escapes your lips as the changes rise to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the nanites work their way lower. Your spine cracking and popping, as your bones re-align. Your waist collapsing inward, as your hips burst wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWetting your lips, your tongue darting between them finds the waxy lipstick coating, and the enhanced sensitivity make you tingle. Belatedly, your hands drop to your crotch. But, it's already to late to give lil' Jack Cochrane a good-bye pat, Lil' Miss Cochrane is already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing off your clothes, you abandon your past, and dart into the recovery room. Picking up an abandoned uniform, you join the other girls in cowering on the floor. Your terror is more real than you'd like, the act quite convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls scream and squeak, begging for mercy, and you imitate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screams rise in pitch, as the police burst in. Both doors crashing open, as they storm the last room of your former hospital. A worrying sense of arousal fills your veins, the nearness of your capture means your blood pounds in your ears. These bodies were crafted to be easily excited. A feature you didn't get a chance to remove from the code. Looking the other nurses over, you try to judge whether it's them, of the police officers you find attractive.</span></div></div>",

A sly injection would ensure an addiction before the night is out, and a life living from one fix to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last option is your lawyer. More a person than a place, he's to surrender the nanites to anyone giving him the appropriate password, for identification. Groaning, you know you use him for work with the last client too.

Shuddering at how similar you look at the moment, you try and concentrate on your restoration, and re-ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis body is rather distracting with it's needs and urges. Certainly, it's not fit for carrying your intellect. Retreating into a dark doorway, you allow another woman to walk passed.

Lyle's Lamborghini well beyond the range of even the richest man kerb crawling for street walkers. A flash of a passing headlight reveals you to a man walking on the opposite sidewalk. The brief light enough to illuminate you, and your abbreviated nurse's uniform. Certainly, he's drawn to the woman cowering in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately wanting him to move on, you watch from the dark as he stands there, staring straight at you without seeing you. Whether he's waiting to cross towards you, or waiting on a second car passing and lighting you up, you don't like either option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking left and right, you press yourself against the door, as he starts to cross the street. He's coming to investigate in person. At the moment you hardly make an intimidating sight. Dressed like a whore and skulking in the dark, flinching at the street noise. He crosses slowly  watching both directions and towards the doorway still hoping for another sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the sound of a highly-tuned sports car revs into sight. Rounding the same corner, Lyle arrives like a knight to your rescue. His glossy scarlet car revealing your position. At his appearance, everything changes. Stepping forward, you raise a hand to identify yourself and step out from the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curious pedestrian sees the dynamic between you and the new arrival. Takes in the answering flash of headlights to your wave, and crosses back to his own side. Now, he's the cowed one. Daunted by the expensive, impressive car, and knowing his power, his opportunity has passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window silently lowers as Lyle pulls up at your position. Quite aware of how this looks, you approach the car and check the occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is Lyle Hunter, your lawyer. His returning gaze takes a moment to find your face, rising from your well-displayed cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ahem!</i>... Jabberwocky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Cochrane...\" He answers. His voice containing all the skepticism you can handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Jack Cochrane, Ph.D.\" You say with as mush authority as you can summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart in your throat, you wait for him to stop staring.

Your hand outstretched, eager like a junkie, you try not to snatch at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the car door with your free hand you find how hard it is to get into a low sports car with a hip-hugging outfit restricting your movement. Sliding into the passenger seat, you feel a width to your hips you don't like and a weight to your ass that reminds you of it's current dimensions. The shake of your bust is the final reminder of your body for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming the door behind you, you feel him rev the engine. It's vibrating trembling through your body. Your thoughts scatter, as your instincts leap to disturb them. The moan spilling from your lips is degrading and honest as you feel your lust spike at the tremors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping the neck of the vial, you look at your recovery. Such a small thing to cause such a significant change. You stab your palm with the store of nanites. Your skin prickles as they enter your blood stream, and begin their work.</span></div></div>",

His job, his life depending on no messing up. You know Lyle has been here multiple times, probably more often than yourself. But he still is cautious, his eyes taking his passenger in too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes roam over you, lingering for a moment on your body. \"Mr Hunter, ma'am.\" You flinch, at the address. Already nameless, and dismissed as a plus one, as an ornamental female. It's exactly what you wanted from your nurses, and how you escaped, but it's a price that's starting to grate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more heavies flank the front door. Their bodies physically bigger and more capable, each enhanced to over 6' tall, and laden with heavier weapons. There's a twitchiness that suggests they're ready, and on a knife edge of adrenalin. These are no lumbering ornamental guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth look you and Lyle over, as you head inside. A hint of a smile from the one with the Maori face tattoo, suggests he knows who you are... or rather <i>were</i>, as he leer down your cleavage as you pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the main entrance hall of the mansion, you see Mick Mulvaney. Your boss, and the scariest fucker you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks you over, as you walk in. Doubt on his face, but not uncertainty. You know you've seriously fucked up, from his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Jack Cochrane.\" His announcement too certain to be a question, but still demanding an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a shaky nod of your head, before confirming in words. \"Yes... Yes, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the same arrogant git, anymore, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't wait for a response, it's already written on your face, and in your bearing. He bursts out laughing, tears rolling down his cheeks, as he takes in your petite, busty new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there and take it, fighting back your own tears... They aren't tears of joyous laughter. You aren't insane enough to object, but eventually his laughter stops, and he wipes the tears aside with the back of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're stuck like that, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you give a nod, this time with fewer trembles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The surgeon may be gone, but I can serve as Doctor Cox, as 'The Doc'...\" you want to promise your worth, so he does just see you as the eye-candy you crafted to be dismissed and overlooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight hand gesture is hint enough for you to fall silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour silence pleases him, \"I like a woman who knows her place, and when to be quiet. You'll serve as Layla Cox, until you mess up, and then we'll have Layla Huntress to keep you busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tilt of the head, suggests he wants a reply, or simple recognition of his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..Yes...\" you want to bow, or should you curtsey now... In either case, you quake and look terrified, that'll do for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll work with 'The Doc' for the moment, but if you displease me, 'The Huntress' will serve instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snaps his fingers, and a tall woman struts proudly into sight.

Looking to Mick, his face is neutral, not giving any clues to guide you. You slip the nurse's uniform off, and stand there in your underwear. You don't know the woman, but you know her type.

'MM', hangs from the chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A reminder who owns you, and who you serve.\" Mick tells you bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your hands cautiously play with it, the domme adds, \"If you lose that, you won't like it's replacement. More a collar than a necklace, and far sturdier, and it will keep you in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've visited 'the girls' often enough while working, and as a treat to know exactly what she's describing. Though it doesn't exist yet, you still imagine it's harsh touch around your neck.

Unnoticed by you, a maid appear with a pile of clothes for you to wear. She doesn't notice the whole situation. Paying no attention to the naked woman she's offering the clothes to, nor to the domme looming over her, or either of the men.</span></div></div>",

You catch Jeff across the back of her hand, raking the shattered neck of a vial over her vulernable skin.

Your hopes of getting off on the right foot  now seeming doomed. The folly of your actions, though inevitable. Jeff's fate was sealed by Mick's command, but now you'll be seen as traitorous amongst your newest... social group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise as you head to the car, that nobody's mentioned your work at the club. Your purpose in going as 'The Beautician', you hope they don't take their revenge sending you onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breath catches, and you stumble as you get in the car. Realising that perhaps you're not heading to the Strip Club, maybe you're heading to brothel, you certainly have a body that pleases men. Your judgement on that score can't be mistaken, you just wish you were still capable of enjoying that aspect once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last backwards glance to your friend Lyle Hunter, is cheapening. His eyes are on your ass, as you leave. Only rising to your face, as he sees your waist flex. His gaze is unapologetic, with a smile, and a shrug.

Please, I\u2019ll pay I just need some more time.\u201d  Monty \u201cswift fingers\u201d Goretti pleaded while strapped down on an exam table.  Staring at the needle piercing his arm he began to panic following the tubing leading from it.  The liquid slowly coming down the line had unknown properties to him but he knew it didn\u2019t bode well for him.  His suspicions confirmed with the burning sensation that started with the liquid reaching his veins.  His cries of pain drew no pity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pay what you owe.  That was the basic philosophy Joseph Wallis lived by.  You take a loan you pay it back.  Monty failed in that duty.  Everyone paid Wallis one way or another.  He used to sell the bodies of his delinquent payers now he found a more lucrative use for them.  As the changes in Monty began a smile formed on Wallis\u2019s face as he watched on a monitor.  It didn\u2019t always take but there were a bevy of those who would pay to take a body off his hands.  His friend from childhood Harry Thompson stood at his side.  A brilliant doctor and scientist who ran afoul of the TFPD.  With a call to Noel Mccauley the best attorney he knew.  Another to Charles Olson through intermediaries he got the scoop on the case and got some holes put in it.  With some evidence turning up missing.  Charges got dropped down to a loss of medical license with a plea deal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Harry worked ostensibly as a consultant for one of his businesses but really he continued his work.  Any findings Harry would have that could be sold legally one his other employees \u201cdiscover\u201d in by legal means.  Making Joesph much wealthier.  Harry didn\u2019t care about credit only the ability to continue his work.  That suited Wallis just fine.  He supplied the equipment and chemicals necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry worried about upsetting Joey with disappointing results.  He was grateful for the help with his legal trouble.  Then the further obligation of giving him a job and allowing him to work again.  He timidly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how well the programming will would work.  There is a twenty percent chance it might fry his mind.  I have improved the transmutagen survivability by at least four percent.\u201d  He looked up at Joey hoping he wouldn\u2019t be disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph nodded without turning his, \u201cThat is fine.  I still want to go forward with the programming.  Twenty percent is better odds than I get in Vegas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed in relief as he pressed a few buttons on his remote to lower the programming helmet onto the subject.  He already saw the subjects figure diminishing.  With mass building behind the pectorals producing the desired mammaries.  The transmutagen could produce many effects not the least of which was gender transmorphing.  With the introduction of the proper stimulus a myriad of fascinating results.  Blends of humans and whatever the stimuli.  On occasion a complete shift could be achieved.  Once a human turned into a dog.  The human intelligence remained for a few days before instincts seemed to take over.  A few times since under questioning the dog was able to comprehend and answer intelligently.  Unfortunately, the attempt to turn the subject had ended up putting to much stress on the subjects system and it passed away.  The autopsy results came up as a stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time he hoped to come up with more consistent results.  The sweat poured down the subject as the final shifts continued.  The crunching and grinding of bones as the subject\u2019s hips widened while his genitals reshaped into her body.  The head jerked about as the programming continued.  Injecting commands into the core of the subjects mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph turned away walking to his office saying, \u201cLet me know the results later.  I am going to send over some items to your lab.\u201d  Charles Olson of the TFPD had snuck a couple items from a crime scene before they were marked for evidence.  He wanted to know if the bargain he got for them would be a score.  Harry might be able to make sense of them.  Russsell \u2018the fox\u2019 Leeds acted as his go between with Olson.  Joseph Wallis liked to keep a step between him and the actual criminal activity.        </span></div></div>",

Settling the rifle butt, against his shoulder, he thought of himself more as an equaliser, someone making the world a better place one person at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crosshairs lining up on his target, a people trafficker was rising from the bed. Scratching at his crotch, he was head of the main route in from the poorer Asian nations. The flight from the rising sea levels causing a degree of desperation, and providing him with a constant supply of new women without options to bed. Luke didn't know he'd bedded his last victim, giving her ass a pat, as she fled the bedroom, her face crimson with shame, and her eyes watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have time to cry out, as the glass shattered. The impact, causing him to reach for the sting on his ass. A tiny trace of blood on his finger the only hint he'd been shot. Dismissing it as an insect bite, he was surprised, as the bed rose up to meet his collapsing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nanites rendering him limp as a gutted fish. He was capable only of breathing and looking desperately at the ceiling. The overhead fan continued spinning, indifferent to his fate. The vague thought that he thought a heart attack would have hurt more drifting through his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nanites spread and multiplied, Dave watched with amusement, as his body spasmed on the bed. His bones re-aligning, his shoulders narrowing. Luke realised as the changes progressed what was happening, the sensation of his muscles withering away. But, it was the flabby weight building on his chest that told him clearly of his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to even gurgle in protest, Luke transitioned fully into a woman. The nanites re-wrote him to match the female DNA, they found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15c7286bb5ff14e86df59d7513787fa7/tumblr_piet5gGHTw1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/15c7286bb5ff...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin two minutes, he was identical to the woman he'd just bedded. At the very periphery of his vision, her new tits were visible, topped by those horrifyingly large nipples. The chill breeze of the air keeping her too aware of that new sensitivity, in this world, in this new role, that new vulnerability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Dave's darts had more than a duplication effect. As her breathing eased, Luke felt some freedom return to her throat. She called for help... or would have if she'd been able to speak. Her vocal cords excluded from the DNA replication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands couldn't even reach from her side. Smiling wider, as he watched through the scope, Dave enjoyed the sight as the next stage started. As Luke's breathing sped up, she felt her chest expand. Her tits, already too big, were swelling larger, getting heavier, more prominent, as she lay powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cede884bb8b2ed2225edef546a7389a6/tumblr_piet5gGHTw1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/cede884bb8b2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was up to their emotions, and how hard they fought, how extreme their bodies would become. Disassembling his rifle, Dave switched to watching through binoculars. Turns out Luke was quite the fighter, as her bust spilled across her chest, pinning her arms to the bed, by sheer weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear trickled from Luke's eye, as he felt the changes continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1efa10a459edd5907943158c7f71f82e/tumblr_piet5gGHTw1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/1efa10a459ed...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreading, and expecting the worst, she wasn't disappointed. Unobserved, even by Dave, her limp body was found by one of her henchmen. Lifted carelessly from the bed, thrown over his shoulder, Luke was dumped (back) with the other girls. The comforting words meaningless babble to her ears, as the slow recovery back to mobility returned to her.</span></div></div>",

The view through the scope showed everyone there, as he took in the lab from one end to the other. The lab technicians, were complicit, and the guards obviously deserved what was coming. But, it was harder to justify the others working there. The fear etched on their faces, was clear the sense of defeat already in their manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding they've made their mistakes, you line up your shot. With the number of transformed you'll make this time, perhaps they'll be enough of them to avoid getting taken from the production side, to being the product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing the trigger, the shot shatters the window, and the beaker the technician is holding up to the light. The clear contents soak into his shirt. The consequences clear on his face, even as it transforms. Breast erupt from his formerly flat chest. Nipples widening, as they thrust forward.

Enough has already entered the air, that you can see the victims claw at their chests, at their throats, their destination already outliined. The screaming, the high, feminine shrill dread cries from the technician shattering their calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne guard, in a loose vest, proudly showing off his muscles, regrets his choice. His skin lightening, his muscles withering away.

The effort just telling her soft her new bust is... how sensitive those ripe nipples are to even the lightest of contact. The dread of knowing how many will talk to her bust, rather than her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final surge, she passes from the \u00fcber-busty to the absurd. More like a cow, with those damned udders, her hands fell limp to her side.

You've tried everything with cocaine - baking it into cakes, hiding it in soap, religious statues, plaster casts, dissolving it in bottles of pepsi. But your preferred method of choice is women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen made the best drug-mules. Their bodies were natural containers after all. The beautiful creatures would swallow thousands of dollars of your packaged product and hold it in their intestines while they crossed the border, to be decanted on the other side. They were naturally accustomed to having their vaginas and anuses packed to the brim, into which you gleefully inserted liters of product. Drug enforcement officials were less likely to search them than men, less likely to use deadly force, and women had their own ways of \"persuading\" border guards to look the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple x-ray would detect swallowed product, of course, but there were ways around that. Breast and ass augmentation was common in this part of the way, and no border guard would look twice at a woman sporting a juicy pair of fake tits. Well, they certainly might look twice, but they're unlikely to suspect that, instead of silicone, your surgeons have filled those implants with pure diluted cocaine. Each enhanced tit can hold within it between 100 and 500ml of the stuff. Surgeons on the other side remove the implant, drain the fluid, and easily filter out the product. There was no greater delight to you than watching the big breasted mules being sent on their way to the airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't stop there though. After all, what goes hand in hand with big breasts? Babies! You could fill a mule's belly with kilos of liquid cocaine, pump them full of synthetic hormones to make them look and act like heavily pregnant women, then send them on their way. It has the additional benefit that border security are especially wary to x-ray a woman they believe to be pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's only one catch. Female mules are scarce. They're too sensible, too afraid of you, they're not as money-hungry as men, nor as desperate to put food on their table for their families. You have more product than you can pump into your limited supply of female mules, already packaged up in millions of jiggly implants just ready to be inserted, but you have more men lining up to be mules than you know what to do with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a typically hot and steamy day, as you sit in the palatial gardens of your forest villa. Underlings fan you, bring you iced drinks, ass you examine the new arrivals, boys from the local villages, all eager to begin working and earning. They are nervous, naturally, avoiding your gaze as they stand in a long line in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of them have already begun starving themselves, so that their clothes hang loosely off their reduced frames. That's good. It shows commitment, and will require less time and effort from your men until their bodies are ready to be carved up, pumped full, and shipped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instruct them to strip, and they do so without question. Your eyes flit up and down the line. There is potential here certainly. A few individuals catch your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome, of course, are too large, too masculine. They must not have received the memo about what this job entails. Many of them genuinely arrive expecting to be recruited as your \"muscle\", when muscle is literally the last thing you need. Yet you've seen muscle-bound men dwindle to nothing just a few months after losing that thing between their legs. A cocktail of synthetic hormones in their blood can correct almost anything.</span></div></div>",

You nod along, as he explains their trip across the border for a little enhancement work. Your frustration must have shown, as you wanted them to look as normal as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe explains rapidly, that they're going to relaunch themselves after the trip, and if there are any discrepancies they can be dismissed as part of their new persona.

While the clothing do much to show off her new curves, the implants inside them were not medical grade. There is a risk of them rupturing with too much force or compression, releasing their deadly payload. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fix Barbi with a look to check her comprehension, though her face has been carved into such a vapid beautiful mask it is hard to tell. To force home the point, you pull Barbi to your side, while your fingers drifts down from Bambi's zipper to gently caress her ass. Your hands glide over the curves of the two girls at your side, tenderly, not squeezing, as much as you might want to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody will judge you if you wish to... explore yourselves,...or each other, while you are away.

Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your satisfaction, they nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I wish you well. When you return, you will be wealthy women,\" you say, driving home that when they had arrived just recently they had dreamed of being wealthy men. \"Your wives will be waiting for you, and will delight at your wealth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou savour both of their mouths slowly, running your tongue over theirs, enjoying the soft whimpers that emerge from them. They still taste of chemicals of the dental surgery that had remodelled their teeth and tongues, though not unpleasantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sons too will be delighted to see you home, I'm sure,\" you chuckle, menace creeping into your voice. \"Just be sure that you complete your job. Or I will have them take your place. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies tremble under your hands as they nod again. </span></div></div>",

The airplane ride had been maddening - every jolt of the plane setting the thick liquid inside her swirling, the slightest breeze of the air-conditioning over her exposed, sensitive bosom making her hornier than she'd ever been before as a man. Not that the thick syrup of hormones glooping through her veins wasn't helping, winding her sex drive up tight as a spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a week to recover. During that time, you are forbidden from attempting to contact your families. You will be expected to live the lives you have been given.

She looked over-joyed to be admired, to be seen purely for her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Tina was jealous, wishing for that oblivion. Another part shuddered at the loss. The pride in her curves, and the power they gave, Sindi proudly defiant with a hand planted on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b0bdd25fbbe32b929f10f5405d1e94b/tumblr_pxnnrmCWrs1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b0bdd25fbbe...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a woman confident in her own power.

She was blind to Felix's request, the gesture, miming once more a fuller, firmer ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina couldn't help but picture it. Her soon to be lesbian partner, to cuddle and snuggle as they proudly strutted across the border, drawing all the eyes, and leaving behind only one impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e60725090c93b0f9edb47142c73f6eb6/tumblr_pxnnrmCWrs1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/e60725090c93...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp inhale came from Tina, as the Doctor answered with his own mime. This time his hands thrusting further forward miming a bigger chest. Tina whimpered, hoping the same thought didn't get suggested for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the innocent Sindi, just continued to preen, turn and be adored blind to the further changes they were planning for her still elastic flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/44bf603023bff9b44e3689f802a3e2eb/tumblr_pxnnrmCWrs1w2lwkto4_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/44bf603023bf...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dismissive wave, the girls were gestured towards the door, and back to their rooms....

His eager pace unsettled her, and thoughts of what he might do once alone in the bedroom with her made her heart beat fast in terror. \"Pu-please, I can find my own way,\" she mewled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wherever you go, I go. Consider yourself chained to me. At least for as long as these things are worth half a million each,\" he barked back, his meaty hand delivering a ringing slap to her cocaine-pumped buttock for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina screamed in pain and fear as the force ripple through her. \"Oh god, don't do that! Don't hit me, they might burst! I'll die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't like that, his face darkening in anger. \"Shut your mouth, bitch. You don't get to tell me what to do. You're just a hole for us to pump drugs and cock into. When I lay a hand on you, you'll say thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised the back of his hand, and Tina saw her life flash in front off her eyes, desperately trying to shield her delicate breasts and ass implants with her hands. It was no use, four hands couldn't have concealed those beauties, let alone two. His palm rung off her other cheek, setting the silicone, cocaine and flesh sloshing like jelly. \"Now what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina trembled. It was possible she was already dead if the implants had ruptured, she just didn't know it yet. Or it was possible she would live. She didn't know which was worse. She lowered her head, sobbing, \"th-thank you\". The only thing that mattered was keeping him happy. Her life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right,\" he leered, seizing her again and dragging her towards the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears dripped down Tina's face. \"I want to go home,\" she sobbed quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, sure, Felix'll be real glad to let you go. Walk out any time you want. And you pick up your cock at the coatroom on the way out too,\" he guffawed. \"Nah, just kidding. We threw that pathetic piece of meat out back for the dogs to eat. Same as we did for all the others. You want to go ask the dogs for your cock back? Huh, bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat was real. Another word out of place and she knew he'd have her thrown to the dogs kept penned up and starving to the rear of the compound. She'd seen the animals on the first day she arrived, snarling and fighting over a scrap of meat, though had not known what it was then. As the hundreds of new arrived local men and boys had been led past the cages, the dogs had paused and stared at them like pieces of meat. It was the exact same expression her chaperone was giving her now.</span></div></div>",

Of Thomas Beck, and what he'd do with the gorgeous curvaceous Tina. It was a disjointed mess, of conflicting thoughts and feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging the door wide, her gaze was on the floor, as she felt the guiding arm at her shoulder stiffen. The bodyguard's whole demeanour become different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss.\" He snapped back a half step, as he spotted Felix Gacha standing in the room. Tina's head shot up as the desperate hope of a rescuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can leave us.\" He said simply. The draught as he closed the door behind Tina's back sending a gusting breeze through her clothes, was swift and silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's smile far more predatory, far more confident than the simple guard. Tina knew she had no hero, no champion or defender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to check your disguise, your commitment, your....\" He gestured, to her lush body. The dermabraded skin was porcelean smooth, her curves just as tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've improved our techniques, and Doctor Floyd has...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was oddly ill-at-ease, \"Well, we can't keep sending you through in dribs and drabs on flights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina nodded, not sure herself quite how to react, \"T..Thank You..\" she wasn't confident he wanted to hear that. But, shouldn't she be grateful to receive 'improved techniques'..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're organising a party boat, to make the run. You can relax and enjoy the whole journey... There'll even be a little party-boosters for cover...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stopped talking, and looked Tina over. It was as if a mask had slipped behind his eyes. The cold dis-interest in her was clear, he looked at her simply as meat to serve, like the guard, but easier on the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping his hands imperiously, \"Well, undress.

Currently enrolled at the local city college he worked a late night fast food job to pay the bills and get himself through school. He hoped one day to finish school and wind up Working for the TFPD. He was a fan of all the cop dramas  and buddy cop comedy stories about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wasn\u2019t anything special physically, around six feet tall and about 180lbs, short dark brown hair. He was a typical average guy for a 21 year old single college guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanes lived alone and took public transportation pretty much everywhere he went. He worked and lived in the city, definitely not in the greatest part of town but it was enough for him to live alone in a simple apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night James was on his way home walking late at night as the busses had already gone away for the night. It was almost 2am as James yawned and walked down the sidewalk trying his best to keep to himself. This neighborhood wasn\u2019t the best part of town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James made his way home he suddenly heard something. It was the sound of a struggle it sounded like. Following the noise Jimmy went into an alley way as he smelt sea water as he knew he was getting closer to the pier. Peaking around the corner he saw something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames saw what looked like a limo. Two large guys in track suits were getting out the front while a slick looking overweight guy in a dark suit got out of the back. He was smoking a cigar as his two henchmen went into the trunk and opened it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the trunk one of the henchmen grabbed what James could tell was a woman. She was beautiful, Latina it seemed, brown skin and long slick black hair. She was currently wearing a sexy black cocktail dress but was barefoot as her shoes had been removed. She was also bound and gagged it seemed as the large henchmen grabbed her and tossed her over his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames new he shouldn\u2019t get involved in this...He knew he should just call the cops. However his heart wouldn\u2019t let him. He knew the cops would never arrive in time. Not in this city. This lady was in danger and it was up to him to do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames followed the henchmen and their boss as they went into an old warehouse by the pier. James saw they had left the door open so he very slowly snuck behind them as he peaked around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw was a scene right out of a mafia movie. The woman was tied to a chair as the henchmen and their boss circled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria...oh...Maria...You are breaking my heart right now do you know that?\u201d The boss said as stroked her cheek with his hand that was covered in gold rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoys...Maria here was the best girl I had ever seen in this business. Beautiful, smart, and strong. I had such high hopes for you...however you know what they say...if something is too good to be true...it probably is...\u201d The boss said reaching into his coat as he tossed what looked like a badge on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective Maria Espinoza, TFPD. I\u2019m honestly shocked. Your profile online looks nothing like you now. They must have really given you a touch of the good stuff to make you look this sexy now!\u201d The boss said with a laugh as his goons joined in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss took off Maria\u2019s mouth gag as she stared at him with a cold look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was never one of your best girls Mick...I was sent in to take you down. Your operation is well known in the TFPD. You smuggle in illegal Bimbosys and use it to turn innocent people in sex crazy bimbos then you bring them into your private harem that rich sickos can pay for.\u201d She said spitting at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...Transformation drugs aren\u2019t all over the place. People always want to be something they can\u2019t. I just provide the means for those to find the comfort they desire and fulfill their fantasies.\u201d The boss said with an arrogant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo what you will to me but know that if you kill me your days are over...The TFPD will bring you down.\u201d Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill you? Please...That would be such a waste...I think there is a better use for you.\u201d The boss said snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames saw perched above the detective was one of the henchman pushing a large barrel towards the edge right above her. Taking off the lid a strange bubbling pink liquid was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think a Bimbosys shower will turn you into exactly the kind of girl who will become my personal private Harem girl for the next few years.\u201d The boss said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sick bastard! You won\u2019t get away with this!\u201d Maria said struggling to get out of her bonds. It seemed she had something hidden away in her dress but couldn\u2019t quite reach it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss our little chats....\u201d The boss said as he snapped his fingers again as his henchmen began to tip the barrel over causing the pink liquid to start pouring out right above Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it fate...maybe just dumb luck...Whatever it was that made James jump out from his safe hiding spot and propel him forward, nobody knows. James had kept from hiding right before the liquid was to splash all over Detective Maria as he pushed her out of the way but causing himself to be soaked instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room was shocked at what had just happened. However Maria wasted no time as the push had freed her from her binds enough to reach into her dress and pull out a hidden gun as the boss and his goons began to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour choice cop! You can either get us or save the kid...\u201d The boss said fleeing with his goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria wanted nothing more than to stop these jerks but she looked over to the young man who had just saved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was writhing on the ground covered in a pink liquid. His body was beginning to twist and turn as his flesh and body were starting to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s...happening to me?\u201d James cried out as his voice was getting higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn the bimbofication has already started...You need help now.\u201d She said as she used the hidden radio in her dress to call for help. </span></div></div>",

They alerted her that all possible assistance would be forth coming.  Emergency vehicles pulling up bringing aid.  Maria directed a couple police vehicles to give chase to the escaped criminals.  Unlikely they would catch up but the chance always lay there.  An ambulance arrived to take James off to whatever help might be possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria did a run down with the chief upon her arrival on scene hearing the incident on the radio.  Directing Maria to head home after and come in early for further questions after a nights rest.  She went home to decompress but found it took a few beers to settle herself.  Anger for getting caught and an innocent victim laying in a hospital room left to an unknown fate.  Flicking on her computer reviewing what the database knew on bimbosys.  Scrolling down to treatment it didn\u2019t appear promising.  No known cure sent her stomach into a tumult.  Perhaps a phone call to her contacts for help.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Yamato eyed the charts with fascination.  The transmutation factor on the chemical significant.  Sadly it dissipated quickly.  Human systems absorbing it rapidly.  Only traces for analyse, degraded to a point only cursory exam could be done.  Nothing to explain its origins.  He only did a perfunctory read on the patient back round uninterested in the human aspect unless it relates to the physical condition.  Noting his address to do a follow up sans scrutiny if necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctors flushed out James\u2019s system the stabilizer staving off drastic shifts in his body.  Tragically ruining any opportunity to retrieve an untainted sample.  Damaging what sample they might obtain within.  What brought Dr Yamato was transplantation.  The young man found himself subject of the surgical precision of the talented doctor for replacing his vocal cords.  That he might not fall to ridicule.  A phone call from Espinosa brought him in.  Providence smiling on him he thought with a laugh.  With a cool attitude he handled procedure with the ease his talent made it.  Palming the extracted material for personal testing and examination into a preservative container.  A risk but definitely worth it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames woke with a with a shivering chill.  \u201cEasy there Mr Erikson.  Your system has undergone quite a shock.  Lay back and see if you can talk.\u201d  A kindly young nurse said adjusting IV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took a minute to examine himself for any feminine signs.  No bulbous protrusions issuing an audible sigh of relief, feeling his manhood in place.  The nurse snickering said, \u201cFind what you were looking for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm feeling hit his cheeks, \u201cSorry, I uhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries I understand.  The Doctor will be in shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I am hundred percent okay?\u201d  James said confused at the his unusually deep voice.  It might be hoarse he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctor will talk it all through with you.\u201d  She said stepping back as an austere doctor entered the room in a tailored suit topped with a lab coat and stethoscope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I am Doctor Kellar.  How are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy voice sounds funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, tonal changes are to be expected.  Necessarily we needed to remove effected tissues.  Don\u2019t worry the eminent Dr Yamato performed the procedure.  A chemical agent of unknown nature attacked you systems.  We removed it the best we could from your body.  A device attached to your cerebral cortex will monitor and filter out any foreign elements.  The hope is that nothing remains but if there is the device should help.\u201d  Dr Kellar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould help?  What if it malfunctions?  What if there is some bimbosys in me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cybernetics inside you should detect the anomaly, alter us and quarantine it.  I am sorry that I can give you no guarantees.  You are receiving the best care we can provide.\u201d  Said Dr Kellar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Yamato sent the tissue samples through a sequencer to try and develop a pattern for what transmuting secrets they contained.  Questions ran through his head.  Why did it only interact with humans?  How could it enact such a thorough alteration mental and physical?  How could chemical contain such a sequence?  Possibly microrobotics or a multi-layer meshing agent with a base DNA sequence interlinked.  If he could master its complexities it would take his work to the next level.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria came in the next day to compare notes with Jackie both a victim and fellow detective for the TFPD.  Jacqueline formerly Jack a victim of bimbosys chemical became lead detective investigating the drug.  Maria said, \u201cI am still not sure how my cover got blown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe glad that you aren\u2019t stuck with a couple zeppelins like me.\u201d  Jackie said her tight shirt with generous cleavage on display.  \u201cOr worse being a slutty simpleton.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria checked her chest saying, \u201cI am.  But I was so close to nailing the asshole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a description thanks to you.\u201d  Jackie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has the money and connections to alter his appearance.  It won\u2019t be good for long.\u201d  Maria said frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we shake down every appearance changers we know.  It is something to go on.  Better than spinning our wheels here.\u201d  Jackie said and Maria agreed.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr. Yamato gave him the full run down the day he woke up. His DNA had been permanently altered by the high levels of Bimbosys he had been exposed to. If Detective Maria hadn\u2019t intervened James would have been just a mindless dumb bimbo right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the cybernetic implants and medications were keeping the changes at bay for now but unfortunately Dr. Yamato had to break some seriously bad news to James. These preventive measures were only temporary. Eventually his body and immune system would reject them causing his body to start turning back into a bimbo form again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news hit James like a ton of bricks. It was like being told you were dying, but in a different way. The only good news out of this situation was the cybernetics in his brain should be able to hold back the worst of the mental changes. He would still be himself, however certain bimbo urges and desires would inevitably get through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TFPD took James\u2019 statement and even the Chief herself Olivia Haywood dropped by James\u2019 room to offer her gratitude and appreciation for what James did. His heroic sacrifice saves the life of one her best detectives. James was to receive a public honor and medal and be featured in the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thanked the Chief but declined her offer. The reality of his life ahead of him was too much for him to deal with right now and the last thing he wanted was the public to see him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chief understood. She left with the simple process that the TFPD would make sure he was taken care of during this transition period and she gave her word they would never rest until Mickey, the crime boss responsible for this mess was brought to justice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014Two Weeks Later\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetective Maria and her partner Jackie had now hit a dead end in their investigation. With their covers both blown no one was willing to talk to them. Mickey had either skipped town or gotten his appearance altered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of his known clubs or cover businesses showed any sign of him. Stakeouts proved useless and just left them Tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this seems to stop the business however. Two more young girls had gone missing in the last couple weeks. Reports that the secret harem was still up and running began to come in through the confidential informants they still had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria sat alone one afternoon drinking a cup of coffee as she poured over paperwork. She felt both a mixture of anger and guilt over the situation she was in. Somewhere she messed up and in the process ruined her investigation and the life of that poor guy who saved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria too had sacrificed much for this investigation. Before this assignment she looked much different from before. She was a skinny and undeveloped paper pusher for the TFPD. She always had the brains but never the body to go out into field work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever when the Chief and Dr. Yamato offered her this chance she couldn\u2019t refuse it. Her treatments gave her this amazing body. Large breasts, great curves, and a seductive personality and desires. However it came at a large personal cost. The transformation was irreversible and permanently left Maria with seductive desires she could never Fully shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow she got exposed still bothered her to no end. It had taken months to establish her trust with Mickey. The things she had to do still haunted her to this day which was why a bottle of Tequila was always near her desk or home now. The only answer she could come up with was an insider tipped Mikey off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple days passed as Maria decided to drop in on James and see how he was doing. She hadn\u2019t been told about his condition only that he had been released. Maria still felt an enormous amount of guilt over what happened and wanted to check up on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria dropped by his apartment and knocked on the door which slowly opened as Maria\u2019s eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway was a beautiful busty blonde woman. She had long platinum blonde hair that fell down to her waist. She had huge perfectly rounded breasts that stuck out from her chest with no sag. She had wide hips and a perfect bubble butt along with long well toned legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like the kind of perfect porn star or trophy wife one would see on a reality show. Her body looked sculpted by design to be sexy in almost every way. Down to her pouty full lips and long eyelashes. To her long perfectly trimmed nails. And even the sultry sound of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a tight tank top that barely covered her large tits and exposed her midriff along with a black mini skirt that barely went to her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Maria confused for a second. \u201cDetective Espinoza?\u201d She asked a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was equally confused. She had no idea who this girl was. \u201cYes...I\u2019m looking for James, he around?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked a bit sad for a moment as she looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore...You can call me Jamie.\u201d She said forcing a weak smile on her face as Maria realized what had happened...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria thought about the figure of the woman before her.  She would certainly draw stares and just the attention that could bring in Mickey.  She could use her as an undercover agent.  No way her boss would go for it.  But she didn\u2019t need to know.  \u201cSay Jamie would you like to get back at the man who did this to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I don\u2019t know it has been lots of fun.   I totally got three numbers last night and company to take home with me.\u201d  Jamie said with a smile on her face thinking on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That wasn\u2019t the response she was looking for.  \u201cBut think of all the competition that he will create so you won\u2019t have anyone to go home with.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie\u2019s simplified mind found the logic in Maria\u2019s words, \u201cYou are sooo right.  I am in what do I need to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I will walk you through it.\u201d  Maria said, \u201cI will even get you a cute outfit.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the best.  I am going to to give you a super squeezy hug.\u201d  Jamie said proceeding to embracing Maria tightly.  Maria rolled her eyes planning out her next steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a fitted outfit with seamlessly in stalled listening device and and optical viewing took a raid on the disguise wardrobe.  Jenkins who ran it did so as if he was already retired.  Normally no nod to your existence took place upon entering.  Often engrossed in his TV to login a person\u2019s arrival.  This led to multiple opportunities to borrow for closet expansion and covert activities.  Maria took a dress that allowed for Jamie\u2019s buxom attributes.  Low cut and tight the better to attract attention.  Maria wondered how to best lure in Mickey without Jamie simply being picked up by a man on the make.  Walking over she began to choose out jewelry.  A set of dangling earrings that she could use to call Jamie off any man she thought might be innocent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn to heels she went.  Hunting through them till Maria found the black strapless ones she sought.  The snap offs that contained chemicals inside that sprayed knockout gas to anyone in range.  An inoculation for Jamie to protect her from the effects.  She arranged to meet at Jamie\u2019s apartment.  Walking her through the various items and gadgets but especially the heels.  Maria could handle the surveillance portion of it.  Ignoring the fawning over the dress Maria got an eye full of Jamie\u2019s naked curves hug the dress as she filled it out.  Nipples on full display with Jamie foregoing a bra and panties.  She didn\u2019t like the lines that would make in dress.  Then bait was hooked for Mickey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria drove the surveillance van with Jamie chatting how exciting it all was.  She tuned her out on the drive to one of Mickey\u2019s favorite bars.  His appearance altered she hoped he\u2019d show up there.  \u201cGood luck Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks but with my new body I get lucky all the time.\u201d  Jamie said.  Sauntering into the seedy bar she positioning herself at the end of the bar like Maria told her to.  Surveying the bar for yummy men.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria observed through a lens positioned on Jamie\u2019s shoulder.  A few women plying their trade and more than a few seedier individuals that she began running through facial recognition software.  Recording on tape every tattoo and distinguishing feature.  A fat slovenly fellow walked up asking her price.  Maria told her to tell she wasn\u2019t for sale.  She couldn\u2019t imagine Mickey choosing an unattractive body.  Jamie followed instruction but this didn\u2019t go over well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t come in here looking like that saying you aren\u2019t selling.  Oh you are for sale or I am taking you for free.\u201d  The man said angrily.  No hero types moved to her aid till a well attired man stepped out of the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an even tone he said, \u201cYou need better manners.  Leave before this becomes physical.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat man lowered his head, \u201cDo I have to go?\u201d  His bluster lost and a defeated look on his face.  <br>\r\nA faux smile came across the silk suit man that never touched his eyes.  His eyes spoke of menace.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that is necessary.  You sound contrite enough.  Apologize and go back to your table.\u201d  The fat man slunk away in shame.  Maria smiled thinking she must of found her mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slick man with a smooth smile sat beside Jamie, \u201cI am Wesley Thornton.  May I be so bold to inquire who you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria whispered go for it.  Jamie grinned to the handsome new man, \u201cI am Jamie and I am looking for company tonight.\u201d  This certainly caught Wesley\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight I inquire as to what the requirements are to accompany you tonight?\u201d  Wesley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie\u2019s eyes drifted down to his groin smiling at the bulge, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we step outside where it is quieter?\u201d  Wesley took the offer and followed her feminine form out the door up to the van.  Where after locking lips Jamie did an exhaustive search for weapons.  Finding the usual one between his legs.  Checking to see if it was loaded she discovered it to be an adjustable barrel lengthening in her hands.  Jamie only triggered her heel under duress from Maria\u2019s repeated pleas.</span></div></div>",

        "created":1384386960,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The TFPD deals with unusual and bizarre cases in all fields of criminal investigation, from situations of identity theft through to assault and murder, drug smuggling and people trafficking, and high tech robbery. Though only a small organization of exceptional officers and operatives, its jurisdiction and budget is extensive, and it has access to the bleeding-edge of top-secret military hardware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Guidelines</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Transformation can be fun, though the general tone is intended to be fairly dark. Transformations may be slow, painful experiences, prone to going horrifically awry, leaving users disfigured or dead. Officers may suffer all sorts of long-lasting physical and mental trauma, be killed or worse in the line of duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Feel free to include magic or supernatural elements. Shows like X-Files or Fringe are good inspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. As a small force, the TFPD tends to work alongside regular law enforcement as \"specialists\" for unusual cases.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The TFPD is departmentalized - as such members of one department may know little about the work of the other departments. Some departments are more mundane than others, and so a member of Drug Enforcement may have zero knowledge and even contempt for the officers in Animal Control, unaware of the highly dangerous \"monster hunts\" the latter frequently go on, or even that such legendary beasts exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Roughly half of the TFPD's manpower works in witness protection. The TFPD now handles all of the country's witness protection programs, providing witnesses with new identities up to and during their day in court, in many cases for the rest of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. TFPD officers are not incorruptible, and there will always be cases where information leaks into the wrong hands for the right amount of money. Due to the many ongoing deep-cover missions being undertaken by its officers, as well as its witness protection programs, any information leaks are taken very seriously. Nor are officers above using the department's resources for their own personal ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>TFPD Staff</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chief Olivia Haywood</b> - the head honcho of the TFPD, Mrs Haywood is a serious, sober official with a distinguished history in both the military and the police force. Commited to doing things \"by the book\", her stern demeanor and strong sense of civic duty is often the only thing stopping the anarchic department from descending into chaos. She is in her mid-forties but despite many years behind a desk, she keeps herself in peak physical condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Doctor Yamato</b> - the world's finest plastic surgeon, Yamato rose to fame after performing the first Species Reassignment Surgery, where he successfully transitioned a dog into a cat. His work is groundbreaking but controversial. It was during an investigation into his sourcing of certain \"transplants\" from third world countries that he agreed to work alongside the TFPD as a freelance specialist, in exchange for sweeping his many legal indiscretions under the rug. He provides his remarkable services on an irregular basis, though due to frequent trips to his native Japan he is not always readily available. Yamato is a brilliant but unethical surgeon, capable of performing extensive body reconstruction and the intricate microsurgery necessary for face transplants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ray Haywood</b> - A rookie on the force, Ray struggles to gain respect from his fellow officers and often worries that he stands in the shadow of his mother, Chief Olivia Haywood. Many of his colleagues question how such a young, unproven agent was selected to undergo amnion implantation. Ray is determined to prove himself, even at the risk of himself or the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Officer Charles Olson </b>- Colleagues who were around when Officer Olson first joined Witness Protection twenty years ago remember him as a squat balding man in his late 50s. He has since matured into a swarthy, statuesque 35-year-old stud, a transition that may have something to do with his close relationship with plastic surgeon Doctor Yamato and the unsolved disappearance of several items from the evidence locker relating to the investigation into Yamato's past misdeeds.<br>\r\nBeneath his handsome exterior, Olson remains a dirty old man rotten to the core, willing to sell out his fellow officers and top secret witness protection details for the right price. He is a slippery character, somehow dodging two investigations into police corruption, as well as retirement.<br>\r\nHas the hots for his partner, Miss Summers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Officer Jennifer Summers</b> - A well-meaning agent who cares deeply about her work. She has personally rehomed a number of witnesses in her own home, despite her allergies to cat and dog hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Professor Frank Heywood</b> - Once a respected lecturer and husband of Olivia Heywood, Frank realised that his considerable genius would be better served in the career of mega-maniacal genius. Using his connections to his wife, he was able to get his hands on a large cache of illegal technology and use it carve out a nice section of the criminal underworld. He is now hunted by his wife and son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Notable tech</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amnion</b> - recently discovered in the Mariana Trench, the amnion are a rare species of jellyfish that displays remarkable properties. When implanted into a human (a process with only a 40% survival rate), the amnion spreads its many long tentacles through the entirety of the host body, integrating itself so fully that it cant be removed. Though retaining a normal outward appearance, the host's flesh is converted into a gelatinous substance identical to that of the amnion. This flesh can be molded into any shape, and can withstand extensive trauma, piercing, and cutting wounds, though the flexible form comes at the cost of a 20-30% reduction in muscle strength . The blood of the host becomes a clear fluid. Due to the risks of implantation, only special field agents are given the amnion.<br>\r\nThe amnion is not without its weaknesses, and is particularly sensitive to even minor changes in its host's blood chemistry. Certain drugs or a high blood alcohol content can temporarily disable the parasite and its shape-shifting abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Synth Skin</b> - Synthetic spray-on flesh, usually used by officers as a field-dressing to patch up wounds. Has a plastic-sheen to it. Veteran officers often show off how much synth skin they have as a badge of honour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nICE - stands for Interactive Computer Environment. If a criminal is regarded as too dangerous for regular imprisonment, they are submerged in liquid-filled pods and their minds downloaded into a virtual prison, where they can be rehabilitated. ICE is the name of the operating system that runs the virtual environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Divisions</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vice Squad</b> - deals with gambling, narcotics and prostitution. An undesirable department due to the seedy and unpleasant nature of the work, most officers are transferred here as punishment for some misdemeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Witness Protection</b> - responsible for taking care of witnesses thought to be in danger of retribution, usually from organized crime gangs. Here witnesses are given fresh identities and safe accommodation until their time to testify. In cases where their safety is still in question, witnesses may be arranged permanent, new lives even after trials have concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Undercover Operations</b> - has undercover agents placed deep within many criminal organizations. Their work is deeply secretive, their agents highly trained and expertly disguised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCriminal Investigations - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Animal Control </b>- As well as handling mundane cases of wild, dangerous, and mistreated animal, Animal Control also deals with a significant number of things that can only be termed \"monsters\", be they ultra-rare species that have fallen into myth, mutant humans, or the creations of mentally unstable scientists. Animal Control Officers are a gung-ho lot, prone to shooting first, decapitating second, burning and salting the corpse third and asking questions fourth.</td>",
