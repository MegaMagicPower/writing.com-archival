Her innate...greenness was painfully obvious as the way she looked at her town map. Her forehead practically touching the damn thing's screen. Sort mint colored eyes squinting at the screen's map, quietly murmuring to herself. Her lips curling upwards. \"....A half-mile away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">DeinDeiDi....DeinDei!</span>\" Her companion, a young Deino dully grumbled. Cursing in her strange terminology. Easily finding her trainer's....optimism to be worse than smelling a Koffing...on a hot summer day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Rose, don't be such a potty mouth. You ruined those pretty little fangs!\" The young girl teased only first and only Pokemon. Causing the creature to hiss up a storm. Which the girl only giggled in response. This became an odd sort of bonding ritual between the two. It all started ever since she threw a premier ball at her while she was napping on her parents' estate. Becoming her first-ever Pokemon! And the grumpy little dragon now stops chewing on her poor bottom in three minutes flat, which is showing real promise on their blossoming relationship!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to said pokemon's chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">and she <i>technically</i>....ran away from home. And used her beloved father's money to get a trainer's license for herself.</font> But alas, her adventurous wanderlust can not be tamed! But she did write a note to her loving parents.

I'm Abigail, and this is Rose, and we're here to beat you for a badge.\" The young girl declares with a mix of confidence and nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. We'll see about that. I am Sabrina, leader of this gym, and I accept your challenge. How many pokemon do you have?\" Sabrina asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... just Rose, actually.\" She admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one?

Very well, then I shall also use one pokemon.\" Sabrina resigns. \"But be aware, given the special case of this match, there will be an added rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What rule is that?\" Abigail asks as she sets Rose on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I win this match, then you are to do whatever I say until sundown.\" The psychic reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a bit... intense for a first-timer.

Not by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being armed with the moves <b>Dragon rage</b> and <b>Bite</b>, both would have instantly landed an easy victory against any Abra. But Sabrina's own was slippery as a greased Tynamo. Using teleport to safely darted away from the blue flames. Making the little creature all the angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it....Rose chase it around and use bite whenever you get close!\" Abigail cheered in support, making Rose see a different side of the idiot child. There was a certain spark in her eyes. And for once, the dragon fiercely replied to her trainer's order. A maw filled with fangs came charging in like an eager liepard going for the kill!....only to miss the target, no thanks to the visual problems that plagued the first two stages of her kind. The abra wasted no time unleashing a bright light that did wonders for said visual problems. This quickly becomes a cycle as the dragon stubbornly insists. Until she comes to stop,  panting angrily as it was clear as day that she lost the battle. Her former foe didn't even break an ounce of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon couldn't continue even if she wanted to. So a dejected Abby returned her back into her pretty white Pokeball. The saddened girl was about to walk to the nearest Pokecenter. Until the cool stern voice of Sabrina cuts her own sadness like a knife through butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop your sulking and come here.\" Abigail got a chill ran down her spine as she approached the woman. Her eyes immediately widened at the woman's tall height. Red eyes soullessly gazing her body. Making her eyes averted to her body. Noticing the way her slim body made curves despite having a smaller bust and thinner legs. Her cheeks turned red as she shamefully looks down on the floor. Sabrina didn't seem to notice as she continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you honestly think that just because your Pokemon is part dark type that it will be such an easy victory? To point you clearly came extremely unprepared?\" Sabrina coldly toned, clearly very angry at the girl's utter arrogance and lack of responsibility. \"What if you were alone in a forest and Rose just fainted? Being a Pokemon trainer isn't a damn game where nothing bad happens! Pokemon depends on us and vice versa. They are not little trophies of your vanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's harsh words made her body shivered like she was stranded in a blizzard with only a mere summer dress for protection. Her eyes grew watery and her bottom lip quivered as she sniffed. Causing the normally ever stoic Sabrina's scowl to soften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026But despite being an idiot who is in way over her head, you do actually care and love about your Pokemon. And that more than what other people can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made Abby's heart fluttered like butterfree emerging from night long slumber. Her frown slowly turning up-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But utter stupidity and naivety like yours must be dealt with immediately. And I'm certainly have nothing better to do at the  current moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, the butterfree gotten eaten by a cruel honchkrow. It didn't stand a singular once of a chance. All poor Abby could say is \" Ehhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the plot thickens, what happens next?</span></div></div>",

The other party just look back at each other, both not sure on what to do now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does happen next in this thrilling drama?</span></div></div>",

It took a long time to set that tent up that you wrecked. So now that you tore it down, I only see it as fair that I be compensated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're sorry. We'll help put up the tent and be on our way.\" Abby tells the pinkette while she fights her way out of the collapsed tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance. You'll be fixing my tent, of course, to make us even. But I said I wanted to be compensated for it.\" She whined. \"On top of fixing my tent, <b>you</b>, little brat, will be giving me a full body massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? And why would I do that?\" Abby snapped back. \"What's stopping me and Rose from just up and leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you do, my Miltank will flatten you like pancakes before you could even get over the horizon.\" The girl threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, like we're supposed to be scared of some Miltank.\" Abby says with an eye roll and heavy amounts of sarcasm. \"What makes yours so special that we should be worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you haven't heard of me? I am Goldenrod City's very own gym leader, Whitney. Trainers far and wide shudder at the thought of me and my sweet Miltank.\" Whitney boasts as she finally announces herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby paled when she finally revealed her identity. She'd heard horror stories of this girl from trainers who could never beat her. They spoke of her Miltank like it was a demon in pokemon form. She never knew that this was what she looked like, especially not looking so... filled-out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! You're Whitney? Well why didn't you say so? Of course I'll massage you.\" Abby says, giving a complete 180 on her attitude towards the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. Now recall that dragon so you can start with rubbing...\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to yet another story of mine! This is a mix of dating sim, a visual novel, and the timeless story of a kid traveling around the place to place. Making friends with fuck powerful forces of nature. Only...more raunchy. ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are da rulz!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No short chapters! Keep a minimum of two to four paragraphs at a minimum. I will give leniency on some chapters but don't continuously make them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Sexual content will be heavily referenced and will happen. And actual super \"lewd\" stuff may or not transpire in later chapters. But being constantly naked is which is a no-no.<br>\r\n3.1. <i>Super</i> young characters (like Bonnie) will have no hardcore and mild level lewd chapters about them whatsoever. Light will be welcome\u2026but it keep that way.<br>\r\n3.2. Full-blown sex and actual romance will be something will you have to develop a relationship with a character. none of which will be the super young characters. Crushes can be formed quite easily however and can act as a starting point for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No toilet, TG, Tf, Most of Weight gain, major limb expansion or inflation, or vore of any kind. That goes for any kink that goes against the flow of the story. I will allow some shrinking/growing, and <i>maybe</i> other stuff like that.<br>\r\n 4.1 But it has to be done by a Pokemon or a human with special powers like Sabrina. And must be reversible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. My eternal rule: Not every foot have to smell like a cheese factory, nor do they smell like a field of daisies. The same goes for the feet' size and texture. Not every person is tall or is short for that matter. Not every girl has watermelon for tits. Or an ass that claps away thunderstorms. Variety is the spice of life, get what I'm saying. All too make feel a little more realistic and \"human\". But it doesn't mean that characters that normally don't have stinky feet can't have positively barking dogs and same for goes vice versa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Your choices do matter in the long run and shape the main character's personality and also develop the others. And remember while you are free to do whatever you want. But remember, you aren't free from the consequences of said actions.<br>\r\n6.1. The protagonist is a deeply sheltered but sweet girl who is so naive and carefree that it hurts, has not mentioned she is at the age where she starts to look at things differently\u2026and realize new distinct ways about herself. So of which are quite pervy\u2026Nuff said.<br>\r\n6.2. Her age would...be vague. All I would say that she will be somewhere between being eleven and fifteen years old. What her exact age can definitely be confirmed in a storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please keep the influx of choice chapters on the relatively low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Keep it, first person or second person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. No sudden abrupt endings and deaths. The former can be done in matter of....thirty chapters in. Deaths are a strong maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Make all characters act their age and true to their personalities. But interpretations and exploration on them and how they react to things are not only allowed but is ENCOURAGED. Not to mention\u2026it's kinda one of the main themes of the story.<br>\r\n10.1. That being...they are allowed to cuss like sailors. Everyone except for Abby and Lillie who will use super grown-up substitutions like (heck, darnit, poop, and etc.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. And while foot fetish is what you called the \"main\" kink of this story and will be encouraged. It doesn't mean that Abigail(the name of our protagonist) is blind to a character's other \"assets\" *eyebrow wiggle*. But be warned, this isn't pure smut(and it can be kinda close). But playful mocking, outright bullying, and teasing is very much allowed and is encouraged. ;D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. And while I'm straight. You can play and interact with both boy and girl characters. Although I would like more stuff focusing on girls. But no chapters with the character lewd interaction being adult and older males (Like Hala and Giovanni.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. While the Humans are the main focus of the story, Pokemon themselves play a lesser but still major role of in it. And certain ones may be interacted in a certain way! Abby may have strange experiences against some wild Froslass she happen to find in her journey of becoming the best and strongest trainer ever! Or her very own Steelie may find new games to play with her dritz of a trainer.\u2026or a rival trainer might use their own Delphox to dish out some cruel and unusual penalties. But despite these, humans are still the frontrunners<br>\r\n13.1 Some Pokemon will be pushed for these interacts (CoughGardeviourCough)\u2026others not so much (looks at Muk) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. The specific region Abby is in will be determined either by a specific character, the criminal team she encounters or a city/location she enters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. The most important rule\u2026is to have fun, and get creative with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. Second most important rule; no crossovers! Keep it purely Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">THE WANTED LIST; I will offer up to five hundred to a thousand gift points on 1,600 to 3,200 gift points for any chapters these characters: </font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.
