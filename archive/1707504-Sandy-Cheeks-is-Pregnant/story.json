The baby is his.<br>\r\n\"Go away Spongebob! I don't want you here!\"<br>\r\n\"But I want to see you! I want to know whats going on. Why havn't you been speaking to me?\"<br>\r\nJust then my twin brother, Randy, walks in the door. I run and hug him, I havn't seen him in a year.<br>\r\n\"I came to see how you were doing after I heard the news.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, your an awesome brother.\"<br>\r\nSpongebob leaves and I'm glad. Today I'm going to find out if I'm having a boy or a girl...well technically the doctor is coming here...since I cant breathe underwater. I'm actually kind of excited to have a baby. It gets kind of lonely around here since all my family lives in Texas. Just in the middle of thinking about it the doctor comes in. He does the test and has me look at the screen. And then the best news of all comes: Twins. The doctor leaves and just in time too. I know its not a very good idea but I need to tell Spongebob. I don't really know when or how to tell him. I guess I could invite him over or we could meet at his place. I've never been good at telling people this kind of stuff.<br>\r\n\"Randy, I'm gonna go tell Spongebob the news, I'll get something for dinner while I'm out\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be here. Goodluck\"<br>\r\n<b>Later at Spongebobs</b>: \"Spongebob, I need to tell you something.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it Sandy?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to say this but... I'm pregnant, Spongebob\"<br>\r\n\"Whos the father?\"<br>\r\n\"You are\"<br>\r\n\"I am?\"<br>\r\n\"yes\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n\"yeah...\" <br>\r\n\"well o... bye Sandy\"<br>\r\n\"bye, Spongebob\"<br>\r\nWell it could have been harder..<br>\r\nWill Sponge bob ask Sandy to Marry him?</span></div></div>",

From the kitchen doorway, he spied on her in the living room. He liked the way her suit fit snuggly on her tail.

Her oxygen tank rested beside her face, and she had her bubble on her head (to Mr. Krabs displeasure--he was craving a taste of her furry little lips.) Mr. Krabs removed her suit to expose those purple bra and panties he'd seen her wear that time she told Spongebob she could breathe underwater and she didn't need the suit. He'd been dying to see those little panties again. All the money in the world that passed between his red claws could not amount to the satisfaction he was feeling as this moment as Sandy drifted in and out of consciousness.<br>\r\nHe stroked her furry body with his cool red hands. He laughed at the thought of Larry the Lobster just wishing he could feel what Mr. Krabs had right now! Everyone knew Larry was the chick magnet...he had ripped abs of great lobster proportions. And of course, Mr. Krabs was old. He had multiple chins and saggy skin. Oh the horror he would feel if anybody every saw him without his clothes!<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" He forced himself to say. \"Don't talk about yeself that way! This here's a beautiful lady. She is waiting for ye.\"<br>\r\nSo Mr. Krabs kissed all over Sandy and made love to her for .0823 seconds. (That's like an all-time record for old crabby men.) <br>\r\nUnfortunately for Sandy, those minuscule seconds were just long enough to spurt into her furry body a little crab seed.</span></div></div>",
