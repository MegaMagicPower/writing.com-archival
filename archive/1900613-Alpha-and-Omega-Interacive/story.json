You try to recall how this happened, but there are still parts you don't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so fast. You were part of a wolf pack- not a huge one, but still a decent size. Relations with other packs were good for the most part and the only real threat to your life was the occasional threat of a lion attack. Thankfully, these creatures never attacked full-force. But then it happened- the poachers came. It wasn't like this hadn't happened before- usually, a few would show up, your pack would kill them and everyone would eat well for a few days. But there hadn't been a group half this size- at least a hundred or more of them all striking at once. The pack was totally unprepared and what followed wasn't a battle. It was a slaughter. Left and right, dear friends, old rivals and even your own family was ripped apart, and you couldn't save them. So how did you survive? By a bit of dumb luck- you fell into some mud and, apparently, they mistook you for a big rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's unclear how long you waited, but by the time you got up, the damage... There were no words to describe what happened to your old home. All the wolves were either gone or (in the case of some poor sods) blown to meaty bits. The trees had all been torn down and burned. Life had just vanished. It was clear that you needed to leave this place. But would you join another pack, after all the pain of loss you have had?</span></div></div>",

You were wondering through the forests of Canada trying to find help. You had been walking for days trying to press on til you could find a pack, but you were on the verge of passing out from lack of sleep. You found yourself in a valley walking through it heading to where the sun sets, knowing the farther west you went, the more bountiful kills were for packs and the more likely you were able to find a pack, hopefully, one with an understandable leader. As you think you can't go another step, you feel the ground start to rumble. You see some of the tiny stones around you start jiggle around. You look up and what you see terrified you. It was a stampede of caribou coming towards you and fast. You waste no time and start to run as fast as you can away from them. As you run you look around for an area that would get you out of their way. With the herd closing in on you, you didn't see many options on what you could do. Soon you were starting to be surrounded and were trying to keep your self from getting stomped. Just as you saw and tried to go for a place to avoid their hooves, one hits you. It was instant blackout as the hoof made contact with your head and you fell to the valley floor unconscious. When you wake up you are.....</span></div></div>",
