It had been several years since the end of the Great Shinobi War and he could honestly say that he was happy with life. Madara was finally dead, the nations were experiencing their first real piece ever, and he was well on his way to becoming hokage. His only regret was the escape of Sasuke Uchiha. The dark avenger had dissapeared shortly after Madara's defeat and had not been seen since. But Naruto knew that he would surface one day, and then they would finally have their long awaited confrontation. All in all, life was good. Naruto smiled a little bigger as he turned another corner, oblivious to the crimson, tomoed eyes that followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke smiled evilly. He had never forgiven for killing Madara, the founder of his clan, and all but ruining his plans to destroy Konoha. As pwerful as he was, he knew he could not destroy Konoha so long as Naruto was there. The idiot had managed to beat Madara single-handedly; there was no way Sasuke could take him AND Konoha at the same time. So, he had spent years looking into a way to get rid of Naruto while also inflicting revenge on the blonde. What he had eventually found was a very special jutsu. It forced the target to slowly regress both physically and mentally. In addition, it would alter reallity (excluding the user) to match the age of the victim. He knew of Naruto's miserable childhood, and could think of no better revenge than sending him back to that hell with the side benefit of making him to weak to fight. Sasuke prepared the jutsu and let it loose in a flash of light.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

More importantly, if hadn't been promoted to jounin for his services in the war would he still be that stupid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued down the street, niether he, nor those around him noticed as he slowly shrank.

It had taken time, but the boy had finally noticed the Hyuuga's crush on him and had decided to ask the beauty out. They had been happily dating for three years now... or was it two? Yah, they had been dating for two years, and Naruto could easily say that he was falling for the girl... even if she was a year older than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wave happily, \"Hey, Hinata-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Naruto-kun, how are you doing?\" Hinata asked politely. Not a moment later she had to bite back an affectionite sigh as Naruto launched into a long rant about the various goings ons of his day. She loved her boyfriend dearly, but he could be so immature sometimes. She supposed that was what she got for trying to date someone one - no - two years younger. Their friends like to tease them about their relationship, constantly making jokes about Naruto liking older women and teasingly calling Hinata a cradel robber. It was all in good fun, but it did get a little old sometimes. Jerking her thoughts away from that track she refocused on Naruto and his tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto continued, niether party noticed as Hinata's kept lowering her eyes to keep eye contact with Naruto. At the start of the conversation, Naruto had been a whole head taller than the diminuitve Hyuuga; now he was almost eye level with her and still dropping. As his height dropped with every year lost, his face grew rounder, his muscles lost mass, the pitch of his voice rose, and baby fat began to appear on his body. Then, as reality followed suit, his clothes shrank to fit, his actions became more excited and hyper, even his story changed to fit the actions of a younger self.  All the while, Hinata never broke eye contact; even when those eyes only came up to her nose. As her eyes continued their trip downwards, her expression began to change. Her expression changed from that of a girlfriend admiring he boyfriend, to that of a big sister humoring a little brother. By the time Naruto finished his story, the top of his head was only level with her shoulder and he now found himself as a twelve year old genin again and Hinata's exression had settled onto a teacher who was on the verge of a giving a lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... anyway I don't think he appreciated the prank very much.\" Naruto smiled up to the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gave him a half-hearted glare. \"Naruto-kun, how many times do I need to tell you to stop pulling pranks? You've been a genin for a week already. It is time to start growing up a little. You're actions not only reflect on you're teammates but on me as your sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked down, properly ashamed, \"Sorry, Hinata-sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's frown softened. She couldn't stay mad at him. He may have had a bit of a prankster streak but that was mostly from the abuses he recieved as a jinchuuriki. Deep down, he was really a good kid. \"Its ok, Naruto-kun. Now, why don't we go get some ramen? My treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto instantly perked up. \"Yah! You're the best Hinata-sensei!\" he shouted before running ahead.</span></div></div>",

He had not grown much as a child, so his shrinking had slowed considerably. Still, by the time they had reached their destination, Naruto was down to eye level with the Hyuuga's chest (a position he would have appreciated far more a few minutes ago), and his forehead protector had been replaced by a pair of goggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two took their seats Hinata decided to start the conversation again. \"So, Naruto-kun, how was your day at the academy?\" she asked of her surrogate little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youthening boy shrugged. \"It was ok, I wish Iruka-sensei wouldn't be so mean though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata glanced at the boy next to her, not noticing how she had to look lower than when they first sat. \"I'm sure he means well. He just wants you to be ready when you graduate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Hinata-onee-chan! I won'y be graduating for another ye- another two years!\" That was weird. Why had he almost said another year? He clearly still had two to go.He must have been a little too eager to graduate. Though he would never admit it, he really looked up to his onee-chan. He couldn't wait to be a strong ninja like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try to be patient.\" Hinata said amiably, \"Maybe if you're good, Konohamaru-kun will play ninja with you again.\" The converation followed those lines for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, anyone walking past the food stand would see a young jounin woman treating a blond first year academy student in a white t-shirt and black shorts.</span></div></div>",

It had started shortly after the Chuunin Exams. She had watched as the young Uzumaki fought her older cousin, Neji, and brought him out of his hatred. Of course, she had been to young at the time to truly understand what had happened. But as she grew older, she began to see the affects that Naruto was having on her family. Not only was Neji happier and more open, but her own sister, Hinata, had grown tremendously thanks to the inspiration that the boy offered. Without even realizing it, she had come to admire Naruto Uzumaki and all of his accomplishments. Then, when he had returned from his training trip, she had caught sight of him as he walked through town. Seeing how strong and handsom he had become, her asmiration had gone straight to crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that crush came another emotion, jealousy. She was jealous of her older sister and the opportunities she had with Naruto. Hanabi new that she was too young to ever really have a shot at him. Why would he go out with her when he could go out with someone like Sakura or Hinata? She knew that Hinata also had a crush on Naruto but was too shy to act on it. It irritated her that, even though Hinata had a better chance with Naruto, she would never take the risk. SHE should have that chance! If she were in her sister's place, she would be willing to do whatever it would take to win his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought had led to a search. That search had led a jutsu. That jutsu, when cast, would allow her to switch ages with her target. It would also alter reality so that she could effectively switch places with her sister, making her the older sister and giving her the chance to win Naruto's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting her older sister, she quickly preformed the hand signs and cast the jutsu. There was a bright flash. When it cleared, Hanabi was dissapointed to find that she was still the same. Trying to think of what she may have done wrong, she remembered readin that the jutsu would take time as it slowly transferred age from one peron to the other. Taking a moment to just sit there, she nearly jumped for joy when she realized that she could feel the changes slowly taking place.. If she concetrated hard enough, she could feel her clothes growing tighter and could see her pont of view rising higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, she saw an oblivious Hinata walking out the front door, probably to stalk Naruto again. Remebering that jutsu would work better the closer she stayed to Hinata, the better it would work decided to stalk the stalker.</span></div></div>",

The capsule landed and it popped open. A small house then materialized. Goku was still wary of the new technology, so he was still frozen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku and Oolong followed Bulma into the house.

Just tired,\" Goku replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma didn't know what to think. Goku is usually so full of energy, no matter what. Now, here he was, a worn out shell of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Goku didn't quite understand why he was feeling this way himself. Was it something he ate? Was it something he didn't eat? It boggled the boy's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt a sharp pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" The pain continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma was perplexed. Why was Goku wincimg and crying out of pain. Had he fractured a bone or pulled a muscle? However, what she saw next was unbelievable.  Slowly but surely, Goku was shrinking. Not only that, but it also seemed he was getting younger, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was unsure of what was going on. He was feeling every part of his body shrink at a consistently slow rate, but it was enough to make him panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma and Oolong just stood and watched, still deeply frozen in shock. They had no clue why or how this was happening, and thus were powerless to stop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hoku's regression stopped at age.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kirito was off on a special business trip, and Asuna decided to keep Suguha company for the trip. This was a way of showing how strong her love was. Besides, her and Suguha needed to bond together. Asuna had always felt a distance between them, probably because she loved Kirito so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna got out of the taxi, taking out her multiple suitcases with much ease. She had a total of 4 items, but she made it look easy. Suguha was in her room, looking through the transparent curtains at Asuna with an evil grin. She hated the idea of Asuna coming over for a full two weeks; first she stole her brother and now she has to share her home. All the angry emotions were running through her head, until Asuna rung the door. Suguha immediately came out of her trance stressed. She rushed for the door, reminding herself to keep her cool. She took a deep breath and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Asuna! How was your taxi? Let me take your bags!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna seemed concerned. \"Suguha, are you alright? You seem stressed. You don't have to worry about my stay. I can take most of my bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha was annoyed; not only could she not contain her emotions, but this lousy girlfriend talked down to her. \"Ok, sorry. I just wanted to make this week perfect. Let me show you to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna did something unexpected though. She snugly hugged Suguha after she finished \"Thank you for the hospitality.\" The hug was suspended there until things suddenly got awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuhuha nervously said \"Um.. Asuna, maybe we should get you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna suddenly struck back to reality \"Yes, sorry about that. Just the mother in me, so used to taking care of Yui. I guess I see you as my daughter as well. Habit I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha was getting more annoyed \"Haha, right this way.\" She showed her to a private room, There was slow cold walk to the bedroom door. \"Here's the room, I'll go make some dinner in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha was gone before, Asuna could thank her. She felt isolation, but she was determined to resolve it. While Asuna unpacked her luggage, Suguha prepared dinner with a little surprise. She had made an age regression potion in ALO. and prepared to use it for dinner. However, she was going to make an act instead of deceive Asuna. She figured an act would suit more since Asuna seemed so willing to make her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha simply cooked a prepared meal, mashed potatoes and chicken. As for the potion, she poured in a one of the many baby bottles she bought. Luckily the liquid was white like milk. She microwaved it in the oven, and Asuna fortunately came out during the microwaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna motherly asked \"Hey there, how are you doing? You still seem nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha gave a deep breath, \"You're right. I've been keeping a secret for a long time and I hope you can understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna gave a response without knowing what it entailed \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe microwave then beeped, indicating that the baby bottle was done heating. Suguha nervously said \"Well...\" and pulled out the baby bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna paused \"Wha.. whats this all about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha hesitates \"R-roleplay. Baby roleplay. I haven't told anyone about this, and I've been nervous about telling you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna eventually smiled, \"Ok, I'm willing to do whatever makes you happy. This might be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha clapped her hands with false glee and pulled out a big high chair from a nearby closet. It was pink with flower stickers on it. Upon seeing the high chair, Asuna gulped. If matters couldn't get worse, Suguha started acting like a mommy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted Asuna's butt, \"Ahh, good girl. You're all cleany weany.\" Asuna blushed, but tried to smile. Suguha saw her false smile and said \"Good girl, let me help get you situated.\" She picked up Asuna by the waist with surprising strength. Asuna was red in the cheeks, until she felt the cold high chair seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna quietly asked \"Don't you think this is a bit much?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha ignored Asuna and put in the warm baby bottle in Asuna's mouth. Asuna couldn't resist the bottle, the taste was delicious. Everything seemed to change though while she drank it, and she couldn't exactly tell what it was. The bottle was soon too heavy to hold and a huge Suguha took it. The size difference never hit her mind, since she could feel more cloth covering her. Colors suddenly jumped out at her. As her blouse closed in on her, darkness surrounded her. Normally, the darkness didn't scare Asuna, but her emotionality had increased. Combined with the pressure of cloth, she did what many babies would do in her situation, cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha reached down and picked up a now 1 year old Asuna. Asuna's hair was much shorter, she was plump with baby fat, and being rapped in her old pink blouse. Asuna still was crying, just this time it was because of the blinding light. Suguha knew what to do though. She cooed at Asuna \"Shh.. its alright. Is a little wittle baby Asuna cwanky? Its ok, Mommy is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna stopped crying and looked at Suguha with surprise and confusion. Suguha then took this motion to spread more doubt. \"You want your baba? Well here it is, don't you worry little girly.\" Suguha took the same baby bottle and started feeding it to Asuna. Asuna was fixated on the bottle once more, but this time her size stayed the same. Instead, her emotional-ness increased and after finishing the bottle, she was as mentally unstable as a 1 year old baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna still had her memory, but certain baby habits were impossible to break now. Suguha asked, \"Good girl! Now do you want to let mommy change your diaper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna felt emotional warmth at the term 'mommy' and 'diaper'\" She cheered like the new little infant she was 'Yay! Haha! Mommy chwange!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha smirked, \"then let me show you to your real room.\" The room across from Asuna's first guest room, was filled with pink, white, and red baby attire. Her bed was intentionally designed in white and red, to remind her of SAO. The room was completely pink though, with common baby accessories like stuffed animals and baby blocks. The changing table was light pink, and her diapers were interestingly colored white with red trim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna wanted to leave that room, she wanted to leave this house and never come back. However, she couldn't fight the instinctual baby urges. She clapped in baby glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha gave her a kiss on the forhead, and then placed her on the changing table. She lifted Asuna's chubby baby legs, applied the powder, and slid a white red diaper underneath. She then lowered the little one's flank carefully on the diaper surface; Asuna couldn't deny that the diaper felt good, it was like a pillow on her butt. Asuna smiled as her new mommy, firmly pressed the diaper straps in place. Then Suguha pilled out the cutest little pink baby t-shirt with a red heart on it. She put it on Asuna, and then took pictures of Asuna in her pink shirt and white red diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera light was scary, but not as scary as this new reality. Asuna burst into crying \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH ME WAA MOMMY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha picked her up, this time rocking her back and forth. To the outsiders view, Asuna was just an ordinary infant wanting adult attention. Suguha warmly said \"Being a mommy sure is tough. Good thing you don't have any of those habits left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna then remembered what she said earlier and angrily asked \"Waai babwy.. me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well because I want Kirito for myself, not from someone who will baby us. Now, you'll be our little baby sister. I already hacked your email and said that your going on a big trip. This IS your new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna's eyes became watery as she started to cry even louder this time. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha plucked a pacifier in her mouth, which distracted Asuna while Suguha placed her on the carpet. Then Suguha rolled in her suitcases and asked \"So, what clothes do you want to keep for babyhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, she started waving her arms and feet around, accidentally hitting Suguha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha looked a little annoyed, but quickly changed her mood. \"Looks like the baby waby, needs a nappy wappy. Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna tried to get away, but she couldn't stand. She tried crawling as fast as she could, but Suguha quickly picked her up my the waste. Asuna wanted to fidget, but it was too risky. She didn't want to fall. She let Suguha carry her to where ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha put her in the crib, wrapping Asuna with a nice comfy blanket; she put Asuna in the best position, where her head would have the most pillow comfort.. Then she removed the pacifier, allowing Asuna to cry. However, Suguha quickly countered with a lullaby. \"Rock a bye baby in the tree top, if the baby hollers the cradle will drop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna couldn't withstand the blanket, pillow, and lullaby all at once; she drifted off to sleep within seconds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a normal afternoon of club. Ritsu, Yui, Mio, and Mugi were the first in the room as always. This wasn't a surprise. Azusa said in advance at the last meeting that she'd either be arriving late or not at all for this meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui sighed \"Augh, I wish Azu-nyan was here. She's missing all these delicious pastries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio was going to respond to that, but Ritsu cut in first \"Same. These foods are one of the best parts of club!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio lost her track of thought and just said \"Yeah, agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi simply nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the door opened interrupting their conversation. It was Miss Yamanaka carrying in a new clothes rack and cute suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi girls! I have some amazing outfits for you all to try on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu didn't see the outfits quickly responded \"Can we just skip that? I'm not really in the mood today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not! These outfits are adorable! You just have to try them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio finally got a look at them first. She became a little concerned \"What's up with these outfits? They're sort of short. Don't ya think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're shorter on purpose. It goes with the theme. It's about youth and childhood. Babyhood to be more precise. Don't won't. They won't show your panties, they'll show your diapers. The diapers come with the outfit. You'll all look adorable in them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stroke of fear quickly hit Mio and she was kneeling in the corner shaking. \"no, no, no, no, no..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi turned bright red and waited for the others to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu was the first one to say something. \"ABSOLUTELY NOT! There's no way, No Way, I'm wearing that or a diaper. This is just plain crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Niss Yamanaka responded, Yui spoke up. \"It is crazy.. But, maybe it'll be fun. We don't know till we try. I'm.. willing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu glared at Yui \"Come on Yui, you can't be serious! This... THIS IS CRAZY! Why are you up to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui gave a happy somewhat aloof response \"because it may be fun. Think of how much roleplay we can do. Plus, we all have an outfit, so we're all having the same fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka then realized she forgot about Azusa's. She'd speak up, but she didn't want to ruin the momentum of Yui's argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui had a determined look in her eye and Ritsu didn't really want to challenge it. Plus, Yui did make a point about all of them being in an outfit. Rui sighed and gave a quiet response \"Fine.. but I'm not wearing it until you do, and I'm not letting Mio or Mugi see me until they change too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui gave a bright response \"That's awesome. I'll go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka lit up with enthusiasm \"Here are the outfits. Can I go with you though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui paused, giving a nervous response \"Uh.. I.. I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka lit up with enthusiasm. \"AWESOME! Now, choose your dress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui looked at the four dresses in front of her and went with the cutest one. It was a pink dress with an array of red flower designs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a perfect dress! I actually was hoping you'd pick that one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui gave a big smile and then Miss Yamanaka grabbed her hand and the suitcase and rushed Yui to the nearest bathroom. Lucky for the girls, there was one near the music room and it was a solo bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui went inside and Yamanaka followed to Yui's surprise. \"Um.. Miss Yamanaka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I'm going in of course. How else will you be comfortable? You can't give yourself a <i>diaper</i> change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui was too nervous for that and tried closing the door. \"No thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka was prepared for this and put her foot in the doorway. Then she put on her rocker alter ego. She scared Yui with it, causing her to back away from the door and go further inside the bathroom. Miss Yamanaka quickly closed the door behind her and changed back to her normal self. In a motherly tone, she smiled and said \"Now then. Let's get you changed little one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears quickly dropped from Yui's eyes. She was terrified about what was about to come. She sat on the toilet, crying her eyes out. Yamanaka was smart with her next move. She rubbed Yui's back. \"It's okay Yui. Why are you so scared? It's just a diaper change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui struggled to get her composure \"It... it... its just.. its been so long. I don't want one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it make you feel better if you knew I had a diaper change recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui nodded \"yes\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're in luck. I did early today.\" Miss Yamanaka then rolled up her yellow dress above the waist, to reveal a white fluffy diaper. Miss Yamanaka was in her own world at that moment, feeling confident that she just tricked Yui. Of course, she put that on just to deceive Yui. Then out of no where, she felt something touch her diaper. She looked down nervously to find Yui touching the diaper with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka quickly hit her hand. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui had a couple tears fall from her face. \"I just wanted to see how it felt. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. do you want to feel it to see if you want the change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui was hesitant, but replied \"Y-yes.. please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go ahead then.\" Miss Yamanaka gave a fake smile. Yui then took complete freedom, feeling every crevice. She felt the diaper straps, the bottom, the sides, and the front and back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt each spot, Yui ask \"How does this feel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka kept her patience, saying overly positive words, such as \"Great\" and \"Amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Yui was convinced and said \"Alright then, you can change my diaper. But can you first look away while I change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Miss Yamanaka could count to 60, Yui was all naked except for her bra. \"Okay, you can turn around now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka turned around. She was a little phased, but otherwise fine. \"Awesome dear. Now, let me put down this mat, so it feels good.\" After that was done, she signaled Yui to lay down. \"Okay, this is gonna tickle for a bit.\" She then got out a baby powder bottle from the suitcase and raised Yui's legs. With surprising strength, she held Yui's legs while spreading baby powder. Yui giggled throughout the process. Then Miss Yamanaka laid the diaper underneath, folded it in, and the changing was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there, that wasn't so bad now was it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. Thanks for convincing me to try it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem dear. Now, put on this dress and your complete.\" Yui did as instructed, looking at the long mirror after she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, I look so adorable. Thanks Miss Yamanaka for making these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome dear. So, let's show your friends and get Ritsu shall we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two left the bathroom quietly, leaving the mat inside for the next girl. Less than a minute later, Miss Yamanaka opened the door and followed by Yui. Mugi and Ritsu were flabbergasted. Mio was still huddled in the corner due to fear. Mugi was speechless, but Ritsu spoke for her. \"YUI ARE YOU CRAZY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui responded with her usual carefree oblivious attitude \"No why? Do you want me to be? I can though.\" Then Yui started acting like an ape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu was amazed at how much her friend was fine with the protruding diaper. If Yui responded that way to the question, then it was best not asking another. She realized this meant, she'd actually have to do it. Part of her was hoping Yui would just come back in her school uniform, protesting to the new outfit. But no.. here she was in a pink dress with a visible diaper, acting like an ape. She had no shame at all. Ritsu sighed, realizing she'd do have to dress up like this. \"You can stop Yui...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui stopped and noticed her friend's dismay \"What's the matter Ritsu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu was angered at her friends obliviousness, but she simply responded. \"Just nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui smiled \"Don't be. It's tons of fun. I was nervous, but look at me now! I'm enjoying it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ritsu slowly walked to the dress rack, trying to find the least embarrassing outfit. She didn't realize that one was missing for Azusa. Her mind was elsewhere at the moment. The one that was least embarrassing to her was a light blue dress with white clouds spread across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka spoke up \"Oooo, I guested right. I thought you'd pick that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui was also cheering. Ritsu ignored both of them, walking to the room exit with an annoyed expression. She was sorta hunched over \"Let's just get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had got herself in a trap by agreeing to these terms before hand. Perhaps, taking that risky deal wasn't the best idea. She walked to the bathroom without really paying attention to Miss Yamanaka. She walked into the bathroom completely and soon realized... Miss Yamanaka was in there too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her brain started working and she spoke up \"WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka took a different approach with Ritsu. Scare tactics or relate-ability wouldn't work on her. In a kind voice, she said \"I came in dear to give you a <i>diaper</i> change and don't you think about yelling again. If you do, people will come upstairs and I'll tell them that I'm helping you in the bathroom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu was terrorized at that possibility, shaking in fear. This teacher just duped her. She could try to test her teacher. But her teacher had a determined look. Plus, she already failed at guessing what would happen with Yui. Her odds were zilch. This was gonna happen, and there wasn't much she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka let the reality hit her for a bit and then she started patting her back. \"It's okay. I laid a mat here for you in advance. This will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sad expression, Ritsu laid on the mat, taking deep breaths. She was thinking to herself \"okay, let's just get this over with lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka just smiled \"Good girl. Now, let's get situated. I assume you laid down without taking off your clothes, because you want me to undress you and <i>diaper</i> change you. That's alright with me. This will be extremely fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reality just hit her even harder. Great, her quickness to get this over with led to this. What more, she didn't really have the resolve to challenge Miss Yamanaka. She just laid there and let reality have its way with her. All things considered, Miss Yamanaka was really good at this. Ritsu's socks and shoes were off within seconds. She then lifted up Ritsu's legs, gently removing her panties. Then she unbuttoned Ritsu's uniforms, propped her back up, and removed the clothing, leaving Ritsu naked with just her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka then held Ritsu's legs again and powerfully applied baby powder. She finished the rest of the changing quickly, putting the diaper underneath and strapping it in place. The energy and speed she put into the diaper changing itself mirrored Ritsu's drum playing. Lastly, Miss Yamanaka stood Ritsu up and put on the light blue dress. Ritsu looked at her reflection in the mirror. She was dumbfounded. Everything she was wearing was so childish, so <i>babylike</i>. She really wanted to cry, but something hit her... literally. Miss Yamanaka had noticed her displeasure, and pat the backside of Ritsu's Diaper. Ritsu felt something oddly nice for a brief second. Ritsu spoke up for once, pretty confidently \"What was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why that? That was just me hitting your diaper. You may have felt the diaper press harder for a second there. Sorry I hit you. It's just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu cut her off. \"Wait a minute lady. I need to see something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka just smiled, predicting Ritsu's next response. Ritsu sat on the toilet seat and quickly said \"Awwwwww... that feels nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka was overcome with joy at the sight of Ritsu liking the diaper. She then hugged Ritsu. Ritsu's reaction to the hug was similar \"AHhhhhh, that feels even nicer! What is this dress made out of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's baby wool. Super soft for the sensitive skin of a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu started pressing the dress up against her. \"AHhhhhh that would explain it. I could totally play drums in this stuff. It's soo warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka then grabbed Ritsu's hands, showing her to the mirror again. \"What do you think of the look though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks... it looks adorable. I look adorable in it. Admittedly though, this is pretty embarrassing to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer adviser spoke up \"But does their point of view really matter. You've worn a lot of things Mio thought were embarrassing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, good point.\" This was the first time Ritsu smiled since seeing herself in the mirror. \"Ya know... it doesn't look half bad. A little bulgy all around, but they'll never see that. I kinda dig this now that I really think about it.\" Ritsu then hugged Miss Yamanaka \"Thanks for making it Miss Yamanaka. Sorry I judged it too soon. That's Mio's job, not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's completely alright. But will you be alright in there though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh.. yeah. Eh, Mio will be wearing this soon anyways and I can take pictures of her if she takes pictures of me. Plus, I got so many more pictures of her anyhow. I'm probably good. Plus, this gives me and Yui some time to play together, since wardrobes taking up so much time today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're feeling alright. Now, let's head back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K. sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka left the mat in like before. This was going by better than she expected. Ritsu was going to be one of the hardest, and that work was already over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu and Yamanaka came into the band room. Unlike Yui's entrance, Ritsu came in first. Once the door was closed, Ritsu kinda announced herself with a proud gesture \"And the adorable Ritsu is here at last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui quickly ran up to her \"D'awwww. You look adorable! I told you this was fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, yea.. you were right. You look adorable too. Let's goof off. This is gonna likely take up a lot of club time anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui smiled \"YAY! I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they continued, Ritsu told Mugi \"Hey Mugi, you totally should go next, since Mio over there is still freaking. And Trust me! It is more fun wearing this than it looks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them started playing around the couch. Meanwhile, Mugi nervously stood up, moving to the clothes dresser. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at the dresses, Mugi only saw two. That was weird. She thought to herself \"What about Azusa's?\" Then she corrected her thoughts \"She said she might not be in today. Miss Yamanaka probably came with that in mind.\" So, Mugi didn't say anything and instead judged the remaining dresses. One was light green and the other was lavender. Green was her favorite color. To top it off, the green dress had adorable blonde flower designs all over it. Spring was her favorite season. This dress was perfect for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fair amount of confidence, she said \"I'll take this dress.\" Ritsu's talk gave Mugi a sense of confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka screamed with enthusiasm \"YES! I knew you'd like that one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka opened the door for Mugi and led her to the bathroom. Mugi opened the door and was surprised by the mat on the ground. \"Uh, what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't good. Miss Yamanaka had to come up with an improve plan. Then it hit her. She knew what to do. \"What mat? Let me in dear, so I can see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi did as instructed and let her adviser in. Once Miss Yamanaka was in the bathroom, she closed the door. \"Oh yes, that mat is for your <i>diaper</i> change of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi was surprised and terrified. She sat on the toilet like Yui, thinking to herself what to do. Then she asked somewhat naively \"Did.. did you say... diaper change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka simply smiled \"Why yes dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis terrified Mugi yet again, and she went back to thinking up a way to leave. About a minute or two passed by and she asked \"Could.. could I put it on by myself? Please, I'll pay you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka chuckled to herself. \"Sorry, but the answers no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi went back to her inner world. However, this time Miss Yamanaka interrupted. \"Is everything alright dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi gave a very timid response \"N-no. I'm sorry. But I-I really don't feel comfortable with you changing my diaper. I hope you can understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, but I was more so going to do it for your benefit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my benefit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You see, both your friends were completely alright with it. In fact, they both enjoyed the change. This would give you something to relate to them on. Additionally, wasn't youth a blast. Didn't you love getting diaper changes when you were little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi went red in the face after Miss Yamanaka's response. \"Oh, that sounds... nice. If they liked it, maybe... maybe I should at least give it a shot. As for what I remember back then. I have very little memory of that time. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I'm willing to take this as slow as you like. I can tell that you're nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I appreciate that. \"Some seconds went by and then Mugi realized what to do. \"Sorry about the hold up. I'll change my clothes. Can you just look away first? I'm a little nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Remember, take your time. No rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi smiled in response and within several minutes, she was ready for a diaper changing. \"Alright, you can look now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka turned around slowly. \"So, just lay down here and I'll make this a fun experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi smiled \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi laid down with a confident expression. \"I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, little one.\" Miss Yamanaka slowly held Mugi's legs, waiting for just the right moment. Once it came, she picked up Mugi's legs with one arm and reached for the baby powder. With a couple hits, the baby powder stage was done. \"Powdering is all done. You were very cooperative.\" Then Miss Yamanaka slid a diaper underneath and slowly lowered Mugi's legs. Lastly, she strapped everything in and the changing was complete. \"There there. We're all done. Stand up now, so we can get the dress on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi smiled, happy the changing was over. She calmly put on the dress herself. She looked at herself in the mirror. \"I look.. so... nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned around and said \"Thank you\" to Miss Yamanaka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you. You were so polite during you're diaper changing. Your cooperation is unmatched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now, let's show them how I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka thought to herself. \"Mugi's changing was so easy compared to Yui's and Ritsu's. Only one left; Mio. I wonder how her's will go. Whatever the matter, this is some of my greatest work yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked back to the room. Miss Yamanaka entered and then Mugi. Everyone in the room was a little distracted. Mio was still in the corner and Ritsu and Yui were distracted playing with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were staring at each other confidently with their thumbs in their mouth, seeing who could keep there's in the longest. Mugi was patient and she came nearby and knelt down. \"Hi guys, I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them tilted their heads. Yui let out her thumb first. \"D'awwww Mugi. You look so cute. That color really works for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that conversation was going on, Ritsu was gloating \"Oh yea! I won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mugi looked at her and Ritsu said \"Hi there Mugi. You look cute. Did you enjoy it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely yes. Thank you for asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet. Only one more left.\" Ritsu then stood up and yelled \"Mio! It's your turn now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio didn't respond, so Ritsu motioned the others to come with her. The three of them went up to Mio and each poked her at the same time. Mio turned around in curiosity and was dumbfounded at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... all of you.... did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu said cockily \"Yeah huh. Speaking of that. It's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio turned pale again. \"No! I'm not doing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu egged her on \"Come on! What are ya? A crybaby? Hahahahaha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio stood up in protest, now towering over the knelled down Ritsu. \"I'm not a crybaby. Are you even one to talk? You're wearing a <i>diaper</i>. You know that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutsi stood up in retaliation \"So what? It feels nice. You wouldn't know. Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio facepalmed \"That's not the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi and Yui then stood up. Yui said \"Trust me Mio. This is tons of fun. You just have to open up to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two both said \"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio sighed \"Fine... I'll do it.\"</span></div></div>",

How come I don't get to pick mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka quickly perked up. \"Sorry about that Mio. I-I only brought four, because Azusa said she'd probably not come. I can't make a dozen of these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio sighed \"Augh, that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio's friends surrounded her, giving her their commentary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu said \"Come on Mio! That dress will look pretty good on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui agreed \"Ritsu's right Mio. This dress is totally awesome for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree\" Mugi responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio pulled it from the rack to get a better look. It was a lavender dress with dark purple flowers. The colors spoke to her, but she didn't want to give away her thoughts. She pulled it out. \"Yeah, it's a nice dress. Let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were surprised she didn't like it. But Miss Yamanaka could tell Mio was lying. There was something in Mio's expression as she walked out that showed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka walked Mio to the bathroom. As they were outside, Mio said \"This is enough. I'll handle the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K, everything's inside for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio nodded \"Thank you, I guess.\" She walked in and quickly saw the mat. Her curiosity was spiked. To top it off, there were no diapers in here. \"Hey Miss Yamanaka, what's going on? There's a mat and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka cut her off, saying \"Oh yes. That one sec!\" She also bolted into the bathroom, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio was suspicious of Miss Yamanaka, but in the heat of the moment, she couldn't do anything. After being cut off, she didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to know where the diapers were? I realized they weren't inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you come in? You could have just handed them to me out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? In the open? What if someone saw them? You'd be embarrassed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're far from any classes. It wouldn't have been that bad. Also, what's with this mat. Come to think of it.. it looks like a baby mat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka was frustrated. It wasn't long and Mio was going to guess everything. All she could do now is get in between the door and Mio. So, that's what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you need a baby mat? Wait.. No. Come on. Please don't tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka responded quickly \"It's for your <i>diaper</i> change. Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio protested in an emotional outburst \"I-I can't. I won't!\" Then she sat on the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn't do. Miss Yamanaka's only hope was to break her resolve. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm not a BABY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka towered over her. \"SO?! This is an outfit for having fun! You don't have to be a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said it yourself that the dresses represent youth and babyhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha.. What about your friends then? They are wearing them and they're fine. Ritsu's loving hers. Are you insulting your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they just.. I don't know why they agreed. And Ritsu's just not thinking straight. It's not meant as an insult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mio, your friends let me give each of them a diaper change. Why not you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio thought to herself \"Really? What did she do to convince them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka spoke up again. \"You know I think I know why you won't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're afraid of being a baby again, or even treated like one. You're scared now. I bet you were more frightened as baby. That's why you're doing this. You're afraid Ritsu will frighten you even more with this outfit on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words hurt hard. Mio started to cry, but tried to hesitate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you hesitating Mio? Cry. Let your youth shine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio didn't know what went over her, but she did as instructed, letting out all the tears she could. While crying, she stopped paying attention to her surroundings. Miss Yamanaka got her opening then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mio cried, Yamanaka removed Mio's uniform, both the shirt and skirt, followed by Mio's panties. Then she laid Mio on the mat and removed her socks and shoes. There, Mio was completely naked except for her bra. On the ground, Mio's cries blurred her vision. The shining bathroom lights didn't help either. Meanwhile, Miss Yamanaka lifted Mio's legs and proceeded as quickly as she could with the changing. She applied the powder, slid a diaper underneath, and strapped the diaper in place. After completing it, Yamanaka took a deep breath. The heavy lifting was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helped Mio onto her feet and said. \"There there. I just finished your <i>diaper</i> change.\" Then she rubbed Mio's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio stared at herself in the mirror and started to cry harder. \"Noo.. you had to change me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't working though. The girl still had cries in her. Miss Yamanaka was lost on what to do, and then the idea hit her. \"Give her a pacifier. The soothes babies' cries.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden, something interrupted her cries. Her cries oddly stopped. Mio looked down to see the culprit. It was just a purple loop. Then she looked in the mirror and freaked. She thought \"A PACIFIER!\" Then she realized she wasn't crying and thought to herself \"Why aren't I crying more? Do I <i>like</i> the pacifier? If I like the pacifier, then.. then a part of me is a baby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka saw the panic in Mio's eyes and comforted her. \"It's alright Mio. Pacifiers are meant to do this. They're suppose to calm you. I recommend you keep that pacifier in and you'll never cry. You'll overcome you're fears somewhat with it. Plus, it goes great with your outfit. Speaking of which! Be still!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka then put the purple dress over Mio, and the costume was completely on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look adorable!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio was shy, and pulled out the pacifier for only a second \"Can I use this pacifier for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use it to your hearts content darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio nodded and then followed Miss Yamanaka to the room. Miss Yamanaka opened the room first, giving an announcement \"The bassist of the Light Music Club! Mio!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu, Yui, and Mugi all waited with suspense. Mio didn't want to come. So, Miss Yamanaka yanked her in. \"Here she is. Wearing her purple dress and diaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui and Mugi complimented her and Mio only nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu on the other hand was surprised she came in with a pacifier. She laughed in response \"Don't forget her purple <i>pacifier</i> Miss Yamanaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes that. Thanks Ritsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui and Mugi became curious about that too, but the three were even more surprised that Mio didn't react. Ritsu asked \"What gives? Why aren't you freaking out as usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio closed her eyes for a second, reopened them and pulled out the pacifier for a brief moment. \"I didn't react, because this pacifier helps me control my emotions.\" She quickly put the pacifier back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu hammered \"So that's it... Could you give me that pacifier real quick? I wanna try.\" (Obviously, she just wanted to mess with Mio)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Miss Yamanaka didn't give the right response. \"No need to take hers. You each have your own. Here you all go.\" She gave out the pacifiers, which was pretty frustrating for Ritsu. Now, she had to actually try this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her and the rest surprise, these pacifiers were a lot of fun. Ritsu and Yui loved the feel of the pacifier, even if Ritsu wouldn't admit it. Mugi just liked the pacifier, because it made her feel like one of the group. Additionally, it made her feel more innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes passed by and the four of them were in their normal seats, wearing baby dresses, diapers, and sucking on pacifiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beginning to get awkward, so Miss Yamanaka left some instructions and left. \"Girls, remember those costumes are just costumes. Still, if you enjoy the roleplay, I have tons of baby things in that suitcase. I also have plenty of diapers, in case anyone of you makes a messy wessy.\" The girls blushed and looked at each other. Then Mio removed her pacifier and said \"We're good. Thanks Miss Yamanaka. We'll behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Yamanaka left and about 30 minutes passed before Azusa entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio let out a sigh, thinking \"Why did I think she'd say something different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Mio asked \"What do you all want to do for the remainder of club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu responded \"Let's just be adorable for the remainder. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi and Yui both responded \"Yea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio just stayed quiet for a little bit. She was annoyed asking questions with silly answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu then yelled \"Let's look in that suitcase of hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest followed. Mio just watched though. Ritsu and Yui found rattles for both of them and had a pacifier sucking rattle contest. Mugi just snuggled with a stuffed doggy and Mio just watched with her pacifier in her mouth. The four carried on like this until Azusa walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings started getting creepy once Azusa entered the room. She knocked and came in timidly. Mio removed her pacifier briefly to say \"Come in Azusa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething seemed off about them. Azusa started to get more scared the further she walked. Once she could see what they wearing and more importantly underneath, she freaked. \"WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu took her pacifier out, but kept shaking her rattle. \"We're having fun. Can't you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With baby stuff? Aren't you all, ya know, a little too old for this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi responded \"Yea, but Miss Yamanaka gave us these clothes. Then we just started having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui removed her pacifier, also shaking her pacifier \"Yea Azu-nyan. This is so much fun! If you wanna join us, we have fresh diapers over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa seemed even more scared \"Listen, I don't know what those outfits are doing to you guys, but it's not good. You guys are acting like babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis response caused the three who were talking to wail! \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! She called us babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu yelled \"Quick! Let's put in our pacifiers. Make the pain go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach put their pacifiers back in and Azusa was without words. \"Why are you all acting this way? Mio-senpai please talk some sense into them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio wasn't responding, because a pacifier was in her mouth. So, Azusa pulled out her pacifier. BAD IDEA! Mio immediately started crying. \"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! I want my pacifier back!\" Azusa didn't know what to do other than to pluck the pacifier back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio calmed down, Azusa started to cry. All her club friends were somehow reduced to babies! Her tears could be felt around the table and the rest started to cry, losing concentration of their pacifiers. Their pacifiers fell out and each one wailed. Little did Azusa know, they were actually regressing because they had nothing to \"stabilize\" them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for about a minute. Surprisingly, each one of them stopped around the same time, when each one of them at age 1. Depending on their birthdays, some were older than the others by a couple months. Their diapers and dresses shrank with them. However, their bras disappeared. Strangely enough, at this age their emotionality was replaced with babylike curiosity. Don't be fooled though, they still were attached to baby items. Additionally, they got a hold of their minds. For some reason, they couldn't before the regression. It's like they cried away all their pent up anxiety from being older, carrying some baby traits and retaining their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa realized they regressed, but it was too late at that point. \"WHAT IS... GOING ON?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Azusa's frustrated question ringed throughout the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity suddenly hit all the babified club members. Ritsu and Yui were looking at their surroundings. They now only could see inside the desks and their bodies were all chubby. Both of them couldn't see their friends on the other end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio quickly asked Azusa why she raised her voice. Meanwhile, Mugi looked at Mio and realized she was an infant. Mugi didn't know what to do. So, she just gave Mio the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio asked in an adorably high pitched voice \"Wha da matta Awu-?\" Mio cut herself off with her hands after hearing her new voice. Then she looked at her hands in shaking fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waa-wha gowin ona? I sownd younga an me hand-sa aw so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu then raised her voice \"Wha?! Da cwazy! I so short nowa. Wha-Wha gowin ONA?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui followed \"I tink yowa baby nowa. You wook wike one-na.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stroke a fear came over Ritsu and she turned to Yui. There was a brief pause \"Y-y-yui yowa baby too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi then spoke up \"I-I tink we aww aw babies. Mio isa baby too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio was frightened and looked at Mugi \"Wha yowa mea-?\" Within seconds later, reality finally hit the four club members. They did the only think they thought about doing. They all cried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa was paralyzed with fear as they talked. However, she soon realized that they were thinking more rationally. It was sorta late though, because they were balling their eyes out <i>again</i>. Then Azusa remembered what Ritsu said earlier. She said minutes ago \"Quick! Let's put in our pacifiers. Make the pain go away!\" So, Azusa's only thought was to put the pacifiers back in their mouths. Hopefully, they would stop crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, Azusa plucked pacifiers into each of them. Then she lifted them up one by one, placing them on the floor where they could see each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen. I don't know what happened to you all, but we have to think if we wanna get out of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends had gained their composure, nodding after Azusa finished. So, Azusa gave a sigh and let out their pacifiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui was the first to talk \"Haha, tanks Awusa. We aw younga one-sa now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu and Mio were irritated, yelling \"Yui!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui's response was a simple \"Wha? Wha I do?\" That was their Yui, as clueless as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu spoke up \"Why aw yowa so waid back abow dis? We aw BABIES! Dis can't be happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio had it with Ritsu's attitude \"Ya bewin too hawsh. Weave her awone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi added \"Yes. Pwease Wiitsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu protested \"Nwo! If wa-went fa ha, we no be in dis mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui started to tear up \"I sowwy.. Wiitsu, pwease forgwive me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui reached for a hug and Ritsu reluctantly allowed it. \"K.. I forgwive Yui. I'm stiw angwy at Mwis Yaaamanaaaka tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio went on the offensive \"Why? Yowa wet her chwanga yowa. Den yowa wa enjoywin ya self. If anwybowy deswerves dis, it yowa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu was on the verge of temper tantrum after Mio's speech. Tears formed around her eyes and she started hitting Mio, while saying \"She forwaced me! Forwaced me! Don inswult me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu still had a fair amount of force for an infant, and her hits really hurt. Mio didn't know what to do besides cry. Her cries caused Mugi and Yui to also cry. Then, Ritsu felt guilty. She tried saying \"Sowwy,\" but Mio wasn't paying attention. This caused her to cry as well. Azusa was getting irritated by this, and put their pacifiers in again. \"Now, be nice. We have to stick together through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed the pacifiers and spoke to Mio and Ritsu. \"You two, apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio spoke up \"Bu-bu-bu she hit me! An befowa dis, she made fun of ma pacifiwa. She's a meany-head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu started getting sad, while she spoke. Azusa spoke for Ritsu \"It's okay Mio. I understand. But you know what friends do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio blushed and was about to say sorry, but Ritsu followed first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I sowwy Mio. I wa bewin a meany befowa. Ca yowa forgwive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio hugged Ritsu in response \"Sur-wa. I sowwy too. Miss Yaaaaamaaanaaka twicked all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu nodded, and the two of them hugged. Yui and Mugi joined in and it was one nice hug. Azusa was overcome with cuteness and took a picture for keepsake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu and Mio became angered by the picture. \"No pictwa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa grumbled \"Fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Azusa joined in. It was one nice hug, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed and each of them stopped. Once they were all finished, Azusa said \"So... we need to come up with a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu spoke up adorably \"Wet's get Yaaamaaanaakaa and deman aw ages back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa interrupted that thought \"I'd love to do that Ritsu, but I have no idea where she is and I can't really leave any of you alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio and Mugi paused to think. Yui removed her pacifier and said \"K.\" Ritsu wasn't happy though \"Surwa we caan? We be gwo nups. We nee no hwelp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa giggled \"Sure you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu was livid \"Stop tweatwin us wike babies. We aw older den you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ritsu, I understand that you all are retaining your memories and intelligence, but it's not that simple. You all are much more sensitive then usual, and you've been getting into fights left and right. Plus, what do I do if one of you has an <i>accident</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu puckered up \"An accidwent?! We won-ta. We aw not babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then prove to me you all can go to the bathroom on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu \"Fine. I go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu tried standing up, but she lost her balance and hit her butt real hard. \"Owa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa and the other babies just watched in awe as Ritsu kept trying to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgwet it. I no need to wawk. Cwawin wiw be fine.\" Eventually Ritsu got to the door. Unfortunately, the door nob was too far up. She kept trying to reach it to no avail. With each try, she fell on her butt. A couple minutes passed before Ritsu gave up. Though, she was quite loud with her forfeit. \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa rushed over, kneeling down and giving Ritsu her pacifier. However, Ritsu wouldn't take it. She just said \"No! No! Nooooo! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't good. Azusa's fool proof plan failed. She panicked \"What should I do? What should I do?\" Then it hit her. Cradle her! She quickly picked up baby Ritsu, held her firmly in the waist, and rocked back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu's wails turned to quiet tears and then silence. Something about the motion just relaxed her. Before Azusa knew it, Ritsu was dozing off in Azusa's arms and sucking on her right thumb. Azusa's heart melted at how adorable Baby Ritsu was. Still, she couldn't keep Ritsu in her arms forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Azusa whispered \"Do you girls know of anything comfortable for Ritsu to lay in. I can't keep her in my arm forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio responded \"Twy da suootcase. Maybe she gab us sometin nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa walked over to the large pink suitcase and rummaged through it with one arm. Eventually, she found something that looked folded up. It was... a four baby stroller. Two on the bottom, two on the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa softly asked \"Where did all this stuff come from by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui spoke up \"Miss Yaaaamaaanaaakaa bwought dem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was becoming more and more suspicious. Azusa thought \"Why would Miss Yamanaka prepare for something this specific? Even more so, why would she want to regress them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnywho, Azusa softly laid Ritsu in the top and asked \"I'm taking you all to my place for the night. Miss Yamanaka is no where in sight and I'm the only person around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui asked \"So, yowa be aw mama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, just for tonight, but yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three babies cheered \"Yay!\" (Mugi removed her pacifier for this)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa didn't know how to respond, so she just smiled. \"K, so who's next\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui raised her chubby hands. \"Oooo... Me! Me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was running smoothly, but as Azusa lifted Yui, she hurt a splat and then a smelly diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing she knew, Yui was crying, which made Mio and Mugi cry and Ritsu wake up. Ritsu then proceeded to cry. \"Augh, calm down please.\" Then Azusa gave them their pacifiers and the cries stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa sighed, \"It's okay little ones. This happens.\" She then got a fresh diaper, the baby mat, and baby powder and changed Yui's diaper. This was one of the most mortifying thing Azusa had ever experienced. Still, there was something adorable about it. Soon enough, the changing was complete. \"Good girl. Mommy Azusa appreciates you're cooperation.\" Azusa paused. That all came out sorta uncensored. Yui didn't mind though. She liked it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanks mommy Awusa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. It's all in my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa then strapped her in the top seat with Ritsu, followed by Mio and Mugi in the bottom. She gave each of them their favorite toy. Rattles for Yui and Ritsu and stuffed animals for Mugi and Mio. A stuffed doggy for Mugi and a stuffed rabbit for Mio. Lastly, Azusa prepared a baby bag, filling it with tons of diapers, baby powder, and baby bottles. There wasn't everything else left in the suitcase. Azusa had emptied it completely. For precaution, she hit their guitars and the suitcase, so no one knew what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Azusa went back to the stroller, all of them were fast asleep. She thought \"they must have had an action packed day. I hope I can do this.\" She took Ritsu's camera and took a picture without flash. It would look adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew a crazy packed evening laid ahead. Being a mother for just 30 minutes was tough. How would it be for a full night? Not to mention, it was Friday. Her odds of running into Miss Yamanaka were slim and she'd probably have to find another cure. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Azusa thought to herself 'First things first, I'm going to need to get a crib and more diapers. Great.. how am I gonna do all this?\" Then it hit her! \"One of their phones probably has Miss Yamanaka's number.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly checked their bags and, to her surprise, their uniforms had shrunk. 'That's weird. Hopefully, their phones didn't shrink.' After a minute or two of rifling, she found each of their cell phones as normal. 'Mio probably has her number.' Sure enough she had Miss Yamanaka's number. She took a pause before calling. 'This is probably gonna wake them up, and I really should change them into their uniforms. It's too cold out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, starting with Mio, Azusa changed their clothes. As she changed Mio, the little baby said in her sleep \"tanks Mommy.\" Similar things happened with the other three. She hoped they wouldn't call her that when they woke up. She always thought of them as being immature for their age, but acting like she is their mommy was a stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished, she buckled each of them back into the stroller. They all looked adorable, with their school skirts hardly hiding their diapers and little baby socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon or later, she snapped out of starring at them and called Miss Yamanaka. She reminded herself as the phone was ringing to stay quiet for the babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Miss Yamanaka picked up the phone. \"Hi Mio, how's the outfit treating you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa started with a loud whisper \"Miss Yamanaka, it's Azusa. I need you're help. They all turned into babies and I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'awwwwww, so, my plan actually worked! Splendid! I'll send the cribs and remaining supplies to your house then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-whats going on? I don't understand. Why'd you do this? And I can't do this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did this, because those four are always acting so immature and they constantly act like I'm old. So, in a fitting twist, I made them as immature as they come off; babies. And I won't help you. This is something you'll have to do on your own. No calling friends for help. Or else I quit as club adviser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me? Why can't I get help? And why would you do this? Doesn't it mean the club is cancelled already. They can't play if they're babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I picked you and only you, because it gives an air of authority to you. This regression will only last a week, while school is out. Once it's over, they'll remember everything you did and treat you with more respect. Remembering that you changed their diapers, will put a different spin on things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa was getting mad and unintentionally raising her voice \"What about their families? What about my family?\" The babies were faintly waking up after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already covered. I talked with each of their families about a Summer camp. I also convinced you're parents that you're responsible to stay home alone. If you need anything, just holler! CYA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa started yelling \"NO! DON'T GO! I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished yelling, Azusa heard the babies cry. They had dropped their pacifiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\"<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\"<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\"<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.. Please don't cry. I'm sorry I didn't mean to yell. It's just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa's voice wasn't working and she couldn't cradle them all at the same time. She then got a new idea. Play her guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out her guitar and started playing \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she finished playing, they had all calmed down. Unfortunately, they were still awake. Azusa wanted them to get to sleep so it would be easier on her, but something about trying to make them fall asleep seemed too manipulative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Azusa put away her guitar, the babies started talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui started \"Tanks Mommy Awu-nywan, I feewl gwate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu responded \"Seriwoswy, Yuwi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui turned her head adorably \"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu tried to do a facepalm, but her chubby hand was so small \"Da wad i fa babies. We naa babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We awn't? Bu I tot we wa. We hab diapas an we in a stwowa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu had more control of her emotions than before, but still made a fit. She folded her cute arms and said \"So... Da no mean anwywing..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui giggled, saying \"Yea i does siwwy\" and hugging Ritsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu just moaned. She still wasn't happy, but she didn't want to hurt Yui's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Mugi was clapping her hands at the performance. \"Da wa awsome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio followed up by laughing. \"Haha, ya.. tanks Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi turned to Mio, tilting her head \"Huh, why yowa say Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio got scared by the question. She covered her eyes with her chubby hands and said, in an adorably high pitched voice, \"Cu-cu-cuz, make me fweew betta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi said in response \"Ooooo.. Da souwd coowa. Wet me twy. Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mugi said it, she giggled \"Da fun. Tanks fa tewin me.\" Then she hugged Mio. That melted Mio's heart and she hugged Mugi in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa simply observed this as she put away her guitar. Both mini conversations were adorable. Still, Mio and Mugi's use of \"Mommy\" was frightning. She didn't want to be called 'mommy,' but it didn't seem right to tell Mio and Mugi otherwise. She let it slide for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K, so, little ones.. Um, I'm taking you to my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu complained \"Bu wha abou aw famwies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already covered. Long story short, they think you guys are going to Summer camp, but you'll actually be staying at my house and this baby effect only lasts a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu yelled \"A WEEK! Da wike, aw entiya bwake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. all of this is Miss Yamanaka's doing. She also wants me to look over you guys with no help or she'll quit as club adviser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi asked \"Bu why she dowin dis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because she wants to teach you guys a lesson. It sounds strange to me.\" They were talking over her after she said that. She cut them off though. \"Listen up please. I don't like this either, but we'll get through this. I'm gonna mess with your pacifiers right now, so they're attached to your necks. After that, I'm hoping you all can behave while I take you to my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio nervously asked \"Ma-mommy, wha wiw we do whe we ge da?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. Let's just take this one step at a time. I recommend you put in your pacifiers for the time being. I have no idea how much attention you'll get.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio and Mugi nodded. Yui was going to but Ritsu stopped her. \"We no wisen to yowa. We gwo nups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa just sighed and went forward. Ritsu took the silence as a victory and for the trip home, talked with Yui. \"Yuwi, wets shwake aw wattles. Da wiw te ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time, they got home, Azusa was frustrated. With the door closed and her frustration at maximum, she raised her voice at Ritsu and Yui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent down and said \"Why can't you two cooperate for once? This isn't easy on any of us, but you have to make this soo hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui instantly broke down into tears \"WAAAAAHHH! I'm sowwy. I-I... WAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa's heart melted and she picked up Yui. \"It's okay Yui-senpai. Apology accepted. You be a good girl now, Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui stopped crying and gave a timid response \"Okay..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that heartfelt moment, Ritsu threw a rattle, hitting Azusa's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa had it. \"One second girls, Ritsu-senpai needs to be taught a lesson.\" She put Yui back in the stroller, and pulled out Ritsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, wha yowa gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Azusa went into the kitchen area and saw what she was looking for; a high chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I no scawed of da.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, We'll see.\" Azusa then strapped Ritsu in and said in an authoritative voice \"Ritsu-senpai, 20 minutes. Time out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wike I care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I hear so much as a peep out of you, I'll extend you're time out another 3 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa sighed \"Suit yourself.\" She moved the high chair into a corner and said \"time out starts now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu just folded her arms. This was ridiculous! She was no baby! No one would give her a stupid timeout. She tried to turn around and see what was going on, but it was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first couple minutes, Azusa spoke to the other three babies. \"Sorry about Ritsu-senpai. In the meantime, I'll set up the playpen and some toys for the three of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi and Yui nodded. Mio said \"Yes, Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa wanted to correct her, but it wasn't necessary. Now wasn't the time though. She had to set up the playpen. While she set everything up, she heard Ritsu say \"Dis is so stoopid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's another 6 minutes Ritsu-senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-bu-bu I onwy spoke onsa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's another 3 minutes. I extended the first one, because you said a cuss word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu wanted to give a rebuttal, but was it worth it? The first 3 minutes killed her and she just extended it by 9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Azusa finished setting up the playpen and put the remaining three babies in it. Mugi and Yui started playing with the blocks. Meanwhile, Mio crawled up to Azusa and motioned her hands for a hug \"Mommy! Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa sighed \"Yes, Mio-senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ca-ca yowa cwadle me too. Yuwi and Wiitsu got a twy, bu na me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up Mio and cradled her. \"Are you all better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, tanks Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa cradled her for about four minutes and asked \"Mio-senpai, you know I'm not you're Mommy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-ah no. I jus fweel betta sayin it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becwu.. yowa so nice. Me wish yowa wa my Mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
