She attended a university that was relatively unknown (isn't that always the way?)<br>\r\nOne fine Tuesday afternoon she was wandering through campus when she spotted a flyer that caught her eye.<br>\r\n\"WANTED:<br>\r\nTest subject for experiment<br>\r\nWill Pay $10,000<br>\r\nApply to Professor Eomot in Lab A\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she thought. I could use $10,000...\"<br>\r\nShe grabbed the flyer and went to Lab A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Eomot was a tall, greying man with glasses. \"Ah, a test subject. Excellent. My stereotypically busty assistant will give you some forms to sign, and we'll strap you in.\"<br>\r\n\"Umm, what are you testing?\" Cindy asked nervously.<br>\r\n\"A teleportation device.\" The assistant handed Cindy the forms and she scribbled her name on the bottom.<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now, have a seat,\" Eomot said, gesturing to an odd-looking chair, one of a set of two. Cindy sat down and the assistant did up a bewildering array of straps and buckles. \"OK. Now. As soon as the experiment is over, you shall recieve your $10,000. Are you ready?\"<br>\r\nCindy nodded.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" He pulled a lever on the wall, the chair hummed, and Cindy jumped instantly to the other in a burst of light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eomot and his assistant stared down at her. They were huge! Cindy scrabbled to her feet. \"What... what happened?\" She gasped. \"I'm naked!\" She covered her chest with her arm and bent over.<br>\r\n\"Um. There was a bit of a mishap. A fly landed on this chair just as I activated it, and....\" He trailed off and held up a mirror in front of her.<br>\r\nCindy looked at herself. She looked normal.... wait, there were two giant wings coming out of her back!<br>\r\n\"Your DNA got scrambled with the fly's. As a result, you now have wings and the fly is human-sized,\" Eomot said as his assistant attacked the fly with a baseball bat.<br>\r\n\"What about my clothes?\" Cindy shrieked.<br>\r\n\"Evidently, the machine only works on living tissue. Look, I am sorry, but as soon as we can return you to normal size we will, and you shall recieve $20,000 afterwards as compensation. In the meanwhile, we would be interested in studying your.... condition, so will you hop in this jar?\" he said.<br>\r\nCindy took a deep breath and replied...</span></div></div>",

The doctor moved the jar causing her to lose balance and plummet down to the bottom.  The jar was placed on a table and Cindy heard a loud scraping sound of metal on glass.  She looked up and saw a lid with holes being put on the top.  The doctor then held the jar in front of his face to examine the fly sized winged girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is amazing, to think you have become nothing more than a tiny insect girl now, don't worry though...\" The doctor began to say.</span></div></div>",

I have been collecting quite an environment of... human insects for a long time now, you are my newest edition, and I must say, of them all I'm amazed by how much of your human form you have retained.\" The doctor explained as he walked out of the lab area.  Behind him his assistant was fighting with the giant fly but was gaining the upper hard, bashing the monster with a large sledge hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean you're not going to change me back! Get me out of here, Help!\" Cindy screamed in terror as she frantically beat on the sides of the jar prison.  She fluttered her new wings and began to fly around the jar but soon lost control and smashed into the lid hard.  She fell back to the bottom of the jar, the doctor laughing at the entire time as he watched her pathetic attempts to escape.  She realized it was hopeless and sat dejectedly at the bottom of the jar, tears welling up in her eyes as she feared her life as a human was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll want to get better with those if you want to survive.\" The doctor stated after his laughing fit had died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Survive, what do you mean, you're not going to kill me are you?\" Cindy replied in shock at the doctor's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, but some of my other experiments inside the habitat have a bit more animal instinct and desire than you, and well, spider's tend to enjoy the occasional fly every now and then.\" The doctor laughed sinisterly as he placed the jar atop a large empty fish tank that was filled with a habitat.  The fish tank was massive, about the size of a large van, with small trees, flowers, plants, and a deep soil surface; and even a small pond near the center.  The lid was face down atop the large habitat and Cindy tried to veer out through the holes into this terrible jungle that she would soon become a part of.  Suddenly a machine began to open the jar as a tube slid around to ensure that Cindy couldn't escape...</span></div></div>",

She was still not used to having wings, or being the size of a fly as she fell and hit a few gigantic leaves, eventually managing to stop herself atop of one.  She couldn't believe how small she was now, the leaf's surface was the size of a parking small parking lot.  She looked around the inside of the habitat, small trees and rotting logs were located all around.  She could hear movement all around, the buzzing of wings and the crunching of rotting wood, but was unable to see anything from the center of the giant leaf.  She got up and walked across the leaf until she was able to peer over the side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below she saw a half eaten hamburger that was being swarmed by what appeared to be ants.  As she looked closer she could see some human features on the ants below gathering up pieces of the hamburger.  Some had human legs or heads and varied in color between the basic red and black ant colors, while some had human colored skin tones on their insect bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How could he do this to so many people, there must be over fifty of them down there.' Cindy was shocked to see so many other people transformed by this mad scientist into insects.  She continued to watch when out of the corner of her eye she saw two larger insects moving behind a few small branches.  These insects were larger than the ants but also had human features.  She watched in horror as the two large ants rushed out from the branches to attack the ants.  Tiny screams were heard as the ants were ripped to shreds and devoured by the two monstrous insect men who had attacked.  The ants scattered but many of them were killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was shocked and appalled, tears welled in her eyes as she saw the tiny dead ants being devoured by the larger insects.  Just then she heard a noise...</span></div></div>",

Behind the pair stood his experimental stasis field generator, a machine capable of emitting a beam which, upon striking inorganic matter, would theoretically freeze it in time indefinitely. Although not fully completed, if he was able to generate enough power he might be able to create a beam powerful enough to freeze the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood, pondering this possibility, Sandra's foot came down hard on a power supply box at the base of the machine, sending sparks into the air. In the same moment, she wriggled free of her lab coat, exposing the pink tank top and jean shorts she was wearing underneath. Her tan cleavage bulged and her breasts jiggled as she swatted at the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eomot decided it was time to act. Waiting any longer would only result in more equipment getting destroyed. Wasting no time, he ran across the room and flipped the switch that would power up the machine. Seating himself at a computer a few meters from where his assistant and the fly were still struggling, he placed his hand over a mouse and clicked a button on the screen. A live view of Sandra and the fly appeared on the monitor in front of him. At the same moment, a dish shaped object extending out of the field generator swiveled to fix on the two creatures beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red dot in the center of the screen indicated where the beam would strike. Moving the mouse, Dr. Eomot swiveled the dish on the field generator until it was targeted squarely on the fly's head. At this point, the insect had again clasped Sandra, it's forelegs pulling at her tank top. For her part, Sandra was pushing desperately against the fly, ripping the fabric of her tank top in the process. As Dr. Eomot pressed the button that would fire the beam, Sandra, in a final heave, tore free of her clothing, sending the fly and most of her pink tank top to the floor. The fly's head dropped out of range, and Sandra's magnificent breasts filled the display as the machine fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green flash filled the room as the beam struck Sandra squarely in the chest. The fly, capitalizing on the incapacitation of his adversary, quickly scampered out of the room, dragging what remained of Sandra's tank top behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eomot peered out from the display at his now topless assistant.

Sandra stood, beautiful and motionless, an expression of surprise frozen on her face. Feeling equal parts concern for his assistant and curiosity, Dr. Eomot rushed to examine Sandra's immobile form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got up from the table, however, Dr. Eomot realized his stasis field generator had not done a thorough job of freezing Sandra in place. Barely perceptible at first, Sandra's eyes turned to follow the doctor's movement, then her head began to swivel. Her mouth, half open in surprise, parted slightly more as a long, low pitched sound escaped from her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doooooctorrrrrr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eomot's eyes widened as the truth dawned on him. Instead of freezing Sandra in time, the machine had sped up time around her! Now Sandra was trapped in a world in which objects and time flew by in an incomprehensible blur. Even now, he could see her breasts shifting in mid-bounce, her legs tensing and her body changing position slightly as she began to take a step forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding to the already enormous list of problems at hand, Sandra's remaining clothing, being affected differently by the machine, was moving at a different rate than she was. As she moved forward, her shorts and panties remained frozen in place and began to tear off her body. Walking around behind her, Dr. Eomot could already see a substantial portion of Sandra's rump already some distance separated from the rear of her shorts, which now hung motionless in space still conformed to the contours of her rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched, Sandra was beginning to show realization of her current situation. Her body was beginning to scrunch down as her arms slowly moved to cover her breasts. He surmised her mouth would be opening for an impending scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning his hands through his hair, Dr. Eomot pondered his next move. Sandra would not go far, but he needed to find Cindy, as well as the fly, if he was to stand a chance of returning them both to normal.</span></div></div>",

A number of students were sitting at desks, apparently attending a biology lecture. As Cindy looked down at them, the reality of her situation began to sink in. Only fifteen minutes ago she had been a normal college co-ed. Now she was.... something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands moved involuntarily to feel the wings on her back. Would she be stuck like this forever? As Cindy pondered this, she realized that if there was any chance of her returning to normal, it was through Dr. Eomot. Cursing herself for running away, Cindy turned and prepared to fly back the way she had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she realized she was lost. She had flown a great distance, and there were no landmarks inside the maze of dark tunnels that she could use to get back to the lab. At that moment, she heard the students below her pushing their chairs back as they left the class. Cindy considered her options. Should she risk flying down into the classroom, or try navigating back through the vents?</span></div></div>",

Sitting there butt naked, Cindy tried to figure out what she could do now.  It'd take forever for her to get home and contact someone's she could trust at this rate, and what if someone found her on her way there?  She shuddered, there's no way she wants to be found by some creep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor dismissed the class below and Cindy, in her haste, slipped while getting up to fly out with the students.

Once she saw an opening to get to her locker, she took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreefalling to her locker, she buzzed her wings as she reached the holes in her locker and climbed her way in, and immediately collapsed on her shirt, her heart racing and adrenaline coursing through her veins.

Not even two inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this going to be my life now?\"  She asked herself as she walked back to her shirt and sat there, hugging her knees to her bare chest, she quietly sobbed, not daring to make enough noise to be heard by any passersby in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done crying, she was able to open up her sandwich ziplock and took a tiny portion of the ham and bread to make an even smaller ham sandwich.  \"What am I going to do now?\"  She asked herself as she ate her tiny sandwich in her locker.</span></div></div>",

She was a cheerleader, gorgeous red hair, beautiful face, her breasts are C-cup, but now all she saw was a naked winged freak, less than two inches tall.  Her butt freckles (side effect of being a redhead) and crimson bush out for anyone to see, and there wasn't anything she could do about it..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go.\"  She said to herself, climbing back out the hole and buzzing her way down the hall, looking for a way out.  There!  A group of students is heading out the main door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing herself to go faster to make it, she caught up to the group, hovering just behind them to make sure that nobody saw them.  Hovering slowly and quietly behind them, she managed to get under one of their backpacks and grabbed onto the bottom of it, waiting for them to head out the doors.  Once they were out, Cindy took off like a jet, heading off in the direction of her house, hopefully mom and dad were back from their vacation and could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to fly carefully due to the greens being empty of trees, which meant a lot of open sky for a student to see her buzzing around.  One close call with a particularly aggressive blue jay and two close calls involving a frisby and a football, she made it to the area around her neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzzing carefully along, not wanting to attract any birds to her, she tiredly dropped into one of the bushes in the front yard of a house not too far from her neighborhood.

Don't leave!\"  And like that, she'd closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuzzing her wings into action, Cindy flew around the room, getting a good look around and paused when she looked out the window.  It was sunset, and she didn't want to be a victim to some bat she'd never be able to see coming, so it looked like she was stuck here for the night.  Hearing the door swing open, Cindy flew up to the top of the window to hide behind the drapes, unsure if it was Lilly or her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy?\"  She heard the little girl call out, \"Where'd you go?\"  Buzzing back down from the window to land on Lilly's dresser, Cindy waved at the girl.  \"Oh, there you are.\"  She placed some bread and an apple slice on a tissue, \"This is all I could get without mommy seeing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy landed and began to tear into the bread and apple, \"Thank you!\" She called out between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two sat there in companionable silence until Cindy was done eating and Lilly threw out the remaining food in the trash.  \"Hey Cindy,\" Lilly asked nervously, wringing her hands together, \"why're you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her body, her trimmed red bush and C-cups out for anyone to see, she decided not to burden the girl with the truth and simply continue with the fairy story, \"Nobody really makes clothes this small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly accepted this and pointed to a Barbie playhouse, \"You can sleeping there, or in the box again, it's almost bedtime.\" Lilly started to pull out her PJ's and start getting changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy nodded, \"Hey Lilly,\" the girl what she was doing to look at Cindy, \"don't tell your mommy about me, we're only supposed to be seen by kids .\" Cindy hated lying to the girl about her real nature, but didn't want to break the girls innocence about what'd really happen to her if her mother found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded, and Cindy flew into the dollhouse and noticed that the bed had been padded up nicely with some clean socks, she could still faintly smell the soap on them.
