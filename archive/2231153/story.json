        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">In a Fan's dream come true, The protagonist Is Brett Smith, a perverted twenty-something asshole who has required special experimental app on that allows him to literally pull out any character from their respective series or media. Once in the real world, a strange collar would be instantly wrapped around their neck. Signifying that they are yours and can't directly harm or kill you or any real human...without your permission...if you're into that. Plus it automatically makes them attracted to you. A real life waifu...literally! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app also features quite a few ways to modify his waifu/husbandos of chose, and some other fun features! Even a clothing section, where they can have new clothes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just snatching characters like that could have plenty of bizzare and profund effects and consequences in their home world-the rest of the characters almost certainly noticed them gonna . Dramatically altering the course of their world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubt it effect Brett though....probably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No short chapters! Keep aminimum of two to four paragraphs at a minimum. I will give leniency to some chapters but don't continuously make them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Unlike the rest of other my interactives, Sexual content is more heavily referenced and will mostly happen depending on the things Brett chooses to do. And actual super \"lewd\" stuff will probably happen. Also this is like a raunchy \"romance\"  based light novel... So yeah. <br>\r\n3.3, Things like \"hands-on\" teasing, handjobs, and etc are fine though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Feet are the main kink of the story. So No toilet stuff, Major Weight gain, major limb expansion or inflation, super-hardcore femdom, or vore of any kind. That goes for any kink that goes against the flow of the story. But to nature of the stuff and themes of the story, shrinking/growing will be very much allowed, and encouraged! That goes for a minor to medium muscle growth and such too! All thanks to the app! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. My eternal rule: Not every foot have to smell like a cheese factory, nor do they smell like a field of daisies. Not every person is tall or is short. Not every girl has watermelon for tits. Or an ass that claps away thunderstorms. Variety is the spice of life, get what I'm saying. All to make feel a little more realistic and \"human\"... but Brett can fix that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Your choices matter in the long run and further shape the main character's personality and also develop the others. And remember while you are free to do whatever you want. But remember, you aren't free from the consequences of said actions. A lot of Brett's actions can blow up in his face<br>\r\n6.1. But Brett's an asshole and is the \"dom\" of the story...so yeah. But he does a heart...so there's that.<br>\r\n6.2. Brett is in his early twenties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please keep the influx of choice chapters on the relatively low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Keep it, first person or second person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. No sudden abrupt endings and deaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. The protag isn't blind to a character's other \"assets\" *eyebrow wiggle*. But be warned, this isn't pure smut(and it can be kinda close). But playful mocking, outright bullying, and teasing is very much allowed and is encouraged. ;D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. You can have both husanbos and waifus. :V<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. The most important rule\u2026is to have fun, and get creative with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. Unlike in my other interactives...you can have different characters from different series together as your waifus. Meaning Brett can be a real harem anime protagonist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. Only animations and video games can be used! This is due to the app can't snatch characters that are played by real people and needs a electrical powered screen for the app to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16. Brett is pretty picky when it comes to boys and he is less likely to get a real-life super macho guy. And won't get any dude who at his dad or grandpa's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n17. Also please keep the waifus/husbanbos' personalities accurate and true. Makes character development and interactions more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18. The app snatches character out of a current playing  scene. This could be used to get young or older versions of a character...but once he snatches one version of let say Goku. Brett can't get the other versions of Goku unless he releases the one he has. </td>",
