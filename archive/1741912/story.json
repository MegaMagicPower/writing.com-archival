Alexandra had been waiting faithfully for a costumer to come in and at least look at something for the past three hours, but none had. She ran a small bookstore, a quaint little place, snuggled tightly between a candle shop and a music store. There was nothing fancy about it, this place held no secrets she had yet to uncover, but yet... The books themselves were always an adventure to her. A new land to be discovered, or a new tale to be told. They were her friends, her family, and her lovers. But sometimes, even they were too much for her. She needed some alone time with her new friend, cable. All she ever did was read, for once, she didn't want to read, she just wanted to think of nothing for a few hours. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Aged at twenty years, she was in the prime of her life. She was happy and healthy, she was working her way through college, and like any twenty year old, she had friends whom she hung out with regularly (apart from her books). Today, of all days, she just felt tired. Her eyes were beginning to hurt from the amount of reading she had to do for her college work, not to mention bills and the like. She just wanted to sleep, too bad the store didn't close for another three hours. Then again, business was slow, what would be the harm of closing up a little early today???</span></span></div></div>",

The shop was peaceful and quiet. This paper was due before midnight, so she might as well get it done.

That is the question, or is he merely just a figment of your imagination?<br>\r\nSex is allowed (between Romeo and Alexandra) further into the story and so is masturbation, BUUUUUUUUUT that's it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of this is going to take place in Alexandra's dreams/ fairytales, but at the end of each story she should wake up, head to her bookstore, commute home, and then return to dreamland.</td>",
