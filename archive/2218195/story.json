It turned out the concern was warranted when, a few weeks after the discovery, scientists realized that Samson asteroid was going to impact the earth in May 2020.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld leaders struggled to keep their citizens calm in the first week after the announcement; assuring everyone that there was nothing to worry about.  While scientists researched ways to alter Samson\u2019s course, bunkers were built in strategic locations in every country; bunkers which were filled with the help of a lottery system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisaster struck about 4 months prior to Samson\u2019s impact; when a robotic mission to plant a nuke inside the asteroid failed.  With no time left to send a second mission, the bunkers became humanities only hope for survival.  The bunkers had enough supplies to feed the survivors for 3 years until the surface is habitable again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was three days before Samson was due to impact; although minor impacts have been occurring for the last week, as fragments that were broken off by the failed mission entered the atmosphere.  My name is Jamie Lincoln; I\u2019m just shy of my 18th birthday and I was sitting in the high school auditorium waiting for my evacuation group to be led out to the buses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about 100 people standing around the auditorium; I was standing in one corner with my parents and my little sister Emma.  My parents, Marcus and Olivia, were standing with our suitcases while was leaning against the wall and crying.  While her best friend\u2019s family had been chosen for the lottery, she was devastated to find that her boyfriend\u2019s family hadn\u2019t been chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t have many friends, to begin with, but I was lucky that the one friend I did have was chosen for the bunker.  My sympathy towards Emma did have its limits however; I was starting to get annoyed by the constant whining.  Leaning down to her level, I said, \u201cEm, you have to stop crying.  Crying isn\u2019t going to get Kyle into the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with tears in her eyes, I could see Emma\u2019s anger as she glared at me.  \u201cScrew you, Jamie!\u201d wiping her eyes, Emma said, \u201cHow would you like it if you get to live while someone you care about died!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because he\u2019s not going to be in the bunker doesn\u2019t mean that Kyle is going to die.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re 300 miles from the impact zone; chances are good that he\u2019ll survive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Getting up, Emma said, \u201cI\u2019m going to use the bathroom; I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry back, sweetie.\u201d Looking after Emma, Mom said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to start the boarding process in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started calling names 10 minutes later; everything was going fine until they came to Ashley Saunders.  She was the stereotypical popular girl; captain of the cheer squad, prom queen, etc.  She, along with many of her friends, made life hell for everyone; including me.  After calling her name three times, the National Guard soldier decided to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure why I suddenly cared about Ashley\u2019s wellbeing, but I was growing concerned that she wasn\u2019t in the auditorium.  I decided, then and there, to go look for her.  Grabbing my backpack, I started towards the door; only for my mom to stop me.  \u201cJamie, where are you going?  They\u2019re about to call our names.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to go find Ashley, mom.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d pausing, Mom said, \u201cIs that girl really worth risking your life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe may be a bitch, mom, but that doesn\u2019t mean she deserves to die.\u201d Looking at Mom, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be safe, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy folks, and Emma, just stood there silently as I walked out of the auditorium.  As I walked through the halls of the school, I silently wondered where Ashley was.  I\u2019d been walking around for 5 minutes when I heard a noise coming from a classroom down the hall.  Making my way into the room, I saw Ashley standing by the window.  As I walked closer, I saw that she was charging her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, we have to go; the last buses are about to leave.\u201d Grabbing her arm, I said, \u201cYou can charge your phone when we get to the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of me, you loser.\u201d Pulling away from me, she said, \u201cI have to charge my phone; I can\u2019t live without it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t leave now, you won\u2019t have very long to worry about that.\u201d I grabbed her arm again, saying, \u201cWe have to get back to the buses before they leave; or we\u2019re screwed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ashley unplugged her phone and grabbed her things, the two of us ran down the hall.  As we crossed the lobby leading to the buses, I could hear a rumbling noise in the distance.  It seemed to get louder with each passing second; as the building started to shake.  Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Spotting the doorway, 20 feet ahead, I said, \u201cCome on, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us ran out of the building, we were horrified to see that the buses were already leaving.  There was no chance we\u2019d be able to catch up with them before they turned onto the main road.  But that didn\u2019t stop Ashley from trying to chase after them, screaming, \u201cWait for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment the rumbling noise, and the ground shaking, got must worse.  I looked back towards the building and saw a meteor flying through the atmosphere.  Seeing as it was close to the ground, I realized it was about to hit.  Dropping my backpack, I ran after Ashley to stop her, \u201cAshley stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the approaching meteor grew louder with each passing second as I ran to catch up with Ashley.  The noise quickly made it impossible for her to hear me yelling after her, but it did make her stop and turn around.  The look on her face as she saw the approaching fireball was one of pure horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to catch up and throw both of us behind a nearby car; just as the meteor hit the ground no more than 100 feet away.  The ground shook from the impact as Ashley and I struggled to stay behind cover.  The shockwave from the impact threw everything into the air; even the car moved several feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything calmed down, even though my ears were still ringing, I slowly peeked over the rear of the car to find the parking lot full of burning debris.  But I didn\u2019t focus on that; instead, I was focusing on the newly formed crater, with the burning wreckage of the bus visible over the top.  I could only stare in shock at the bus; knowing it was the one my family was in.</span></div></div>",

I was frozen in place as reality sank in \u2013 my parents and my little sister were dead.  I was only vaguely aware of what was happening around me, but I was suddenly snapped back to reality when Ashley slapped me hard across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to her, taken aback, and said, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSnap out of it, Jamie!\u201d looking at me, as she tried to pull me to my feet, she said, \u201cYou got me out of the building; I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to die out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized she was right when I saw a crowd of people outside the barricades.  I knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before the barricade gave in; with everything going on, two teenagers would be easy targets for looters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little unsteady, I climbed to my feet and helped Ashley to hers.  Looking around, I spotted my backpack underneath a damaged car door nearby.  Looking at Ashley, I said, \u201cI have to grab my bag, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley started to protest but I ran off before she could.  After grabbing my bag, I ran back to where she was waiting.  By that point the crowd had burst through the barricade surrounding the building; many torching anything they could get their hands on, while a few took notice of me and Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized our best option was to run; so I grabbed Ashley\u2019s hand in mine and started running in the direction the buses had been going in.  This time, to my surprise, Ashley didn\u2019t object to me grabbing her.</span></div></div>",

Having grown up in the town, I was horrified to see how quickly it devolved into a warzone as the impact date got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhole sections of town were either burnt down or completely blocked off.  It had been about 10 minutes since we\u2019d run from the school.  I was still in shock from my family\u2019s death, but I couldn\u2019t really focus on that at the moment.  I was too focused on keeping myself and Ashley alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d managed to avoid the group chasing us long enough to make it downtown.  The two of us were resting in an alley in the center of town.   Looking at me, with a hint of exhaustion in her eyes, Ashley said, \u201cWhat are we going to do?  It\u2019s not like we can keep running from those people forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the best thing we can do is to try and reach the bunker.\u201d Catching my breath, I said, \u201cBefore they started calling names, they said the bunker would be sealed up 3 hours before Samson\u2019s impact.  We just have to get there before that happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust how do you plan on doing that?\u201d scoffing, Ashley said, \u201cWith all the chaos we\u2019ll be lucky to make it 20 feet without being seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ashley; I\u2019m trying to figure this out as we go along.\u201d Leaning against the building, I said, \u201cOf all the people to be stuck with; why\u2019d it have to be you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m happy about being stuck here with you?\u201d looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019d rather be with anyone else but you; but unfortunately that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think I would\u2019ve been with my family; but no, I had to come to save you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, are you really that stupid?\u201d sighing, Ashley said, \u201cYou would have died on that bus if you hadn\u2019t come back for me.  Your last thought probably would\u2019ve been wondering what that loud noise was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing dead would be better than being stranded here with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately regretted having said that; because I could see that I\u2019d hurt Ashley.

Looking around, I saw a doorway nearby; so I ran over to see if I could open it.  After tugging on the handle for a few seconds the door opened, I quietly gestured for Ashley to go inside; I followed her after grabbing our bags.  I just managed to close the door as the looters came round the corner from the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the looters ransacked the alley outside, Ashley and I walked further inside in an attempt to hide.  As we walked through the office, I realized we were inside an abandoned dentist's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe quickly found an exam room far enough away from the entrances that no one would be able to see us.  But to be safe, I closed the door anyway.  Turning on the lamp over the chair, I sat down in the office chair while Ashley leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of us said anything for a moment; our emotions clearly still in control.  After a moment, I took a breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said in the alley; I-I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to apologize for; I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did.\u201d Looking at me, moving some hair from her face, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that your family died, and I\u2019m sorry for making light of it the way I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith everything going on, I guess we\u2019re both on edge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Sighing, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cBefore you came to get me, did you happen to see Eric anywhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Masterson was Ashley\u2019s boyfriend, and captain of the football team.  The last time I saw him, he was trudging out the doors towards the buses.  \u201cHe left to get on the bus as soon as his name was called.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat jerk probably didn\u2019t even realize I was gone.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m not exactly thrilled that I\u2019m stuck with you, but at least you came to look for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have been a total bitch to me in school, but that doesn\u2019t mean I would let you die.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cRight now I guess our next step is figuring out how to get to the bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could go to my stepdad\u2019s house; it\u2019s only a few miles from here.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cWe could grab one of the cars and try to get to the bunker that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a good idea, but I\u2019m not sure we should go now.\u201d Getting out of the chair, I said, \u201cThere may be more looters out there, I think our best option is to wait until night time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard any screaming for a while; I think we\u2019re in the clear.\u201d Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cI think we should go now while we still have a chance.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sitting in an adjacent chair, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saved my life, Jamie; when not even my best friends or my boyfriend came looking for me.\u201d Gesturing to the empty house, Ashley said, \u201cYou can see the warm welcome I had waiting for me here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve to die; no matter how badly you treated me in high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a faint smile, Ashley said, \u201cStill, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone tried to talk you out of looking for me.\u201d<br>\r\nMom had asked if Ashley was worth risking my life for, but I didn\u2019t want to tell that to Ashley.  \u201cThat\u2019s crazy talk, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about my Mom started me down a slippery slope; so I desperately tried to think of something else before the waterworks started. Thankfully Ashley came to the rescue; standing up, she looked at me and said, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and followed Ashley into the kitchen, watching as she gathered some things from the fridge and pantry.  As she started cooking, she said, \u201cYou can go watch a movie or something; I\u2019ll let you know when dinners ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all; I\u2019ve been cooking for myself and my friends since the 3rd Grade.\u201d Putting some diced peppers into a pan, she said, \u201cIf Samson had been destroyed, I probably would have been doing this for one of them anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we\u2019d finished eating dinner, I helped Ashley clean up.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhere do your folks keep the cars?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the garage; but it\u2019s too risky to go right now.  The darkness would hide the looters from us, and they\u2019d be able to track us from the headlights.\u201d Turning on the dishwasher, Ashley said, \u201cWe\u2019re better off staying here for the night and leave tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a good point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d With that Ashley led me upstairs; opening a doorway at the end of the hall.  \u201cThis is my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking inside, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes; her room was bigger than my parent\u2019s bedroom.  \u201cIt looks nice.\u201d Turning to her, I said, \u201cWhere am I sleeping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie, I don\u2019t want to be alone tonight; in case the looters get in.\u201d turning on the lights, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019d like for you to sleep in here with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" <i>Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her into the room, I quickly realized what she meant; when I saw two beds in her room.  \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t use up all the hot water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo began my first time in a girl\u2019s room; although it wasn\u2019t quite the experience I\u2019d expected.  <i>And here I thought she wanted me.</i>  Once the two of us were in bed, she turned over and put her hand out.  Expecting her to say goodnight and let go, I took it; so imagine my surprise when she held my hand until she fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

When I finally woke up the next morning it had stopped raining.  I looked over to find that Ashley wasn\u2019t sleeping next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I walked out of the room to look for her; eventually finding her standing in front of a picture window admiring the sunrise.  Walking up next to her, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a really nice sunrise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d Chuckling, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cToo bad we won\u2019t see another one for 3 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind, Ashley and I stood there watching the sunrise for a while longer.  Once we\u2019d stopped, I said, \u201cI think it would be a good idea if we stuck to the highway as much as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get right down to business, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure we survive, Ashley.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to take the surface streets; and besides, we\u2019ll be less likely to encounter looters on the highway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Jamie, I was just joking.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cI agree with you 100%, the highway would be our best bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you point me to the garage; I\u2019ll see if the car still runs, while you gather some supplies for the trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d Pointing down the hall, past the kitchen, Ashley said, \u201cThe garage is down there; the last door on the right.\u201d<br>\r\nOnce we had our assignments, Ashley and I went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the garage, about 30 minutes later, topping off the fluids in a 2017 BMW when Ashley came into the garage holding a tote in her arms.  I looked behind her and saw several more totes sitting on the floor.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI found some camping supplies in the attic; some food and some extra clothes.\u201d Pausing, she placed the tote in the trunk, \u201cYou look about my step-brother\u2019s size, so I grabbed some of his clothes for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fine to me.\u201d Discarding an empty oil container, I said, \u201cWe should be ready to go in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Returning with the last tote, Ashley said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I-I\u2019d like a few minutes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley trailed off but I knew what she was going to say; she\u2019d grown up in this house and she wanted to say goodbye.  I silently nodded as she walked back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shortly after 10 AM when we left the house; I was driving while Ashley was the lookout in the passenger seat.  As we pulled out of the driveway, I said, \u201cBarring any issues, I think we can get to the bunker by this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep our fingers crossed that we don\u2019t run into anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive went perfectly for the next 5 minutes until, as we were driving out of the gated entrance to the neighborhood, we came across a large downed tree blocking the road.  Stopping the car, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWell that poses a problem; it must\u2019ve fallen down during the storm last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cThis is the only way out of the neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I see it; we can try to go around it, or we can find another car on the other side.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I quickly decided our best solution was to try and go around the tree; which involved driving on the grass and gravel.  Looking at me, a somewhat worried expression on her face, Ashley said, \u201cPlease be careful; this car isn\u2019t built for off-roading.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI backed the car up and turned so I was facing the grass on the right side of the road.  After figuring out the best way to go, I put the car in drive.  The tires struggled to get a grip on the still-wet grass, but we managed to gain a little bit of traction.  I slowly continued towards an opening between the tree and some nearby boulders; an opening just wide enough to fit the car through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going well until one of the rear tires got caught in an unseen patch of mud.  Despite my best efforts the car wouldn\u2019t budge in any direction.  I even resorted to attempting to lift the car while Ashley worked the pedals, but it did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything that\u2019s been happening, I was bound to snap sooner or later.  I collapsed to the ground in a huff; crying in exasperation while Ashley came running to check on me.  \u201cJamie, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not alright!\u201d tears streaming down my face, I said, \u201cMy family is dead, I\u2019m 100 miles from where I need to be, and I can\u2019t get this damn car out of the mud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find another way, Jamie; we have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow Ashley?\u201d gesturing to the car, I said, \u201cOur only mode of transportation is stuck in the mud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can find another car down the road; transfer everything into that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saw how things looked as we made our way here; every car we passed was either burnt to a crisp or had missing tires.\u201d Wiping tears from my eyes, I said, \u201cLet\u2019s face it; our chances of surviving just dropped to zero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stood up and paced around for a moment; before turning to me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur chances of survival aren\u2019t zero.\u201d Wincing, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bunker underneath my house.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Making sure to enunciate every word, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s...a...bunker...underneath...your...house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinching, Ashley said, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve known about it all this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Ashley nodded and said, \u201cMy folks put it in; in case the lott...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting angry at that point.  \u201cWhy the <i>hell</i> did you let me plan to carry all of this <i>shit</i> away from it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook; the bunker has a lot of amenities and can hold a lot, but it doesn\u2019t have the people we care about.\u201d Looking at me, <br>\r\nAshley said, \u201cWith everything you\u2019re dealing with right now, I thought you could use your friends to help through it.  Plus I knew you wouldn\u2019t want to be cooped up with just me for three years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not ashamed to admit that Ashley surprised me at that moment.  I thought she was going to say something like it slipped her mind or that she hated what the decorator did.  But instead, she was thinking of me; and she was right, I did want to see my friends.  Taking a deep breath to calm down, I said, \u201cIn all honesty, our chances of surviving a 100-mile journey were pretty slim.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWe should use your family\u2019s bunker; since it\u2019s close by and has what we need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, Ashley opened the trunk and shouldered some bags.  Grabbing one of the lighter totes, she looked at me and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several trips to get everything back to Ashley\u2019s house; I followed her orders and placed everything in the garage.  I watched as Ashley input another code which caused a hatchway, hidden under some boxes, to open in the floor.  After tossing down the lighter bags, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWe should scrounge around for other things while we\u2019re up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cYou get some board games and movies; I\u2019ll start bringing out some more food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the better part of an hour gathering more things for the bunker; including every board game and movie I could find.  I was climbing up the ladder, having brought down a box of food, when I saw Ashley come into the garage holding a box \u2013 containing picture frames and other assorted items.  \u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome family mementos that we couldn\u2019t bring with us.\u201d Placing the box on the ground, Ashley said, \u201cSince we\u2019re going to be in the bunker, I saw no reason why I couldn\u2019t bring them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance at the box showed it contained wedding photos, pictures of Ashley as a kid and some photos of older relatives.  \u201cWish there was a way to grab those things from my house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown, Ashley said, \u201cI wish there was too, Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ashley\u2019s help, we got everything else into the bunker.  After making one last check of the house, I climbed down the ladder as Ashley closed the hatch.   Once the hatch was closed, I turned to Ashley and said, \u201cWhat are we going to do for food and water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an underground river about 200 below us; it\u2019s not only our freshwater source, but it provides power to the bunker.\u201d Pointing down the hall to the right, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a hydroponic garden down the hall; with enough food for us until we can get back to the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook violently as Ashley finished speaking; another piece of Samson had struck close by.  \u201cToo bad there\u2019s no way to look around above ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe of little faith.\u201d Heading down the hall, Ashley said, \u201cThere\u2019s a periscope in the central room; or, if you\u2019re feeling confident, controls for a drone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed; your folks really thought of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly; all they were concerned about is the cost.\u201d Turning to look at me, Ashley said, \u201cThe power was the idea of the designer, along with the periscope.  The drone, however, was my idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot smarter than I gave you credit for, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Ashley said, \u201cThe teachers said the same thing.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Built into the wall was a big-screen TV; with the drone controls sitting nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the TV was a door leading to the sleeping area, which had 4 bunk beds, and a bathroom.  A door in the kitchen led to a pantry with shelves full of non-perishable foods; enough to last two people a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back into the main room, having just checked out the exercise/workshop.

When we weren\u2019t working, the two of us were watching movies or anything else to keep our minds off everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 11:10 in the morning; less than 20 minutes before Samson was due to hit.  Ashley was in the kitchen making some lunch for the two of us, while I was checking on the weapons locker in the pantry.  The locker consisted of 3 shotguns, 2 rifles, and 4 pistols; with around 200 rounds for each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the middle of putting the weapons back in the locker, oblivious to my surroundings, when Ashley walked into the room with an annoyed look on her face.  \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you for the last 5 minutes.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m checking out the weapons.\u201d Placing a rifle in the rack, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need them once we can return to the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have three years to worry about that, Jamie.\u201d Taking a breath, Ashley said, \u201cHow about you close up the cabinet before I have to learn how to remove shrapnel from your neck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine.\u201d Sighing, I closed the cabinet.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so worried; we\u2019ve got like 5 minutes before...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the whole place started to shake, and I wasn\u2019t exaggerating.  It felt as though the whole world was shaking apart; as dust fell from above and my life flashed before my eyes.  I kept hearing Emma saying, \u201cHold me, mommy...Hold me, mommy...Hold me, mommy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity before the shaking finally stopped.  I slowly got to my feet and brushed off the dust.  As my ears slowly stopped ringing, I realized that was still hearing that little girl saying, \u201cHold me mommy...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I realized it was Ashley who was saying it; as she held onto a nearby post for dear life.  Walking over to her, I placed my hands on her shoulders and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay Ashley; it\u2019s all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything going on, I supposed I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when Ashley wrapped her arms around me in a hug.  She held my tight for a moment until she composed herself.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cA-Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ears are ringing a little, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWe did it, Ash; we survived Samson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, but I suggest we wait until all the fragments are gone before we celebrate.\u201d Taking a breath, Ashley said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot here; but neither of us are doctors.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For weeks leading up to Zero Hour, scientists stated that there would be secondary impacts from fragments all over the globe.  Some of the fragments would be tiny, no bigger than a car, while others would be the size of small buildings.<br>\r\nOne of the main reasons behind the bunkers was that scientists believed the surface would be uninhabitable for three years after impact.  This was due in large part to the ash and debris thrown into the atmosphere; blocking most of the sunlight and cooling the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been three hours since Samson struck the surface off the coast of Massachusetts.  The resulting tidal wave had most definitely reached Europe by now.  I tried to put all that out of my mind, as Ashley and I hunkered down in the bunker.  Even though we were relatively safe inside the bunker, the two of us would still flinch whenever the ground shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, after a particularly violent shake, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cHow much longer before this stops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be at least a few more hours before all the fragments either burn up or strike the ground.\u201d Trying to sound reassuring, I said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I hope so.\u201d Taking a breath, Ashley turned to me and said, \u201cDo you think they felt any pain before they died?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d read about the victims of the atomic bombs in Japan, how many of them were vaporized within milliseconds of detonation.  I couldn\u2019t know for certain, but I certainly hoped those near the impact zone died quickly. \u201cEverything happened so fast; I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if there are any survivors on the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it would depend on how far away they were; anything within 50 miles would likely be destroyed by the fireball and quakes.\u201d  Taking a breath, I said, \u201cNot to sound callous, but now\u2019s not the time to think about those on the surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you being serious right now?\u201d getting to her feet, Ashley looked at me and said, \u201cMillions of people are either dead or will be in a matter of days; forgive me for being upset about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up to follow Ashley as she went into the sleeping area.  \u201cAsh, wait\u2026I-I\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t worry about this.  I\u2019m just saying we need to ensure that we can survive; then we can mourn the dead.\u201d Placing a hand on her shoulder, I said, \u201cDo you really think that little of me; that you think I\u2019m not upset that millions of people are dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned around to say something; her face a mixture of anger and sadness.  She opened her mouth to speak; only the ground started shaking before she could.  Before I could realize what was happening, a bookshelf in the sleeping area toppled over and fell on top of me.</span></div></div>",

I quickly realized that I resting on one of the bunks; with the bookshelf lying on its side nearby.  My head was throbbing like crazy; I reached up to touch it, only to find half my head had been bandaged.  \u201cWhat the...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley walked into the room at that point; holding an ice pack in her hand.  Seeing me, she dropped the ice pack and ran over to me.  \u201cJamie!\u201d pulling me into a seated position, Ashley hugged the stuffing out of me.  \u201cThank God you\u2019re alive!\u201d<br>\r\nI was touched by her concern for my safety.  After she released the hug, I looked at her and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the bandages?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bookshelf split your head open; I\u2019ve never seen so much blood, at least from a boy.\u201d Sitting next to me, Ashley said, \u201cI figured it was better to use too much than not enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cHow\u2019d you get the bookshelf off me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdrenaline can do some crazy things; I saw you were hurt, so I sprang into action.\u201d Looking at me, grabbing my hand, she said, \u201cI was so worried you wouldn\u2019t make it, Jamie; I was afraid that the last thing I said to you was out of anger.  Please forgive me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts okay, Ash; we\u2019re both dealing with an intense situation, we both said things that we didn\u2019t mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be down, just the two of us, for years.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cThe last thing I want is for us to blow up on each other like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I want, Ash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I eventually felt up to it, I went to the bathroom to unwrap the bandages on my head.  Judging from the blood soaked bandages, Ashley hadn\u2019t been kidding about the blood.  I was amazed that so much blood came from such a small cut.  Even if I got a scar from it, it was likely no one would notice.  <i>If that isn\u2019t the story of my life; even my scar isn\u2019t worth noticing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway behind me, Ashley said, \u201cAre you going to be alright?  Do you think the scar will be bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ashley will notice.</i> I told myself. <i>Ashley will care. And in a good way, even.</i> \"I'll be fine.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first week after Zero Hour passed by without much of an issue.  Within a day Ashley and I had come up with a chores list; divvying up the jobs needed to keep the bunker in one piece.  I was in charge of maintenance, security and the supplies; while Ashley was in charge of cooking, medical needs, and miscellaneous other tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after noon on a Saturday; I walked out of the sleeping area to find Ashley taking a spin on the treadmill in the far corner.  Slowing the speed of the treadmill, Ashley took a sip from her water bottle.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou got any big plans today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d Grabbing the drone controller, I said, \u201cI was thinking of taking the drone out for a spin; so we can get an idea of what\u2019s out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s such a good idea?\u201d stopping the treadmill, Ashley got off and walked over to me.  \u201cI understand wanting to see what it\u2019s like out there, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to see dead bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that either, Ash; but we have to figure out what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching the TV over to the drone, I activated the drone and launched it from its \u2018hangar\u2019 along the side of the house.  As soon as it left the \u2018hangar\u2019 the drone started transmitting data; the air quality was terrible and the ambient temperature was in the low 100s.<br>\r\nThe first images we got back were of trees on fire and most of the adjacent houses in ruins.  I heard an audible gasp from Ashley when we saw that most of her house was burnt to a crisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceeded to take the drone out over the road; flying by where we\u2019d abandoned the car, only to find that it had been crushed by another tree.  I followed the road towards town, keeping an eye on the drone\u2019s battery life.  Sure enough, as we got closer to town, we started seeing charred human remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dentist\u2019s office where we\u2019d hidden from the looters was still relatively intact; but when the drone arrived over the school, I saw that large sections of it were destroyed.  By this point the drone had been in the air for about 30 minutes; so I decided it was time to come home, even though there was still about an hour's worth of battery left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned the drone around and started following the road back; only to come across the crater and burnt remains of the school bus.  I started to tear up at the sight of the bus on the screen.  Seeing the image on the screen, Ashley came over and took the controls from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing the drone on autopilot, she turned her attention to me.  Without saying a word, she just hugged me for what seemed like an eternity.</span></div></div>",

I'm glad he's dead! Mwahahahaha!\u201d  I couldn\u2019t help but smile when Ashley started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us had fun playing Life as well.  I had three kids while Ashley had five; I ended up winning that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun, Ash.

I wasn\u2019t glad that the world ended, but...well, I used to have a huge crush on Ashley in middle school.  Then things changed once we got to High School; where I ended up squarely in the crosshairs of the jocks, and Ashley and her friends started laughing at me.  Now that it was just the two of us, we were getting along well and working on improving our relationship every day.</span></div></div>",

Thanks to the use of the drone, I\u2019d been able to survey everything within a 3-mile radius of the bunker.  The results were as I\u2019d expected; buildings destroyed, the occasional corpse, etc.  My family\u2019s house, surprisingly, we almost completely intact \u2013 save for the broken windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did learn one lesson the hard way, and that was to avoid Ashley when it was her time of the month.

She looked as though she was going to yell at me; only she stopped herself at the last minute.  \u201cToday would\u2019ve been my 2nd anniversary with Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I sat down at the foot of the bunk and looked at her.  \u201cAsh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I wonder why I even dated him; aside from the perks of dating the captain of the football team.\u201d Putting her phone down, Ashley sat up and looked at me, \u201cHis birthday was a few months ago; I put a lot of thought and effort into buying him a jersey signed by Tom Brady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he loved that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d scoffing, Ashley said, \u201cYou know what he got me for my birthday?

I had to be rescued by <i>you</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew Ashley was just lashing out in anger, but it still hurt when she said that.

We were both in agreement that we had to do something; especially considering there was a child involved.  The question was; did we bring them here or go out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, it seemed as though the trio was ready to give up.  Grabbing the controller from me, Ashley pressed a button and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll come to you; stay there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving figured out Ashley\u2019s plan, I went to the airlock and retrieved an environmental suit.  The suits were designed to protect us from the extreme environmental changes brought on by Samson \u2013 mainly the cold and ash in the air.  Walking back into the main room, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll go out to them; you stay here in case something happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick stop at the weapons cabinet, Ashley joined me at the airlock.  Handing me a rifle, Ashley said, \u201cThe coast looks clear, but take this just in case.\u201d Giving me a quick kiss, for good luck, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019ll watch you with the drone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rifle in hand, I opened the outer hatch and climbed up the ladder.  I\u2019d seen the damage done to the house through the drone, but seeing it first hand was something totally different.  The garage wall had collapsed, making it impossible for me to exit through the door.  Speaking into the mic, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go through the house, most of the garage has collapsed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful; that suit doesn\u2019t make you invincible.\u201d Pausing, Ashley said, \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering, it\u2019s a balmy -15 out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I entered the house, I was surprised to see it was mostly intact; sure the windows were blown out and there was debris everywhere, but the house seemed to have fared pretty well.  Walking outside, I saw the cause of the collapsed garage \u2013 a tree had fallen and struck the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked down the driveway towards where the trio had been; I could barely see 10 feet in front of me.  I took my time getting there; when they saw I was armed, they started to tremble.  This, coupled with Ashley\u2019s recon, told me this wasn\u2019t an ambush.  <br>\r\n\u201cWe saw your signs.  What do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two adults; a man and a woman, exchanged shocked looks with each other.  Turning to me, the woman said, \u201cY-You\u2019re not going to chase us away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to chase you away; the rifle was just in case you were planning something,\u201d lowering the gun, I said, \u201cNow it\u2019s not getting any warmer out here; what do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, the man said, \u201cCan we come inside with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir; but we don\u2019t have enough supplies for five people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease sir, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d Looking at me, pleading, the woman said, \u201cWe\u2019ve made it this long on what supplies we had, but we haven\u2019t eaten in four days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were making it difficult for me to turn them down.  After a moment, I said, \u201cYou can come into the bunker; but only for a few days.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but any longer and there won\u2019t be enough supplies for my friend and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-We understand.\u201d Smiling, the woman said, \u201cT-Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI helped the trio pack up their tent and the rest of their equipment before leading them back up to the house.  I was the first to climb down the ladder back into the bunker.  I took off the suit\u2019s hood just as Ashley walked into the room; a stern look on her face.  \u201cYou and I need to have a talk.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was sweeping up some of the ash on the floor when Carl came over to me.  \u201cIs there somewhere we can talk in private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go to the hydroponic garden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI led Carl into the garden where, after making sure there was no one nearby, he said, \u201cI want you to know how hard this is for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be hard.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cUnder different circumstances, I wouldn't even think twice about helping you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for everything you and Ashley have done, but that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Sighing, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m a monster for even considering this.  But, would you two let Caleb stay here with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe love our little boy; and we\u2019d do anything to ensure his safety, which is why I\u2019m asking.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t keep him safe in this world; he deserves better than us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you think two teenagers are better equipped to keep him safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s ideal, but you can provide him with three meals and a roof over his head.\u201d Pausing, Carl said, \u201cThose are things we\u2019re incapable of giving him, and we don\u2019t deserve Caleb if we can\u2019t take care of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head was swimming at this point.  Ashley and I were barely out of high school and suddenly we were being asked to take care of a four-year-old boy?  I\u2019d called Samson's impact a world-changing event, but I never expected the world to change that much. \"Could you please send Ashley in? I should talk this over with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Turning to leave, Carl said, \u201cOne suggestion though; I wouldn\u2019t take the drone out too often.  We\u2019re not the only ones out there; and some of them are...desperate.  I want my son to be safe from them.\"</span></div></div>",

It took three days before he was okay being in the same room as us and another two before he said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings still weren\u2019t perfect, but he was slowly coming around.  I entered the main room from the filter room to find him playing with some toys on the floor.  The night before his parents left, I\u2019d ventured up in the house and found some toys that weren\u2019t too damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to be playing with some GI Joes that belonged to Ashley\u2019s stepbrother Joey.  Noticing me standing nearby, he started to get up and leave the room.  I quickly caught up and grabbed his shoulder.  \u201cCaleb, stop; just...come talk with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stopped in his tracks and didn\u2019t move for a moment; even from behind, I could tell he was conflicted.  Eventually he turned around and walked back over to me.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cWhy did my parents leave me?  Was I a bad kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart dropped when I heard that \u2013 was that why he\u2019d been acting this way?  \u201cOf course they didn\u2019t, why would you possibly think that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing up, Caleb said, \u201cBecause they promised that they\u2019d always be there to take care of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh boy.</i>  Leading Caleb over to the couch, I sat the two of us down.  \u201cThey left you here <i>because</i> they cared about you, Caleb.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cThey realized the world out there isn\u2019t safe for a little kid.  They felt having you here in the bunker was the best thing for you; you\u2019d be safe and never have to worry about food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I ever see my mommy and daddy again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said yes; because I don\u2019t know.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIn the meantime, Ashley and I will do everything in our power to keep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that put a faint smile on Caleb\u2019s face; he hugged me just as Ashley walked into the room.  Walking up to us, Ashley said, <br>\r\n\u201cCome on, little man; let\u2019s put you down for a nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley picked Caleb up off the couch and walked into the sleeping area with him.  I followed behind and stood in the doorway as she tucked him into bed; giving him a kiss on the forehead before walking back to the door.

Making my way to the microwave, I opened it and carefully removed the bag and poured it into a bowl.  That was the way my family always ate microwave popcorn; which caused me to think about them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two months hadn\u2019t been easy; for the first few weeks, I cried myself to sleep or woke up screaming.  I looked up towards the sky, not out of sadness, but out of wistfulness.  <i>I wish you guys were here; you would have loved Caleb.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb came out of the bedroom a few minutes later; after taking a handful of popcorn, he went to look over the movie collection.  While he did that, Ashley pulled me into the bedroom and shut the door.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Ash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was confused by this; as she\u2019d done nothing to warrant an apology.  \u201cWhat for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the way that I treated you up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was starting to become a regular occurrence between us; usually, after I did something that Ashley genuinely appreciated.  \u201cAsh, you don\u2019t have to keep...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do, Jamie.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cWhen we were in school, I thought everything revolved around me and that you were barely worth being in my presence.  But I\u2019ve come to see just how wrong I was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, I\u2019ve forgiven you for how you treated me in High School.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep beating yourself up over that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to show how much I appreciate you; and everything you\u2019ve done for me these last two months.\u201d Smiling, Ashley said, \u201cYou saved my life, you <i>tried</i> to make my favorite cake for my birthday, and you saved Caleb\u2019s life.  I\u2019ve seen how you are with him; you\u2019re no slouch in the dad department.

I was never a particularly big fan of storms, thanks to a traumatic incident from my childhood, so I was doing anything I could think of to keep my mind off the storm outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, I was in the hydroponic garden planting three new tomato plants.

From what I could tell, the garage area was still relatively intact; nothing was preventing us from leaving the bunker when the time came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I flew the drone around the front of the house, I noticed something on the periphery of the camera\u2019s range.  While going in for a closer look, my heart sank when I saw a dozen or so individuals standing outside of some tents in the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to worry when I realized they were all armed with rifles.

She had already removed a shotgun and was in the process of loading it when I caught up with her.  \u201cWhoa!\u201d grabbing the shotgun from her, I said, \u201cYou mind telling me what you\u2019re doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat man is dangerous, Jamie; I won\u2019t have him endangering you or Caleb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019re safe down here, Ash.\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cAs you said, nothing short of a bomb will get through that hatch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Jamie; Patrick is...relentless.\u201d grabbing a pistol from the rack, Ashley said, \u201cOnce he sets his mind on something, he won\u2019t stop until he\u2019s got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the years I\u2019d known her, I\u2019d never seen Ashley this upset about something; I was understandably worried.  \u201cWhat are you saying, Ash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the pistol on the workbench, Ashley pointed in the direction of the hatch and said, \u201cThat man molested me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn for the color to drain from my face.  \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, when I wasn\u2019t in school for a month?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I vaguely remember that.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhen you came back, you said you\u2019d been out with mono.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish it had been mono.\u201d Sighing, leaning against the bench for support, Ashley said, \u201cIt was Columbus Day weekend, we were at my step-grandparents house for a BBQ.  I was playing with some of my cousins when Patrick asked if I could help get some stuff from the basement.  I thought it was weird he didn\u2019t ask one of the guys, but I went to help anyway.  We got down there; and the next I know, I\u2019m topless and he\u2019s caressing my breasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was fuming at that point; to the point where I was almost willing to give Ashley back the shotgun.  \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI managed to knee him in the groin and run upstairs.\u201d On the verge of tears, Ashley said, \u201cI found my step-dad and one of my other uncles; after they called the cops, my step-dad went down to confront Patrick.  By the time the cops got there, Patrick had a detached retina and a broken nose.  Long story short, he was persona non grata after that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was on the verge of tears at that point, I dropped the shotgun and embraced her.  After letting her cry into my shoulder for a moment, I looked at her and said, \u201cYou have my word, Ashley; I\u2019ll never let that man anywhere near you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Patrick\u2019s voice came over the speakers again.  \u201cI know you\u2019re down there, Thomas; you better let me in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley broke the hug and made her way down the hall to the intercom at the base of the ladder.

It was apparent that she was still traumatized; all these years later, by what Patrick had done to her.  Even the sound of his voice was enough to scare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing both my hands on her shoulders, I looked at Ashley and said, \"You and Caleb are the two most important people in my life; I\u2019ll die before I let <i>anyone</i> try to harm you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you can do, Jamie?\u201d looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cHe\u2019s out there, and I\u2019m sure as hell not going to let you go up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could respond, I heard Patrick\u2019s voice come over the speaker again.

He didn\u2019t seem very concerned about how he would get into the bunker; whereas I was concerned with the fact that I couldn\u2019t do anything unless he got inside the bunker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at the intercom, desperately trying to think of something that I could do.  Suddenly I had an idea, so I quickly ran across the bunker to the workshop and pulled up the drone\u2019s maintenance system.  I scrolled through the information until I found what I was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WEAPONS SYSTEM: OFFLINE</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hanger where the drone was kept was connected to the bunker through a dumbwaiter system with an airlock.  While I waited for the drone to be brought down, I looked through the equipment until I found what I was looking for; a small-caliber pistol designed to attach to the drone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arming the drone, and sending it back up, I went back to the intercom; thinking to myself \u2013<i>Now let's see how you feel about threatening Ashley and Caleb, asshole.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the controls in hand, I flew the drone to the front yard; where I saw Patrick and a group of men inside the garage.  Piping myself through the drone, I said, \u201cI\u2019m giving you all one last chance; leave now and never come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told you, kid; I\u2019m getting inside whether you like it or not.\u201d Staring menacingly at the drone, Patrick said, \u201cLet\u2019s go boys; it\u2019s supper time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven within the confined space of the garage, I was able to line up a shot and take out one of the attackers.  I quickly moved the drone out of the line of fire, before taking down another one.  They knew I was serious by that point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still getting in, kid.\u201d Reaching for the keypad, he said, \u201cMy brother set up an access code, and I\u2019m positive I know what it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as he grabbed the outer hatch; before he stiffened and fell to the ground.  Seeing his lifeless body, I thought to myself, <i>You might have known your brother; but did you forget he didn't want you anywhere near his stepdaughter?</i>  I\u2019d suspected there was a booby trap but had no way of knowing for sure until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to the intercom, I said, \u201cLeave the dead as a warning to others.  If I ever see any of you again, I\u2019ll shoot you on sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the leadership position suddenly vacant, and with three fewer mouths to feed, the surviving cannibals took my offer and beat a hasty retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited a few moments, making sure they\u2019d truly left, before bringing the drone back.  Once it was secure in the hanger, I went looking for Ashley and found her in the sleeping area with Caleb.  \u201cIt's all clear, they\u2019re gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley wasn't at ease yet. \"What about Patrick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise you he\u2019ll never trouble you again.\u201d Watching as Ashley tucked Caleb into bed, I said, \u201cHow\u2019s Caleb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe heard everything Patrick said; I had to promise that we\u2019d keep him safe.  He was so shaken up, he called me Mommy by accident.\u201d sighing, Ashley said, \u201cAre you sure they\u2019re gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m positive; it\u2019s over, Ash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to believe you, Jamie; but you don\u2019t know Patrick the way I do.\u201d Shaking, Ashley said, \u201cHe\u2019s relentless; he won\u2019t give up as long there\u2019s breath in his body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Ashley\u2019s hand, I led her into the main room; I punched up some photos from the drone to show her.  \u201cTake a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... is he... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead?  He punched in a code he thought would work; I guess your step-dad had a builtin booby trap.  He took enough amps to kill him instantly; your stepdad was looking out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley held me while she absorbed this; then she kissed me.  Then she kissed me again, harder.  I returned the kiss and she then began pulling at my clothes.  Soon enough we were on the couch having sex.</span></div></div>",

It was almost as if we were always reaching for the same thing at the same time.  Once our hands touched, we\u2019d turn and smile at each other.  Even when we weren't working together, we'd find a reason to watch the other person work, and that would make us smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat proved the second part was, now and then, Ash would get this look in her eye.  Whenever she got that look, we\u2019d put Caleb to bed for the night; then she\u2019d pull me to the couch where we\u2019d make love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my 19th birthday when it finally happened.  First, during breakfast, Ashley kissed me and said, \u201cHappy birthday, Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d been careful about how we acted around Caleb, but it was inevitable that he\u2019d see us kiss now and then.  At first, he thought it was gross, now it barely fazed him.  Looking up from his cereal, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday, Jamie?  I never heard you ask for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to anymore, Caleb; all we\u2019d get is things we already have.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cSo instead we\u2019re celebrating the most important thing; that we have each other. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley baked me a cake that night, and it tasted much better than the one I\u2019d made for her.  After that, we watched a movie, nothing too raunchy since Caleb was watching too.  Throughout the movie, Ashley was giving me The Look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie was over, we tucked Caleb in for the night, then went to the couch and made love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we\u2019d finished, Ashley and I snuggled together on the couch.  Looking at me, with a look of pure happiness, she said, \u201cI love you, Jamie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand down her waist, I said, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to know a secret?  Something that I've never told anybody before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you since high school.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cSeriously, I would dream about you every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked; the most attractive girl in school had been in love with me.  \u201cWhy did you never say anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told my mom a few years ago that I thought you were cute, but she just laughed and said you weren\u2019t good enough for me.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cIt was the way she said it that got to me: like you and I were barely the same species, and I'd lose everything if I tried anything with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why now?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean aside from the fact that the world is destroyed and everything is pretty much gone already?  You\u2019ll probably hate me for saying this, but it took the world ending for me to realize there\u2019s more to life than social strata.\" She looked me straight in the eye. \"Like being with the man you love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we\u2019re sharing secrets, I\u2019ve got one for you.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you since high school too.  But my friends all said you were out of my league, and my mom didn\u2019t like what your mom was saying about me.

Then, we made love again.</span></div></div>",

As soon as I climbed out of the hatch, I noticed just how much damage the cannibals had caused to the garage in their attempt to enter the bunker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d torn down one of the garage doors and pretty much destroyed the remaining car in the garage.  I\u2019d seen it through the drone, but seeing it in person was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also noticed the three bodies lying on the ground.  I stared at them for a brief moment before I decided to relocate them to the side of the house.  It took some doing but I managed to do it.  I was in the process of moving Patrick\u2019s body when Ashley\u2019s voice came over the earpiece.  \u201cHow\u2019s it looking up there, Jamie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad, actually; the snow has covered pretty much the entire area.\u201d Looking around the yard, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t think about what caused it, the view is almost serene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t stay up there too long, alright?\u201d pausing, Ashley said, \u201cJust find out if the cannibals left any supplies behind that we can use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, dear.\u201d With a sarcastic tone, I said, \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that you mention it; could you clean the gutters and mow the lawn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I started towards the cannibal\u2019s abandoned camp, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cannibals must\u2019ve fled in a hurry because they left everything behind.  As I picked through everything, I sardonically prayed that they were dead.  If anyone deserves to die, it\u2019s them.  I\u2019d already rolled up two tents that were in the best condition; along with some sleeping bags and some canned goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found a cooler near where they had their fire; I went to open it and immediately regretted it.  I had to take my helmet off to vomit at the sight of several severed limbs.  I decided then and there to relocate the cooler away from here.  Once that was finished, I grabbed the supplies and started heading back towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I approached the house, I looked to the east and smiled; seeing the faintest glimmer of the sun trying to peek through the ash layer.</span></div></div>",

We were still new to the whole parenting thing, and it wasn\u2019t like we could ask anyone for pointers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Caleb was down for the night, Ashley and I went looking for a more private spot for lovemaking than the couch.

After all, it was his 5<sup>th</sup> birthday.  I\u2019ll admit to feeling bad for him, he was at the age where he was supposed to be starting kindergarten; instead, he was holed up in an underground bunker for the next 3 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of life he\u2019ll have once we\u2019re back on the surface.

In fact, over the last few days, I\u2019d noticed her acting somewhat differently around me.  After hanging up the last of the streamers, I walked over to the kitchen.  Coming up behind her, I wrapped my arms around her and said, \u201cHave I told you lately how amazing you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve said it a few times.\u201d Turning around, Ashley said, \u201cBut once more wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, here goes.\u201d Kissing her, I said, \u201cYou are the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Kissing me back, Ashley said, \u201cYou are the most amazing man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on now, you\u2019re just saying that because I\u2019m your boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a part of it, but I\u2019ve always thought you were amazing.\u201d Her mood turning sullen, Ashley said, \u201cAs long as we\u2019re together, I know everything will be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading between the lines, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if there was something on Ashley\u2019s mind.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cHey is there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the cake, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, after Caleb\u2019s party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though we couldn\u2019t give him presents, Ashley and I made sure Caleb had an enjoyable birthday.

As one would expect with all the sugar he\u2019d had, Caleb eventually tired himself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting him down for a nap, I walked back into the main room; where Ashley was taking the streamers down from the wall.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cI think Caleb enjoyed the party, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I bruised a few ribs from all his hugs; but yeah I think he enjoyed it.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIs now a good time for us to talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Ashley hesitate for a moment; clearly whatever she wanted to talk about had her worried.  Stepping down from the stool, she walked over to me.  \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way for me to say this, so I\u2019ll just come right out with it.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Ashley said, \u201cI\u2019m late.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The good news was that we did have pregnancy tests. The bad news; the boxes recommended taking them first thing in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Day 121:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of us slept very soundly that night; we were both understandably terrified.  How could we possibly raise two children in a bunker?  What kind of life would they have down here?  What if they never felt the sun on their faces or the smell in the air after it rained?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both got up at the crack of dawn, or rather when the lights turned on.  After making sure that Caleb was still asleep, Ashley went to take the test while I paced around the main area.  The five minutes we had to wait seemed like an eternity, but eventually, it was ready and Ashley went to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came back in, holding the test, I looked at her and said, \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit I was a little relieved.

That became even more important after Caleb walked in on us having sex.

The idea was to turn that into a bedroom for Caleb, while Ashley and I took the sleeping area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, I was suiting up to venture up to the surface; in the hopes of scavenging some things from Ashley\u2019s bedroom.  Once I was secure inside the suit, I made my way to the ladder where I found Ashley waiting for me.  \u201cI probably sound like a broken record, but promise you\u2019ll be careful up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will; I promise.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be on Channel 3 if you want to chat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been on the surface for about 25 minutes, putting what I could salvage into some boxes I\u2019d brought with me.  I\u2019d been primarily focusing on the stuffed animals that Ashley had in her room, but I also rummaged through a box of children\u2019s books in her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the middle of closing up one of the boxes when I heard a noise in the hallway.  I\u2019d seen some animal footprints on the ground the last few times I\u2019d taken the drone out, so I knew there was some surviving wildlife in the area.  I was more than a little worried that there might be an animal in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sound grew closer, I was grateful that I\u2019d brought a handgun with me.  Removing it from the holster, I aimed it towards the door as I noticed a faint shadow moving on the floor.  In the hopes of scaring off whatever was out there, I fired off a quick shot.  This was quickly followed by the sound of Ashley frantically saying, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!  It\u2019s me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lowered the gun as Ashley, wearing an environmental suit of her own, appeared in the doorway.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI could have shot you! What the hell are you doing up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been cooped up underground for 4 months; forgive me for wanting to come up for some air.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou left Caleb down there alone?\u201d shocked, I said, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me some credit, Jamie.\u201d Even with the helmet on, I could tell she was annoyed.  \u201cI closed the hatch after I came up; besides, he\u2019s so focused on his movies that he\u2019ll barely realize we\u2019re gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine.\u201d Getting back to work, I said, \u201cI just wish you would\u2019ve told me you were planning this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough, I\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d Going to look out her window, overlooking what was once a spacious backyard, Ashley said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to remember what all this used to look like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we\u2019re having difficulty picturing what the world used to look like, can you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sentence was cut off when, in the process of retrieving something from the closet, I stumped back into a bookshelf.

I don\u2019t know if it was adrenaline or what, but she lifted the shelf off my leg just enough for me to move.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Ashley went to get Caleb, I stepped back into the coop and gently lifted the deceased chicken out.  I was in the process of laying it atop a garbage bag when Ashley and Caleb walked into the room.  Almost immediately Caleb noticed what I was doing and said, \u201cDaddy, what are you doing with Marshmallow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst my better judgment, a few months back, I had agreed to let Caleb name the chickens.  I didn\u2019t want him getting too attached to them, particularly in events such as this.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid Marshmallow is dead, Caleb.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cShe must\u2019ve been sick for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she going to be alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having enough understanding to believe that his parents were dead, it seemed as though Caleb didn\u2019t truly have a grasp on the concept.  I exchanged a glance with Ashley, before saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Caleb, but Marshmallow isn\u2019t going to get better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravity of the situation slowly dawned on Caleb; as he started tearing up.  Getting on her knees, Ashley pulled him in for a hug as he started to cry.  \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright, sweetie; Marshmallow had a good long life.\u201d  Rubbing his back, Ashley said, \u201cYour dad has to go up to the surface to bury her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes he have to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, buddy.\u201d Turning away from Marshmallow\u2019s body, I said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t bury her, then the bunker will start to smell pretty bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb insisted that we have a quick funeral for Marshmallow; once that was finished I put her in the garbage bag and headed for the surface.  I walked to a point about a \u00bc mile from the bunker; in an area just above a small creek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had some difficulty digging a deep enough hole, but after 45 minutes of trying, I managed to dig one.  After placing the bag in the hole, I filled it back in.  I was about to head back to the bunker when something caught my eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards a nearby tree, I saw a faint glint of light reflecting off something.  Moving closer to inspect it, I saw that it was a small picture frame half-buried in the snow.  Digging out of the snow, my jaw dropped when I saw what it was a picture of \u2013 Caleb and his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frame was cracked in several places but the photo was in decent condition.  Looking around the area, I figured they must\u2019ve sent up camp in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the frame in hand, I started back to the bunker; calling Ashley on the radio, \u201cHey Ash, I\u2019m on my way back; I think I found something that will make Caleb feel better about Marshmallow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Knocking on the door, I said, \u201cCaleb it\u2019s dad.  Can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence before the door opened; Caleb was standing there and it looked like he\u2019d been crying.  \u201cDid you bury Marshmallow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah kiddo, I buried her by the creek.\u201d Kneeling, I said, \u201cWhile I was out there, I found something I think you\u2019ll want to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d wiping his eyes, Caleb said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found this buried in the snow by the creek.\u201d Turning the frame towards Caleb, I said, \u201cI thought you might want to have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stared at the photo for a second; before he took it from me and started crying.  Ashley and I watched as he alternated between looking at it and holding it to his chest.  After a few minutes of this, he gently placed the frame on his dresser and turned his attention back to us.  Hugging me, he said, \u201cThank you, daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, little man.\u201d Rubbing Caleb\u2019s back, I said, \u201cNow you have something to remember your parents by.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley and I have spent the last 9 months cut off from the outside world; save for our interactions with Caleb\u2019s parents and the cannibals.  That\u2019s a long time to only have two other people you can talk to.  We made it work; but it wasn\u2019t without its difficulties, especially during Ashley\u2019s time of the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Ashley and I moved into the bunker, we\u2019d had a ham radio turned on; scanning every frequency for signs of outside contact.  For 9 months we\u2019d heard nothing but static \u2013 but that was soon going to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been having trouble sleeping for almost a week, so it wasn\u2019t surprising when I woke up at 6:30 in the morning.  Seeing that Ashley was still asleep, I gently kissed her on the forehead and climbed out of bed.  I then proceeded to check on Caleb, as I\u2019d done every day for the last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just checked on Caleb, I walked through the living area to get something to eat.  I spotted in my tracks when I noticed a blinking light coming from the ham radio.  I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn\u2019t dreaming; as a blinking light meant the radio had found an active frequency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tripped over some of Caleb\u2019s toys as I ran across to the radio.  I turned up the volume as I put on the headset, catching the tail end of a transmission:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...unker on a frequency of 51.53Mhz.  Is anyone receiving me on this frequency?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I scrambled for the microphone I hoped they were still listening.  \u201cHe-Hello?  This is Jamie Lincoln, can you hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feared the worst when all I heard for a moment was static.  After a moment a woman\u2019s voice came over the headset.  \u201cJamie Lincoln, this is Corporal Elena Reyes transmitting from the Appalachian Bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made my heart skip a beat; the Appalachian Bunker was where I would\u2019ve been evacuated to.  After composing myself, I said, \u201cD-Did you say the Appalachian Bunker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct\u201d there was a brief pause, before Corporal Reyes said, \u201cWhere are you transmitting from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must\u2019ve been making too much noise because suddenly Ashley was standing in the doorway with an annoyed look on her face.  \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?  It\u2019s 6:45 in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the microphone down, I said, \u201cThe radio picked up a signal; it\u2019s the Appalachian Bunker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d her annoyed look turned to shock, Ashley said, \u201cA-Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unplugged the headset just as Corporal Reyes started speaking again.  \u201cJamie Lincoln, are you still there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ashley stood there, stunned, I picked up the microphone and said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m here.  I\u2019m transmitting from a bunker in Granby, West Virginia.\u201d Catching my breath, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve with my wife and our 5-year-old son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorporal Reyes took down all our information; including how we were left behind during the evacuation.  After a few minutes, she came back over the radio and said, \u201cJamie, we\u2019ve been able to locate your wife\u2019s family; they\u2019re alive and well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Ashley started to tear up.  Reaching for the microphone, she said, \u201cC-Can I talk with them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, ma\u2019am; we\u2019ve already sent for them.\u201d Pausing, Corporal Reyes said, \u201cJamie, sir, we...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew what she was going to say; they weren\u2019t able to find my family.  \u201cYou won\u2019t find them, Corporal Reyes, because my family is dead.  They were in the destroyed bus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my turn to tear up at this point.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was thrilled that Ashley was going to speak with her family.  I just wish that I had that chance as well.  So you can imagine how I reacted when Corporal Reyes came back on and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Jamie; your family is alive.  We\u2019ve sent for them as well.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That was until Mom said, \u201cYour father and sister are here.  We\u2019d love to know who the lucky woman is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing how my mom felt about Ashley, I was hesitant to say anything.

Instead, she showed the same restraint that she\u2019s developed over the last few months.  \u201cI had that coming, Mrs. Lincoln; but I assure you that I\u2019m improving.\u201d Stepping closer to the transmitter, Ashley said, \u201cYour son risked everything to save me, and I\u2019ve spent every day for 9 months making sure I\u2019m worthy of him.  You should be very proud of him, ma\u2019am; you and your husband did an excellent job raising him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone had a chance to respond to that, Caleb stepped forward and said, \u201cAre you my gramma?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Although, I would have loved to see the look on his face when he got my surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of Ashley talking with her step-dad, I heard another voice come over the speaker.  \u201cJamie, this is Lt. Heidicker. I'd like you to give me some idea of your supplies if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave him an idea of how many supplies were already in place at the bunker, what we brought with us when we came down, and what we'd used up or given to Caleb's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it sounds like you've got a good supply, kid. You should be set at least until we give the all-clear.\" He started breaking up. \"I think that's about it for now... your frequency... when we can.\" That was all we could hear until the storm blew over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in years, a storm didn't frighten me. I had talked to my family. They were alive. And, if we weren't all on good terms yet, we had time to make up.</span></div></div>",

We split the duties between us; Ashley took the alphabet while I took the numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d always suspected that Caleb was able to read a little bit; because he didn\u2019t have any problems finding a particular movie to watch.  Ashley always thought it was because he recognized the labels; but, after seeing that he recognized a fair amount of letters, she realized I was right.  That made me wonder if his parents had enrolled him in daycare or preschool before the world went to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick lunch, it was my turn to teach him.  This was where we ran into a little difficulty; he was able to count to six without issue but couldn't count to ten.  He grew more agitated with each failed attempt; until, at one point, he started crying.  I had to stop my lessons and go over to comfort him.  Coming down to his level, I wiped his tears and said, \u201cCaleb, it\u2019s alright; you\u2019ll get there.\u201d Looking around to see if Ashley was nearby, I leaned closer and said, \u201cBetween you and me; I had trouble with my numbers too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You did?\u201d sniffling, Caleb said, \u201cB-But you\u2019re the smartest person I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate the vote of confidence, buddy; but I\u2019m not <i>that</i> smart.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never told her this, but I think your mother is smarter than me.  She\u2019s certainly smarter than she gives herself credit for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t realize Ashley had walked back into the room; until I heard her say, \u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short, babe; after all my 1450 SAT score is pretty meaningless right now.\u201d Seeing the tears on Caleb\u2019s face, Ashley walked over and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got a little frustrated with the numbers; but I think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Checking the clock, I said, \u201cIn fact, I think now\u2019s a good time to end for the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d a smile on his face, Caleb said, \u201cCan I watch a movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot until your chores are finished.\u201d With a semi-stern tone, Ashley said, \u201cI saw about a half-dozen eggs in the coop.  After you pick them up, feed the chickens, and then you can watch a movie.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ashley and I had just finished giving status reports to various department heads, so it was time to chat with our folks.  I was making a cup of instant coffee when Ashley came walking over to me, a worried look on her face.  \u201cSo, uh, my mom wants to talk with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well that Ashley\u2019s mom didn\u2019t approve of me, I couldn\u2019t help but worry about what was going to come next.  \u201cDid she say about what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she just said she wanted to talk with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ashley following behind me, for support, I walked over to the radio.  Grabbing hold of the microphone, I said, \u201cMrs. Saunders?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her opinion of me, I wasn\u2019t surprised when she didn\u2019t say hello or anything like that.  Instead, with a bit of an attitude, she said, \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019re even remotely worthy of <i>my</i> daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean aside from the fact that I risked my life to rescue her?  Something neither you nor her ex-boyfriend could be bothered to do?\u201d hearing Ashley give a faint chuckle, I continued, \u201cI\u2019ve done more for her in the last 10 months than you probably have in your entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, how dare you.\u201d Getting angry, I said, \u201cI love your daughter more than anything in the world.  If you can\u2019t get past your low opinion of me to see that she loves me too, then I feel sorry for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing, as we heard her mom stammer over the radio.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, young man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio went silent for a few moments; enough time for Ashley to look at me and say, \u201cYou\u2019re my hero, Jamie; you did what I was afraid to do for years.  You stood up to my mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI survived the end of the world; dealing with my mother-in-law is a piece of cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Elena\u2019s voice came over the speaker; \u201cYou guys mind explaining why I nearly got trampled in the hallway by a <i>very</i> irate woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, Elena.\u201d Grabbing the microphone, Ashley said, \u201cJamie just told my mom off, and I guess she wasn\u2019t happy about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish I could\u2019ve been here to witness that.\u201d Chuckling, Elena said, \u201cI spoke with the teacher in charge of the kindergarten program; she\u2019s more than willing to let Caleb participate in her class every few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for doing that, Elena.\u201d Smiling, Ashley said, \u201cWe figured a trained teacher would be a better choice than us teaching him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that, Ashley.\u201d Chuckling, Elena said, \u201cBefore I let you guys go, there was something I wanted to ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and I looked at each other; wondering what was about to happen.  Taking the microphone, I said, \u201cGo ahead, Elena.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie; I was wondering if, during our weekly contact, you\u2019d like to play a game of chess?\u201d pausing, Elena said, \u201cI\u2019m not nearly as good as Ashley, but I think I can still give you a challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll scrounge up a chess set; see you in a week.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ashley and I choked up a little when we overheard him say that he\u2019s grateful that we took him in and that he loves us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Caleb stopped talking about the bunker; I guess the teacher said the students had questions for him.

You deserve to be with someone who can provide for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to contain my anger; after all, I could only take so much.  Meanwhile, Ashley stepped closer and said, \u201cJamie\u2019s doing a fine job of providing for me, Mother; the bunker\u2019s fine and we\u2019ve got enough supplies to last for 3 years.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, <br>\r\n\u201cWe both know that Eric wouldn\u2019t have been able to do half of what Jamie\u2019s done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose my only consolation is that you haven't gotten in trouble yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a moment to realize what exactly Mrs. Saunders meant by that remark.  I\u2019d walked over to the kitchen to clean up a mess Caleb left, while Ashley continued her conversation.  \u201cFor your information, Mother, we came pretty close a few months back.\u201d Sighing, Ashley said, \u201cThere are times that I find myself wishing that it hadn\u2019t been a false alarm; because I would certainly be a much better mother than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you, you ungrateful child; after everything I\u2019ve done for you.\u201d Practically screaming, Mrs. Saunders said, \u201cYou\u2019d be nothing if it weren\u2019t for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood in the kitchen, I watched Ashley start fuming; to the point where I imagined smoke coming from her ears.  \u201cYou know, Mother; this whole time I thought I was missing out on not being with you in that bunker.\u201d Grabbing the microphone, Ashley said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the more I hear you talk; the happier I am that I won\u2019t see you for another 3 years.  I can only hope that\u2019s long enough to undo all the damage you\u2019ve done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley Saunders, if you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smug grin, Ashley reached over and flipped the power switch for the radio.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cThat felt good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to her, holding a glass in my hands, I said, \u201cHow come you never told me about that thing with the pregnancy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how you\u2019d react; if you\u2019d feel the same way that I did.\u201d Looking at me, Ashley said, \u201cI do want to have your baby, Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew where this was leading; because it\u2019s happened several times over the last several months.  Ashley was going to try and convince me to get her pregnant, and I\u2019d have to talk her out of it.  I hated having to do that; because I wanted nothing more than to have a baby with her.  But the situation we found ourselves in wasn\u2019t conducive to raising a newborn.  \u201cAsh, how many times have we talked about this?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next couple of weeks weren\u2019t good for Ashley; I was beginning to think the stress from our situation was getting to her, and the news of her parent\u2019s separation didn\u2019t help matters.  She\u2019d grown withdrawn; barely saying anything to me or Caleb the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb, for his part, didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on; but he knew his mother wasn\u2019t happy.  He tried to cheer her up but it didn\u2019t work.  Things came to a head this morning when I woke up to find that Ashley wasn\u2019t in bed.  I sat up in bed as I heard an alarm blaring in the distance; one I quickly recognized as the air quality alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scrambled out of bed and made my way to the maintenance room; my concern about Ashley\u2019s whereabouts superseded for the moment.  I was justifiably confused when a look at the monitoring system showed that all the filters were working at or above 90%.  Walking through the bunker, I soon realized the source of the problem \u2013 the surface hatch was open, and there was a suit missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb came walking out of his room at the point.  Rubbing his eyes, he said, \u201cDaddy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo back to your room, little man.\u201d Clamoring into the other suit, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes I was up on the surface; I made my way around the outside of the house but found no sign of footprints.  I\u2019d been calling out for Ashley for the last five minutes but got no response.  I was about to go back and use the drone when I saw a flash of light coming from one of the upstairs windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing back into the house, I went upstairs to find Ashley in what had been her parents\u2019 bedroom; lying on the bed as she looked at a photo album.  Walking up to her, I said, \u201cAsh, what the hell are you doing?  You\u2019re not supposed to come to the surface without telling me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo emotion in her voice, Ashley said, \u201cI wanted to find proof that my parents did truly love each other.\u201d Gesturing to the photo album, Ashley said, \u201cThey\u2019re smiling in every one of those photos; they were happy and in love.  What could have possibly changed all that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople fall out of love, Ash, it happens all the time.\u201d Sitting next to Ashley, I said, \u201cJust look at you and Brian; you guys were happy together, or at least you appeared that way.  It\u2019s not your fault that he cheated on you; just like it\u2019s not you\u2019re not to blame for your parents separating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was silent for a moment; until she looked at me and said, \u201cWhat if that happens to us?  What if we reach a point where we no longer love each other?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, Ash.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d even think that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you blame me though?  We both hid our true feelings from each other for years; then we get married after dating for barely 3 months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly realized what she was getting at.  Taking her hand, I said, \u201cAre you concerned that we moved too quickly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley went silent again, thinking about her answer.  After a moment, she looked at me and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After feeling around for a moment, I pulled out a small number of wires. Details aside, I got the truck started and pulled the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Jamie...\" Wincing, Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and found a number of rioters running for the truck. \"Hang on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hit the accelerator, sending the truck screaming forward and drove through the lot, straight for the exit. Two rioters got into vehicles and gave chase. \"they're after us for stealing a truck!\" Frightened, Ashley yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're after us because they're all mad and need someone to blame.\" Serious, I countered. \"We're just teenagers so we're easy targets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gulped at that, it was not a pleasant thought. The two who had jumped into cars to gave chase used their cars to block the exit but I was taught how to drive on the back roads. \"Jamie, they're blocking our way out!\" Screaming, Ashley warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a chuckle. \"Buckle up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's eyes went wide before buckling herself up and grabbed onto her seat for dear life. I turned the wheel and charged the car off the lot into the grass towards an old dirt road in a nearby forest. <i>\"They're nuts if they give chase.\"</i> glancing at the rear view I thought. <i>\"Only a four by four can handle these roads.\"</i> To my surprise, the two cars did give chase onto the road. <i>\"Yup... they're nuts.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are insane!\" Angry, Ashley yelled. \"You are insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're insane for following.\" Darkly, I replied. \"This road was not made with luxury cruisers in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for my words to ring true as I took a sharp turn on the dirt road. the first car was not able to turn fast enough and ended up sliding sideways right into a tree at high speed. The second ca managed to make the turn only the diver was not ready for a steep hill shortly after. While the four by four was able to climb the hill, the car fell short and rolled back before flipping three times to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you do know what you are doing...\" Wincing, Ashley muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got away from them, that's all that matters.\" Softly, I said. \"What we need to do now is find some form of shelter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we follow the buses?\" Shrugging, Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The route was top secret as was the location of the bunkers.\" Serious, I replied. \"Even if we knew where their route and where they were going, the fragments are hitting sooner than predicted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means Samson may hit sooner than predicted.\" Pale, Ashley said. \"Why an old four by four though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The newer models have safeguards to protect from the old tricks.\" Serious, I replied. \"Now focus, do you know of any place close hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed, tears forming. \"I know a place...\" Whispering, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Ashley's instructions and we soon arrived at...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We soon arrived at a huge ten foot steel door built into the sheer face of a mountain. Ashley jumped out of the truck and hurried to it, fumbling through her purse. She soon produced a key card and inserted it into a small crevice near the door. A low beep was heard and a panel opened revealing a keypad. She punched in a code, opening a another panel that looked like a scanner. \"Put your left hand onto the screen.\" Serious, she ordered. \"I'm logging you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I placed my hand onto the sensor and I felt the sensor vibrate before a beep was heard. Ashley then pushed me aside to place her hand onto the screen. Again, a beep was heard and she removed her key card. Both panels closed and a deep hollow clang was heard before the heavy steel door slowly lifted. \"Walk casually, don't run.\" Darkly, Ashley warned. \"You will understand once you pass the main hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and followed Ashley inside where she again inserted her key card and punched in a code. The heavy door slowly fell, sealing the entrance with a heavy clang and a hiss before she motioned me to follow. The entry hall was cared out of solid rock and seemed to go on forever. Upon reaching the end, I was greeted by an awe inspiring sight. We were at the edge of an underground cavern abyss. \"Welcome to Demon's Mouth cavern.\" Calmly, Ashley said. \"My father discovered it ten years ago and built a fortress to survive almost literally anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out over the abyss and found several stone bridges leading to a stone fortress on the other side deep inside the mountain. \"It looks familiar...\" Curious, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed. \"It was inspired by a novel called The Buried kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped. \"My father wrote that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded. \"Why do you think he and your dad got along so well.\" Frowning, she said. \"He helped dad build it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned back. \"I don't remember him coming home with a pay check...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know what the deal was.\" Annoyed, Ashley spat. \"My father kept business and home strictly separate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"My dad was like that too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we don't exactly like each other... in fact we can't stand each other.\" Her face softening, Ashley said. \"However, like it or not, we need each other right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I knew Ashley was right and I offered my hand. \"A truce then...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley took my hand and shook it. \"Truce...\" She then turned to the bridges. \"I hope you know your father's novel better than me. Dad warned me that there was only one way to cross any one of the bridges or you will fall to your death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"The only was to cross is to walk slowly and lightly.\" Serious, I said. \"In the story, there are trap doors that will barely hold the weight of a grown man. If you run, the trap door opens but if you walk, it holds your weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gulped and nodded. Together, we carefully walked across the bridge without incident to the fortress itself. It looked almost exactly like a castle of old only, if it followed my father's story, the inside was even more awe inspiring. \"Do you have the key to the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded and inserted the same key card into a slot near the door. a panel opened revealing another key pad and scanner. she hit a code and motioned me to put my hand onto the scanner. She then did the same and the massive door opened. It looked much like a door to a safe with multiple heavy rods holding the door closed. We both walked through after Ashley retrieved her card. \"This is the furthest I have come into the fortress.\" Honestly, Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked beyond the door and smiled. \"Well, your father didn't exactly follow my dad's book on the internal design but still... not bad.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked passed me and gasped as she found...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The grand entry included two large fire places each with a generous supply of wood that reached to the high ceiling in a specially constructed chute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful...\" Whispering, Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"We can admire it later.\" To her frown, I said. \"We need to make certain this place is secure before Samson hits... it will be too late after impact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough annoyed, Ashley nodded. \"You're right... what do we do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find the control room.\" Serious, I said. \"I would imagine everything we need to activate, open or close would be operated from a central point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only where would it be?\" Wincing, Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally, I would put it in the center most room.\" Thoughtful, I replied. \"I suggest we work our way to the center of the castle and find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked about before walking to a picture hanging on the wall. \"The control center is twenty rooms in down the main hall.\" Studying the picture, she said. \"It's the last door before the center stairwells.\" She turned to me. \"Dad always framed the blueprints after each major job completed... his idea of a trophy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then studied the blueprints myself. \"The food stores are in the castle cellar and the armory is right next to the control center.\" Softly, I said. \"We better take stock of what we have after we lock down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded and we ran down the hall towards the control center...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She opened the case and tossed one key to me. \"What do we do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to turn them at the exact time to lock down the castle.\" Serious, I said. \"It is designed to prevent one person from locking everyone else out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" Wincing, Ashley said. \"So... we lock everything down now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was answered by an alarm suddenly sounding. I turned to a screen and swore under my breath. \"Samson has hit early!\" Panicked, I announced. \"We need to lock down now or we won't make it through the impact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gulped then nodded. We inserted our key and on the count of three, we turned our key at the same time. More alarms sounded and we watched nervously as the monitors showed one heavy door after another slowly closing downwards with a loud clang and hiss. Just as the last door sealed, the entire castle was rocked with the shock waves from the meteor impact. Ashley and I both screamed as we were thrown off our feet. Sparks flew from the controls, lights above us burst, the monitors went dark and the power went out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, a low hum was heard and the lights that had not burst flickered back on with the monitors soon following. \"Are- Are you okay...?\" Weakly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still alive...\" Weakly, Ashley replied. \"You were right about Samson hitting early. Were we able to seal the base in time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" Wincing, I replied. I struggled to my feet then helped Ashley to hers. \"We will need to check the cameras, if they still work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the controls and activated the remote cameras. To my relief, all of the heavy gates were sealed and holding. I then switched to the external cameras and gulped. Everything, literally everything was on fire through the heavy haze... even the city in the far distance. \"Mom... dad... Emma...\" Whispering, I cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley touched my shoulder. \"I'm fearful for my family too.\" Whispering, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then switched back to the internal cameras. \"We- We should take stalk on- on what we have on supply.\" Tearfully, I stammered. \"There's nothing else to do right now, anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to walk out of the control room.

There were so much dust and smoke in the air that the sky looked like a perpetual sunset.  I probably would\u2019ve thought it pretty had it not been for what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Ashley Saunders, I\u2019m a 17-year-old girl from West Virginia and I\u2019m praying the I survive the coming apocalypse.  My boyfriend Eric and I were on a bus heading to the Appalachian Bunker; a large underground complex, underneath the Appalachian Mountains, designed to hold 3000 for three years.  Admittance to the bunker was determined by a lottery; both Eric\u2019s family and mine had been evacuated in an earlier group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from a dozing Eric, I looked out the window to see another fragment enter the atmosphere in the distance.  I watched it until it went below the tree line, followed seconds later by the tremors caused by its impact.  <i>I can\u2019t believe the world is coming to an end.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so deep in thought that I failed to notice the large tree that had fallen in the road up ahead; thankfully the driver of the bus saw it just in time.  Unfortunately, the bus couldn\u2019t stop in time; everyone was rather violently bounced around as the bus went up and over the downed tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric woke up at that moment and, oblivious to the situation, turned to look at me. \u201cAre we there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared back out the window for a moment before turning to Eric in disdain.  \u201cNo Eric, we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d<br>\r\nAs the bus driver and the Evac leader got out to check the damage, Eric closed his eyes and said, \u201cWake me when we get there, alright babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rested my head against the seat back as I reconsidered some of my life decisions.  <i>I got straight A\u2019s in school; why am I dating a guy who flunked every class but lunch?</i>  Then I remembered why we were together; I was Cheer captain and he was the school\u2019s star quarterback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the bus, I spotted a familiar face a few rows behind me.  Jamie Lincoln wasn\u2019t in my social circle; but he was still a sweet guy, kind of dorky but still sweet.  I\u2019d never admit to it publicly but I\u2019d had a crush on him since the 8th grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI casually waved at him once I saw him looking at me; he waved back but I could tell he was confused.  I couldn\u2019t really blame him; after all, I spent the last 2 years making his life difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the distance, I could hear an approaching fragment burning its way through the atmosphere.  I found myself hoping that we\u2019d be moving again soon, but that hope was dashed when the driver came back on the bus a few minutes later.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry folks, but hitting that tree snapped the front axle clean in half.\u201d With a heavy sigh, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve called for another bus from Appalachia, but there\u2019s room for 6 if anyone doesn\u2019t feel like waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was then unloaded from the bus and left to spread out along the side of the road.  With my backpack in hand, I was heading towards a nearby rock when Eric grabbed my arm.  \u201cCome on babe, there\u2019s still three more spots on the bus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou go ahead, I\u2019ll wait for the next one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, incredulous, Eric said, \u201cWhat, are you serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith everything that\u2019s been going on, I think I just need some time to myself.\u201d Looking at him, feeling rather despondent, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch up to you at the bunker, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t surprised in the least when Eric didn\u2019t even try to convince me otherwise.  \u201cOkay then, I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d<br>\r\nI watched as Eric turned and headed back towards the buses; making a bee-line for an attractive girl standing outside the bus.  I sat down on the rock and watched as they boarded the bus, mere moments before it drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t been lying when I told Eric I wanted time to myself; I was taking the opportunity to rethink my entire relationship with him.  <br>\r\nThere were some good times in our one-year-long relationship; but honestly, were they enough to justify staying with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so deep in thought that I hadn\u2019t realized someone was next to me; until I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard someone say, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to my right, I saw _______. </span></div></div>",

You look like you\u2019re in pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuring the chaos out there I think I twisted my ankle.\u201d Wincing, Jamie said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much further I can go before the pain becomes too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps in the distance, I realized it wasn\u2019t going to be long before someone found us.  I didn\u2019t want to wait to see if they were good or not.  Turning back to Jamie, I said, \u201cThe nurses\u2019 office is right down the hall; if we can get there, I\u2019ll see about fixing your ankle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny trepidation that Jamie might\u2019ve had vanished as the sound of approaching footsteps got louder.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll be better off with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my arm wrapped under Jamie\u2019s shoulder for support, the two of us slowly made our way down the hall.  It took us a few minutes to get there, but we finally made it.  Still supporting Jamie with one arm, I used my other arm to try and open the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, it\u2019s locked.\u201d Banging on the door, I said, \u201cHello is anyone in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter no answer, I started to panic; it wouldn\u2019t be long before Jamie and I were found.  Jamie was in no condition to fight; and, given the current situation, I didn\u2019t want to think about what would happen to me.  I started knocking on the door again, \u201cPlease let us in; I\u2019m begging you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few seconds went by before I heard the lock disengage, and the door opened a crack to reveal ____.</span></div></div>",

Looking at the two of us, he said, <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s injured; I just want to get some things to help him.\u201d Getting nervous, I said, \u201cPlease let us in, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to suspect the man wasn\u2019t alone in the office, because I watched him lean behind the door and whisper to someone.  I couldn\u2019t understand what was being said, but soon the man turned back to me and said, \u201cOkay, you can come in; but don\u2019t take too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI helped Jamie into the room; only then did I notice a woman sitting nearby holding a scared little boy in her arms.  They seemed to shaken up about something but I figured it was the pending disaster.  After putting Jamie on one of the beds, I turned back to the man and said, \u201cThank you for letting us in; I was a little worried there for a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me regret letting you in; I won\u2019t let any harm come to my family.\u201d Gesturing to Jamie, the man said, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve tended to his injuries, you\u2019re out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled about the idea of heading back out there, but I didn\u2019t want to overstay my welcome.  Giving the man a brief nod, I went to check on Jamie.  While I slowly rolled up his pants leg, he looked at me and said, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound unappreciative; but why are <i>you</i> helping me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDespite what you probably think of me, I\u2019m not a bad person.\u201d Looking up at Jamie, I said, \u201cJust because I made your life difficult in school doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d let you die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDifficult?\u201d scoffing, Jamie said, \u201cYou did more than make my life difficult; you were a downright jerk to me all through High School.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we can waste time discussing every terrible thing I did to you in school, or you can let me help you.\u201d Getting annoyed, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s your choice, Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the situation we were in, I grew visibly annoyed when Jamie paused to think it over.  After a moment, he said, \u201cOkay fine, I guess you\u2019re better than nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was settled I got up and walked over to the supply cabinet.  I was digging through the supplies for some bandages when I felt someone step up behind me.  Thinking it was the man keeping an eye on me, I turned around; only to see the woman staring at me.  \u201cTurn around; make it look like you\u2019re still searching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was confused but decided to comply.  As I went back to searching, I said, \u201cIs something wrong, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son and I are in danger; can you help us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in danger, ma\u2019am; that asteroid is going to strike in three days.\u201d Glancing back at the man, who was standing by the door, I said, \u201cBesides I think your husband can take care of the situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat man\u2019s not my husband.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s holding my son and me hostage.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He just clung tightly to me as we sat in the corner.  I watched as Jamie waved the man over to him; saying, \u201cDo you mind helping me use the bathroom?\u201d pausing, Jamie said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel right asking one of the girls to help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Helping Jamie to his feet, the man said, \u201cI had an injury like that a few years ago; I couldn\u2019t put any weight on it for almost a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man helped Jamie towards the bathroom, I found myself feeling a little sorry for him.  Sure he\u2019d taken a woman and her son hostage; but he was only trying to survive.  The woman, waiting until they got closer to the bathroom before she pounced, slowly came up behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his credit, Jamie was doing what he could to string the guy along; asking him about what he did before the world went to hell and other questions of that nature.  \u201cI was a history teacher at a community college a few towns over.\u201d pausing to take a breath, oblivious to what was about to happen, the man said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get picked for the bunker, but I thought I could...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the man could finish his sentence, the woman smacked him across the back of the head with a garbage can.  While Jamie fell off to the side, out of the way, the woman removed the gun from the man\u2019s pants and shoved him into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly ran over to check on Jamie.  \u201cHow are you feeling, Jamie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d Grunting in pain, Jamie said, \u201cI think that guy was right; I won\u2019t be able to put any weight on this for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the man, we suddenly heard pounding coming from the other side of the door.  Appearing in the window, he said, <br>\r\n\u201cYou a**holes better let me out; or so help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d With a chuckle, the woman placed the gun against the glass and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got your gun, a**hole.  Next time you want to take someone hostage; why don\u2019t you make sure they\u2019re not a former Marine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe son came running over to his mom at that point.  As he hugged her, I said, \u201cWe should make a run for it while we still can; I don\u2019t think that door will hold forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove my point, the glass started to crack under the man\u2019s repeated punches.  \u201cI think I saw some transportation behind the building.\u201d Spotting a pair of crutches nearby, the woman looked at Jamie and said, \u201cDo you think you can keep up; or do we need a wheelchair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Hobbling over to the crutches, Jamie said, \u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here.\u201d</span></div></div>",
