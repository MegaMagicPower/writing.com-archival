Your master always liked to keep you close while you slept, although you weren't sure whether it was for warmth, or something else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing you did know about your master was that he was incredibly powerful. He only had to touch the wall and a miniature sun would appear above both your heads. He only had to hunting for an hour or two at most, and returned enough food to last for weeks. Said food was often alien enough to make you ill, particularly a strange brown bar that he had not realised he had dropped, allowing you to take a bite out of it before he threw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had gotten pretty ill after that, but your master never left your side, always making sure you were okay. It was a testament to your master's power that he could eat the brown bars without becoming violently ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master could even see distant places in the world, and even outer space, using a black rectangle in one of his rooms. He often invited you to sit next to him while he watched it, you laying your head in his lap. He also had a much smaller version in the room where he slept, being able to manipulate it to a larger degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shaken as your master rolls over slightly in his sleep, and hugs to to his chest. As he does so, you feel a bizarre tingling feeling run from his arms and into you, and it is only growing stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what this feeling was, but you begin to feel... Powerful, able to do anything for your master...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can sense a near infinite amount of the tingling energy in your master, so surely he wouldn't mind if you took some of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out a deep sigh as you look down at your hands, slowly relaxing your iron grip on the bedsheets that you'd grabbed when Lily had pushed your bed up into the corner of the room. When she'd first spoken, you couldn't help but dimly wonder if it were all some sort of bizarre dream. Then her flank had begun to push your furniture away, just like that, with literally no effort on her part she had casually brushed aside furniture that would take at least two people to move. You glanced over at the crushed remnants of what used to be the other bedside cabinet, which is now scattered across the area of the bed you weren't lying in. The bed is so tightly pressed against the wall that there is simply nowhere else for the scraps of wood to go. This was definitely no dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back to Lily, her immense bulk mere inches from your comparatively tiny form. Casting your gaze over the entirety of her massive frame, you could only gawk at the powerful musculature that flexed and swelled with even the slightest of movements. You swallowed thickly as you considered just how easily she had pushed away all of your furniture. Your bed, your dresser, everything. Brushed aside as if it weighed nothing, all without even trying. You couldn't even dare to begin to imagine just how strong she had to be now. You couldn't see anything else apart from the titanic frame of your pet Husky, so the only way you could estimate that the rest of your furniture was probably intact was that you hadn't heard any sounds of creaking or cracking wood as you had no doubts whatsoever that if she pressed against them, likely without even applying that much force, they'd be completely crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" Lily asks, her deeper voice rumbling through you. She looks down at you, again, her face is surprisingly expressive for a dog. You look up at her, your gaze moving from her massive flank, past her muscular chest, her thick neck and up to her big blue eyes, wide with awe. God, she was so beautiful. Her fur seemed so glossy, her musculature was incredibly well-defined even beneath the thick fur, her gaze was so sweet and kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" She asks again, her voice shaking you out of your daze. \"Ah, uh, yes, Lily?\" You stammer out, still trying to wrap your head around the fact that you now need to look up to look you dog in the eyes. You've never been more thankful for the old house's tall ceilings. They looked beautiful and while it did make heating the house a bit of a pain at times, you were sure that if the house had shorter ceilings Lily would have simply smashed straight through and into the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" She leans down, nosing into you gently, pushing you back slightly as her huge head presses into you. You let out a weak chuckle as her big, slightly wet, cold nose brushed against your head. She'd just grown into a literal giant of a dog and gained the ability to speak, her intelligence exponentially skyrocketing, yet here she was, worrying over you. You still had no idea what could have caused this, or how it was even possible, yet her thoughts were for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a warm smile come over your lips as you reassured her. \"Yeah, I'm fine thanks. I mean, I have no idea how this could even be possible, but, you know, I'll deal with it somehow. We'll deal with it.\" You smiled, prompting Lily's face to brighten up as her tail began to wag furiously, although given that it was pressed up against the wall, which if you strained your hearing, you could hear lightly groaning under the force her backside exerted upon it, it had rather limited motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to be honest, I'm kind of surprised you're so calm.\" You admitted, causing Lily to smile down at you - it was so strange to see her actually smiling like a person. \"Well... I don't really know how to describe the feeling of suddenly being so smart, so strong... so big...\" She trailed off before continuing. \"But, I need to stay calm for you Master!\" She beamed widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked. She was facing a situation she could never have dreamed of, and she was keeping herself calm for you. You shook your head, bringing a hand up to run over your face. This is unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you still had to get up. It was Friday, so you were going to have to call work and explain that you weren't coming in, no way were you leaving Lily alone like this. There was no way they'd believe you if you told them your Husky had grown into a giant and was now talking, so just something non-specific should do. But first, you had to actually get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Lily, I'm going to need to get up now, okay?\" You asked, to which the big Husky giggled. You almost could have sworn the room shook as she did so, but you dismissed it as your mind merely overcompensating to make sense of the situation. \"No problem Master!\" She beamed, as you pushed the covers off and climbed over the bed to the door, pressing up against the wall and her bulging flank as you did so, her thick, soft fur pressing into you. You could feel the powerful, steely hard musculature beneath with ease. God, she was so big! She couldn't stay here however. If she grew again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, listen, Lily? I think we're going to have to get you out of the house.\" You explained from between the wall and her flank, halfway to the door. Lily immediately twisted her huge head around to face you as perked up. \"Does that mean we can go on a really long walk this morning?\" She gasped out, to which you nodded slowly. \"Uh, sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's entire face lit up with unbridled joy. \"Well, hold on now, I've got to shower and get dressed first, so I'll be back as soon as I'm done with my shower, okay?\" You pointed out, to which she reassured you. \"Oh of course Master! Don't worry, I'll stay right here!\" She smiled brightly as you stepped out into the hallway, making your way to the bathroom. It felt almost like a dream. You could still scarcely believe any of this was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got through your shower as fast as you could, your mind racing the whole time with thoughts of how completely impossible all of this should be. Dogs can't talk, yet Lily could speak fluent English, without having even studied it for years like a human would have to! Nothing can grow to that size so quickly, yet in mere moments, Lily had more than doubled her size! You shook your head to dispel the thoughts and clear your mind, yelping when water got in your eyes. You were just glad it wasn't shampoo. You quickly finished up and dried yourself off, before wrapping the towel round yourself and heading back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped through the door, Lily immediately spoke up. \"Master! Are you alright? I heard you yelp in the bathroom.\" She asked, to which you blinked and nodded. \"Yes, I'm alright Lily. I just got water in my eyes.\" You explained, to which Lily nodded. \"Ah, right. I couldn't have protected you from that then.\" She mused. You furrowed your brow, wondering if you should inquire further, but a chill ran through you, forcing you to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, your dresser was Lily's other side, and that was assuming it hadn't been reduced to splinters beneath Lily's massive weight. How much did she weigh now? She was far beyond hundreds of pounds, she had to be measured in tons now! Did she weigh a ton? Two tons? You swallowed, trying to ignore the thrill than went through you at the thought of Lily weighing several tons. It was a chill of something, but it wasn't fear. Not quite. It was fear mixed with... something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Lily? I can't reach my dresser, so I'm going to need you to get out of my room so I can reach it. It's uh, well, it's going to be a tight squeeze.\" You murmured anxiously as you looked at the door and then back to Lily, trying to work out how exactly a 10 foot tall Husky who was built like a tank was going to fit through a door that was only about 6 and a half feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Master! I'll manage!\" She smiled. You jumped as the entire house suddenly seemed to loudly groan and creak as the enormous Husky shifted her position, her every movement causing a litany of groans and whines from the building's structure. You could only stare in dumbfounded awe as the colossal Husky crouched down and gingerly squeezed her way through the doorway. Despite the awful groaning, the structure remained intact. \"There we go Master!\" She called through happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed, turning back to the now much more spacious seeming room. You quickly got yourself dressed and head out to meet Lily on the landing. You go downstairs as she follows behind you, the stairs groaning under her tremendous weight as the bannister creaks as it's pressed into by her tremendous bulk. \"Alright Lily, I'll just phone work, grab something to eat and we can be on our way.\" You explain, to which Lily grins widely, her tail whipping about madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull up your phone to call into work, you wonder where exactly you'll be able to take Lily on her walk, now that she's a literal giant of a Husky.</span></div></div>",

Even in the house Lili's giant body almost completly full whole room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stood up, you just realise your head could reach Lili's, fluffy  chest. \"master? where we are going?\" Lili raise her head and asked.

You don't know what people would do... what govermant would do. you tremble with idea what government would do with your dog. No... going with Lili around would be bad idea. secondly you need to find place for Lili.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pushing the repercussions of owning a giant pet to the back of your mind, you focused on getting Lily to the abandoned factory as fast as possible. \"Come on, Lily,\" you called out to her. The ground shook a little bit as the enlarged dog trotted over to you, eager to start the walk. Practically power walking, you lead her to the sidewalk and headed in the direction of the factory. Thankfully, Lily was loyally following behind you and not wandering off, even if it looked like she wanted to explore the world that seemed to have shrunk around her. For a few good minutes the two of you just walked in silence, the only sounds being your footsteps and the heavy paws of your husky hitting the pavement. Then, you stopped as you came to a gravel alleyway wedged between two houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lily came to a stop, the concrete beneath her front paws cracked. \"We're going to cut through here,\" you told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, master!\" Lily enthusiastically barked. The alleyway was a bit of a detour but you figured it would help conceal your giant dog. Unfortunately you were wrong. The husky was much taller than the fences on either side of the alley and she stood out like a sore thumb. More than once you could hear some frantic mutterings or a gasp from behind the fences from people that were probably just hanging up their laundry for the day. You picked up the pace, even more so when Lily started stopping to say hello to the stunned bystanders. After taking a turn, rushing to another alley and detouring through a small reserve, you eventually arrived at the base of the factory. There weren't any mobs following you and Lily so you assumed the two of you were in the clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chain-link fence was your first obstacle. You easily passed it by crawling through a section of cut fence but as you tried to pull it back for your husky you noticed there was no way she would fit through. Lily noticed too. She took a few steps back from the fence and startled you as she started running and then jumped. She flew right over your head and made the landing on the pavement behind the fence with a loud crash. The force of her landing made cracks radiate out from beneath her and sent little pebbles flying. From her expression, she was clearly very proud of the stunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a pat on the large flank of her leg as you passed by her to the next obstacle. A large, rusted double door on the factory that was closed shut. Usually, the door was left open but it seems that the local council deemed it mustn't be so. A heavy, thick chain was wrapped between the two doors with an impressively large padlock to match it. For a moment you were lost as you tried to recall if there were others ways you could get Lily into the factory but as you looked around in thought, your eyes landed on the big dog herself. The powerful muscles beneath her fur were flexing as she meandered about the factory yard and after watching her for a bit an idea formed in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lily, come here,\" you called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a few steps she cleared the distance and lowered her head down to you. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to break the lock,\" you stated. \"Do you think you can do that so we can get you inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can do that,\" Lily said. With that you stood a safe distance away and watched as she got into position. Lily pressed her big nose against the lock and made it jangle before she moved to the side and pressed her shoulder onto the doors. Her muscles tensed up as she pushed herself into the large steel doors. The doors groaned for a few seconds and just when you were starting to feel they were too strong, the chains broke apart with a loud clang. The doors jolted open, swinging inward along with Lily who almost fell over at the sudden movement. Quickly following behind her, you swung both the doors back to a closed position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but praise her feat of strength. \"Good job, girl!\" She was happy for the compliment but she was far too busy taking in her new surroundings. The factory was almost completely empty, save for a few odds and ends. Most, if not all the machinery was presumably taken out and stripped for parts when the factory shut down, leaving the area clear besides a few orderly rows of supporting pillars. There were a few tertiary rooms off to the side along with a metal staircase that lead to a network of catwalks way up high. It was illuminated by light which was pouring into the building from sets of square windows that adorned the top of the walls. In all, it looked like a good place to hide a certain giant canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily explored for a bit before she found her way back to you. \"This place is huge!\" she excitedly barked. \"But what are we going to do now, master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" you admitted. You were still coming to terms that your dog evolved into a giant talking super-husky and you had only thought as far as keeping her out of public sight. Her size was something you were getting used to, though. Lily had proven she knows how to maneuver her enlarged body and she was conducting herself very carefully when she was near you. To fill in time as you thought of something for Lily to do, you reached up to pat the side of her large furry face. She enjoyed the touch and leaned into it, blissfully closing her eyes and letting out a satisfied hum before pulling away and sitting down on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her sitting down, the top of her head was about level with your eyes. You continued petting her for a while, savoring the softness of her fur as you brainstormed. Maybe having a giant dog as a pet wouldn't be so bad? Lily raised her head suddenly and affectionately looked you in the eyes. \"Master, if you don't mind, could I maybe suggest something we could do together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What's that?\"</span></div></div>",

However, the really strange thing was that Max had bizarre growth spurts throughout his life, and no one, including your own parents, would tell you why Max was having these spurts. You first noticed that Max seemed bigger than usual a few days after Christmas when you had gotten him as a puppy: He wouldn't fit into the little bandana you had gotten him just the other day, and his cute little puppy bark somehow seemed a little deeper than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking much of it, the months passed before you realized that he was growing (no pun intended) into a much bigger dog than you realized.

Never really seeming to catch on when he had his slow, gradual growth spurts, you watched as your bigger and bigger doberman continued to grow throughout the months, reaching the height of 10 feet tall when you were in 8th grade. Not only did you have to constantly make accommodations for your growing pet such as buying bigger dog beds and bigger and more treats and toys (not to mention being careful that he didn't damage anything while inside the house), you also noticed that he seemed to age much slower than other dogs. You couldn't make heads or tails of this, and were rather sure it was related to his growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were in high school, nearly ten years after you had first got him, he just now seemed to have grown into an adult dog. But the most noticeable issue was that he had grown to a staggering 20 feet tall! He was of course no longer able to stay in the house and spent most of his time in the backyard where you tried to play with him and spend time with him when your schedule permitted. You would have gone out on walks with him but the other dogs and their walkers were now terrified of him at this size, even though he was one of the friendliest dogs you could ever meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day when you had gotten home from school you go outside to greet and play with Max a bit as usual when you notice something odd: He is sitting down in the perfect sitting position, his four huge paws side by side, being almost as tall as your two-story house even while sitting down. But you also notice that his eyes are closed and his head down a little, almost as if he were in some sort of doggy meditation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you hear and feel a deep rumbling underneath you, seeming to come from the very earth itself, and then your attention is quickly drawn back to Max: </span></div></div>",

His growing and growing body swells and swells while he lays on his side. He begins to pant with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, enjoying the sensations of growing so big so fast, before he realizes that you might be in danger from his expanding form. Max takes you again by the back of your hoodie, his teeth growing steadily and his warm breath breathing down over you. He gently places you atop his gigantic and still-growing back to enjoy the ride. The doberman continues to grow, bigger and bigger and bigger, pumping up higher and higher above your house and soon the neighboring houses. All the while the earth continues to tremble as if fueling the dog's growth, and you look over the side of his back at the shrinking world beneath you, wondering when or if his growing would stop soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis massive growth spurt stops at a little over 100 feet tall, his body towering over all the houses in the neighborhood, now five times his previous size in just a matter of moments! Even though Max's hefty paws grow big enough to crush parked cars, front yards, and parts of houses underneath them, they just seem to harmlessly smother everything underneath them without damaging anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax turns his now billboard-sized muzzle back to look into your eyes, his own eyes gleaming with satisfaction and contentment. <b>\"Did I do good, master? How is this for a size correction?\"</b> He licks you again, careful not to sweep up your entire body with his giant tongue. <b>\"Are you happy too, master?

The human then looks up to you, \"Is this a gun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke. \"Yes, child.\" You jumped slightly at your voice as it just came out as if you had been speaking your whole life, nevertheless you speak to the child.<br>\r\n\"I have been getting bigger and you humans have been shooting guns like that at me to make me even more larger.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" The child meekly said. He looked down to the gun and back up to you, smiling enthusiastically. \"Can I make you bigger?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" You said, swishing your tail. The thought of getting bigger and the pleasure of growing filled you with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy inspects the gun and places his hand on the grip and readies his finger on the trigger before aiming up at you. You close your eyes as a flash of light and a loud bang fills the alley. Again, you felt that pinprick and purred. The child stands frozen in awe as your frame begins to expands. From 15 feet you slowly swell, gradually gaining foot after foot of height as pleasure wracks your body. About a minute passes and the growth grinds to a halt, leaving you at 20 feet tall. Looking down and making eye contact with the boy you break him from his trance. He looks up to you and flashes a toothy grin, aiming the gun at you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a gasp as a flurry of shots hits you as the child fired repeatedly into your chest. They weren't so much as pinpricks now, but more of a slight pressures against your fur. Your body begins to slowly creep up once again. Suddenly jumping up a few inches and sending jolts of pleasure with each successive shot. After several shots you heard the gun start clicking over and over. \"It's out, I think!\" The boy yelled up to you. <br>\r\n\"T-that's okay!\" You tell him, your voice shaking from the sheer amount of pleasure your body was experiencing from growing. By this point you have probably gained another 10 feet, but still you grew. You adjust yourself in the alleyway, moving your paws carefully so you don't step on the child. A slight tinge of worry overcomes you as both your sides press up against the alleyway. You decide to wait it out, feeling your body create massive cracks in the buildings beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, your growth slows to a stop, leaving you 40 feet tall. You barely fit in the alleyway. \"You're so huge!\" the child yells, loving the fact he is contributing to your size. \"I wish this gun had more shots in it though.\"<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\" You say as you adjust your body to get a better view of the child. He was probably just a head taller than your paw. \"I think that gun was starting to lose effectiveness, anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down from the ordeal you notice you are definitely stuck and it would take some effort to get out the cramped alleyway. You were about to start wriggling back out of the alley before something interrupts you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're interrupted by the sound of whooping sirens and screeching tires out on the road behind you. You weren't exactly surprised to hear those sounds, they always happened shortly after a loud sound like the gun's happened in the city. You turn and raise your head to try and look behind you, you think there are three cars with the flashing lights out by the entrance to the alleyway. The men in blue uniforms rushed to take position behind the cars, they were holding guns much like the one that made you grow before! The thought that the humans wanted to make you even bigger pleased you, but you would prefer it if they waited until you got yourself unstuck from the alleyway at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to push yourself backwards, your 40 foot frame rubbing against the buildings to either side of you causing them to crack and groan in protest. The policemen behind you were yelling back and forward to each other, obviously confused and scared by the sight of the furry monster in front of them. Accidentally knocking over a multitude of trash cans and boxes with your back paws, your rump slowly squeezes out of the alley. As you continue to try and wriggle out of the confines of the two buildings you obliviously flick your tail about to give you some better balance. Unfortunately the policemen were in the range of the furry battering ram. Your tail almost bowls a group of them over and then comes back again to swipe across the sirens of one of the cars, smashing the lights to pieces. It was then that you heard gunshots and felt multiple pinpoints of pressure on your behind. \"W-wait!\" You try and reason too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but let out a moan as the pleasant sensation suddenly washes over you again, the pressure on your sides increasing as you begin to grow. Your view began to rise faster as you gained more and more height, the cracks in the walls beside you getting even more larger. You look down to see the child intently watching you from behind a dumpster. You had to get out of that alleyway or you might accidentally hurt him! Already at 50 feet, you give a mighty push backwards, your thighs crumbling and spilling into the buildings beside you. Your rump was essentially bulging out of the alleyway now and you noticed that if you lifted your head up you could actually see over the buildings. The policemen were still firing as you shoved yourself backwards again, inadvertently causing more of your body to invade the buildings beside you by destroying more wall.  At this point even your front legs and paws were running out of room in the tight alleyway. You looked about as your head rose above the two buildings, and as you reached the 60 foot mark you gave one last push to free yourself. With a loud crash your thighs destroyed the walls and you practically launched yourself out of the alley, landing onto a police car with a loud crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the humans they were able to get out of the way before you spilled out onto the street, regardless still they shot at you persistently. You were flattered that they just wanted you to get bigger and bigger. Still in your sitting position after freeing yourself from the alleyway you watched as some of them got different looking guns from the cars that looked longer and more powerful. You flinch as one of the policemen fires at you with it, creating a loud bang and causing you to suddenly grow two feet. Before long a barrage of these louder and more powerful shots impact your body causing you to rocket up to 70 feet, then 75 feet, then 80. You just watched the small policemen as they continued to open fire while slowly backing away from your expanding body, the asphalt road cracking under your tremendous weight. Your thighs were even pushing against the other cars the humans drove here, causing their tires to screech slightly as they were pushed by your 90 foot and growing frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their yelling was inaudible over the sound of the loud guns, you did hear one of them that held a device up to his face. \"Retreat, retreat!\" He yelled. Just like that, the firing suddenly stopped and the policemen scattered, disappearing out of sight. Your growth slowed down considerably and with the street empty you felt it was safe to stand up, getting a slight bit of vertigo as you underestimate how much bigger they actually made you. You look down to the alleyway. As your growth grinds to a halt at 100 feet, you were nearly twice as tall compared to those buildings you were recently jammed between. You even think that if you put one of your forelegs in the alleyway it would completely block it. Looking at your surroundings, everything looked so much different. You were bigger than many of the buildings but there were still some that were taller than you, especially in the center of the city where the skyscrapers loomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a slight tugging sensation at one of your paws. You see the small form of something at the base of one of your toes, it takes you a second to recognize the small figure as the boy that made you grow before. Lowering yourself down you could hear him cheerfully yelling at you. \"You're massive! Those police officers made you so big!\"<br>\r\n\"I guess they did\" Your loud voice causing the boy to cover his ears. Oops, you suppose being bigger means you have a bigger voice. Lowering your voice considerably you ask the child, \"Why do you humans want me so big?\"<br>\r\n\"Dunno!\" The kid chirped \"But I think it's really cool! I kind of just want to see how big you can get.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" You ask as you move your face closer to the small child. \"In that case, how about you climb on my back so you can watch me grow first hand?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you watch the small human struggle to climb your arm you can't help but think how much you've grown. He was so small compared to you and you barely felt his weight has he grasped onto your fur to pull himself up on you. Completely different from a few days ago when people would all tower over you. As you waited for the boy to get on your back you looked around the street. Lights in the building were turning on and a few people were even starting to run out of the buildings away from you. You could feel a slight pressure in between your shoulder-blades. \"Hey! I'm ready!\" a small voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you slowly rose back to your towering 100 foot height. You could just see the sun rising over the horizon as morning came. Looking down even more people were pouring from the buildings, creating a steady stream of people running away from you. Before long there was just a few stragglers running about the street and you thought it was safe to finally move about. You step forward, producing a loud thud and making cracks in the pavement form all around your paw. You liked the sensation, it reminded you of walking on thin ice when you were smaller. You take a few more steps, savoring the feeling of the ground cracking under your weight. You turn your attention to a car parked on the side of the street, a machine that humans use to get around. Raising a paw you rest it against the roof of the car, feeling the metal bend. Slowly you put more pressure on the vehicle and the metal warps, windows shatter and various parts and pieces break off. You even grind your paw up and down the car a few times, crunching the car up even more and getting smaller pieces of car stuck between your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the base of your neck you could feel movement. \"Wow...\" the child said. \"You're so powerful, kitty!\"<br>\r\n\"I guess I am!\" You boast as you look at the flattened car. The child was right, your new size made you immensely powerful and something itching in the back of your mind made you want to experiment with your newfound power a little further. You noticed that most the people in the area had evacuated. If they already left, they wouldn't want these cars anyway, right?</span></div></div>",

The cat starts to grow 3 inches a second until the cat nearly touched both sides of the alleyway with it\u2019s sides. The cat fortunately stopped growing then... at least for the time being. The cat had already grown to be 20 ft tall while standing. This massive growth spurt also triggered something in you, casing you to grow as well, though not as quickly as the cat. You stopped growing when you were about 2 ft long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up first and find yourself completely smothered by the black cat and it\u2019s fur. You try to move but are unable to and are forced to wait until the cat wakes up. Fortunately for you, it isn\u2019t long until the cat wakes up with a yawn and stands up to stretch, having just enough space to do so. You roll onto your back and look up, seeing the massive cat standing above you. You look the cat over, admiring it\u2019s size and the beauty of it\u2019s pitch black fur. Offhandedly you notice that the cat is female. You see the cat looking in between her legs at you, head cocked. You roll back over and stand up. This is the first time you notice your own size growth. While the growth is small compared to the monstrous cat, you did grow to about 8 times your previous size and are about the size of a normal cat. You won\u2019t have to be worried about them eating you anymore, not that any cats would try to eat you while the massive female one was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the alleyway and see that the cat is rather cramped in it.

But I never got to tell them, tell them for me, pass this hug on. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I should have done this so much earlier,\" as it talked the bear grew to 25 feet and then 50feet tall.

He would probably get cold or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou master sighs, however, and manages to quickly and expertly squirm his way out of the hug, leaving you on your side in the space he had created.

You watch the screen with rapt attention. You hadn't watched the horse trials before, but these were simply amazing! The horses were more animated than you had ever seen others of your species be so before, and the woman interviewing the jockeys also let the horses add their own comments. One particularly titanic stallion, breaking seven foot five inches, wouldn't stop praising his rider, often pausing to nuzzle down on the far smaller human, almost knocking him down every time he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that there seem to be rather a lot of horses from a place called \"Britain\". That sounded familiar, you had heard your master talk about \"British weather\" on several occasions, but you had just assumed it was another word for \"bad\" as in \"bad weather\", as the remark had often accompanied the start of rainfall. Looking about you realise that the flag that was displayed for the British horses was also hanging from one of the walls of the living room. Well, that cleared that up, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the different flags that are displayed for different horses and riders; they were all rather interesting in their own way, really. Then, a mare fails while trying to jump over an oddly shaped bale of hay, sending her rider tumbling off her as she falls. You wince as she abandons the trial to assist her rider, who seemed to be healthy, if rather dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear your master placing down the phone and walking into the living room, your powerful ears easily picking up his soft footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You are about to stand up when you feel a bizarre tingling feeling welling up in your stomach and travelling throughout your body. Your ears twitch slightly as your stomach groans, even though you don't feel particularly hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling is replaced with a nice, warm feeling, and you feel your head begin to press into the sofa as you grow...<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWHAT?!</i> you watch, helpless yet enjoying the feeling the growth gave you as you slowly swell outwards, your brown fur and hooves slowly rolling over more and more of the carpet. The white fur surrounding your ankles fluffs up as your hooves, ankles and legs swell disproportionately large for a second before the rest of your body catches up. You had always been a big horse, but this was seriously pushing the boundaries of that definition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling fades all of a sudden and you sigh, relieved yet disappointed by the end of the spurt. You had to be at almost six foot nine by now! As if answering your slight disappointment, you gently swell an inch taller, the growth being much more uniform this time. Swallowing, you fidget slightly before hiccuping and blowing up another two inches, then another one, putting you at exactly seven feet tall. The spurt isn't quite over yet, however, as you begin to have more and more spurts, each of them absolutely tiny, but no less pleasurable than the steady growth of the first growth spurt. Panting slightly from the inner warmth the growth made you feel, you hiccup one last final time and groooow three inches larger in one long, slow, spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master's breakfast assembled, he walks back into the living room, where your even larger form lay, taking up almost the entirety of the space your master had made for you. You aren't really surprised when your master doesn't notice the massive size change, remembering you as always being this titanic. Your owner plops down on the floor next to your chest, leaning against you and eating his sandwich while you giggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes are once again drawn to the TV as your master eats, and you realise that the massive stallion from earlier was once again being 'interviewed', although he seemed content to use the time that would have been used to discuss his exploits to instead talk about his rider, much to the seeming embarrassment of said rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch, however, you notice something...</span></div></div>",

Before, they were about he and his rider's feelings about their performance in the horse trials. Now, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, at what point was it that you realised, 'I'm growing bigger than every other horse I know, and not stopping?'\" The stallion paws at the ground with a hoof far taller than any human you've ever seen, and replies. \"Around about the point when I went to sleep normal size and woke up with my back touching the ceiling of the stable.\" His voice is so deep and loud that the ground trembles ever so slightly when he speaks. However, despite the sheer volume, the humans do not seem to be bothered at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice your master is eagerly leaning forward, his eyes drinking in the details of the black stallion's body. Said stallion then asks, \"Can I say something before the program finishes?\" To which he receives a yes. He sucks in a massive lungful of air, bursting up to a hundred feet tall as he does so, although the humans don't notice the spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HELLO, OLD MASTER!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide smile now adorns your master's face and he gasps in happiness, before turning back to you and gripping you in a vice-like hug around your neck. \"Isn't this great, Bella? All this time and he still remembers me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look through your memories and remember a period of time a few years ago, when your master had take. Care of you and a black stallion, who had been so large as to have trouble being fitted with a saddle. Apparently that same stallion had now grown so large that most buildings were insignificant compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both turn your attention to the TV, the horse trials on which are almost finished. \"And that was Maximus, Britain's fifth largest horse, twenty ninth largest horse in the world, and the only macro horse we could find that was small enough to actually fit in the trial area as opposed to gently smothering the surrounding few miles under one massive but harmless hoof. So, to recap, the top five largest horses in Britain are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Billy, at sixty seven miles tall.<br>\r\nPhaedra, at twenty five miles tall.<br>\r\nBlaze, at ten miles tall.<br>\r\nAdonis, at one mile tall.<br>\r\nAnd last, but certainly not least, Maximus, at one hundred- one hundred and te- thirt- sorry, fifty-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow as you realise Maximus is steadily pumping upwards again, although his normal breathing suggests he is happy with his new height, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, we've been having some communications trouble. So, last but not least, is Maximus, at one hundred and seventy five feet tall, and due to reach two hundred feet tall in a matter of days. Thank you for watching, we hope you have a pleasant day. Goodbye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe program ends and the next one begins. Your master idly strokes your neck as he thinks out loud. \"Good to hear Maximus remembers me. I wonder if Billy and Phaedra remember me as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems your master has a knack for raising ludicrously huge horses, then.

That was probably it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you begin to feel a powerful tingly feeling, and begin to rapidly grow, your master sitting on you and leaning against your expanding neck. You stamp with a massive hoof, larger than your master's house, and the shock waves reverberate back into you, further fuelling your growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and bigger you grow, not paying attention to exactly how large you are getting and instead concentrating on the rush that the growth spurt gave you. You pant and pant, hugging the shrinking Earth to your growing form, as the galaxy sized masses that were Billy, Phaedra, and Maximus are powered onto even more absurdly huge sizes by your growth alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pure white form of Phaedra gently nuzzles you, the gentle mare lavishing her affections on both you and her home planet even as both of you continue to flood into space, growing larger and larger still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your entire body begins to quake and rumble, and you burst bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pass Maximus' size, growing larger than the Milky Way in the process. Then Phaedra begins to shrink in comparison to you, the mare scrutinising your growing back for your master, whom she easily finds and places on her own body, which is still pulsing larger. It takes a while to completely outgrow Phaedra, as her growth rate had increased at almost the same rate yours had. Eventually Phaedra had broken off from the growth race, storing her energy in preparation for a growth spurt that would put most multiverses underhoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had continued to grow, and were currently filling the quarter of the universe not occupied by a single hair strand from Billy's body. The name Big Billy suited him more than ever before. The sheer noise of the stallion's growth alone drowned out every other noise in an incalculable number of universes, all of which Billy filled to the brim, then outgrew almost instantly, spreading throughout the multiverse at mind-breaking speeds. Billy pants and pants and pants, breathing harder and harder as he outgrows the multiverse, flowing into the nearest five more as a single hair fibre dominates your universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happens. You grow again, instantly outgrowing Billy, doubling, tripling, quadrupling, dectupling his size in mere moments and continuing to grow faster as Phaedra lets all of her pent-up growth energy out, matching your size and then surpassing it, just like you did to Billy, who is breathing in harder and faster in an effort to outgrow the local exoversal cluster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how much later it was that you all stopped growing. You, several trillion yottaverses tall, Billy eclipsing your vast size by several orders of magnitude. And then there was Phaedra. Everything that ever was, is, could be, might have been, or wasn't, was held firmly in the affectionate embrace of the Arabian mare, who had long ago grown into different dimensions while you and Billy were still stuck with being but a few trillion yottaverses tall. Or, in Billy's case, a few septillion ultraverses. You feel slightly woozy, however, and close your eyes for a second...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly jolted out of your dream. Still mostly asleep, it takes a while for you to realise that anything is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat about reality has changed?</span></div></div>",

You had grown, obviously - but your master's house had disappeared, as had your stables. Speaking of your master, he was sleeping peacefully on your back, lying against your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other visible changes were rather disconcerting, although you couldn't quite pin down exactly why. The sky, which had been grey and overcast for a few seconds, had warped and shifted as the sun itself moved backwards across the sky until it was early morning, causing the sky, now devoid of clouds, the take on a pinkish hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground itself had changed, as well. Instead of the brown field of mud that had awaited you and your master yesterday, a stereotypical but beautiful meadow that stretched on and on, trees and bushes dotted about every so often. The mountains on either side of the valley where you lived were still there, snow-capped peaks rising majestically into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master begins to twitch as he slowly awakens, and you giggle quietly as he flips over and buries himself into your fur in an attempt to fall back into sleep. However, he is unable to stop the early morning rays of sunlight from rousing him, and pushes himself into a sitting position, laying against your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master shifts slightly, as if weighing his options. Eventually, he comes to a conclusion of whatever argument he was having inside his head, and speaks in a low, quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you awake, Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe... <i>WHAT?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the lump in your throat, you lower your voice before responding.

You're a bit too big for me to be able to get off on my own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as your ma- er, Clive, moves to the midsection of your back, allowing you to turn your head and nip the back of his clothes, before placing him on the ground next to you. He looked a little younger than last night, maybe a couple of years younger, and looks about... twenty three? You're not that good at pinpointing humans' ages by their appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour m- <i>no</i>, Clive, happily moves over to your chest and pushes himself into it, snuggling you as you try to comprehend just how much had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

You and Clive were delighted as her body continued to swell up higher and higher, bigger and bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more the miles were added onto her height, the mare surpassing the size of the surrounding mountain ranges quickly, soon becoming the size equivalent to a county, then almost to the size of a state!

What is making that strange and horrible sound? You open your eyes to see, and notice that once again, you're growing! The creaking was coming coming from the sofa you were growing into, as it was straining to try and keep you making it break. Though to no avail as with a loud *CRASH*! The sofa breaks, and your growth only picks up from there. 10 feet, 11 feet, 12 feet, up and up and up you grew. You wanted to wake master, to get you to stop, but...it feels so gooood. \"Mmm...maybe...a bit bigger...wouldn't hurt. Or a lot.\" You moan through the pleasurable growth as your body presses against both the walls and the ceiling at the same time, causing them to make the same creaking and groaning sound that the now broken sofa was making. Lucky for you now, your master had already heard the crash of the sofa and came downstairs to investigate, seeing your huge and growing form in his living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bella?! Whoa, I wasn't expecting you to grow like this!\" He admits as he pets your growing hide as it reaches 15 feet tall and still grows. \"Mmmm...It feels wonderful master. Do...do you think I can make it go faster?\" You ask panting through the pleasure. \"Hmm...probably Bella, I mean, most horses only grow during the day. So grow Bella, grow!\" he cheered. And with that, with the blessing of your master, your growth exploded! You burst free from the home at a massive 30 feet in size and were only growing more and more with each huff of your breath, as you doubled in size. 60 feet...120 feet...240 feet...Bigger and bigger you grew, already outsizing Maximus, as far as you knew. But it wasn't enough. It just wasn't enough for you. You wanted more, to make your master proud of you as a growing goddess of a horse. And so, through sheer will power, your growth goes from doubling in size every huff, to TRIPLING in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n720 feet...2160 feet...1.5 miles and still growing bigger and bigger. Luckily, your body harmlessly rolled over the landscape, not hurting anything or anyone. The news was reporting on your growing body as you grew over their station at 4.5 miles in size and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is astounding folks! A new super horse has made herself known at this very moment! And she's still growing stronger and stronger!\" The lady says reporting on you. \"According to sources, this growing beauty is named Bella, another horse raised by Mr. Clide. Not surprising, as almost every horse that is on the charts, was at some point raised by him. And gosh dang, it looks like he's won the lottery with this horse! Why, she's already 13.5 miles tall, and still growing! The rate she's growing, she'll probably outsize the planet sooner or later!\" The news woman said to everyone who was listening, though it was hard to hear over the deafening sound of your creaking growing hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even still you wanted to grow faster, so you willed yourself to grow QUADRUPLE your size with every breath you took this time. 54 miles, 216 miles, 864 miles, the whole Earth was becoming like a too small bean bag cushion for you to sit on. But on and on you swelled, growing bigger and bigger with every huff and puff you took. 3,456 miles, 13,824 miles, 55,296 miles. Everything was tiny to you by this point where your growth FINALLY stopped. The planet was now the size of your eye, and your master was caught in the fur of your hide. You felt proud, happy and powerful. You wondered though...could you grow bigger?</span></div></div>",

You lazily open your eyes, temporarily blinded by how bright the morning sunlight is that is creeping into the stables. You stand up on all fours quickly as you realize that it must be a few hours later than when you usually wake up to help your master on the farm. You look shamefacedly at your master, fearing his disappointment, but he just smiles warmly at you and pats you again reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good sleep, Colton? Come on boy, time to get up and at 'em...that's it,\" he says, helping you through the stable door. He takes the specially-made harness used for plowing off the wall opposite your stable and helps you into it, making sure it has a snug fit. \"We've got another long day ahead of us, but with a bit of hard work we can get done a couple hours before sundown,\" he says, petting your head. You neigh understandingly and trot out of the stables in his wake, ready for a full day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since you could remember you have been working on the farm with your master; he had lovingly raised you since you were a small colt, hence your name. Although you always remember being a working horse since you were little, you also remember growing up much faster and stronger than the other horses too. Although you and your master were perplexed by this when you were growing up, you both didn't think much of it as he continued to work you more and more on the farm, giving you more endurance-based tasks that you could pull off with your gaining size and strength. By the time you were an adult you were able to do all the hardest jobs around the farm, the hardest of which included plowing field after field, day after day, so your master could plant the seasonal crops after harvesting the last batches. The old tillers and cultivators that you pulled behind you weighed over a few hundred pounds a piece, but pulling them behind you was easy; after all, you had grown very strong and muscular for a stallion and stood at a massive 8 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are pulled out of your reverie as your master whistles at you from across the field, calling you back to the barn for the next task, having finished with the fields for the day. As you turn your body towards the barn's direction you feel a sharp, stabbing sensation, and you snort in pain before collapsing to the ground. Your master rushes over as you try to assess the damage: it looks like your front left leg is badly sprained. You try to stand up and put some weight on it, but it's a no go, and you rest back down on the newly cultivated earth. Your master finally reaches you and knows what's wrong immediately. He finds a cart nearby, empties the dirt from it, and heaves your huge left leg into it gently. You still wince in pain as your master slowly wheels the cart toward the barn while you trot along with your other legs, but you are very appreciative of his help during this difficult time. You both finally reach the barn and your master leads you to a large mound of hay, heaves your left leg out of the cart, and you lay down in the soft mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chin up there, Colton, it could have been much worse,\" your master says, bending down and patting your head. He must have guessed how somber and disappointed in yourself you felt. \"I can get a few more of the horses to do your work over the next few days as you rest. Although I must say it'll take them much longer to do it, even with their combined strength! But you getting better is much more important, so don't you worry. Just rest and focus on getting better,\" he tells you, smiling. He pats you again affectionately again before making sure the trough in the corner is filled with water for you and there is plenty of hay to eat. When done, he bids you goodnight, closes the large doors, and heads back to his farmhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My master has always been so good to me, even with all the work I do,\"</i> you think to yourself. <i>\"I just wish I could keep on working and helping him even with this injury...\"</i> But you know that a sprain this bad will take at least a few days to heal, so you just sigh and lay down completely, lying down peacefully before drifting off to sleep... </span></div></div>",

You nuzzle down on your master, who laughs and responds by hugging your thick neck, moving so that your head is just past his shoulder. It was almost comical how small your master was compared to you and the other horses, at times. Of course, compared to you, most other animals from the local area were rather puny, given your huge size and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a whole two feet taller than your master. You remember rather vividly when you started growing, that your master had to extend the ceiling on your stable as you grew and grew. It was a good thing that he did, as your height - eight feet tall - had been the height of the ceilings in the stable. It would have been rather impressive to press against the ceiling simply because you stood up, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master was rather affectionate towards you and the other horses. Though you were sure he didn't know if you were fully sapient or not, that never stopped him from hugging you, petting you, and occasionally scratching behind your ears when he could reach them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nicker as you feel even more tingly and suddenly grow a foot taller, your master dropping the short distance between your neck and the ground. He and the other horses begin to circle around you, marvelling at your power. Then, the other horses all neigh in surprise, and blow up to your previous height of eight feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze, a brilliant white mare whom your master used for riding, and Ace, a brown stallion who you knew to be an unofficial team leader of sorts for other the work horses, accidentally sandwich your master between them as they rapidly spurt upwards, continuing past both your previous height, and your current one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir growth stops at eleven feet tall, the white Arabian mare and brown draft horse nickering loudly as they turn to your master, who was firmly pinned in between them. Realising that his arms were pinned between her and Ace, Breeze takes the oppurtunity to nuzzle HARD into your master, who giggles as his favourite mare lavishes her affections on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlowing up even more, Breeze steps away from the increasingly smaller Ace, and lets her master harmlessly drop to the ground before flumping and using her front legs to awkwardly hug your master as her growing rump begins to push into your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the tingly feeling comes back in full force, and before you know it you are bursting larger and larger, harmlessly pushing your master and the other horses back with your growing form. The earth beneath you is quickly cratered by your massive hooves, each twice the size of houses by now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe in heavily as you flow upwards and outwards, but it only seems to further fuel your growth, and you feel yourself ripple upwards in size until you pass one mile, then two, then five!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other horses are growing with you, but at a much lesser rate. When you reach five miles they reach one, by the time you're ten miles tall they're barely reaching two. A titanic rumbling emanates from your stomach, shaking the ground itself, and you double in size again and again and again and again and again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you blissfully hug the earth to you, the beachball sized planet shrinking against you slightly. You feel the country sized horses wriggling slightly as they are fed with your growth energy, bursting larger than the solar system as you have another spurt and outgrow the galaxy. Your master would be very proud of you and the other horses, indeed...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake rather suddenly, disorientating you for a brief moment before you remember your surroundings.

You think back to your dream, and remember that you had grown many times the size of the other horses throughout your spurts. You stand up to your full height, or at least you try to: You soon realize your sides are jammed against the sides of your stable, and even if you did manage to stand up you would be far too tall for the ceiling and break through it. The next best thing to do would be to shimmy out of your tight squeeze, and you manage to do so after opening the door behind you with your large rump. Once in the stables hallway you are able to stand up to your full and gigantic height of 12 feet, having to bend you head down to avoid scraping the ceilings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master shortly arrives to the stables to replenish the hay, clean, and do all the other morning chores before heading out into the fields for the day. Upon entering the stables, your master lets out a small cry of surprise. He can barely believe his eyes: All of his horses had grown absolutely huge! He gazed around at the lot, looking at the content Breeze and Ace in their stables before his gaze falls on your ginormous form. Shocked as he is about his horses' new sizes, especially yours, he doesn't verbally question the changes and still comes in and places down a bale of hay before smiling and patting your side. You close your eyes and neigh appreciatively. Suddenly, your body vibrates with that same tingling sensation you felt in your dream, and you feel your body expanding further and further in front of your master and the other horses. Your master's face shines in pleasant surprise and the other horses crane their necks up and up in awe as they watch your towering body pump higher and higher towards the building's ceiling. The top of your head and back soon hit the high old wooden ceiling, which instantly crumbles, and you feel your body vibrate powerfully once more as you take in a deep, heavy breath to further fuel your next big growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly notice with a small sigh of relief that your master and the other horses are not hurt as the stables fall apart around them and pieces of wood rain down on them. Knowing that your growing body would only push them aside and not harmfully smother them, your body vibrates tremulously along with your heavy breaths and you rocket higher, higher, and higher into the sky, your stallion body bursting bigger, bigger, and BIGGER still! You quickly outgrow your master's farm and then the surrounding neighborhood, your hooves multiple times the size of the ordinary house by now! And the craters caused by your hooves continue to expand further and further along with your body; you continue to breathe in deeply, fully enjoying the sensation of endless growth and knowing that you can consciously help increase your own growth spurts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrating, tingling feeling stops, and you gaze around at the tiny world beneath you. You must be over half a mile tall by now! Your master must be so proud of you right now, having long overcome your injury and growing up to be so big! Speaking of which, you crane your neck down and spot the tiny farm beside your right hoof, looking more like a small Lego piece than anything by now. You can just make out the specks that are your master, Breeze, and Ace surrounded by the wreckage of the puny stables. However, the glints of white and brown appeared to be fuzzy and then get back into focus, almost as if their bodies were vibrating and then growing bigger...could it be? </span></div></div>",

Your master softly leads you forward, one hand underneath your muzzle to steer you. He chats with the human atop your back, having to look up not just at you, but to them as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the human atop your back dismounts, handing your master some strips of multicoloured paper before leaving. Smiling at the fact that he is now alone with you, your master wraps his arms around your neck, resting his head on your muzzle. Giggling, you nuzzle him, nosing down on his smaller form. Laughing, your master begins to lead you back to your stables, taking the riding equipment off you when he arrives. After storing it, he leads you into your room in the stables, making a big pile of hay for you to sleep on. Whispering soft yet unintelligible words as you lower yourself onto the hay, your master strokes your mane, easing you asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Blinking, you look around, not recognising your surroundings. Instead of your stables or the rolling green fields surrounding your master's house, or even the forests bordering said fields, you were floating in an infinite void of inky blackness. Thrning and twisting, you try to look for some way to escape when a feeling of calm washes over you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Before you appears a figure, its appearance constantly shifting and morphing, never staying the same for more than a second before changing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as the figure begins talking in a voice that matches its appearance - constantly morphing, yet still remaining recognisable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen it fit to... grant you, a certain power...\" Seeing you nod your approval, the figure continues. \"You shall be allowed to warp reality at will... Go on; try making yourself bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on making yourself grow, you feel a warm, tingly feeling quickly spreading throughout your body, causing your eyes to roll back slightly as you expand. You slowly roll over the blackness, rapidly eclipsing the figure as your chest bumps him backwards through the void. The figure touches an appendage to your shuddering chest, reversing your growth until you are merely eight feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you can do more than simply grow or shrink. Why don't you try something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating, your soft brown pelt shifts to a brilliant white, then to a inky black, and then back to its normal brown. A fellow horse is summoned next to you, and he begins to expand, inflating to fill the area around him; each heaving, heavy breath forcing his shuddering body to grow, matching your scale before his sides begin to push you back, his hooves rapidly outgrowing your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsummoning the fellow equine, you concentrate on the darkness around you, turning it to a deep red colour before returning it to its original black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have the hang of it... Just remember, your imagination is your only limit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel slightly woozy, the inky black void seeming to swirl around your massive body. Before you can even do anything, you feel yourself waking up...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking one eye open, then the other, you awake to find that it was still dark; the moon shines in the sky, a few stray beams of light visible from your stable. Concentrating hard, you briefly force time to speed up, the sun appearing in the sky. A muffled knocking on the door to your stable alerts you to your master's presence, and you turn to face him as he enters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen once more as you look down - and down and down - at your master, your presence utterly dominating the room as the small human slowly moves towards you. Thinking back to your dream, you remember the stallion you had summoned. Had he kept his size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground trembles ever so slightly, and as your master guides you out of the stables, you see the same stallion you had summoned, patiently waiting outside. But he hadn't stopped growing when you summoned him, he had to have been twice as tall now, if not bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to shrink the stallion down when you notice your master's reaction to him. He didn't seem scared or disturbed; rather, he seemed to think that the stallion's size was completely normal. Grinning, you and every horse your master owns begins to rapidly grow, heavy breaths resonating throughout the area as all of you approach the titanic stallion's size. Cutting off the flow of growth, you look down at your tiny master. He was so cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, a thought occurs to you. With your powers, was your master really your master? What if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if <i>you</i> were <i>his</i> master?</span></div></div>",

Whatever happened to make her grow like that, it seems to be over and done with. Thank goodness!

She must be what, fifty feet tall by now? Amazing! Her flank alone comes up past the nearest trees, a truck passing by under her belly with a few choice honks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must think I'm a good horse, too!\" Bella cheers, watching the vehicle tear off behind her. \"You think so, and I'm getting bigger and better!\" She huffs lowly and tingles all over, making you tense up in anticipation as she huddles inward and booms up bigger, legs wobbling cutely, her mane pouring out over you, the follicles in your grasp growing larger and thicker as more of her hair flows over you; she balloons all over proudly, until she shivers her way out of her spurt, sighing loudly, at over 85 feet tall, at the eartips! Birds flutter away in shock as her inflated haunches brush out and into their treetops, her head peeking up adorably over an entire hillside as she looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to speak, patting down on her huge hide lovingly, though before you can calm the young mare down, she erupts even larger, with no warning this time, lurching violently up in height and mass, her belly pumping out on either side, her big, deep eyes closing as she whinnies and cries out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can love me more, master, I know it!

Her hooves widen explosively, shearing the grassy fields on either side of the highway, her tail whipping gleefully as she can see more and more of the area from her increasing vantage; she takes in a breath, and, before you can make so much as a muffled cry from within her mane, she erupts to over 400 feet in size, then 500!!</span></div></div>",

You take a deep breath of relief and pat her on her incredibly thick, long neck, nodding, and responding very-much in the affirmative. After all her giddy teenage ballyhoo about growing, you're really quite surprised she's taking your order so calmly. You can hear the world below kicking up some considerable fuss, car horns and buzzing helicopters all moving around the 500-foot tall equine giantess; Bella smiles down at everyone and stamps one colossal hoof proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Hello, little ones!\" she cheers, flicking her ears adorably. \"I always wondered what it was like to be this big! The air is so clear up here! I feel so powerful and strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caution her to try and just stay still, and not do any further damage to the countryside, or heaven forbid, the nearby cities.

They want to see if I can catch up to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her no, in your loudest voice, now having to swim upstream through her mane, hugging on her ear to speak into it, which makes her giggle in total adoration, thinking everything you do is truly that awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know, master! Watch how clever I am!! I won't disobey, I'll stay still, since you told me not to move anymore! I'll catch up with them another way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horror, you realize the misinterpretation that's taken place, and start to correct her on your original meaning, but it's just too late, and she's just too cutely hyperactive and playful; with a tingling that swells into a quake that shakes the ground under her, Bella begins panting loudly, before gritting her teeth and bowing her head in sheer effort.

You wait there hanging from her vast ear, seeing birds fly by in calm flocks, before with a massive booming echo and a whinny of total bliss, the sky changes; the ground is engulfed by the tones of her pelt, clouds starting to drop lower and lower and lower towards you both as her body rockets larger, pumping furiously in size; in moments she's standing over a mile tall, easily, her growing equine rump wiggling as she keeps her sort-of promise and locks her hooves to the spot, not moving her legs at all; of course, at the rate she's growing, her legs are growing farther and farther from the cratery quartet of gouges she had first made moments ago, long, increasingly wide and deep trenches being dragged further out from each of the four source points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M A GOOD GIRL!\" she BOOMS, clouds puffing and breaking apart against her inflating shoulders and titanically long, thick, bulging neck; her rear swells out over the county line, growing into the next, as her neck extends far out, hovering imposingly over the nearby city, which the front of her 4-mile body has now more or less reached. Planes veer wildly to escape her growing mass, the 7-mile tall horse snorting and giggling, never once flicking you off with a motion of her ear.

She wiggles her body around in space, giggling at the sensation of floating freely in the void, feeling her growth escalate furiously! The single compliment is only building up further, it seems, as she hiccups again and feels her rump shoving Venus away, the gravity forcing an entire planet to rollll up her rump like a shrinking marble, which just tickles her adorably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-BIGGERRRR,\" she huffs, hungrily swelling through the galaxy, letting all the planets stick like fridge magnets to her inflating sides, fluttering her huge eyes sweetly. \"MASTERRR...MAKE ME BIIIIIIGGGERRRRR!!!\" She roars the words, even as you just let the previous compliment keeps working at her, tapping some unspent and still-gathering well of power; she's utterly incredible, growing so big! Even the Sun just kisses her muzzle, making her giggle away as she kisses it back, before it shrinks away between her lips, making her blink in confusion as to where it went--really, she's just growing that fast! And she's getting bigger, faster, shuddering away as all the spare matter clusters up into her fur, her erflickering making gorgeous contrails of light across the black, stray matter sparkling off of her thick tail as she roars and closes her eyes again, bloooooowwwwiiiing up and up and up and up and up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger she pumps, the more giddy joy she radiates, bathing everything in pleasant warmth as she canters in place, and octuples in size, her head finally peeking up and out of the Milky Way itself; bigger still she swells, groaning with bliss as more and more of her emerges from the gigantic cosmic disc; soon her lower body sticks far, far out from it, the ring hugging her thick, amazingly huge neck like a cute decoration, a necklace for a not-so-little pony (Zing!)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe siiiighs and shakes all over, looking down at the necklace and giving a sweet coo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK HOW PRETTY I AM IN MY NECKLACE, MASTER, LOOK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's finally stopped growing, and her voice is like the end of everything, only cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks wonderful on you, Bella!

Curious, you snuggle Bella and whisper praise gently into her ear, and the also-confused mare moans and puffs, before blowing up thousands and thousands of times larger--and that was just a light little one-word praise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy smokes!\" you shout, at the sight of who had been talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gecko. A gecko...A FREAKING GECKO, bigger than huge, looming still over you both. The voice is feminine, like Bella's, so...you hope she's friendly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi!\" you stammer, as she blinks her gigantic eyes, and cocks her head at you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hi! Hello!\" she giggles, licking and eye cutely. \"I can't believe anything is so big that I can see it at this point--my Master's been growing me bigger for so long, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did! She just...vanished into me...a long, long while ago! But she ordered me to grow forever, before she disappeared, so...here I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really?\" Maybe she wasn't taken care of, like how Bella had kept you with her? \"Aren't you lonely like this, er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flicka,\" she added, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh! That's a horse name!\" Bella laughed, wiggling happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it?\" the vast gecko asked. \"What's your name, little horse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that's so pretty! I like your name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Bella suddenly rocketed even larger, bumping cutely against Flicka's immeasurable, endless belly. The gecko's great arms slowly, surely crashed in towards them, and she gave them both a godly hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...made Bella grow, too?\" you gasp, suddenly only half the size you were, relevant to your proportions on her before she grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought only I could do that,\" you murmur, in complete shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Master, I still love you!! Nobody praises like Master does! He loves me!\" Bella chirps, dancing in place, as Flicka continued hugging her softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see! Well, it's so nice to meet you both! Finally, some real company!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you, Flicka,\" Bella cheered. \"You're a very pretty reptile, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been called that!\" Flicka giggled, as she began to tremble violently all over. \"But you're prettier, Bella!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou''re too stunned that this sort of insanity happened with another pet, that it takes time for you to realize what's going on now. The more the two animals praise one another, the more aggressively their bodies continue to shake...</span></div></div>",

She is going faster then she ever did before. \"Faster?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe accelerates to a hundred miles an hour. The nearby scales are a blur. \"Faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou here a sonic boon as she accelerates to 1000 miles per hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella who faster can you go?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't but lets find out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoosh!!! She does what you can only describe as going into warp. Bella guess you want to now now faster she is going so a a speedometer is hung between her ears. It is label is smph (scaled miles per hour) the lowest number is a million next is a billion then a trillion and so on. The dial is already at a billion and is creeping up. Soon a trillion is is reached then a quadrillion. Pretty soon it broke into a pile of clockwork.

He had called you an hour and a half ago, telling you to come to his house, ASAP. It was an unspoken rule between you two that texts were for chatting, and actual phone calls were for emergencies, so whatever he needed you for must have been urgent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into the gravelly parking area in Danny's front garden, you wonder how he could afford the house at all, just like you did every time you visited for whatever reason came up. Realising that Danny's car was nowhere to be found, you frown and approach the front door to his house, glancing at the area of paddock approaching the front garden to see if Danny was lying there in an intoxicated haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in frustration at the lack of your friend, you ring the doorbell several times, receiving no answer. \"Okay, getting a bit creepy now...\" You mutter to yourself as you withdraw the key to the front door from your jacket pocket. It had been agreed you your group of friends, you and Danny included, that each of you needed to have a copy of the key to everyone else's front door, in case of emergency or something more mundane, such as forgetting your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlocking the door, you flick the light switch to illuminate the large hallway, which was somewhat spartan compared to the rest of the house. \"Hey, Danny? You okay, mate?\" You all but shout as you close the door behind you, and receiving no reply, yet again. Gulping, you begin to methodically search the house for any sign of your friend, until there was only one room left; the kitchen/dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the lights on, the whole house now illuminated, you growl when Danny was nowhere to be found. Even if he had just been, say, sprawled on the floor, deep asleep, you would have been satisfied, if a little miffed. A folded piece of paper on the table catches your eye, and you lean against the fridge as you unfold and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, [your name], I would have called earlier if I could've, but the phone signal was out all day, and I really had to get going. I was going to explain the situation to you when you got here, but like I said, I really had to get going. Anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was mainly white, with a few grey areas here and there, and was pretty damn big, at six foot six, although Danny could have been exaggerating her height slightly. Danny had also showed you several videos of him riding her, usually taken via camera mounted on helmet, during which he would usually pet her golden yellow mane as a reward for completing a particularly hard jump, or for managing to gallop much faster than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Zayna's perfectly fine with new people. My scent is on the letter, and I don't know if horses can smell all that well, but if you bring it with you she should figure out that you're connected to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yeah, my contact information is on another piece of paper in the living room.

You know, lead to gold? Well, he was trying to find a way to live forever, and used me as a steed as he travelled over the land, looking for expensive ingredients and substances for his experiments. One day, he was absolutely sure he had gotten his potion right, but he needed a test subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving reached the end of her lungs' capacity, Zayna draws in a huge breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he made me drink the potion, and hoped that it wouldn't cause anything bad to happen to me. As you can probably guess, it didn't. Anyway, he just thought that his potion didn't do anything and tried to find other ways of living forever. For some reason of other - i couldn't understand human speech at the time - he had to go away, and never came back, leaving me in the care of a retired mercenary. He seemed rather surprised when I was still completely fit ten years after he had recieved me. Even more so when I spoke to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZayna giggles loudly, practically laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that I was taught about how a horse who could live forever would shock most people.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were always a fan of rats. They were an underappreciated pet and you were slightly upset that more people didn't consider getting one. after all, they were small, smart and contrary to popular belief, quite clean. Regardless, after becoming a genetic scientist you came up with a plan to improve all that by making them larger, more intelligence and even allergy friendly so they would become a more popular type of pet. After helping a high ranking scientist at the genetics research company you work at make a breakthrough the higher ups gave you your own small lab and gave the green light to start your own project. In the end you went with your plan to create a new breed of super-rat and they barely blinked an eye when you requested a huge number of rats to test on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day earlier you actually completed the serum and administered it to all of them. With luck, they should all be in their cages with  the various modifications complete and all you would have to do is document it, do a few tests and write the report. Pushing open the door to your small lab you quickly ducked in and grabbed a white coat from a nearby hanger. Since you were pursuing this project alone you had the luxury of having the entire lab to yourself so you decided to skip the safety glasses and latex gloves you always had to wear. Starting up a computer for you to write down notes and data your eyes wandered over to something on the other side of the lab. On one of the tables were one of the cages you keep the rats in. You must have accidentally left it out when you clocked off the other night, not that it ultimately matters since the cage had all the food and water the occupant needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping closer you noticed something; the serum had worked! Although, from how the husky rat's white and grey fur was pressing against the thin metal bars of the cage it seemed to have worked a bit <i>too</i> well. It was larger than a cat! The rat pitifully squeaked as you observed it in its cramped cage and you immediately noticed that it would be impossible to get it out of the small cage door. Since the only way to get the rat out of the cage was to disassemble it you searched the many cupboards lining the lab for a screwdriver. After sifting through troves of useless equipment you eventually found one and started working on freeing your overgrown test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you unscrewed the side of the cage off your furry friend wasted no time in leaving and stretching out on the table. For a moment you looked on with worry, it <i>was</i> a large animal and could do some serious damage to you if it so wished, after all. Thankfully the rat seemed to be friendly as it reached up and quickly licked your hand and gave a few playful squeaks. Well, since it was already here and wasn't acting up you decide that you might as well write down some results from it. The rat was far too large to navigate the maze you set up to test their intelligence but its size shouldn't stop you from measuring how large and heavy it is. \"I'm just going to pick you up, okay?\" you said to the rat before you cautiously wrapped your hands around it. You hated sedating the animals but thankfully the rat was more than willing to go along with whatever you were planning on doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was heavy enough that you had to hold it against your chest as you moved it over to another table that had a large set of scales on it. You gently set it down and eagerly awaited for the numbers to stabilize, revealing that it weighed 6.8 kilograms. Ducking over to your computer and opening a spreadsheet you quickly entered in the number while the rat eyed you curiously as it continued standing on the scales. When you went back to the rat you were about to grab something to measure its dimensions when you noticed the digital numbers on the scales were slowly rising. For a moment you dismissed it as random fluctuations caused by movements from the large rat but it was sitting perfectly still as it watched you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers slowly ticked up one after another until the counter reached 7 kilograms. Dismissing it as faulty equipment you pulled out another set of scales and moved it over but this one was doing the same thing. It went from 7 to 7.1 to 7.2... For a moment you were dumbfounded until it hit you that this rat was actually getting heavier as the moments passed by. Backing away from it you could actually see it, too.  It was impossible and defied reason but the rat before you was evidence enough something strange was happening. Measuring its dimensions would be useless because it was obvious at this point that the rat was still getting larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth was slow and barely noticeable but it was undeniable that it was bigger than it was a few minutes ago, you wracked your brain as to what was happening. Mutations happen all the time in organisms and it wasn't that crazy to think that one coincidentally occurred to the rat overnight and messed with the gene therapy, but then again it could be a case of that you just forgot to put in the gene that actually stops their growth. The latter possibility made a shiver run up your spine. In the next room over were over a hundred rats that all received the same treatment the night before and if your fuzzy friend's growth was anything to go by they would be growing out of their cages at any time now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the door to the cage room, almost afraid of what was behind it. It would take you forever to get a serum to stop this rat's growth, let alone a whole army of them. Turning the handle of the door to the cage room creaked open to reveal that...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door opened up to a scene of pure chaos that confirmed your fears that all of them were growing. It was a cacophony of squeaking and straining metal. A few of them had already escaped their cages but a vast majority of them were still cramped up in their increasingly small metal prison. Screws simply popped out of the frames of the cages as they failed to contain their expansive furry bodies and entire panels of the cages began springing off one after the other. More and more giant rats were freeing themselves, seemingly rejoicing at their freedom with their other enlarged brethren. Some of them were even forming small teams to help the other rats that weren't big enough to break free, their increased size giving them enough strength to just pull the sides of the cage off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you were admiring their developed intelligence before you realized that even if you made them smarter, they were still just animals. The rats by now were considerably larger than an average cat and to make matters worse, there were over a hundred of them fighting for space in the small cage room. A squeak from the first one you found alerted the mischief of rats to your presence and you quickly noticed many beady eyes training on you. All at once, the horde moved and in a panic you tried to slam the door to the cage room shut. Too late, however, you found a large rat jump up and tackle your chest which made you fall to the ground. The survival instincts in your brain basically gave up and you went limp as you resigned yourself to be devoured alive by a horde of giant rats as more and more of them piled onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you felt no fangs digging into your flesh nor claws raking at your body, just the oppressive weight of lots of rats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur constantly rubbed against you and wet tongues would occasionally lash against your face. Getting over your initial panic you quickly caught on that they weren't hungry, but rather very happy to see you! Quite quickly you were enamored with all the friendly rodents falling over themselves to give you affection and you encouraged them by giving them pats and scritches as playful squeaks filled your ears. Furry bodies were on top of you, to the side and even occasionally lifting you up as they squirmed all around you. Unfortunately you came to the conclusion that you can't stay in this friendly fur pile for much longer since each ratty face that came to say hello to you was getting bigger than the last. Just like the first rat, all of these ones were getting bigger, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some struggle, you managed to stand upright and got a look at the massive horde of rats that surrounded you. Many of them have piled into the lab but the cage room was still looking very cramped, an unfortunate side effect from how each rat was gradually taking up more space. The diverse patterns and colors of the various rats made it look like the room was engulfed in a turbulent ocean of fur and with how they were approaching the size of a dog it was an effort not to be swept up by the excited rodents. By now they were tall enough to come up slightly higher than your knees and by the second you could feel their fur slowly ride up higher as they grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fact made you slightly nervous; you intended to make them larger and tweaked a few genes to accomplish that but now it was getting ridiculous. One of the main hurdles you encountered when developing the gene therapy was dealing with how their bodies would support their increased size but they all far surpassed your expected limit. You were glad that they still seemed healthy despite their increasingly ludicrous and unrealistic sizes, even if it hinted they could possibly grow indefinitely. As much as you were finding yourself adoring the giant friendly rodents, you realized that you should probably start working on a new serum and actually put a limit on their rampant growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWading through the rats you made your way to the other side of the lab where you primarily worked on the serum. The limiter gene was already developed but it was just not inserted into the initial serum. It would be easy enough to put back in and start developing but it would take a substantial amount of time and looking behind you, that might present some troubles. In the small time since you opened the cage room the rats have almost doubled in size. Working on a fix might be a fruitless adventure. How big would they be when you finish making all their individual injections? What if they break out of the lab and escape into the wild? What if they don't want you to stop their growth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir temperament assured you that they would most likely remain friendly despite an eventual size difference so you weren't afraid of them. One of them was even wrapped around your leg in affectionate hug, happily squeaking and rubbing its cute muzzle against your side. When you opened up a few drawers to get your equipment your eyes wandered over to a small box which held a number of vials containing a clear liquid. From the label you could tell right away it was the same serum that you administered to all the rats, obviously lacking the limiter. You must have made some extras for some reason you couldn't remember but looking at them sparked a strange intrusive thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if you administered it to more rats? Remembering the wholesome feeling of being cuddled by a horde of giant rats and seeing more vials of the serum triggered the thought. A part of you wanted other people to experience the feeling of being showered in affection by huge fluffy rodents and doubling the amount of growing rats sounded like a good way to achieve that. It was a silly idea but what was worse was that you were actually considering it. Being in a genetics research company, access to more rats was easy as walking to another laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to you, a small group of not-so-small rats were standing on their hind legs looking up at you expectantly as if they were silently willing you to go through with it. The fact that they were almost a foot shorter than you when they were standing like that jolted you back to reality. Overall their size had developed to a point they were essentially larger than a human-being and just maintaining eye contact with one of the rats you could see that their height was still gradually increasing. If you waited for a few minutes you might even see the point that it grows taller than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, these were some very giant rats. You assured yourself that the world doesn't need more giant rats but the strange thought persisted. Creating an army of giant rats would definitely be put on your permanent record and if you intentionally added more fuel to the fire you could be put away if they accidentally hurt someone. It would probably be more responsible to try and stop them from getting bigger. Picking up a vial in one hand and the vial with the limiter in the other, you thought about what you should do...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The result of this is that she hadn't ate anything of the last year and half. Now you could see her bones, which meant most of her blubber was gone so she was also very cold. Now the whale was digesting it own muscles. Ever day she became weaker. Every rise to the surface to breathe was harder then the last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as last she couldn't make it at all. She had taken her last breath. She had 30 minutes left. Enough time to say goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like its finally over, its for the best. Now I can apologise to all those millions of ghosts I made,\" Proclaimed Walsy Solemnly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have one more breath in you, just one more, please, Just. One. More,\" begged the krill, who never thought it needed a name, all the deaths would just hurt more if they had names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, these flippers don't move at all now. I'm going to die, now, but dying with your best friend, pretty good as deaths go,\" denied Walsy sorrowfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they said their last words to each other (words far to private for me to write here) the Walsy the whale sank to the ocean floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreviously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 year after the resolution Walsy had become a legend of amongst krill and many other sea creatures. Now a swarm of krill approach, something they would never ever do before, because they'd get eaten. They get up with the krill in the ear. The krill explained about the resolution the whale had made, and the huge cost it was clearly having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to look for a way for the whale to eat without killing anyone. They would contact would spread the world so all the krill in all the oceans, as well as lakes and rivers. This there are krill everywhere they'll be able to look everywhere, and quickly too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was 6 months ago, the krill had been working hard to keep the whale alive for that time. Without its support it would have given up a long time ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching Walsy was the largest krill shoal the world had ever seen. Walsy had earnt such bemused respect amongst other whales that they decided to leave it alone, at least until Walsy received his message, they all knew it would be Walsy's last day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've done\" they all cried out as once \"we've found a way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly found the ear krill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late, she can't go up to breath any more, she can't even talk anymore,\" decried the ear krill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That why there's so any of us,\" said several krill at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe krill then formed a cylinder just below the way. The first row of the cylinder smashed into the whale, slowing it descent a tiny amount The next hit, slowing it more. The next and the next and the next. The descent stopped. More then more rows of krill hit, the whale started to go up. It each hit it went up faster then faster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whale breathed very shallowly. Deadly carbon dioxide left and life sustaining oxygen flowed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whales eyes opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm alive somehow. There's no way your going to hell,\" deduced Walsy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns out you have a lot of friends. They've found a way you can live without killing anybody,\" explained the ear kill, it then asked the other krill \"so what is it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll found a wishing coral, it in the great barrier reef, it far more power then the other wishing corals, some say it is infinitely powerful,  But it only grants completely unselfish wishes by the most moral of creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's thousands of miles away and I can't swim at all,\" cautioned Walsy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll swim for you,\" replied all the krill at once (yes they had planned this, there no krill hive mind here)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you all want to help a mass murderer then I certainly don't have the moral authority to say no,\" conceded the whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe set off. As they went along thousands of sea creatures helped push, and nobody ate anybody else. Various sea mammal snuggled up get to Walsy to keep him warm and seas spiders made him a sweater in many many pieces.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow ever even with all the help they got they still came across a problem on the way. </span></div></div>",

Between pants and the stop-start motion of the growth, the deer looks down at you and ask \"W-what are they doing to my forest?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look up at him, dumbfounded by his size. He was about 10 feet tall and still growing. \"Um...\" You start, interrupted by a grunt from the deer as he surges another two feet. \"If I remember correctly there's a logging company that was setting up not far from here. I guess they've started?\" <br>\r\nThe guardian was slow to reply, too preoccupied with his growth. \"We must stop them!\" He brazenly exclaims, regaining his composure and standing up to his full height at 15 feet. He was by far the biggest animal you have ever seen, and he was still growing.

Standing up on his thigh you could just barely see over his rump. Grabbing onto his thick fur you pull yourself up, scrambling to balance yourself on the deer's back so you don't slide off. Looking up you get a feeling of vertigo as the stag slowly dominates more of your view and the ground gets further away. The deer turns his head, watching you crawl along his back until you get to the base of his neck. \"Are you ready?\" He asks, his voice booming.<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" You say as you tighten your grip around his tree trunk sized neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he stands.

You felt like you were making good distance and going the right direction but you should have arrived at the new logging camp by now. Perhaps it was the fact you were looking at the forest from a different angle or because the branches of the trees were starting to obscure your vision. Since setting off the forest guardian had been steadily growing larger, the fur of his neck lengthening and widening in your hands as you held on. At a guess he must have already doubled in size after you took position on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noticed that he seemed to be growing a bit faster than before. Given his size, his body was brushing up closely against all the trees in the forest as he sauntered his way through it. Twigs and branches snapped from every direction around you and with the way he was constantly stopping and tilting his neck, you guessed his antlers were no longer fitting between the tree trunks. When one of the large velvety protrusions snagged against a trunk and brought down half the tree in a thunderous crash you could feel the deer let out a quick gasp before he quickly expanded for a moment. The deer seemed to be grunting in frustration at the fact but you had to ask him on the off chance he didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh... Guardian?\" You call out to him. \"When you said you get bigger if a tree gets hurt in an unnatural way - does that include if you harm them by accident, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer stopped and grumbled. \"Maybe. A giant deer carving a path through the forest definitely isn't natural.\" His voice boomed all around you as it bounced off the surrounding trees. It sounded much more louder and powerful now. You didn't want to get into an argument with such a huge creature set out on a divine mission but his reply only raised more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that whatever power made you the forest guardian would have took that into account?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, a loud crunching sound rung out before he jolted upwards a couple of feet again. \"Gods work in mysterious ways, human. It's not like I'm relishing in destroying the forest I was tasked to protect.\" You decide to drop the conversation out of equal parts intimidation and respect, since it sounded like he was not too pleased with the fact himself. \"Are we there yet?\" He boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you took too long to respond the sounds of crunching branches came to a stop as he stood still. \"Are we going the right way, human?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated for a moment but the fact his body was still constantly inching higher reminded you that it was important to talk to him sooner rather than later. \"I don't know. I can't see where we're going anymore from up here. The tree branches are in the way and the fact your neck is getting too thick for me to look past isn't helping either. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive deer merely sighed. \"It's not your fault. The higher ups definitely could have planned this better. I do have a plan, though.\" You flinched as the huge neck before you began to shift, followed by a cacophony of cracking and crunching. Not a moment later you could feel gravity pull you deeper into the deer's lengthening fur as he grew. You realized that he was intentionally destroying the trees to make himself bigger. In-between a sharp gasp or a quick moan, you could hear the guardian quickly mutter a sorry to the trees he was wrecking. Eventually he stopped and raised his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, the sky seemed closer as you could barely make out the tops of the trees. Trailing your gaze up his neck however, it stretched upwards until it breached that top and stood above the canopy. His antlers stood proud and free from any entangling trees. A moment of awe hit you as you realized that meant he was over a hundred feet tall. He stretched his body a bit as if he was relieving some knots in his muscles. By itself it wasn't much of a movement, but at this staggering size it was like experiencing an earthquake and you were bowled over until you were sitting down in the indent between his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the course fur for support you calm yourself down as you get over the fact you could have easily fallen to your death just then. You can see his head turning to the side as he looks at you out the corner of his eye. \"Oh! Sorry, human! What little movements I now make must be quite the experience for you down there. I'll try my best to keep that in mind as he continue. Now, as for plan.\" Slowly he turned his head forward again and arched his neck down. \"Please climb up. I'm sure I'm large enough you can use my head as a proper vantage point now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat and stared at the long, furry road ahead of  you. <i>He wanted you to climb all that?</i> Regardless, considering the fact the climb was getting longer by the minute thanks to the work of the loggers out in the forest, you urged yourself to get started. Standing up you stumbled along his back until you reached his neck and began climbing. You were making good distance as you were able to pull yourself up easily on his thick fur but the slight wobbles as he idly moved kept scared you into stopping since you were aware just how high up you were now. Down below you could hear the cracking of branches as his body continued to slowly grow and push into the surrounding forest in what felt like a constant feedback loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, though, you make it to the base of his head and muster the courage to look up from the tawny brown fur below you. The view left you awestruck for a moment as you took in the sight. He had grown large enough that most of neck was poking through the canopy giving you a clear view of the surrounding forest and distant landscape. You could even see the city in the distance. The view downward wasn't so awe inspiring, however. Moving over to one of his velvety antlers and holding onto it for support, you could just see past his muzzle and see the ground which made your stomach lurch with each small movement he made. It didn't help it seemed to be getting further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you guide me from up there, human?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... I think so.\" From this new vantage point you could definitely make out some landmarks and you even think you could see the black exhaust fumes from the logging machinery rising up in the distance. \"It's a little to your left, that way\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That way we go, then.\" The deer bellowed before turning. You wrapped as much of your arm around his antler as you could when he started moving. He seemed to be doing his best keeping his head level but it still felt you like you were on a boat on a choppy sea. You sure hoped the black fumes were the source of the disturbance in the forest because it felt like the deer was growing more steadier and faster now, the antler to your side giving out a gentle creaking sound as it grew. Thankfully you were approaching a small clearing that seemed to be hiding the source of the smoke.</span></div></div>",

And yet...there she was, inflating to the size of a house...then a medium house...then a full blown mansion. All the while, people begin to inch away, still taking the odd picture or video of the prodigious pachyderm as she continues to magnify. By now she's easily 80 feet tall, and barely fitting in her exhibit pen--her ever-increasing rear and belly pressing against the Plexiglass wall with more and more pressure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just in time, common sense kicks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone away from the walls!\" You bellow, ducking behind a nearby bench. \"TAKE COVER NO--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKRACK-THUNK! The pressure is at last too much for the walls of the hippo's pen, and they violently give way, sheets of Plexiglass jumping from the metal frame in many directions, too heavy to fly far but fast enough to injure if they hit somebody. Luckily, your warning was heeded and nobody was hurt at all. Ducking behind the bench had even been unnecessary; none of the walls had reached that distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now your attention went back to the hippo. Understandably, since she was now outside of her pen. And 200 feet tall. No, 300....400...450...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the glow faded from her massive, 500-foot form, revealing the same reddish-purple she-hippo from earlier...only at a Brobdingnagian scale. She could probably crush a tank by sitting on it, easily! Heck, her feet had left craters in the walkway when she'd exited her pen! Along with the rest of the crowd, you stared up at her, waiting for some cue to either approach, or run for the hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo snorts, shaking its head as if confused. She cranes her neck around this way and that, like she was just now noticing her newfound size...and the tiny humans who were staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook off your disbelief and shock to listen to the crowd's chattering whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look! Is it...smiling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, is the big hippo smilin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, smiling? The hippo?

You try to back away, but you're already against the pen wall. The elephant girl stops and lets out a quiet growl of satisfaction, as if you passed some kind of test when she sniffed at you. Before you can react, her trunk shoots towards you again, passing by your left side and curling completely around you. You can't help but shout and beat on the trunk with your fists as her grip tightens, her trunk coiling around your body.

It was probably just the neighbour's dog again, nothing to worry abou-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUNK.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop mid thought, your mind reaffirming that it did, in fact, hear a very loud thumping noise from downstairs. Swearing, you grab your baseball bat from under your bed - you were always a bit paranoid about this kind of thing, which seems to have paid off - and stealthily move downstairs to confront your would-be, unskillful burglar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPositioning the bat so that you can easily swing it with one hand, you creepy into the living room, which was completely black, and move for the switch by virtue of spatial memory. You prepare to charge and swing at the burglar, and flick on the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you stood a green dragon, looking very uncomfortable. It's legs were positioned on the side of its body, both of them thick, and vaguely semicircular in appearance, with three long, yellow claws emerging from the lowest, foremost part of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also had two comparatively short arms, both positioned close to its legs, with two claws on the end. You look upwards, at its head. It was long as sloped, and the same light green as the rest of its body. It had two yellow eyes, its pupils being a solid red, small, thin trails of smoke emerging from its nostrils, which were on the end of its muzzle. It had two short ears, directly above which were two long, yellow horns, which were pressing into the ceiling, as it was so large. There was also a large red spike on the top of its head, surrounded by a dark green patch of scales. There were more along its back, going to the end of its long tail. Two short, stubby wings with yellow membranes emerged from its back, most likely for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a vivid yellow underbelly, running all the way from underneath its head to the end of its tail, with uniform orange stripes breaking up the solid colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly weren't sure what to do, or even what to think. The dragon was studying you closely, seemingly eager to find a way to stop its horns from damaging the ceiling and walk over to you before wrapping you into a hug with those big green arms. You noted that the shape of the dragon was akin to an 'S', with its arms being at the middle bend, and its legs shortly underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat underbelly looked...soft. A thought enters your mind, of the dragon laying asleep on the floor, you wrapped up in a hug, pressed into its yellow belly. That would be fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Original author: Redfang3986<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a small human boy standing outside waiting for you. You knew this boy, his name was Ket and he often visited you. He was a friendly little guy, if you got to know him. Most of the time he was shy, but if you waited long enough and were nice to him. Then he would definitely warm up to you. Ket had been told by the villagers to stay away from your lair, but he came to see you anyway. You liked Ket, he wasn't all that strong, or all that smart but his presence filled you with joy for some reason and you always enjoyed it when he visited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKet stood at a little under four feet and was about ten years old. He was small for his age, but that didn't matter to you. He was dressed in a simple tunic with torn pants. His skin was very pale and he had blue eyes. What you found to be his most unique and unusual quality was his hair. It was smooth and came down in a mop over his head, but it was the color of his hair that made him stand out. It was sky blue. He told you that he was often picked on or avoided because of this. People thought that he was a freak or possessed and stayed away from him. Even his own parents abandoned him. You were his only true friend. At least that's how he saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't see Ket as your friend you saw him more as your student or your charge. You believe that you were Ket's teacher or guardian. Whenever he came along you would always try and teach him something or read to him. You tried your best to teach Ket about the world and other subjects. Such as history, math, language and the like. Other times you would tell him a story or cheer him up when he's sad. All in all you deeply cared for Ket and worried about him. Again you have no idea why but you didn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Bahimut!\" (Bah-he-mutt) The boy shouted with glee. He ran up to you and you lowered your snout and nuzzled him gently. Ket hugged you as best he could. After a few moments you let go and looked down at him. He was covered in dirt and bare foot. Which was concerning. You knew he had shoes and it was a long trek up to your cave, you hoped he didn't have any injuries. \"Ket, show me your feet\", you said. Ket happily lifted his foot. There were small cuts on his sole. He then showed you the other foot and it to had small cuts. All the cuts were bleeding but didn't look infected. \"Where are your shoes, Ket\", you asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tried to look away but you made him look at you. \"Answer me.\" You made your voice a little sterner. \"The village chief took them to prevent me from coming here\", he said defeated. \"He doesn't want me to see you anymore. He says your evil and will eat me. But I don't believe him. He's a big dummy.\" The boy finished and looked up at you, tears forming in his eyes. You bend down and nuzzle him gently. You can understand where the chief was coming from. You were a dragon and you were big and intimating, but you were also kind and would never harm someone much less eat them, unless they did something unforgivable. Again even in those cases the worst you would do is probably scare them or remove their means of hurting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut humans didn't see this. In your long life you have been told by fellow dragon that humans attack what they don't understand. So you could see the villagers concern with letting a child hang out with such a big dragon. They were scared. You thought it might be best to end this right now. Scare Ket off so that he never comes back. It would certainly make his life better and he would get his shoes back. But as your about to even consider doing this, you look into Ket's tear filled eyes and realize you can't. He saw you as his only friend, the only person that liked him, you couldn't bring yourself to take that away from the little guy. You continue to nuzzle him till he calms down then look him in the eyes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right\", you say to him. \"If you want to keep seeing me keep coming. It doesn't matter what anyone says. It's your choice.\" You nuzzle him a little more till you hear him giggle. You nuzzle him a little more before letting up. \"So, what are we going to do today?\" He asked looking up at you with hope filled eyes. You smile down at him and scoop him up in your paw and bring him to your eye level. You give him a little kiss then place him on your back. \"Well first thing were going to do is, heal those feet of yours and remove any infections you may have.\" You state while walking inside your cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean your going to use magic\", he asked gleefully.<br>\r\n\"Yup\", you answered.<br>\r\n\"Yay\", he shouted happily. \"I love seeing your magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true you were a dragon that knew magic. Many of you kind did, but magic was a very frightful thing to humans and it was considered the work of the devil. But you never used that kind of magic. The only magic you ever used was to make your stories come alive or for healing and protection purposes. Ket loved seeing images of the story you told him. He would clap squeal with joy when he was happy, cuddle up against you when he was scared of a monster or bad guy he saw, and sometimes he would move so close to the images that your magic produced that he could reach out and touch them. He only did this when he was getting excited. You always enjoyed how he'd react and didn't care that using magic like that made you tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After your feet feel better, I was going to teach you a little bit about multiplication. But since your feeling down I'll skip the lesson and tell you a story instead.\" This earned you a hug as the boy wrapped his arms around your neck as best he could. \"Also there's a big storm coming and I don't want you to run home in it so you can either spend the night with me or I can fly you down to the village.\" Ket looked up at you excited. He had never seen you fly and was probably surprised to learn that you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can fly\", he shouts!<br>\r\nYou smile at him. \"You didn't think these wings were just for show did you?\" You flex your wings and Ket stares at them in awe. He reaches out and touches it. You loved how excited he seemed to be about flying. \"Yes, Ket I'll fly you down to the village, but you could also spend the night with me and I'll fly you down once the storm lets up. This one looks like it's going to last a while.\" Ket looks at you again with happy eyes and wonders what he should do. You swear you can see smoke coming out of that head of his. \"Would you like me to decide for you\", you ask? He nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should stay here. I know the villagers will worry about you, but I also know that you live alone and are terrified when your alone. Plus you'll still get to fly on my back when I take you there tomorrow, okay.\" The kid hugs your neck again and you take this as a yes. Now to move on to healing his feet. You walk deep into your cave where a small glowing spring is waiting. You slowly pick Ket up and put his feet in the spring. You lift him out and the cuts on his feet are gone. Looking at the spring you mutter something and dip your free paw in and purify the water. You then set Ket down near the far end of the cave and fetch some small trees from the corner. You lay them down in front of him and use your fire breath to light them ablaze. You then lay down and watch as he cuddles up against you, fearful of the flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Ket\", you whisper softly. \"Just stay close to me and it won't hurt you.\" The boy presses closer to you and you mutter something. The flame turns blue and images form in the smoke. Finally you wrap your tail around his body and begin your story. He listens closely and time flies by. You look up and realize it's night and the storm has just begun. You end your story there, put out the flame, cuddle Ket and wait for him to fall asleep. When he closes his eyes and your sure he's asleep and you gently drift to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes slowly open. You had an interesting dream last night. You dreamed that you had to protect Kent from a terrible formless beast. But it was too big and managed to pin you down easily. You wouldn't let it take Kent. You wouldn't let ANYONE take Kent away from you. Suddenly, in the dream, you started growing and growing! Soon the formless mass dropped Kent and ran away in fear, as Kent fell into your paw. You brought him to your face and smiled softly. He looked at you in awe and hugged your muzzle. At that point the dream ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke, you noticed that things looked...smaller...MUCH smaller. You then realize something: You had grown huge! You were probably 500 feet now! Your cave was just BARELY big enough to hold you in. How in the world did you grow so big? Was it the dream perhaps? Regardless, you have grown massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Kent started waking up. He looked around as he saw a lot of white scales. He looked up and showed a face of complete shock at your current size. You were worried that Kent would be fearful of your new size. Instead however, he exclaimed \"Wow! You got soooo biiiiig!\" He says amazed. You couldn't help but feel a bit proud at his love of your current size.\"Indeed I have. Though, this was not intended.\" You tell him. \"But what now? Can you even fit out of your cave?\" Kent asks. You shake your head sighing. \"I can barely fit in here as is. There is no chance I can get without breaking it.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if you got even bigger? Then you could outgrow your cave!\" He cheers. You chuckle and shake your head. \"I think a better idea would be trying to use magic to shrink down.\" You say. Though, a part of you, a very small part, wanted to grow even bigger as well. You had never felt this way before. Perhaps it was because of Kent's positive encouragement for growth combined with the admittedly pleasurable feeling of being so large and powerful. You wouldn't abuse your power, but maybe you could change peoples minds on dragons if you were even bigger.</span></div></div>",

You decide to kneel down and gently nuzzle him to cheer the little one up. \"Listen to me, Ket\", you start. \"Truthfully I want to see if I can get bigger to. But I also don't want to destroy my home, or much worse risk hurting you with my growth. So instead I think I'll focus on shrinking back down, okay.\" Ket doesn't meet your eyes. You realize he really wanted to see you get bigger and that makes you feel a little guilty about your decision. \"But if you behave, maybe I'll grow a little later.\" The boy's eyes immediately light up. \"Promise!?\" He exclaims. Chuckling you say, \"Yes but only if your good. Now stand back I need to focus.\" Ket obeys and gets as far back from you as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and begin focusing. Channeling your magic, you imagine yourself getting smaller. It works, your body slowly begins to shrink. You decide not to go back to your original height and settle for the moment at merely a hundred feet. When your done, you open your eyes and look around. Good, you could move around more easily. Gently laying down, you turn your gaze over to Ket whose eyes glitter with excitement. Before you can even get a word out he runs up to you and hugs your chest tightly. He giggles happily and says \"You didn't shrink all the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling you cover his body with your paw. \"Well I thought it would be boring if I shrunk all the way back down. Plus you seem to like me big. So I thought this would be a nice way to compromise.\" Ket hugged you tighter. Satisfied with the kid's happiness you carefully listen outside. The storms still going on but you can hear something else out there. The marching of boots, the sound of voices and the smell of humans. Your body tenses up and you carefully look down at Ket, who's still hugging you oblivious to what's going on outside.  You listen closely and can hear the voices clearer now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if it eats us\", says a panicked young man. \"Well just have to kill it before it has the chance\", says another. \"What about Ket\", asked a third. \"What about the little hell spawn?\" You utter a soft growl at that insult. Ket looks up at you a little worried. \"What's wrong\", he ask. For the moment you ignore Ket and focus on the voices. \"We gave him plenty of chances, took him in when his parents abandoned him, raised him, clothed him, fed him. We warned him about that monster. The elder took away his shoes and still the little heathen went to see that thing. As far as I'm concerned he dies with that dragon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bare your fangs as flames flicker at the corners of your mouth. Your free paw digging into the ground and your tail lashes the hard rock floor. They were talking about killing Ket, just for being close to you. No, you would not let that happen. You promised yourself that no one was allowed to hurt Ket, no one was going to separate you two. No one was going to kill him. Just then you heard sniffling and looked down to see the little one staring up at you with fear in his eyes on the verge of tears. You stopped and realized you were scaring him. You gently crane your head down and nuzzle him. \"Shh, I's okay Ket, everything's okay. Everything will be okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't quite sure how to explain this to Ket. But you decided it would be best if he didn't know. \"Ket I need you to listen to me. I need you stay here while I go outside.\" \"What, why?\" He asked innocently. \"The villagers are here to... talk to me about you. I need you to stay here and no matter what you do, do not go outside, okay?\" Ket trembles for a moment. \"But\", he starts. \"No\" you state. \"No buts, I need you to listen to me and stay right here okay.\" You say again sterner. The little human knows better then to argue with you when you use that tone of voice, so he simply gives a dejected okay. \"Good i'll be right back.\" You get up and begin to leave just then you feel something grab your tail. Looking back you see Ket hug your tail. \"Be careful.\" You give him a reassuring smile and walk out into the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey've gathered quite the number you notice. At your original height this might have been a problem but standing at a hundred feet tall, this wasn't that bad. You could probably scare half of them away with a growl. Looking down at they, they didn't think you'd be this big. Some of them already looked like they were going to wet themselves just from your presence alone. There were around twenty of them with pitchforks, torches, hoe's and other farming equipment, not really suitable for hunting a dragon. They didn't have any armor with them either. After surveying the situation you were certain the villagers were no threat to you, but the could easily hurt Ket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo what do I owe the pleasure of this fine visit\", you ask somewhat angry. A villager in the back shouted in fright. \"It talks!\" The leader a big burly man built like a wall obviously the leader, shouts back, \"Shut up! Who cares if it talks! It'll die all the same! It and that little brat it has with it.\" At this you swing your tail knocking the pitchfork out the human's hand and lean in close to him growling intensely. \"Never talk about Ket like that in my presence, human. That boy is as sweet as they come and If I ever hear you talk about him like that again I'll burn you to ash.\" You'd never actually do that but you had experience dealing with humans before. No matter how big they talked threaten them a little and they'd usually back down. Usually being the key word here, this was not one of those times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the villagers coward in fear and few even ran away, the leader stood his ground and stared you dead in they eyes. \"Doesn't matter how big you are, we'll still take you down.\" Just then you hear a familiar voice from behind you. \"Stop fighting!\" You swing your head around see Ket standing in the rain drenched and on the verge of tears. \"Please can't we just talk-\", Ket didn't get to finish that sentence as one of the humans hurled a rock at his head. The boy screamed in pain and fell to the ground. He laid there crying as the scent of blood hit your nostrils. You turned your full attention back to the villagers as you wrapped your tail defly around Ket positioning yourself between him and them. Through barely containded anger you utter \"How dare you.\" </span></div></div>",

These humans were so disgusting and so vile to a child like Ket, that you can't help but begin to grow back to your previous massive size in rage. The humans look utterly shocked and terrified as you grow to 150 feet, then 250 feet, then 500 feet finally. You look down at the now puny humans. It felt good to get them to shut up like this, especially since they didn't seem to be afraid before. Every villager except for the leader ran away in fear. The leader looked back at them shouting \"Cowards! God will smite you when you perish!\" Then he stops and looks up, up and up at your huge form. You then lower your head to him. \"So...what was that about taking me down?\" You ask confidently smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quivered and shook, and then bolted back down the mountain side crying in fear and terror. You feel good, and then look back at Kent, hoping he's not too scared. Quite the opposite actually. He loves to see you so big, as he hugs your tail gleefully. You had to admit, it felt nice to be so large and powerful, especially since it made it much easier to protect Kent. \"Thanks for protecting me.\" Kent says smiling up at your face. You smile back, bringing him close to your face with your tail and gently nuzzle him. \"It's no trouble.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really was no trouble actually. This growth didn't even tire you out like you thought it would. If anything, it made you feel even <b>more</b> magically and physically powerful somehow. But how though? Was this just a new facet of your magic you had discovered? Or could it be because you did for Kent instead of yourself? This required a bit of testing. You decide to do this for one reason only: To make Kent happy to see you even bigger. You focus, and the feeling of growth courses through your body as you expand once again. Bigger and bigger you swell, reaching 1000 feet before you decide to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoooooa! You got even bigger!\" Kent shouts in joy. Luckily you could hear and see him just fine. Your senses seem to have been improved thanks to the magic of this size changing. And you had to admit...just growing felt really good. Pleasurable even. Once again, you also feel more powerful with your magic, and not just your physical strength. In fact, your magic powers seem to be preventing your paws from breaking the mountain you stood on. \"Indeed I did.\" You say in response Kent's exclamation. \"Can you get even bigger?\" He asks, his eyes shining with excitement. You ponder for a moment. Sure, it would be nice to grow even bigger, and feel the power surge through you, but you don't want to lose yourself to the growth.</span></div></div>",

But you wanted to at least keep a calm appearance, so you say to Kent \"Very well, I will indulge you a bit and grow some more.\" You say, which causes him to cheer with glee. You focus your powers, desiring to make yourself bigger for Kent's sake, and a bit of your own. This time, you don't hold back, and grow rapidly. 1000 feet quickly becoming 2000 feet as you expand in ever direction. You couldn't help but murr at how pleasing this surge in size feels. You chant in your head <i>Bigger, bigger, BIGGER, BIGGER!</i> the bigger you get, the more pleasing the growth, and the bigger you want to get. Eventually, you surge straight up to a mile tall and don't seem to be stopping. \"Yaaaaaay!\" You hear Kent cheer, enjoying you growth. You place him on your back so he's somewhere safe, as you felt like you were just getting started. \"Get ready to watch Kent. Cause I've just gotten started.\" You tell him confidently to which he cheers and you grow even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole village from which Kent was from looks up in awe and fear of the 2 mile tall dragon that was looming over them, whose paw could easily smush the entire town into nothing but dust. You don't care for them though.They're so tiny compared to you, they couldn't even hurt you if they tried. You felt so strong. So powerful. You felt like...a God. The thought was incredibly enticing to feel as you reach 5 miles tall. Kent was just there on your back, cheering on your incredible growing form. \"What do you think Kent? Aren't I amazing?\" You ask chuckling confidently. \"Yeah! You're super amazing!\" He yells with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \"Good. Because I'm not even close to being done yet.\" You boast and grow faster now. You reach 10 miles easily, your body beginning to glow with a godly light. People from around the world bow before you, whether in fear or respect, you don't care. Because you just are way too into the growth right now to actually care. \"BIGGER...BIGGER...BIIIGGERRRR!\" You boom in a voice that is loud and yet not loud, your very being bending the laws of reality to your whim. On and on you grew, a hundred miles tall seeming like such an order of magnitude to those below, but for you, it's as easy as breathing. Kent is just giggling excitedly as he rides your seemingly endless back. \"You're so huuuuuuge!\" He cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, and pet him gently with your mighty tail, as gentle as you ever were with him and everyone else. Even at 1000 miles tall, with your paws smothering whole kingdoms under singular digits, your body refuses to hurt anyone, and you refuse to hurt anyone. You will not be like the rage filled humans who wish harm upon anyone they don't like or disagree with. You will be the new god of a new era of peace. You will not let anyone be hurt or hurt each other. You will bring untold and unimaginable prosperity to every atom of this world that now rests between your still growing paws. Kent was on your back, safe thanks to your magic creating an atmosphere for him to breathe in. \"Woooooow! You're so strong!\" He cheers. You couldn't help but chuckle proudly. \"Indeed I am Kent. And with this power...I will ensure an age where everyone can be happy.\" You say, the whole world hearing that last bit. They cheer and bow before you, accepting you as the new God. Whether out of fear or respect, again, you care not. So long as you can make everyone in the world happy. However, you can't help but wonder...what does the 'real' God think of your growing and constantly ascending form of yours?</span></div></div>",

Could this be God's power and if it was just how far and how much could you do with it. Kent meanwhile continues to cheer on your ever growing form as the earth itself seems to shrink away as you grow bigger and bigger. You look at him and suddenly get an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Kent\", you call down to him. He turns his head and looks at you. \"I want to try something sit still.\" The boy obliges and you close your eyes and focus you can feel just how vast your power is and know that what you want would be no trouble at all. Snapping your eyes open a glow engulfs Kent. The glow expands at an incredibly rate meanwhile you shift your continuously growing body which has easily at this point matched the earth in size so that you are instead holding the glowing mass with your paws. All at once the glow fades and a very large and very confused looking blue hatchling is looking around up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm\", you say to yourself. \"Guess human years are different then dragons.\" The hatchling in your paws shakes his head a few times times and blinks before looking up at you and then at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it speaks in Kent's voice. \"What happened Bahimut\", he asked looking around confused and a little alarmed. \"why am I a\", he trails off and you speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to do something nice fore you\", you start. \"Without you this may not have even been possible. Furthermore, I know you don't have any parents and even in the new world order that i'm creating i'm sure you don't want to go back to your village because of how they treated you. And\", you glance and glare down at Kent's village, the villagers in question swallow nervously. \"I myself do not want you to go to a place where you are not loved. Even though I would never hurt you no matter what size I am, I wanted to do this to both give you a home and a family. But it seems that while you may be a ten year old human child. Ten years as a dragon still makes you a hatchling. I know it will be a hard change but-oof.\" Your interrupted as Kent has managed to weasel out of your grip and tackle you in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kent may quite possibly be the biggest hatchling alive, he is still a hatchling, and compared to you that hug just surprised you more then anything else. He is now gripping your chest tightly his tail wagging happily. You take a moment before gently patting his head and embrace him yourself. After a few minutes you both look at each other and the continuously shrinking planet. Kent turns his attention back to you. \"So\", he begins. \"Does this mean I'm your son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look at him. \"I suppose it does\", you reply still taking this all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make me older?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, but learning how to be a dragon would be easier if you were like this. So I think it might be for the best if for now you remained a hatchling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\", Kent replies cheerfully. \"Can I change size to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", you reply. \"This is something I acquired from  the old god\", but i will grow you in accordance to my height as I continue growing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks slightly disappointing before brightening up again. \"So as a dragon will you teach me how to fly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How to breathe fire\", he ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", you answer again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How to use magic?\" This continues for a while, with Kent asking questions and you answering yes or no to them. All the while the two of you continue to grow bigger and bigger as the earth populace stare up in awe at their ever growing god and his kid. Eventually your internal Clock tells you  that it's getting late. You decide that's enough questions for one day and with Kent pressed up against your chest you kneel down and very gently pick up the earth which is little more then this size of a marble to you now. Kent is curious so he ask to see it saying yes as long as he just looks, you begin wondering what to for bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could shrink yourself and Kent back down and move right into your cave. Kent might not be very happy but you figure as long as he's with you he won't complain that much. You could also continue to test the limits of your new powers and just fashion a new lair into existence. Or you could simply sleep with in the vastness of space. </span></div></div>",

So it was magic fire it should burn you you think especially if it came from Angel and speaking of Angel where was that massive fairy dragon of your there was no way Angel would dare leave you alone not now anyway and then that when you heard the snoring man it rumbled the cave how did you not notice it before or did it just start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to find out what was make that noise even thought you had a guess of who or what was making it, but it was pretty dark it still dark up the path way to the mouth of the cave while a little hesitate to try and pick up the magic flame as it was technical still a fire but you tried and just like you expected it did burn you just made you a lot hotter. As you when up there were claw mark that were fresh and skid marks it looks likes Angel had a growth spurt a bit bigger than planed you had to giggle nefariously would your fairy dragon even and you push that thought out of your head no Angel would love you that was quite clear but you hate to admit you did want to see Angel keep growing and maybe Angel already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long maybe 10 to 15 mins to reach the caves entrance you thought made athought made not as there was a solid wall of silver all crack it kind of looked like scales ha ha ha you laughed and then it hit you as you ran your hand over the scales and you heard what to you sound like a very load purring and then a large slit eye started to open yep you it hit you that large silver wall was just Angel tank God but man did Angel grow not angry or sad you were now getting used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Now back to your POv)<br>\r\nMaster you say in a half daze \" Angel what did I say\" David said. You shoot him a look like really do you think I care about what I call you and just say right now and as long as there is not a reality warp I will call you my master you took care of me when I need it most so deal with or shut up about what I should call you. \" angel if I'm still you mas\" and you cut him off by picking him up and pinning under one paw it wasn't enough to hurt him but would shut him up as all you heard was muffled words it was quite fun being this big you picked up you paw after a few mins ok now what where you about to say before I used my paws a sort of muting device. \" I was saying you can call me what ever\" David looked sad, good learn that lesion fast didn't you master I know what I did was mean and sorry about that but I couldn't take it any more. \" But I mean size difference and we don't even knew that your going to stop growing (even though I hope you don't)\" David said, I'm sorry what was that last part you heard your tiny master just fine even though he might not have want you to. \"What is going to happen to me if I don't say it again\" David said. Well if you asking if your going to hurt I think you know the answer well I give you two punishments trapped under my paws until I wake back up witch I hate to say it could be hours, or if you don't chose my paws there is alwas you smile my mouth witch is nice and warm and yes I am going to sloshed you around. \"If I tell you then what?\" David asked, well then you can go back into the cave and rest until I wake up or brave the cold with me </span></div></div>",

You just can't order me what I should think. And I think giant, overwhelming fairy dragon, being oversized victim of his own wish is just ridiculous\". David shout to be heard by Angel. \"And you shouldn't talk to me like that! It was unpleasent\"<br>\r\n\"Convince me\" Angel reply and stood on all four. For David he was like a small mountain comparing to himself. \"You are my master and I'm gonna call you that you like that or not.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes? Even when I'm order you to stop that?\" before David could realise what's going on, Angel just walk over him. Dragon take few steps and just then he used his hint leg to overturn David and crush him with that paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now think about it. I'm gonna sleep\" Angel reply and stretched out. He put his massive head over his front legs and closed eyes. He fall into sleep almost immidiately.  <br>\r\nDavid lie crushed. He could feel how hard rocks dent into his back. Before him he could feel hard, rough surface. That surface cover his face, arms and legs with such pressure he could barely move. For him it was hardly belive it was Angel's paw. Paw such big it cover him whole and pinch him to the ground so hard, only by it's weight. It was unblivable that almost week ago he could grab Angel in his hands and his paws looks so tiny and delicate. Now at this scale Angels skin become so thick and hard it was hard do to anything. In the David blindly try to move one of his arm, then other one trying to find way out, trying to ignore that every move could create chafe on his skin. Finally fingers grab edge of that surface over him. It should where one of Angel's pad end. David pull as hard as he can and move closer. After few minutes his hand finally get free from overwhalming pressure as David feel that dragon paw finally ended. For him it was like hours, now he need just little more pushs and he will be free. <br>\r\nIt was easyer to said. While David pull himself out, he feel how whole surface over him trembles. \"NO!\" he thought, trying to get out as fast as he could. Skin over him screach and extends as pressure over human also increase. <br>\r\nFinaly he was free. David get out from under dragon's hind paw as he see that Angels growth slows down. Many trees nerby screach and fall down as dragon's giant, growing body press on it. \"phew.. that was close\" Dawid think and look around. With shock he realise that he stand next to wall of silver with scales like cracks on it. That wall breathing, living and it was only part od his dragon. Last growth wasn't big but even that Angel from tip of his tail to his muzzle could compare to scyscrapers. He was such long. Even toes on his paw was almost as high as David alone. David pat one of Angel's claw and think. He love Angel but now he just become more and more dengerous. He never think he could be crushed by him or that dragon try to intimidate him or punish him. Some pranks of course but that was too much. David need to talk with him as master and pet - even if such pet could destroy whole citys. Way to his head was simple, just next to his belly, over the arm and than jump on his muzzle. But if he grow during that trip, he could accidently crush his master and even didn't realise that. David look the other way, he could climb on his paw, than go to the knee, climb on his back and just walk on his back between wings, over neck just to the head. It was longer but... bit more amazing and safe in case of another growth. </span></div></div>",

Sure, the little hamlet was safe from bandits and the like, being built on a hill and sporting some respectable walls; it even had a river close by, which opened up some fishing and the occasional traders coming through on their boats. The harvests were usually good too, so even the lowliest peasants had a <i>little</i> something to eat. Heck, the tax-collectors were even friendly! The village was only a few days' ride from the nearest city, so the King's men weren't sporting saddle-sores and grumbling about being away from their homes when they rode into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem? Most villages answered to an earl, or a lord, or maybe an Archbishop or monk if there was a temple or monastery nearby. Your particular village answered to a <i>dragon</i>. A HUGE dragon, covered in white and gold scales and sporting green eyes and wings, who could easily crush a castle in one clawed foreleg. She always said she would never do such a thing, though, claiming she liked humans too much to even <i>think</i> of hurting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't make her any less intimidating to you. Friendly or not, mountain-sized dragonesses were still scary to a little human such as yourself. Especially if they were towering over you like a scaly, living mountain; giving a friendly smile....that showed off a <i>VERY</i> impressive set of fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, little one.\" She greets you, faint smoke coming from her nostrils. \"What brings you to you Lady's domain? Something the villagers need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your nervousness, you can;t but smile back. Gigantic dragon or not, you couldn't deny that she treated her vassals well. \"Y-yes, milady,\" you answer. \"It...concerns the 'size-shifting' you've been undergoing recently. A freind of mine happened to come across you while he was hunting in the forest. You were trying to beat your last record of, erm, big-ness, and---well, you didn't see him and, well, you sat on him. He was unharmed, don't worry!\" You add, noting her nervous expression, \"but he was....somewhat flustered by the whole event, milady. His ranting in the tavern could be heard three streets over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness chuckles at that, and gives her answer....</span></div></div>",

Most of the foliage barely cleared her haunches, and you saw that even the taller trees were harshly bent or tilted in sharp angles--likely brushed aside as the maternal titaness trudged through the jungle. She filled most of your vision just standing there, and just one of her feet was bigger than your whole body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be 500 feet tall, at the <i>least.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother chuckles at your little display, a sound that shakes the air. Not that you were intimidated; she may have been utterly gigantic even by T-Rex standards, but she was still your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the world, little one!\" She coos, reaching her massive head--easily dwarfing your form--down to nuzzle you. \"You were putting up quite a fight inside that egg--I worried for a bit that you might hit your head coming out, or even knock it out of the nest!\" Humming a dainty tune, that still shook ferns, rocks, and trees throughout the jungle from its volume, she sits down...and makes the ground shake; enough to toss you into the air and come back down on the nest with a little thud! Groggily, you sit back up, eyes spinning in dizziness from all the falling-down you've done fresh out of the egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother had the grace to look embarrassed AND sympathetic. \"Oh my--I do enjoy being this size, but sometimes it can be such trouble...\" she mumbles, her tail swinging a lazy arc behind her. Several trees are cut down from the impact, and tumble down towards Terra Firma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the last of your dizziness, you walk over to your mother--lying her head on the ground with a warm grin--and return the nuzzle. \"You didn't need to worry, Mama; I'm okay. Ooh; when I grow up, am I gonna as biiiiig as you? Are all grown-up Rexes as big as you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles again, shaking the air. \"Well, I can't say if you'll be as big as me when you grow up, though I would like it. As for the other one...no, sweetie; most Rexes don't get anywhere near my size, even after they're all grown up!\" She winked, and gave a fanged smirk. \"Mama is one of the lucky ones--grew up near a nice little spring with fresh water, my parents--they were even bigger than me!--loved me very, very much. Who knows? Maybe you will get as big as me some day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both trade nuzzles again; you especially like the idea of being her size--nobody with half a brain would mess with you! She even tells you a story about picking out this jungle nesting ground: when an annoying pack of raptors--bug-sized by your Mother's perspective--had refused to clear out, even though she'd asked nicely many, many times, she'd scared them all off...by casually sitting on the gang's leader as if he were an egg! She even quipped, \"Keep my precious little one company, would you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, shed gotten off the pinned, embarrassed raptor, who promptly fled along with his gang. And this little neck of the jungle had been her home ever since. You break into belly-laughs at her story, clapping your little clawed forepaws. \"Hahaha, that's great Mama! You showed them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply smirks in response. \"Well, I had to do <i>something</i> to, heh, convince them to leave. They weren't doing anything here except bumming around all day and being lazy, and I thought it was the ideal nest-spot.\" She starts to add something to that, but stops mid-sentence. Gesturing for you to duck and be quiet, she lifts her head off the ground and sniffs at the air while looking around. After a brief, tense moment, she finds the scent she's looking for. She stares off into the distance, squinting into the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou risk a whisper, \"Mama? What's wrong? What do you smell...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts a bit, looking back at you with an awkward smile--a towering fanged titan, and her own hatch-ling catches her off-guard! \"Oh, nothing's wrong. Just smelled some...unexpected guests on their way. As for who they are...\"</span></div></div>",

The seismosaurus retreats from the edge of the hill to make sure she doesn't fall over the edge, and the tingling continues to endlessly build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling is so intense it shakes the ground, and, slowly, surely, your entire body begins to rumble and groan as you begin to stretch out, growing once more. The warm feeling returns, much stronger now, and your baby T-Rex eyes roll back in their sockets as your growth begins to escalate, pumping you higher into the sky, scales stretching and groaning, skin tightening and pulling wider and wider with every passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seismosaurus, contrary to her earlier reaction, now seems happy with your growthquake, as you hiccup and double in size, then double in size again, mowing hundreds of trees down under your gargantuan feet. She nuzzles you with her minuscule head, and you feel your scales blowing up larger and larger around her, as your growth continues to speed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your growth stops. You growl in confusion, as the tingling feeling grows ever stronger, racing through your mile-tall body with renewed strength and warmth, spreading to every part of you, clouding your thoughts with warm pleasure. You spread your legs into a lower stance, and huddle I wards and downwards, as the other dinosaurs, like gnats before you, start to crowd around you, curious and frightened and the same time, as the tingling simply grows and grows, consuming all of your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is nothing but the tingling and the warmth, but still they build preparing to catapult you to unimaginable sizes, then far beyond those. Down below at your multi-hundred foot tall feet, a single, timid triceratops lightly taps your claw with her horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of the tingling, all the warmth, all of the growth energy is freed, rushing through your body, filling and nourishing it, for it it to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth happens so fast it is barely perceptible to the dinosaurs down below, who are instantly smothered as you double in size again, and again, and again, then burst up to twenty miles in size, then fifty, a hundred, three hundred, your evergrowing bulk ripping millions of trees out of the ground, but harming no living creatures, simply pushing them back as they struggle to register what is happening, any one of your scales dwarfing the largest do dinosaurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel powerful, so powerful. You inflate warmly to five hundred miles tall, poking far beyond the Earth's atmosphere, before simply rippling outwards again and again and again, the earth itself now no larger than one of your eyes. You nuzzle it, growth energy flooding out of your reptilian snout and causing thousands of other dinosaurs to start growing as you are, the tiny dinos struggling to fit onto any of the continents, before they simply outgrow the earth entirely, floating in your gravitational field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the sun in the distance, as it begins to pull you in towards it, and you are helpless to resist its force. But as you collide with the now merely warm surface, you are infused with even more growth energy, your growth compounding over and over, as you instantly outgrow the solar system, thousands of dinos, larger than planets themselves, growing alongside you. You let out a happy roar that defies physics, before flowing out again, alpha centauri smacking into your belly, before you simply begin to grow, and grow, and grow, and grow, and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire galaxy shakes, before you simply outgrow it, incalculable amounts of growth energy flooding into you, as well as the other dinosaurs, before you flood into darkspace, nothing able to stop your growth spurt, your body groaning and squeaking louder and louder with every second. A single raptor, fifty light years tall, latches onto you, flooding bigger with you, feeding off your growth energy, nuzzling you over and over, as you both blow up and inflate ever larger, whole galaxies now meaning nothing to either of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a galaxy rapidly shrink into nothing, too small to even see, as your growth energy floods into millions of animals from just as many planets, forcing all of the to grow, rapidly taking up more and more space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUNK</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that?

You fill the entire universe, quadrillions of parsecs flooding into you every second, straining your form against the walls that were penning you in. You liked that feeling, though. Smooshing against everything in existance, millions of parsecs flooding into both your form, and that of every other animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the tingling again, permeating throughout everything in existence, and the walls of the very universe itself begin to strain and buckle underneath your truly indescribably huge bulk, before simply shattering, allowing you to flood into another universe, then another, and another. Your thoughts return to the raptor, when suddenly, you feel almost all of your growth energy being sapped from you, before it all returns in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you hear a groaning from your back, then from all around you, then from everywhere, as a gigantic shadow darkens thousands of universes. You look at the giga-yotta-zetta-Raptor, as large compared to her as a planet compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licks you, overflowing you with her growth energy, and you burst up to her size, the two of you hug, compounding eachothers growth millions of times every femtosecond, multiverses meaning nothing to either of you as entire exoverses now bow beneath your mind breaking size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know about you, but I think this would be a perfect place for an epilogue, as I am running out of units of measurement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, epilogue, or continue growing into more exoverses, and beyond?</span></div></div>",

It isn't a bad sensation, this lessening of pressure, but honestly it felt much nicer to increase rather than decrease.

They had gotten you just small enough to where they were no longer pressed so hard against the crackling walls by your bulk, but now your 200 foot-tall body was starting to shake violently, and you hiccuped again, and again, unable to stop. The pressure build back up, and then some, as you felt the hot ray blast off inside of you again and again and again, making you 'ruuuuuurrrurrrl' happily as the pleasure returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne little human yelled to the others, something about unforseen allergic reactions to the antidote, and they all took off as fast as they could, for some reason. Shouldn't they be happy? As you noodle it over, your eyes suddenly roll back in your dino skull, and you huff and pant and blooooooooow up to over 320 feet, in one rude, thick push, crashing up through the ceiling, sending glass and drywall and beams all over the air, before you tense up and balloon even larger, shooting up to 460 feet, your growing scaly belly pushing wider as it grinds all the topside and sides of the compound apart! The other dinos all crawl out of the openings cracking in the walls, escaping with panicked expressions as they turn back and hear you growling cutely, seeing you tower to over 600 feet, then 700; feeling better than ever before, you can't help but raise your head up high and blast a happy beam of growth energy into the clouds, before surging powerfully, unstoppably up to 900 feet!! You can feel your toes digging into the soil in glee as you rise taller and wider, more and more tonnage sinking your heaving body into the ground below. Finally you come to a stop, panting and licking your chops in approval, surveying everything below in satisfaction. What a great day it's been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat strange feeling resumes, the pressure dropping again, as you begin to shrink just as suddenly as you grew, losing 50 feet one second, then another 60 after; at around 800 feet in size, you start stomping around the edge of the city ,snuffling curiously on buildings, seeing yourself in their glassy reflections--well, the taller buildings, that is! You shrink and shrink, down to 600 feet, tapping a massive skyscraper with your muzzle, buffeting it with blasts of air; you can see all these tiny humans inside, and you realize they're as trapped as you were! You want to help them like they helped you before, but you're only 550 feet tall now!

She's getting so big that her body floods the interior of the courtyard, her backside rising up into, pressing against, then cracking more and more of the solarium dome at the ceiling's apex! There's no more room for her, or you, as some of the beam blows back into you, making your thick dino-toes curl in as you ripple up into her growing bulk with your own, twin giants filling too little space! Nice as the feeling is, admittedly, you're still shocked enough by this development to instinctively pull back some, cutting the feed off, and leaving her sighing in joy, shivering bigger still against the crumbling interior of the lab's center.

You rush back to the ruins of the facility and pray that the controls for the cloning machines are still active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some heavy sprinting, you reach the control panel for the cloning vats, but have no idea how to operate it. There is a display on the right side of the screen displaying the type of dinosaur and how large the next dinosaur will be, which are set to velociraptor and 2X respectively. You begin tapping random buttons, hoping to turn the cloning machines off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it work?</span></div></div>",

You were out grazing in a rather deserted grassland, your head low to the ground as you searched for small edible shrubs and berries that littered the ground. You had decided to spend some time grazing away from the rest of your small herd; they were in the next grassland over searching for similar food, but were not having much luck. The amount of food you continued to find was adequate, but you always seemed to be hungry no matter how much vegetation you ate: After all, you were a huge stegosaurus, standing at 13 feet tall, 30 feet long, and weighing in at over 2 tons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to graze for some time, determined to eat as much food before sunset and heading back to your herd. You look up and see the sun low on the horizon, meaning that sunset would come in another hour or two. Just as you were about to turn around and head towards the direction of your herd, you see a flash of color blazing across the sky. A giant, almost spherical object is charging its way towards the sun, or so it appears to be; you figure it must be caught in Earth's orbit but not entering the atmosphere for whatever reason. Instead, the meteorite gently passes by the planet, casting blanketing shadows on the continents as it makes its way past Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at the large object in the sky, your land covered in shadow due to the semi solar eclipse, and all of the sudden a light shines down from the sky. It is instantly really bright all around you. Squinting, you realize that the light is not coming from something external, it is actually you that is glowing! The brilliant white light emanates from your body, and all you can do is really stand there and take in this unprecedented string of events. Immediately, you feel something like a jolt of adrenaline shoot through your body, and you realize that your surroundings are rapidly getting smaller and smaller---what is happening? You stand there in confusion for a moment, watching as the land around you shrinks further and further, the dark sky growing around you fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as it appeared the light is gone, leaving you dazed. The grasslands around you have disappeared. Your feet are standing in what appears to be an expansive plain with a very thin layer of brown earth dotted with green. In the distance you can see a fuller, thick strip of green enclosing what looks like a small, steep hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb goes off, and you realize that these browns and greens are vegetation and trees, and the small hill must be a mountain! Which means...you must have grown...HUGE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how big are you? </span></div></div>",

Ariadne. Snake. Talked. To me. Asked question.<br>\r\nSuddenly feeling very stiff, you make a slow turn on your heels and stagger back into your room. Ariadne is lounging atop some rocks in her cage, basking in the morning sunshine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...you...speak to me, earlier?\" You croak out, not knowing if your brain is working right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriadne tilts her head. \"Of course, Boss. It was, what, ten seconds ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roughly sit on the floor, getting at eye-level with your pet snake. \"But..you--snake. Not talk...impossible,\" you blurt.<br>\r\nAfter a pause, you groan, \"Oh blast it, what happened last night?\" as you facepalm and massage your temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriadne sighs. \"Bosss, don't be ssso cliche'. You jussst went to a movie with your friendsss in town, remember? And you had dinner too, right? At that Mexican place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lebanese,\" you correct...then snort angrily, uncovering your face. \"Wait a minute! Why am I correcting a hallucination?!?

Or maybe the waiter at the restaurant spiked my drink when I tried to speak to him in Arabic but got the wrong side dish! Or--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOSSS!!\" Ariadne shouts, cutting you off. \"Look; if you're wondering if you're thinking ssstraight, then obviously you aren't hallucinating! Because that happensss when your brain is all screwy, right? Well, if you're lucid enough to realize something is weird, and you know you aren't having a lucid dream, then the best explanation is that whatever is happening...really is happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink...and blink again. Somehow, her logic seemed sound. Not to mention, if your food or drinks had been tampered with, you'd have been affected before now.<br>\r\nThat didn't change the fact that your pet snake had suddenly started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, you decide to roll with this.<br>\r\n\"Makes sense...I guess,\" you admit, slumping your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't feel bad, Boss. C'mon, just relax for a bit.\" Ariadne slithers up the wall of her glass cage, sticking to the side. Taking the hint, you gently pick her up and give the red serpent a quick nuzzle, which elicits laughs from both of you. \"There. Feel better?\" she coos, flicking out her forked tongue across your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...so, how about that breakfast?\" you answer, good mood returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's Ariadne's turn to look nervous. \"Um, about that... Boss, I'm afraid things are gonna get, well, weirder pretty soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"Weirder? How? You just started talking out of the blue, and just like any human besides hissing the 'S'. Seriously, you don't even have lips--no offense--and you can speak perfectly well, more or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriadne rubs the back of her neck with her tail, almost like a human would do with their hand. It's actually pretty adorable. \"Yeah...well, In a few..seconds, I'm gonna start...getting bigger. A lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in her tone makes you drop all humor--this could be serious. \"What do you mean by, 'a lot bigger'?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriadne shudders again, like when you petted her. Already, she's starting to magnify.<br>\r\nChuckling awkwardly, she answers....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ssssee, ever ssssince...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you barely hear her, as you've already left to go downstairs. The situation is so amazing that you're more floating around the home than anything else, lost in a dreamy cloud of 'huh'-ness. Come to think of it, if this were a dream, you likely would have awoken upon considering it a dream in the first place. So okay, it's...really happening. A flood of images fill your thoughts, all of them super-cute; a primary one is you sleeping in her giant coils like a scaly, lovey hammock. Oh, you HAVE to ask her about that, if she gets a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, you think. Hopefully she won't get house-damagingly big. The downsides start pouring in, but Ariadne's sweet female voice cuts them off:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bossss! You got me the whole plaaaaaate! Gimme, gimme...\" she chants, bobbing left and right happily. You smile wide,, as this was really about how you imagined she'd be, were she able to have expressed herself in such a fashion, in the past. You set the entire thing down on the bed, and she sticks her greedy muzle into the pile, hungrily gulping her food down as you slink onto her coils, stroking on her neck; if she could purr, she'd be motoring right now, and loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so...how is this something, to even begin with?\" you ask, petting her scales softly. \"I've had you long enough, why is this happening now?\" With a few heavy gulps, she siiiighs and flicks her tongue, nosing the plate politely to the side, and curling herself up untightly around you, burying her giant head against yours in affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Well, bosssss, I ssssssaw you watching one of those thingssss on the thing last weekend,\" she began tail-pointing at the TV. \"You were watching sssssomething with a really big, happy sssssnake on it, ssssso big it crussssshed buildings and ssssstuff.

Ssssso...I wished I could be big like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wished to be able to talk, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to explain mysssssssself, didn't I?\" Her muzzle bumps your cheek as she rubs into you like a big cat.

She soon stopped again, literally stuffing your room to the brink, with over 20 feet of coiled beauty. She rested her head a little uncomfortably on her own bulk, it alone the size of your upper chest and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssssssee? Your affection made me wish I wasssss bigger, sssssso it makessss me get even bigger when you love me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...Ariadne...you're huge!\" you sputter, making her flick her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, bosssss! Lemme unwind for you...\" she grunted, looking over at the door to the room, which was still opened enough for her to flex around with, making her lower quarters push it fully open; she hisses with a giggle, obviously over-pleased with the whole situation, forcing her tail down the upstairs hallway, then partly down the stairs, weaving around and threading herself through the upper half of the house, to where only her head rests inside the room. \"Ta-daaaaah! Tssssss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done! It's just...you know...you're filling half the house. How do I get out? What are you going to do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic snake thought on it a minute. \"I guesssss I sssssee the downside, bossss...here, I'll fix it!\" With that, she nuzzles hard into you, and you reflexively hug her snout tight, giving off a smile as she buries her nose into your belly happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a telltale tingle racing through her body, you realize your error; her nose bulges bigger still against you, then bigger than that, groans and cracks heard around the house as her tingling grows into a hard shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, rats...\" you start, as she swells rapidly... </span></div></div>",

Pressing itself against the glass of the enclosure, it flicks its to the in and out as it grows against the glass, a squeaking noise filling the air as it runs against the thin sheet more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake continues to steadily pulse larger and larger, taking up almost three quarters of its enclosure by now, and still sticking to the glass and flicking its tongue out every few seconds. You slowly back away, unable, or perhaps unwilling, to take your eyes of the anaconda as it swells and pulses bigger and longer and thicker, completely filling the floor of its enclosure and still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been almost sixty feet long now, as it rears its head back, and fixes you with another warm, intelligent stare, having the continually move its head down as it grows more and more, long having dwarfed your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake regards the glass sheet in front of it.

It flicks its tongue in your face causing a tickle and you laugh before the snake starts to pulse again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts body thickens and widens more and more as the anaconda pulses bigger and bigger, longer and longer.

The gigantic snake's coils are now quite a bit taller than you, and they are closing in on you as they pulse and expand bigger. This makes for a tighter and more enjoyable hug, but you quickly feel that the snake's embrace is becoming too embracing pretty quickly.

The anaconda's immense form swells faster than ever before, and soon its scaly body completely fills up the hallway as is threatening to crash through the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing impending danger, the anaconda pushes you atop one of its huge coils where you able to grab hold wile on your stomach to avoid the 12 foot tall ceiling right above you.

Though her features remain largely unchanged, her eyes sparkled with a loving brilliance, as though she had found the one she would adore forever, and some new, well-deserved existence was now yours to both share in. You blush darkly as her coils tighten, snuggling your tiny body carefully, her head now considerably larger than your entire body! She dips her snout in and nuzzles away over you, tickling more and more with her tongue as she closes her eyes, trembles, shakes, tenses tightly inward...then erupts even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one huge, wonderful burst, the snake bulges clear through the west wing of the entire exhibit itself, pushing everything out, as the walls begin to creak and warp outside.

Y-you don't want her to stop, anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still you feed her growth, as she trembles and pulses up larger still, all sights of the interior lost to her sheer bulk, her coils completely obscuring everything around you, until there's nothing but her, growing bigger and bigger and bigger...</span></div></div>",

Through the ensuing cloud of grit emerges Anna's colossal head, as she hisses and shivers adorably. She cranes a head as big as a house back and down towards you, her great tongue flickering happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaah! Sssso niiiccce!\" she moons, wiggling her hefty, bulging midsection, like a gargantuan, scaly ferret, overjoyed in her massive, incredible size-over 650 feet long, nearly 40 feet thick in the middle. \"Again, Wesss, pleasssse! That wasss lovely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, wait, hold up,\" you stammer, holding on tight to a body-length scale, as she looms so high overhead, \"you're already pretty gigantic, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, Wessss, don't,\" she giggles, as sirens begin to fill the air in the distance. \"I can smell it all over you, you're every bit as excccited as I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth has just about steadied, having slowed to a cute crawl, her scales tickling their way against you as they grow and grow. At about 700 feet in length, Anna peers around herself, cocking her head and flicking her tongue as she regards the tiny world below. The animals on the ground, even the largest, fall comically short of the height of her coils, not even coming up the top of the lowest rung. All the while, you fight back at her observation, not so much bothering to justify it or reason the strange feeling out but, more practically, attempting to stifle the sheer joy in being on her at such a magnificent size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stupor is broken, or close enough to it, as the sirens come close, and tiny policemen scatter from their vehicles, all pointing their weaponry high towards the massive snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they look like the nice man who walks by my cage past clossssing time!\" Anna says, making every jaw on every cop drop at the utterance. \"They can admire my ssssssssize!

You know what's coming. Anna cries out as her quaking coils blow up bigger, and bigger, the scales singing some strange symphony of stretching groans and pulling rubbery sounds. The side of her bottom coil pulses fatter and wider, growing bigger and heavier as it rolls down the main walkway and steps, bulldozing the cop cars with no discernable effort as the tiny men scatter every-which-way. 700 feet of anaconda swells to 800 feet...900 feet...1,000 feet! She coos and rumbles and burbles joyfully, feeling herself spread out over more and more, the opposing end of her coils snapping through the nearby park, her bulk spilling cutely into the city streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people all run, which would have baffled the giddy female, were she not busy crowing and panting, gulping in air as she inflated bigger still. Her scales began to bulge into the facades of the neighboring buildings across the way, crackling glass and bending beams, crushing the pavement of the city streets into an increasingly fine powder as her bulk sank in deeper and deeper. Busses flipped, trolleys were put into reverse, and refunds were frantically issued as patrons fled, the 1,400-foot long serpent bulging even thicker, so much so that her midsection got snagged between two much-larger skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled and nosed lovingly on the buildings, looking up at them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Wesss, lookit! I can't wait until these are tiny compared to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she laughed off the situation, she gave a last shuddery burst, flaring up twice as big, her sides dimpling against the buildings, which groaned and budged just slight, but otherwise held her fast. Her tail was so far away that it still rested over her former home, which she stopped looking back at, once the rumbling of tanks could be heard, as well as the thrumming thumpthump of helicopter blades slicing the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeee, more toyssssss!\" Anna cried, wiggling jubilantly in place. Her growth had stopped, leaving her still pinned in between the two huge buildings. She was over half a mile long, and over 450 feet high, without lifting her head (which, when she did, put her at over 1,000 feet tall).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire!\" one teeny man in his teeny toy tank roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna beamed a bit, childish grin, and closed her eyes, puffing up.

Anna, being Anna, simply squeals out her delight and puffs herself up, as impact clouds and small explosive bursts began scattering all over her trembling hide. Her eyes lid to slits as her tongue flick-flickers excitedly, the quaking tingles racing up and down her length getting worse and worse and worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Yesssssssss!! Keep it coming, you ssssweet little men! M-make me grow!!\" she huffs, hungrily writhing with want. Her sides begin inflating by gentle degrees, as if warming up for the show, as they roll bigger, tighter and heavier against the two buildings pinning her in place. Obviously, you know this won't be the situation much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom far down either end of the downtown street, thousands of little people surge away as one, emptying the vicinity as fast as possible, as her quaking rumbles begin pulsing through the pavement, making lamp posts and mailboxes and trees all wobble and shift about precariously in place. Sewer rattle, car alarms cry in...uh, alarm, and even the well-removed crowds are suddenly bowled over, as Anna's breathing sinks into a husky rumbling pant, and she finally explodes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swelling anaconda's body balloons out wider and wider, pushing meanly through and shoving both skyscrapers off their foundations, as showering walls of glass tumble around her hide, which just trembles and surges even tighter, the bigger Anna bulges. She cries and whips her head around, nuzzling the air in joy, as she doubles in size, then shakes, moans, and doubles that size, bowling over one city block, then the next, her rolling undersides inflating madly as they snap and pop the rows of tiny buildings flat, like a steamroller over packing bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...haaaaaaaaah!!\" she huffs, harder and harder, taking bigger gulps of air in as she pants and shivers and erupts larger, and larger, so much so that a loud, low pulling noise fills the city, the acoustic oddity bouncing off of everything she hasn't yet flattened, accenting the snake's shuddery growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 miles rumbles, tenses, and blows up to 6, then 15, Anna's thickening tail pushing and curling cutely as it looms across town, filling and sweeping ugly trenches through the mid and uptown districts. She's half as long as the entire city! Her sides fatten in the center, gaining more and more curvy weight, making Anna coo and giggle, as she continued trembling worse and worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOORE!\" she cries, booming even bigger, and bigger, leaving a 20 mile-tall monster snake smothering the city with her rippling body. She blinks at a teeny plane as it passes along, then tries desperately to change course. \"Hello!\" she chirps, before shivering again, her head rising higher and higher towards the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou've been holding on for dear life the entire time, until the gentle slope of her growing body guides you towards the upside of a coil, and you find she's just so big that you can easily stand on the vast plain of it. You breath a little easier, before looking up, and seeing several bombers screeching through the skies--god, they're heading for Anna! Th...they're going to really nuke her!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna! Anna, honey, move! We have to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Wessss!\" she booms, splitting the skies with her giggly voice, \"You're sssstill on me! Good, good!

Thankssss, Wessss, I'm glad you told me sssso!\" She just straightens her neck up, before squinting, giving a little look of validation, and then easily snapping her jaws over the cluster of teeny-tiny bombers, swallowing them whole. She blinks, then feels around, and spits out a tinier cluster of parachute-bearing little men, who now have a fun story for their kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanksssss for the gift!\" Anna laughs, and sincerely--she really thinks the humans want her to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Anna, don't tell me you swallowed them!

You just folded your arms and sighed, hoping this would all work out okay in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wessss, look! Look!\" Anna boomed, her sweet feminine giggles echoing and reverberating across the countryside, both ways. \"I'm growing ssssso biiiiiiig!! Everything'sssss ssssso tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cooed and swished her thickened tail tip cutely, looking all around the shrinking splay of cities and roads and rivers and mountains, as they all grew comparatively tinier and harder to distinguish proper. She cocked her huge head and flicked her tongue, before booming up to 130 miles, shaking terribly; she moaned and gasped, then squealed adorably, as she rocketed up and up, pushing all the way to 200 miles in length! Her sides heaved in and out as she chuckled, peering around the curve of the world itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssssso pretty! I love it! Wessss, look! The moon! I bet I could nom it up now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou more feel the vibrations of her colosso-speak, rather than simply hear it. Youstupidly catch yourself starting to answer, then smack your forehead and shrug, certain there's no way she can hear you reply anymore. You don't feel that tingling anymore, so it seems like Anna's growth has stopped--but gads, she was as long as a state now, and totally feeling her proverbial oats. Who knew what on Earth--literally, on Earth--she would do now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be content, please stop trying to get bigger,\" you chant uselessly to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" Anna chirps, as she attempts to shift her untold billions of gigatons, in the process of doing so shaking the continent. \"Wessss, lookit--More of thosssse little ssstingy-tickly toys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach drops further still. More warheads, surely, being sent from who-knows-where. Surely the Americans had figured out that it just makes Anna grow bigger, but the rest of the world, locked in panic-mode, was probably loosing its entire supply of high-end arms, from all angles, all at Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...it was a nice world while it lasted. And not because it was about to be blown up, either--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit was Anna who was going to blow up. Bigtime... </span></div></div>",

Such dedication pays off, as said payloads detonate, peppering her reptilian hide with rows upon dotted rows of explosions, each as tiny as a little party popper, compared to the anaconda. \"More, little humansssss, more!! Sssssuper-pretty pleasssse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female serpent is in a state well-beyond rapture, her body nearly aglow as it trembles more and more. You curl up into a fetal position, and just brace yourself, now less than a slight percentage the size of a speck against the giggly snake--and that's before you feel the rumbling grow and grow, shaking the entire hemisphere ominously; Anna hisses and cries out in glee as she tightens all over, groans, shudders, pants...and explodes fifteen times larger, in one shove of mass, your blown-up coils pumping and pushing, dragging unstoppably across the continent, as she fully covers the mass, smothering it under increasing teratons of giddy serpent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut oh, Anna is just getting started--she huffs loudly and moans, as her next spurt forces her up another twenty times larger, making her head surge closer to the moon, as the rim of destruction snugging her anaconda coils rises higher and wider, scattering out against her ballooning body; cities, towns, forests, mountains, canyons, lakes, streets--everything is shoved over and out, as Anna fills the skies, the atmosphere, and even more and more of space, as she outgrows the continent. Her slithery bulk spills cutely out in both oceans at once, her moon-sized head shivering as she closes her eyes and rumbles loudly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaah, I c-can't stop...grooooowwwwiiiiing!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough to form, Anna explodes from 6,000 miles to 60,000, her coils finally slipping awkwardly down the curvature of the planet, as she outgrows it, hugging herself against the too-small ball tightly; this only grinds her bulk against country after country, island upon island, though amazingly no one seems hurt by her--they all merely get pressed down on impossibly, weighed down by unimaginably big scales, which tremble and stretch bigger, as Anna hiccups, tingles, and grows again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping free into the void of space, Anna unfurls herself, wiggling all about in zero-gravity; her thick midsection bulges bigger and fatter as she giggles and playfully circles around and around, in a goofy loop-de-loop, with Earth shrinking away in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Wessssss, I've got the whole world in my coilsssss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs and forms her length into the shape of a phony set of jaws, the chuckling female snake acting like the jaws she shaped herself into were nomming the teeny planet. Then she made herself out in the shape of an angry eye, with the planet being the iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe! GRRRRR!\" she giggled, as her head alone soon grew equal to the size of the world. She nuzzled lovingly on it, flicking her tongue all about. \"Hi, humanssss, hello! Now I can see all of you in your habitat! Hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted, smiling wider, as she let out of little soft coo of pleasure, then rippled out even bigger, and bigger, and bigger, 90,000 miles growing and surging out to 110,000...240,000...390,000...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, sssso big! Ssssso big! D-don't ever ssssstop, body!\" she moons cutely, panting openly. With one last burst of rippling growth, Anna heaves out even larger, and finally comes to a slow, huffing and gulping in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n500,000 miles. Half a million miles. 2,640,000,000 freaking feet of serpentine godliness. You were long-past being stunned or shocked, given you were still taking air in, even after riding with her into space. Something was clearly out of whack, and that was foregoing the monstrous tera-snake, who still chattered and giggled to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wessss, you think I can find ssssome way to get any bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" you laugh, in hysterics. \"Maybe eat the Sun, or something? That'd be one heck of a combustion for you to feed on.\" You're joking, yet you know what's coming...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Original author: TheCrimsonFreak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna cocks her continent-sized head, cutely flicking her forked tongue out a few times. The chipper goddess-sized serpent glaces at the Earth nestled in her coils, then at the blazing yellow jewel it orbits. She looks at the star hungrily, but hesitates. \"But, doessssn't the planet kinda need th--\" She replies, only to break off mid-sentence, when a massive flash overtakes your vision. You and Anna both yelp in shock and cringe away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, you blink your vision clear and look back up, a reply to Anna's unfinished question on your lips...which dies rather quickly, when you get a good look at the star-scape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarships. Alien starships, specifically--they were even built in the classic \"Flying Saucer\" style, complete with a shiny plating on the hull that looked an awful lot like chrome. And there were thousands of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least these aliens had good taste, right? But why were there so many of them...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wessss? Who are these guys?\" Anna chirps, staring at the armada. At her size, the ships looked about the size of cookies compared to a normal-sized anaconda. \"Are they gonna help be get bigger? Their toysssss don't look like what thossssse other little men were ussssssing, though--maybe they're friendsssss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer at the swarm of alien ships--who'd halted rather quickly when they spotted Anna--you begin to pick out what look VERY much like weapons mounts mounted on the hulls. LOTS of weapons mounts...BIG ones, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable. First Anna grows big enough to hold the entire planet in her cute, scaly coils, and now aliens show up and try to invade!<br>\r\n...Well, more emphasis on \"try to\" than \"invade\", though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't think they're 'friends', Anna,\" you reply. \"I think these guys are here to invade Earth, not help you get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gasps in shock--the physics-defying inward gust actually pulling a few ships out of formation--and looks down at the little planet she's hugging with a motherly expression.\"I-Invade?! Why? There's plenty of planet to live on, they just need to ask! I don't see their names on it, so why are they trying to take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer that, the biggest ship in the alien fleet, suddenly opens up with its lasers, the white-hot beams searing into Anna's colossal hide just below her head. The rest of the ships follow suit, peppering her with weapons fire....which, naturally, starts off another round of growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeerrrre we go agaiiiin!!\" Anna whoops out, hissing with glee. This time, her growth is in a smooth, easy motion--no more rocketing and lurching in size when lasers come into play, it seems. 550,000 miles.....675,000 miles....725,000 miles!!!! Within seconds, she's so impossibly, epically, mind-crushingly ENORMOUS that Earth, now less than pea-sized, simply slips from her coils, somehow unharmed despite the sudden release of pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehe....silly alienssss! You can't sssstop me with your itty-bitty gunsssss!\" Anna giggle-booms, form quaking with laughter. Indeed, they couldn't. Like the nukes and bombs from before, the barrage of lasers and plasma sent by the now-quite-terrified aliens didn't even leave burn marks on Anna's form. Now in full retreat, the UFOs reversed course and flew away from the unconquerable snake-goddess. A few unlucky stragglers had been smashed to scrap when Anna's ballooning form slammed into their ships from behind. A few more were smacked by her tail, sending the would-be invaders careening helplessly of into the void. The luckier ones retreated, flying away at breakneck speed--though there wasn't another flash. They simply sped away until they were out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscape pods were scattered like confetti everywhere; a few had settled into a loose orbit around the Moon and formed rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done Anna had reached 2,600,567 miles in size. The tip of her tail brushed against Mars, carving a new canyon in the rust-colored surface; her head tapped against Mercury, flattening a sulfurous mountain instantly. She could have easily swallowed a planet, with room in her maw to spare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it, Wessss! I sssssaved the Earth!! Ooh, I'm a hero now!!\" Anna coos, giggling up a storm. She surveys the scattered wreckage of the hundreds of ships that were too slow to escape, and their friends who did, now in full retreat. \"Sssso, what do we do about them now? A few got away, but thesssse guys don't deserve to just float out here forever....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you--you were less than microscopic in comparison now; a single scale could have fit a dozen cities with room to spare. Still, she DID have a good point: what to do about the aliens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's thought, you answer....</span></div></div>",

'Seriously, don't! It's a miracle enough we didn't--er, YOU didn't annihilate poor Earth, getting so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Anna stammers, trying to purse her snake lip, \"what should I use to grow off of, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOTHING!

Enough to not desssstroy ssssstuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't even know if or how that would work.

You think. Though you fight it, you can already see her sucking in heavily, until huge, lengthy contrails of flame begin to funnel out through space, and into Anna's mouth. She gulps a full length down, before she hiccups and flickers her vast tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaaaah,\" she sighs, closing her eyes. \"Ssssso good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you quit!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great, cosmos shaking rumble, Anna begins to swell out again, bigger and bigger, her great coils getting lengthier and lengthier, fatter and fatter around the middle; her scales spread out more and more, deepening the cleft-style valley that you find yourself stuck in, forming greater canyons between where each end meets the other. 600,000 miles booms, bulges and bursts to 800,000, then a staggering 1,000,000 miles--with one gulp, Anna has doubled her size! And she's beginning to suck in more and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't stop, I'm leaving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstonishingly...that does it. She gulps, then worriedly turns to where she thinks you are on her body, her tongue lashing frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, don't! Pleasssssse, don't go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll stop, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnf...okay...\" she sighs, dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Okay, let's get somewhere a little less dangerous, okay? We'll figure out what to do then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oka...ahhhhh...HAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH...\" Anna begins to reply, before her words tumble off into an unhinged pant of pleasure. You know what's coming, so you hunker down, as the vast snake's body trembles worse and worse, to the point where you can feel everything shaking more than ever before--and that itself just gets worse and worse, as the shaking builds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly cats, how big will she get!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pondering is cut short by a physics-defying bellow. You and Anna turn to see something every bit as insane as Anna was, in turns of surreal spectacle. There was an alien, akin to some titanic Rhinoceros Beetle with bat wings and a lizard's tail, doing some hefty looming of its own. Gadzooks, it had to be twice as big as Anna was long!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" it roars, its voice deep and feminine. A female!? \"I, Loquost, devourer and snacker-upon-er of worlds, have been to many dimensions and spaces...but never have I seen a creature so large! Prepare to battle, strange worm-thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Anna hissed, put-off, even as her tingling gets worse and worse and worse. \"Mannersssss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already throwing your arms up.

Anna wanting to eat the SUN was bad enough, but she had been innocently nibbling, only wanting to get bigger! (and bigger...and bigger...and bigger, etc.) But now...some evil Bug of Death comes out of nowhere, wanting to devour the entire Solar System, including EARTH! And now she was going to skewer Anna like a kabob! The only creaute that could EVER have a hope of standing against her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny incredulity or resignation-to-craziness you felt was burned away by sheer, unadulterated survival instinct. You jump up and down in the scale-valley, yelling out to Anna, \"DODGE! Get out of the way! Anna, you're gonna have to fight, or this bug will impale you, and EAT EVERYTHING!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Anna's tingling reached a fever pitch. An incredible inertia envelopes you, knocking you on your rump as Anna's growth skyrockets once again!<br>\r\n...At least you THINK it's her growing. The sheer magnitude of the sudden motion robs you of any sense of direction or reference, and for a horrible moment you think that Loquost's attack was successful. You imagine her mandibles opening wide around Earth, the giga-bug laughing evilly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you hear Anna's voice. She was giggling, and sounded triumphant. \"HA! Who's the biggest NOW, Miss Big Bad Bug Thingy?!\" After a pause, Loquot's reply--sounding farther away, and VERY scared:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh---whaaaaaa?! How is this possible?! Even I, the devourer of worlds and eater of stars, never achieved such size from simply a paltry nibble!!\" She sounds somewhere between unbelieving and flat-out terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to scale the scale-mountain, and arrive on the summit...and once again, you throw up you arms in utter disbelief. Anna was beyond mind-bogglingly huge. She had passed incomprehensibly gigantic. She had shattered impossibly big long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Anna the Anaconda was just plain STUPIDLY BIG. Ten. Million. Miles, to be exact. The entire solar system--the Sun, all eight planets (and Pluto), plus the Asteroid Belt, and a good portion of the Oort Cloud, fit easily within her coils, with room to spare. The Sun was less than a marble at her scale. Maybe a .22 BB round, at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna giggles and leans in, her muzzle easily dwarfing the would-be world-eater. \"So. Who's the strange worm-thing now, Missy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoquost can only blankly stare at the snake-goddess before her, eyes wide and mandibles slack. But hoe does the new arrival react once her senses return to her?</span></div></div>",

You've only made a few steps when you see an small orange blur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts shivers then Malmekko suddenly swells to the size of the small dragon. You mind rushes as you try to think of a way to defend yourself without hurting Bryim's beloved pet and one true friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: to see how you got here listen here <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-stories/e/64021569\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.breaker.audio/sryth-bedtime-...</a>) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the bag of white worms you were given. You try to unknot and bag to get a the a worm out but it is tried up with several advanced knots, you don't have time to unknot it. You have no choice but to use the whole bag. You throw the whole bag into the gapping maw of Malmekko. He swallows it. You wait hoping this works because its your only chance with this tactic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salamander shivers and then starts to grow again. Fortunately this time more slowly, It started at 7 feet tall 5 seconds later it hit 7 foot 1 inch. Another 5 second 7 foot two inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts tail grows into some rotten casks smashing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fills nearly the whole passage, there is no way past it. Unless it let you past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only option you can think of it to return to Bryim to see if has any idea to shrink it or at least stop its growth. But the salamander blocks the path and you'd rather not fight it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use your power of Divination to reach into its mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MALMEKKO LIKE BIG. MALMEKKO WANT MORE BIG. MORE BIG. MORE MORE MORE MORE BIG. CASTLE BIG. MOUNTAIN BIG. WORLD BIG.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou telepathically explain of Malmekko that you have to get past him get to Bryim. It somehow sense that you want it stop growing and is not pleased at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO STOP BIG. NO STOP BIG. BIG FOREVER. MORE BIG FOREVER\" now here telepathically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalmekko's growth speed increases now gaining an inch every couple of seconds. Soon he will be crushed by the ceiling or break through in the inn above. Either would be bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to use your power of gating. You open up a portal below Malmekko it lead to outside the inn. You can only make it 6 feet across. Not nearly big enough. Malmekko look though the portal and sees it leads outside. He grasp the side of the portal and it grow until it spans the whole width of the passage. Malmekko goes though it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGot having time to go though the cellar and tavern you go through after. 3 seconds after the portal closes with a zap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalmekko is in a clearing outside the inn. His growth rate as ticked up get again, as if he is personally offended by the distant mountains being bigger then him. He is now growing a whole feet every couple of seconds. He is lying down with his tail curled around him and seems perfectly at peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody in the tavern has filled out and gathered in the clearing, keeping several dozen yards from the creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrutzmil is loudly berating Bryim. Demanding in stop the growth right down or old Wut will have to deal with both them without mercy. A mob is gathering. You estimate less then a minute before things get ugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParting the crowd with few stern stares you make your way over to Bryim, you explain was happened. Bryim tell your that now Malmekko is in control of its size, its can be as big as it wants which is very. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou convince Bryim to come over and ask Malmekko to at least slow down its growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryim does then stands before the 120 foot tall salamander. He gentle touches it on the lower jaw, which is all he can reach. The salamander opens its eyes and looks at Bryim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you like being big but your scaring all these people, and your scaring met, or would your please stop growing so fast, at least until we can think of a way for you to huge without hurting people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalmekko eyes twitch as it think then the growth stops. Everybody keeps watching for a few minutes. By carefully watching the toes you note it is growing about an inches every 5 minutes. No one else seems to have noticed that so you decided to keep that secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising their no imminent danger everybody but Bryim goes back into tavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour talk to Bryim alone and he tells the whole story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe meet with Malmekko back when he was young man. They had been firm friends ever since. However a couple of months ago something odd happen whilst he was on the road between Highmeadow and Hawklor. A portal such opened up right in front of him. The portal stayed only a few inches wide. Form the other side he felt and power aura of Benevolence. Then a insectoid limb with 3 tentacles on the end burst out and met him in a shoulder cross. Another portal appear for him the complete the cross. Whatever as on the other side felt very fluffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then passed over the leather bag filled with worms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a note attached \"These are for your little friend, well <i>currently</i> little,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tried to hide them. But eventually Malmekko found the bag and gnawed through the knot to get it open. He ate one of the worms and the suddenly grew to six feet long and snuggled up with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly learned and the worm had Malmekko then ability to change size. The more worms he ate the greater then change could be. He also found not that the number of worms in the bag never went down. After a bit he train Malmekko to sizeshift on command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask if eating the bag and thus and unlimited supply of these magic worms mean there is now no limit to how big Malmekko can grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably but you can never be sure with magic, especially magic from deep deep in the neverness. Well its what Malmekko thinks and he probably knows best after whatever gave the worms,\" confirmed Malmekko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both realise its only a matter of time until Malmekko grows to big even at the current slow rate of growth, which you doubt he'll maintain. Fortunately you struck by the notice that Malmekko can now learn magic, but what circle should he learn first.  </span></div></div>",

You use Divination of protect into his mind what you want him to make, a skin tight barrier of fortification around his whole body that would not him crashing into or crushing anything no matter now big he gets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalmekko then covers himself in a tight barrier of orange sparkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIG SAFE NOW?\" project Malmekko into your brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask Malmekko to test this first. You move around the Salamander so that his bulk is between you and the Goblinclaw inn you then then used your power of Necromancy to summon forth a skeleton. He can practice on that without anybody getting hurt if it doesn't work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalmekko rests a single toe on the skeleton, crushing it to powder. You summon another now for him to try again, by the fifth one Malmekko has figured out a way to use fortification of divert the force around the skeleton. After a few more tests with several skeletons and ones that move around erratically or feel ready to try it on something living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to volunteer your self when Bryim insisted he be the first.

NOW\" yells out Malmekko it what you are surprised to find is not telepathically but actual speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salamander then starts to go much faster shooting up several feet a second. Its quickly grows right over the Goblinclaw, but does it so gently even the less intoxicated patrons don't notice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then grows over the surrounding forest, without snapping a single twig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIIIIIIIIG,\" yells Malmekko with glee and sky above you is replaced by orange salamander.

After getting dressed you fill a small handbucket with corn and walk out to the large wireframe cage where you keep your hens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had three hens, all of them 3 years old. They were called Honey, bluebell, and Tikka. Honey was a sort of golden-whitish-yellow colour that was hard to adequately describe. bluebell was white with the occasional black feather here and there, particularly in her tail, and Tikka, who was brown all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney was the tallest, and one foot and seven inches. Tikka was next, at one and a half feet, and bluebell was the smallest at one foot two inches, although she was very slowly beginning to catch up to the other two. You weren't sure if those sizes were particularly big or small, but it probably meant they were fully grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all three produced eggs, you checked the hen house fairly regularly, every other day or so. Every so often, bluebell failed to lay an egg, and seemed... embarrassed by it, somehow, though she usually seemed to feel better after a bit of light petting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney was by far the most adventurous of the trio, often attempting to get out of the cage, which was large enough for you to stand up and walk around a small bit in. Bluebell was somewhat timid and preferred to stay inside the henhouse that was located partially in, and partially out of the cage. Tikka seemed kind of...mellow. Laid back. Although, like the other hens, she could be quite affectionate when she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter your back garden and approach the cage and henhouse, where all three hens are outside, stretching their legs. They notice you and turn towards you, before they start to...shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth drops open as the three hens begin to...</span></div></div>",

Nah. You just woke up. It's probably even happened before. You know you're up, you just aren't out of the groggy phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's breakfast?\" Honey demands, flapping her goldish wings impatiently, bouncing in a feathery dance around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use some seed,\" Tikka yawned, calmly sauntering behind Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please...\" is all Bluebell can muster, a heavy blush all over her soft tone of voice. If she could hide behind oxygen, she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you pause, your jaw doing some weapons-grade slackening, your handful of chickenfeed hovering just out of the rim of the feed bucket in your other arm.

You finally take notice enough to lower your head, in time to see Honey's feathers fluffing and puffing in and out, as she shudders again, and begins to balloon out in size, just a little bit. Two inches later, she tries leaping again, her beak getting that much closer to your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, lemme try...\" Tikka says, fluffing up and waddling in place, before blowing up a little bigger than honey, her feathers resting again once she stops at two feet in size. Bluebell cocks her head at the two of them, her beak agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can I try?\" she murmurs quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it, Bluebell!\" Honey sighs impatiently, still not tall enough to reach the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, sweetie, try it,\" Tikka clucks soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBluebell sheepishly steps around a bit, as if needing to be on the exact right spot; she puffs up and puffs up, though for a minute nothing really happens...all the while, you just gawk and watch, not sure which impossibility to wrap your head around and address first. Before you can pick, Bluebell chirps loudly in shock, feeling herself swell up bigger, and bigger, her talons digging in the dirt happily as she surges up cutely to over 2 feet in size, then 3! She stops at 3.5, shivering in approval, fluttering her feathers all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me, girls!\" she cries, overjoyed. \"I...I think I got the biggest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what now?\" Honey sputters, momentarily stopping her mad quest for breakfast to see. \"Why's bluebell the biggest?

There's no other possible alternative explanation for what's going on; given that it's a dream, you see no harm in indulging her--frankly, you feel it a little indulgent on your part, as well! You smile up at her as she blinks down at you, scooping her huge wings tenderly around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll help me, little human?\" she cries, her feathers ruffling excitedly up against your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, sure I will! Might as well have some fun with my own dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dream, little one?\" she muses, seeming about to laugh. You won't be fooled, though, of course she would say that. You dig into her fluffed feathers, snugging tight as you can on her large body, feeling it breath in and out against you; its so warm, you can't keep from closing your eyes and just enjoying the comfort of it, with or without the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Though the answer quickly is determined to be \"with\", as you feel that trademark tingling rippling through her! The eagle cries out louder, somewhere in between victory and juvenile glee, as she expands radically, BOOMING powerfully up and out into the mountain air; smaller birds scatter at her deafening cry, her beak wide open, her pink little growing tongue poking out in joy, as she grows, and grows, and grows, leaping up another 10 feet, then another 17, then another 22, gaining feet more and more rapidly, and in more furious bursts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHHH,\" the eagle pants, flapping her wings out wider and wider, \"No one has fed me their affections in so long!\" She moans, shuddering up even bigger, now standing at an impressive, stunning 75 feet! You open your eyes at this, a moment of panic flashing, before you reassure yourself: that's what a spirit would say, in your dream, after all, she'd be this happy, if not moreso. Heck, by dream logic, things could be much crazier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes off without warning, making you clutch her enormously huge feathers tight as she flies off with you in tow, giving out a strangely un-animal giggle as your tight hold just tickles her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, hang on! I must take you to my home, little one!\" she caws, flapping with so much power that you can hear the trees below warp from the winds they kick up; in minutes she lands heavily on the ground, in a small valley nestled in the upper ranges of the mountains. She politely guides you to the ground with her gigantic wing, where you thud down and shake off the shock of what just happened. For a dream, this feels incredibly real...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see a small circle of tents in the mist nearby, with camping equipment all over the place. A hiking party, from the looks of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These humans mean me no harm,\" she began, pointing with a wing, \"but they are right over my nest, and they have been so noisy! No humans come here, I am not used to their presence. I had gone out looking for help in telling them to please go elsewhere, but thanks to your power, I am so big that I can talk to them myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...why did you bring me along?\" you ask, dusting yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case they say no, my little friend,\" she chirps.

An RV can now be seen near a stream, behind the circle of tents and folding chairs. Ooh, they even have a nice portable hibachi grill thing! Er, focus, you think, strolling up rather boldly into the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anybody home?\" you shout over the din, looking between tents for activity. Two of them unzip pretty quickly, and four humans total those who respond, as they stand there in the circle's center, blinking in a daze of sorts. Beer cans are everywhere. They may well be drunk, and that might well work to your advantage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who're you, man?\" one bearded hiker asks, not really aggressively, but genuinely curious. His voice is slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...am here on behalf of the spirit of the skies?\" you begin, seeing what their reaction is. They just stare on. \"You know, the sky...the spirit, it's of the sky? Big honking eagle? Because, you know, she's right behind me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou motion back to her, and she smiles down at them, chirping softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" she says, pretty plainly. She ruffles her feathers reassuringly at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...a big eagle!\" one girl laughs, before the other three bend over with her, caught in hysterics of a fittingly grand scale. They quickly double over laughing, falling over one another. \"How much dust does the sky accumulate over the weekend?\" another girl asks, making them all laugh harder. \"Where's the maid of the mountains, dude? Is that her feather duster? 'Cause we got all these cans, and...oh god, I can't even finish, haha!\" They cackle like tipsy hyenas in mountain face gear, and even in a dream, you feel a hot blush of embarrassment forming. \"I'm so blitzed, man, it's not even...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You humans are making so much noise,\" she gently cawed, defluffing her plumage some. \"Couldn't I ask you to please move elsewhere? M-my nest, it's right over in this tree...\" She motions up to, then realizes she's enormous now, and actually has to look down at the tree, to find her nest is littered with beer cans and smokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're too small and down to the ground to tell what she's seeing, but the look on her face isn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, you...seriously, you should leave. A lot,\" you begin, before she takes you up in her feathers, rubbing you all over herself, spreading your arms and pressing you into her in a big, long hug. She begins to quiver all over, curling her talons in tight, as she's done asking nicely, and is ready to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUMANS!\" she bellows, fluffing up bigger and bigger, losing you in her fluff; it's...actually still just as nice as before, if not moreso--naturally, she's going to scare the fire out of them, but this is, well...sooo niiiice... \"DEPART FROM MY HOME, I--er, THE SPIRIT OF THE SKIES DEMANDS YOU VACATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-vacate?\" one of the guys asks, all four of them losing their humor, and backing away steadily as she swells larger and larger still, towering higher, up to 90 feet, then 100, then 120, then 150, more than double her previous size, letting you hang in her feathers and keep hugging as she flapflaps her huge wings imposingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT MEANS LEAVE!!\"she blasts, flapping so hard that their tents all go flying, uprooted from their stakes, the RV jittering along the ground as she swells larger still, puffing herself up demandingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guys looks to the rest, and they huddle, getting over their drunkenness pretty fast as the pow-wow. After a moment of this the eagle has stopped growing, nearly 200 whopping feet tall! She starts smiling some as you rub into her, but puts her game face back on as they turn to look up, up and up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, miss eagle-sky-demon, we've decided to...\"</span></div></div>",

As if in answer, the light fades at last, leaving all blinking eyes to adjust to the sight of an enormous allosaurus looming over not just them, but the canopy, the mountaintops, and even most of the mountains! Its massive feet clutch reflexively at the base of the mountain range, its colossal head looking this way and that far, far up in the atmosphere, peeking through even the lower cloud cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...am free?\" the gargantuan dinosaur asks no one, with a deep, powerful, yet feminine voice. She peers down at the cluster of tinies far, far below, cocking her head. \"Whom among you summoned me here?

Until just then, you were doing a good job of hiding behind her, but the downside was you were in wing's grasp; now she rubs you up and down hard against herself, her feathers ruffling all over as power starts to build inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you--\" you begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, love me!\" she begs, starting to ripple and tingle all over, her body lurching taller as she goes on, her feathers spreading adorable around you.

Just a bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" she caws, taking moments here and there to glance up nervously at the stupendously big dinosaur looming over her still--and, well, everything, at her fantastically overdone size; the female lizard just watched, herself somewhat curious as to how far this insanity she's been pulled into can wind up going. Her enormously huge foot raises up over the 700-foot eagle, and hovers there imposingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, fellow spirit, don't give me cause to follow through,\" the allosaur says, with genuine concern.<br>\r\n\"I must defend what is mine!\" the eagle replies, before crying out, trembling all over, and ruffle-ballooning up to over 1,200 feet, then exploding more furiously than even she anticipated, her eyes widening as she inflates all over, her chest and neck swelling and bulging out as the size floods her rudely, leaving her towering herself at a good mile in size! She defiantly sits on everyone below, not harming the campers at all, but trapping them under-rump like teeny eggs; indeed, the entire valley under her is now a perfect fit for her coverage, turning that segment of the entire mountaintop into her nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How strange,\" the allosaur says, a slow smile spreading on her muzzle way up above. \"I was just about to get to doing my summoner's bidding, when lo and behold, I can't hear anything from him anymore! I am bound to him by law, though, so I must put my foot down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle smiles back, though she shows a moment's panic once the dinosaur actually makes good on her statement, and lets the heavy, humongous digit come crashing down; however, it merely touches softly on the eagle's head, and begins to stroke it over sweetly, leaving the 1.3-mile tall eagle blinking in surprise, before lidding her eyes in pleasure, warbling happily at all the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but it appears you've gotten so big that my attempts to stop you just aren't working,\" the dino says with a feminine chuckle, petting the happy mega-eagle slowly and tenderly. Down under her rump, the campers all wriggle and protest, but the orders to try harming the eagle just can't be heard anymore. The eagle caws softly, feeling you hug her, feeling love from the enormous reptile overhead as well, and she begins to tremble even more than ever before, her fluffed body bursting warmly to over 2 miles, then 3, then 4, looming up higher and wider as all the affection soaks her swelling form deeply, pouring into her and feeding her up to 5 miles, totally even with the massive dinosaur; she bumps her muzzle to her beak cutely, and the eagle nuzzles hard into her in thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved me!\" the eagle cries gleefully, though you can tell she blushes when you chip in:<br>\r\n\"I helped, too!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you certainly did, yes! Thank you little friend, thank you so much!!\" she chirps and clicks her humongous beak in joy, preening you with her feathers in appreciation. As she does so, the tingling returns, full-force, and she begins to widen her eyes yet again, as she can feel her sides blowing up against the tips and spires of the entire mountain range, her growth truly taking off, pushing back even the dinosaur, who just laughs in amusement, and hugs into her growing body tight, as she swells and bulges to over...</span></div></div>",

This whole day has been a roller coaster--talking eagles, magic spirits, gigantic creatures that actually get bigger, just by giving hugs--forget hiking, THIS is how you spend a weekend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, seeing your new avian friend pin the arrogant campers under her rear was pretty funny. Guess they got a...bum deal out of all this, you think--and suddenly find that the eagle has stopped growing. Maybe bad puns stop it, or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle's laughter finally subsides as she catches her breath. Then you hear her let out an adorable squawk. \"Oh... oh dear. I think I overdid it that time.\"<br>\r\nHer voice had a faint echo--not a surprise in a mountain range, but it sounded like it was coming from...below? Cocking your head, you wriggle loose of the eagle's embrace to look out at the landscape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then your jaw drops open, and your eyes bug out in a way that--had you looked in a mirror--would have reminded you of Loony Toons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like looking at a map, really. The mountains seemed little more than gray ridges coming out of the ground, topped with white. The sprawling meadows and plains of the countryside stretched out into the distance--like a natural tapestry, a patchwork rug of green. (You were usually better with metaphors, but THIS is really out of your linguistic league). Wispy clouds dot the sky; many look level with the eagle, or like they'd be below her chest if closer. Off in the far distance, you can see the distinctive grey and brown of a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and you're pretty sure you can see the curvature of the Earth on the horizon. That's impressive too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the... wha..

Ten miles to be exact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink slowly. Ten miles tall? She was the size of a small town!<br>\r\nAfter a long, awkward pause, you find your voice. \"So...now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, you hear the allosaur clear her throat--loud enough to be heard, but still polite. \"Well, I suppose that settles the 'who wins' issue,\" she announces, starting to grow. In a few moments, she's level with the eagle--though she's on another mountain altogether, to give the bird some personal space. \"As for the human's question, well...\"</span></div></div>",

At least, you imagine she's blushing, as there's a prominent flare-up of body heat from her, her feathers bobbing up and down cutely against you as she coos and ruffles them a little. \"While I do not at all mind being this big and powerful, truth be told, it is clear now that anyone else that can hold sway over our actions would be all the more tempted to do so, given how strong you and I have grown, kin eagle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you proposing?\" the eagle chirps, cocking her huge head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We go and tell the humans ourselves not to abuse our powers, or THIS happens. There's one of their communes just across the way. We should put on a little show, to dissuade them from further harassment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I don't want to hurt anyone,\" the gargantuan avain says, putting her massive wingtips together as thought they were fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, kin eagle,\" the allosaur laughs, with a feminine giggle, \"I mean only to loom overhead and impose a nonviolent ultimatum. Should they fear us too much, after all, they might strike, and we are not meant to escalate things any further. But we really ought to act, nonetheless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she turns all of her 10-mile bulk slowly around, smiling back at the massive spirit eagle, then motioning for her to follow along as she stomps down off the valley (though by 'off', at that size, it really means a few comparative little inches). Her foot slams the earth with a muffled, meteoric impact, shockwaves rolling out for half a mile under her heavy reptilian soles; her tail tickles and brushes the eagle's feathery chest, making her chuckle and nip the tailtip harmlessly; playfully, she spreads her humongously wide wings open, and waits, the dinosaur dragged her along, before the titanic reptile looks back in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" the eagle speaks, letting her tail drop from her beak, \"I have seen the humans sailing behind their vehicles as though flying, and I couldn't resist trying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to like being in your company, kin eagle,\" the monstrously huge allosaur laughs. \"Why don't you adopt that same pose when you reach the--oh, we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, they are, already looming high, high, HIIIIGH up over the tops of the paper-thin skyscrapers of the city, really more a few sheets of paper stacked so as to differentiate themselves in some laughably minute way from the rest of the surface of the world. Two pairs of fantastically big dino feet and mutually huge eagle talons loom over everything, clawtips clicking up and down over hills and smaller mountains, vibrations cascading through the city, setting off all manner of car alarms and screams as their presence is noted en masse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, little humans!\" the allosaur booms authoritatively, \"we are great spirits of nature, spanning time immortal, standing over the very earth we represent! We mean you no severe harm, but we come with a grave warning: our power has been abused by humans, and our current size is the result of such foolishness and recklessness! We come now to warn you, do not involve us in your petty affairs again, and hence-on, you shall respect he bounds of nature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they'll listen?\" the eagle asks you quietly, blinking her huge, adorable eyes; granted, she's squinting to find you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it'll go that smooth, just yet...\" you yell up to her, a best you can, pointing her towards what you can more easily see: an entire airborne squadron is pummeling away at both the eagle and the dinosaur, neither of the titans noticing at all as missiles slam uselessly into their bodies, the explosions not even big enough to be seen or felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister allosaur,\" the eagle says, poking her backside with a wing, \"our little humans friend says they are not complying! Wh...what do we do now? I will not harm them, but they're calling our bluff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, eagle,\" the allosaur says, simply puffing some air out of her nostrils, sending the heavy artillery scattering all over like panicked little gnats. As she chuckles, the allosaur feels the feathers of the eagle puffing out against her backside, then her eyes widen as she realizes her chest is now, more-than covering it, the upwards curve of the avian's mighty body sliding up slowly over her scales, her head getting mooshed down by a growing field of plumage. With a booming, echoing chirp, she and everyone around sees the eagle growing even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" the eagle cries, surging up another 1,000 feet, then another after that, her eyes fluttering in bliss. \"I...I feel love radiating from the city!\" With that, the allosaur feels herself tingling all over, starting to boom up even bigger as well, the two giantesses getting cutely, awkwardly tangled together, as they grow and grow and grow, rising even higher up over the sky-view of the littles down below. \"I don't know h-how, but I can feel them loving us! Millions o-of themmmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither one realizes the entire thing had been televised worldwide, and some serious love and admiration was being loosed the world over...</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, the growth tapers off soon after that...without either spirit-creature reaching space, or at least without hitting their head on the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...is it over?\" The eagle asks nervously, looking around. \"I don't even want to know how big...we...are-- oh my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh My\" indeed. Both creatures had reached truly gargantuan sizes--the city below seemed a mass of grey, with individual buildings almost indistinguishable. This time, you were sure you could see the curvature of the Earth--and that the shadows of both spirits stretched for what had to be dozens of miles, blanketing huge swaths of the area in shade...even the mountains off in the distance, where all this had started, were covered....by the eagle's shadow, meaning she had ended up the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess that should send a message,\" you offer, stunned for the umpteenth time today. Then, a thought occurs. \"Hey wait a minute: what about the city?!? Just your feet, er, talons growing forward could have toppled half of it! But...it looks fine!\" You look down at the city below, and lo and behold, not a single building looked damaged in the slightest despite both spirits' feet--especially the eagle's talons--jutting into them as they had grown. In fact....it almost looks likethe buildings...moved to accommodate them as they grew! \"But...how...why...?\" You splutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I can answer that, little human.\" The allosaur's voice calls out. She actually wasn't that mush shorter than the eagle, coming up to the colossal avian's chest. \"As spirits of the earth and sky, we are sworn to protect our realms from outside threats. But as you've seen today, we can reach....considerable sizes and strengths given the right circumstances. Just one of us could become large and powerful enough to, as the saying goes, 'take over the world' and rule it themselves. And two spirits at such sizes? Well, you probably have an idea of how THAT could go wrong. So, we have a check on our power: no matter how big we get, we can never harm anyone unless they pose a direct threat. That's why those annoying hikers weren't squished when your eagle friend sat on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle giggles, a bit sheepishly. \"I admit, I kind of enjoyed that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mull it over. \"So...that's why the buildings...moved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagles reaches her head down and nuzzles you, chirping cutely. \"That's about right, little guy!\" she coos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe allosaur chuckles at the affectionate display. \"And that's also why you can still breathe despite being at such an altitude, little human. But with that out of the way, I suppose you wouldn't mind if we...messed around with these humans for a bit? It's been a while since I've been to a human city, let alone this large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle nods rapidly, smiling hugely. \"Oh, yes! Please don't worry, we wont hurt anyone--we can't hurt anyone, promise! Besides, you humans are just too cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug...then smirk. \"Of course you can.

No, not yet. What form would the Spirit of the sun take, anyway? The only possibility dave saw was a Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave checked the pockets he had put into the inside of his hoodie when he ordered it. It truly was an effort to block out the titanic Spirits' voices, but what he heard was to interesting to ignore. They literally couldn't harm people? Dave blushed slightly when the eagle mentioned sitting on him and his friends. That had felt kind of good, as the eagle's feather were so unbelievably soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave retrieved four pouches of powder from the inside pockets of his hoodie, opening them to check the contents. A light cyan blue powder in the first, a blazing yellow-orange in the second, and pure black in the third, and black mixed with silver in the last. He had to wonder what the last two were.

If the Spirits truly were gentle, as the Allosaurus had said, what was the harm in summoning a few more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing all but the pouch of cyan powder back into his pockets, dave removed a small pinch of the powder, holding it between his fingers.

Her movements were also quicker; graceful but twitchy...like an overly-happy kid.<br>\r\nOdd that every Spirit so far has been female...ah, whatever. Dave shook his head; he had to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's me, Spirit of the Seas,\" Dave intoned, putting on an authoritative air. He wasn't the best actor around, but he figured first impressions would be vital. After all, the last time he'd summoned a Spirit and not taken charge, a certain spectral dinosaur had simply stood by while he and his friends had been pinned under a certain spectral eagle's feathery rump. He wasn't too keen on something like that happening again. \"My name is Dave, and I am your summoner. Tell me, what do you know of the Spirits of the Earth and Sky?\" After a moment's hesitation, he loosely crossed his arms and straightened his posture--best to play the part in full, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dolphin-Spirit rolled in the air, looking Dave over. \"Pleased to meet you, boss,\" she chirped. \"As for the other Spirits...well, they're a lot of fun! Sky is always looking for a hug, and she's always found you humans adorable. And she just loves mountains--like this one, actually!--always making a nest or two on some peak, usually watching over any villages or towns nearby.\" The Sea-Spirit \"swam\" around Dave as she kept talking; \"And...well, she likes humans, but she has this odd habit when they annoy her or make her mad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave had to suppress a chuckle, he just knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She likes to, well, pin them somehow to shut them up,\" the dolphin concluded, giggling. \"I've seen her just lie down on some guys with axes, pinning them under her belly; Once she stepped on a trireme to keep it from leaving a dock when the humans had chopped up her favorite forest to make the ship, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit on some hikers for annoying her?\" Dave added, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dolphin-spirit blinked...then laughed. It was an odd--yet adorable--laugh, a mix of a human-sounding chortle and the squeaky chirps of the creature she took the form of. \"Wha-what??\" She choked out between laughs, \"That's...hilarious! When did that happen, and who were the poor saps she did that to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave simply smiled. \"Those 'poor saps' were me and my friends, and it happened just this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dolphin winced, halting her mid-air \"swim\". \"Oh...sorry, boss,\" she squeaked. \"...Anyway, Earth acts more...grown-up than Sky; she likes humans too, but she doesn't go around looking for hugs and cuddling them every chance she gets. Actually, she sorta likes messing around with you guys, she's pretended to be a big monster and scared up humans before; she especially likes human cities for some reason...why'd you ask, boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave smiled, and pointed behind the Sea-Spirit. The dolphin turned around...and her jaw dropped as she saw the other two Spirits, grown to ludicrous sizes, and lazily lying around near a nearby city, idly chatting away while a crowd of people swarmed around them. They were leaving, breathing mountains of feathers and scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How did I not notice that until now?\" The dolphin squeaked, dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Dave soothed, hugging the dolphin. There was a sensation like static electricity cracking all over her, and the feeling of the aquatic spirit inflating and pushing him back. By the time Dave let her go, the dolphin was easily 70 feet long. \"Now then, we have somewhere to be...\"</span></div></div>",

Said talons and toes swell loudly, aggressively, the scales to her huge feet stretching ominously.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What is it?\" the earth spirit asks, cocking her reptilian head curiously at her cousin. \"Are you alright, dear kin?\" The allosaur nuzzles harder, and harder, and harder, awash in genuine concern--but the eagle only moans and shakes harder, the more she's nuzzled on.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I...B-B...BI...\" the colossal, mountain-sized avian breathes, gulping and cawing in bliss. The tingling worsens! The ground starts to quiver and quake, pebbles, trees, far-off campers, cars and boulders all starting to jitter about fearfully. Her huge eyes close as she opens her beak wider, and wider, and...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith a flustering rush of fluffed-up feathers, a vast, snuggly wall booms into you--into everything down below, even--as the sweet-hearted eagle cries out and BOOMS another 30 miles in size, in one blasting burst of growth!! You ride the wave, along with the colossal dinosaur, as the sheer cliff of the eagle's chest pushes you both out further and further over the mountain range. Her rear pushes down over the entire span effortlessly, feathers puffing out in shock, as she goes from 10 to 20, then to fifteen, then the full 30, then comes to a rest. Her head bobbles as she sighs, still shivering a little.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"AH, so good! So gooood!\" the eagle quake-chirps, beaming happily. Her voice echoes for mile after mile, shaking the snow off of the far-flung mountains in the distance.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" the alloasaur moons, blinking her gigantic eyes. She nuzzles into her feathers like crazy. \"Hmmmnmph...fellow kin, your feathers are so soft! I just...can't...help...\" She nuzzles more and more and more, making the eagle catch her breath.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"G...good! Please...give m-me more, fellow spirit! Please...Make...ME...GROOOOOW!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSomething is strange here--er, more so. The eagle feels just as kind and warm, sure, but the alloausar, while talking the same way, is becoming more and more...enamored of the eagle...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes, of course, dear one! Feed! GROW!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe eagle begins to rumble and rattle, shaking so much that the tectonic plates wobble about just a tiny bit. The clouds swirling about her feathery midsection shift and move about, as the power builds and builds within the swollen avian...it just gets deeper and deeper...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Uh,\" you begin, so very lost among feathers the size of your neighborhood street, \"you look amazing, eagle, but...I dunno, isn't this a bit much?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, mooooore! MOOOOORE! MMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe eagle roars, erupting five times larger, in one awesome spurt of power...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"--OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n150 miles booms to 250...460...600!!!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE!!!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou hear the oddest noises, and after some climbing up a skyscraper-sized feather, you see other spirits rising from the world; most are only so big, but they are large enough to be seen climbing up around you, on her groaning body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Kin...let us love you, too...\" a massive horse says, imploringly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Let us cuddle you!\" a gigantic female dolphin begs, nuzzling into her form.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"It's like her powers got too big, all of a sudden,\" you muse, as you observe the curvature of the very planet itself, seemingly safe at your vantage. \"But this means...holy cow, she's gonna get HUGE!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"MOOOOOREMOOOOOREMOOOOOREMOOOOOOORE! YES!!\" the giddy eagle booms, clicking her huge, huge beak in joy. \"PLEASE! LOVE ME!! LOVE ME MORE, ALL OF YOOOOU! MAKE ME EVEN LARGER! I WANT TO GROW AND GROOOOOOOW!! I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n...Huh. Maybe this was why the spirits never were given too much at once.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe same rumble tears through the monstrously vast eagle yet again, and she begins to openly pant and tremble, fluffing herself up in gleeful anticipation. The planet goes quiet, the nearest cities and far-away countries--even the cities covered by her harmless fluffy rear--all wait and watch in shock, as the rumbling gets heavier and louder.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"NNNNNNN...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer beak shuts as she grows more tense...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"HNNNNNNNNNGHHHHH...HAAAAH...HAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nVisible tics pulse through her, as her feathers begin to grow a golden shade, shimmering with energy. Waves of power flood off of her, only to be pulled back in, making the many forests below do the wave, in and out, as she keeps soaking up more love, more than she knows what to do with! Gads, the shaking--it's getting so much worse!!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"HHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDespite her cries, her beak is open in a huge, glorious smile--she's never sounded so happy! Just before the spurt erupts from within her, a great and booming voice calls out:<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"WHAT IS ALL THIS COMMOTION!?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou hang on dearly to a feather-tip, and look out to see a great bronze dragoness, easily half the size of the planet, coming up from the crust as though she were part-ghost. You and the other spirits are agog...but the eagle is nearly screaming with need, her body pulsing violently, her breathing fast and deep as she smiles.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"AGAIN, I SAY--WHAT IS THIS NONSENSE!?\" the dragoness booms.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Core spirit!\" a massive python hisses, nodding in respect. \"Hello!! It's eagle, look at her! Isn't she radiant? She's grown so big and beautiful! We can't resist loving her!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe eagle tries to speak, but blushes, and begins to uncontrollably strettttch out with growth...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"AH, SHE IS GORGEOUS, IS SHE NOT, FRIEND CORE SPIRIT?\" a new feminine voice asks. You look up and up and up and up, to see a silver dragoness, though not as huge as the core one. She purrs, sticking partly out of the moon, making sweet eyes at the less-humongous eagle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"MY DEAR MOON SPIRIT, PLEASE. DO NOT BE INFLUENCED BY HER GROWING POWER SO EASILY.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe eagle groans and bursts a bit more, trying so hard to hold back, as more and more affection pours freely into her quaking body...she can't contain it anymore!!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer roar splits the heavens, as the eagle balloons at an incredible pace, 600 miles lurching disproportionately up to 800, then bulging on the other side as she roars past 1,100 miles, then 1,500!! She just gets bigger and bigger, the thin sheet of clouds below rocking out further and further, as her puffing plumage sweeps them away!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"GOODNESS!\" the Core dragoness roars, as the eagle bumps and swells right into her, pushing happily and so warmly into the colossal dragon. \"STOP THIS RIGHT NOW, EAGLE!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I CAAAAAAN'T!\" she giggles, blowing up three times larger!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer avian shadow consumes the land, casting the hemisphere in gentle darkness, as she pants and grunts, and doubles her size!!! The planet itself, while still larger, becomes more and more like some too-big egg atop which the growing female is perched! And still she shudders with growth!!!!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your new friend the eagle...she had gone from regular sized to over 47,500,000 feet, in this short, bizarre time. Put a massive bronze staff into the south pole, and you could have made a pretty nice flagstand...in space.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, that's better! So much better!\" the eagle giggles, fluffing up joyfully. She finally peers down, then gawks. \"Oh my! I'm...I really DID get bigger!\" A feather as big as a lesser archipelago floats down, crashing into the ocean, rocking ships with no real harm for miles over.She blinks, batting her gigantic, deep eyes, and can't help but smile. She blushes and shudders more, as every spirit on Earth loves continually on her figure. \"Mmmmn...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"ENOUGH OF THIS, NOW, EAGLE! SERIOUSLY!\" the angry core spirit huffs. The only slightly-bigger dragoness furrows her brows and cocks her head, restraining obvious envy as she glances the gargantuan eagle over. \"YOU MUST REALIZE, DEAR EAGLE...THIS IS FAR TOO SEVERE OF AN IMBALANCE. PLEASE, DO RELINQUISH YOUR SIZE, RIGHT NOW.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"H-how, core spirit?\" she chirps, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"NOW, NOW, FRIEND SPIRIT, GO EASY ON HER,\" the huge silver moon-spirit says, smiling wide. \"SHE IS WORTHY OF SUCH SHE HAS RECEIVED, I DO THINK. LET HER JOIN OUR ECHELON OF STATURE.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"ABSOLUTELY NOT! YOU AND I BALANCE OUT THIS AREA OF THE COSMOS, NOT HER. SHE IS A SUBORDINATE. A LOVELY ONE, EAGLE, DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, th-thank you so much!\" Eagle coos, putting her colossal wings up to her beak in sweet embarrassment at the compliment. \"To have you of all the spirits say so...I...IIIII...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe shudder grows and grows within her, and the bronze dragoness cocks a brow nervously. Everything not nailed down trembles on earth. A second more, and the pulsing quake swells, rattling the unharmed world. Everywhere her great, vast claws dig in, there is only open land or waters. To those living, it's like some god has slipped a few quarters into a message bed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"N-NOW, EAGLE, THAT IS ENOUGH...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"H...HAAAAH...AAAAAAAAAH!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer golden feathers fluff further out, as if pleading with the stern spirit to let their master grow and grow. The only thing that comes from the great dragoness, however, is a set of slack jaws, as the gentle silver dragoness emerges fully from the moon and cuddles the larger eagle tenderly against herself, smiling.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"YOU'RE JUST...SO GORGEOUS...\" the less-gigantic (but still immense) dragoness purrs, nuzzling hard into the eagle's soft belly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"M-moon spirit...\" the eagle rumbles, lidding her adorable eyes low. The vibrations grow much, much stronger, emanating from the colossal avian in great, rolling waves of affection-soaked energy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD, FELLOW DRAGON!?\" the core spirit balks, starting to pointlessly back away. \"S-STOP, MOON! EVEN THE LOWER SPIRITS HAVE MADE EAGLE THIS B-BIG, DON'T--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"HHHHHHHHHH...HHHHAAAAAAHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe eagle's quaking goes from violent to outright catastrophic as she closes her eyes, beams wildly, and lets her beak hang open. The roar that follows is so large that the world can see her swell out as it passed through her throat, and out into the heavens:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBBBBBBIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGG GGGGGGGERRRRRR!!!!!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe great body of the silvery moon spirit almost vanishes into a forest of plumed chaos, as the eagle blows up furiously, audibly stretching and swelling, pumping and groaning, her body rocketing out in every direction in a mess of pleasured growth. Her thickening neck creaks and strains as it bulges wider and wider, pushing up taller and higher and thicker through the boundaries of space. Her rump smothers and bulges down, diffusing out over both oceans at the same time, as the planet dwindles to a ball, then an egg, then less than that!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"NOOO!\" the bronze dragoness roars as the eagle swells rapidly, crashing cutely into her scaly, 20,000-mile body, consuming it as well in feathery warmth. She and the entire planet, every tiny spirit, the moon, and all man-made satellites vanish, snuggled into her loving bulk, as she caw-booms and grrroooooows again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n90,000 miles tingle, tense, tremble, and explode to 110,000...130,000...160,000...gods, on and on she swells, as her influence brings every human and animal alike on the little planet to cuddle into the harmless wall of bulk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"AAAAAH...H-AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe gulps and bursts up twice as large, overfed beyond all comprehension by so much love at once flowing into her, filling her up and up. Soon over half a million miles, over 2.5 billion feet, the eagle finally lets out a rolling, thundering sigh, and hugs herself dearly, just to feel her own bulk swell against her embrace.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"MMMMM! I..I FEEL SO GOOD! AMAZINGLY GOOD! HEE!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn the minutes taking place during her expansion, as she watches the realm of space both open up and constrict around her, the eagle begins to feel a few odd sensations rolling across her body--external ones, not the tickling pleasure of her growth. As she finally slows her spurts down, she better ses what the reason was:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPlanets. Entire planets are on her. She blinks, her beak agape.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"MAGIC!\" she caws excitedly. \"THEY LOVE ME TOO!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDown so, so far below, all of Earth is smiling at her outburst. You come off of the shock of her pulsing growth, to find yourself on her beak. You haven't slipped through her atomic structure or pores, so you take a second to chalk it up, perhaps lazily, to magic, before turning to the endless plain of the eagle's yellow beak.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"It's gravity!\" you bellow, as best as you can. \"You're creating your own gravity well, eagle!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer blinks create a concussive blast that rushes through you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"EEEEE! YOU'RE HERE! MY LITTLE FRIEND!\" You can feel the hearts coming off of her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I am, yup! You may be a spirit, but you obviously are composed of mass--that mass is so big now that you're pulling cosmic bodies towards you!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"OOH! HELLO, PLANETS!\" she chirps, so big she can snuggle on Jupiter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"So, are there other spirits, out in the universe?\" you ask, starting to wonder.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"OF COURSE THERE ARE,\" a booming voice replies. An alien-looking figure emerges, swelling up from Jupiter. From the voice, he's clearly male; an insectoid, but thick and bulky, at that! \"YOU ARE MASSIVE!! TELL ME...HAVE YOU BEEN SENT BY THE GALAXY SPIRIT, IN SMALLER FORM, TO SEE ONE OF US PLANET SPIRITS?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I haven't! I was from Earth, actually!\" she says, smiling lovingly. The insect-Jupiter-spirit, easily as big as five Earths, just blushes and clicks his mandibles cutely. \"But still, hello! I didn't know we had cousins this far out in space!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I-IT'S A PLEASURE,\" Jupiter spirit chatters, obviously already in love. \"I FEEL COMPELLED, FRIEND SPIRIT...T-TO...ER, MAY I...?\" he meekly asks, readying his mantis-styled arms in a hug position. She nods rapidly, wiggling her tail feathers all around giddily, in so doing dusting dozens of moons attracted to that region of her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"MAY I, AS WELL?\" a strange, whale-like creature asks. She's much smaller, coming from Venus, and several other planet spirits all cuddle into her as well, like little siblings eager to bask in her radiance. Her golden glow grows brighter as she squeals in joy:<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Y-YES! YES, YOU ALL MAY! HELLO!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHug upon cuddly hug ensues, affection from entire planet spirits racing into her as she closes her eyes and clicks her beak. A rumble so big it shakes the quadrant echoes out from her as she pants and groans and huffs, the power building at a frightening pace within her golden core!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"GREETINGS, MY LITTLE FRIEND SPIRITS,\" a colossal, booming voice speaks. Everyone but the trembling, smiling eagle looks out to see the Sun spirit himself, a great, phoenix-like being, incredibly big, and all smiles. He's larger than even the eagle! He takes one look at the great golden eagle, and just absolutely melts. \"SUCH A BEAUTY YOU ARE! HOW DID...HOW DID YOU GROW SO LARGE, FELLOW SPIRIT? YOU ARE MORE RADIANT THAN MYSELF!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"HEEHEE! FLATTERER!\" eagle coos, her vibrations getting massively powerful, the growth wracking her shuddering body as she rumbles away and grins. \"OOOHHHHHH! ONE SECOND, SUN SPIRIT...H-HERE WE...G-G-GGGRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith a concussive blast, the other planets are blown back, the ring of them pushing out as the spirits all whoop and laugh, as though it's just some great ride; as the gravity well pulls them back in, eagle's body beats them to the punch: the monstrous god-bird roars and pulses out a hundred staggering times bigger in size, on the spot! Even the Sun is pulled in slowly, the gawking spirit watching in total awe as her body slams into her kin, all of them cheering and hugging away tenderly, as she grows higher and higher above them, and lower and lower down below.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n60,000,000 miles of quivering, happy bird tremble, ripple and blow up yet again by five hundred times! That one spurt sends her rocketing to 300,000,000 miles, over half the distance from the Earth to the Sun--or the Earth, where it used to be. In her gilded feathers, the little blue planet is just fine, unharmed by the huge Sun's blazing adoration of her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"AMAZING! TRULY AMAZING!\" the Sun spirit roars, cuddling her un-burnt body lovingly. \"L-LET US BE WITH YOU, SWEET SPIRIT!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe would answer, but the goddess eagle is still panting and groaning with bliss, her body rippling so much that waves are rocking over her body...she's nowhere near done growing bigger!!!! The pulses get worse and worse, the entire system starting to shake ominously, as she takes in a huge, impossible breath, grooooaaans, and...AND...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The booming avian's many, many occupants are simply too enamored of her, engrossed with cuddling into and generally loving away on her body. Every few seconds a tic races through the rattling ripples quaking through eagle, each tic blowing her up a stretchy bit bigger, as if the growth spurt that's piling up within her is so big, even she has to bulge up bigger before being able to handle it!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe bright, gilded hues dancing over her feathers become brighter still, as she clicks her beak and moans louder. 500,000,000 miles pussssshes hotly up to 600,000,000, and she closes her eyes. 700,000,000 comes and goes as she fluffs out and groans even louder. The rumbling just gets worse and worse and worse, until the cosmos seem to shake angrily around her. All of you deep within her plumage hold tight, smiles of anticipatory glee plastered on every face, human and smaller-god alike.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer feathery chest surges out hungrily, as the quaking gets so bad it nearly renders eagle a gargantuan, growing blur, bolts of godly energy dancing over her as she spurts up to 900,000,000 miles...and stretches...and streeeetches...and...AND...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEagle explodes bigger so violently that the rush is like the end of the world--only snugglier. The inky depths of space melt into a string of colors and ethereal bands of light that snake and warp about her as she triples--no, dectuples--n-no...in one booming heartbeat, eagle has inflated herself up to 50,000,000,000 miles!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnother heartbeat, and she's 600,000,000,000 miles tall!!!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n1,200,000,000,000 miles...3,700,000,000,000 miles...the colors shift, then go to black again, and eagle's eyes only open to happy slits as she keeps bellowing her bliss:<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!\"&lt; br /&gt;<br>\r\nBWHOOMPH! 1.5 light years tall...BWHOOOOOMPH!!6 light years! BA-WHOOOOOOMMMMPH!!! 40 light years!!! Her monstrously vast wings flapflap cutely, wrapping around the Orion nebula entirely as she quickly huffs and shudders and blows up twenty times larger than even it!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"C-CAN'T STOOOOP!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe caws and rumbles with growth, the sheer force of the waves pouring off of her vibrating throughout the Cat's Eye Nebula, before she wiggles and billows through it, buffeting the great mass apart with her feathers, dusting it to a million vibrant wisps through her wings. Another gulp and a happy sigh, and eagle balloons furiously up to 1,500 light years, her beak wide open once again as she giggles and pants and swells out ten times as big, in one thick gush of size!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"HAHHHH...AH-AAAAAAH!!

PLEASE!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe trembles with need, the 12,000 light-year tall bird preening herself, both to feel her own body swelling out, and to nuzzle and thank the nebula spirits that had stuck to her body like tape as she outgrew their homes. Strange rainbow serpents that could swallow a trillion Suns in one bite are darling little flecks compared to eagle, who loves them back and croons and chirps in utter, complete joy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"BIGGER!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe tenses up and strains, detonating another 10,000 light years in one rude burst.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"B-BIIIGGGERRR!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer belly and chest outgrow her for a comical moment, making her thick neck lengthen out and swell in diameter, before she trembles more and explodes even larger, and larger, growth crashing atop frantic growth!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n34,000 light years...45,000...75,000!!!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEagle's adorably huge, gentle eyes glow a brilliant white as they roll back in her skull; the space around her flashes and contorts with the sheer influx of energy that pours into the once-humble little bird. Her talons, each thicker than the nebulae within Orion, could be felt bursting thicker as they curl in pleasure, her beak pushing out further and wider as she click-clicks it in glee. Another rumbling stretch of her feathery hide, and eagle bursts even larger, straining with abandon, as if every moment knowing she might simply burst apart at the seams, and being endlessly thrilled that she won't.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"B-BBB-B-BB-BIIIIIII-IIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGGERRRRRRRRR-HRRRHRRR!!!!!\"<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hiccups and rockets up even larger, stronger and fuller with power, leaving her a stunning 100,000 light years in size!! With a cry of joy she feels herself pass a glowing light, before darkness resumes again. She opens her great, massive eyes, blinking, and sighs in bliss as the growth spurt finally, finally ends. Eagle is...holy cow...sh-she's over two billion times larger!!!!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"SO LOVELY!\" she giggles, fluffing up in pride and joy. \"OH, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH, LITTLE SPIRIT KIN! I LOVE YOU ALL!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"SUCH NOISE,\" an equally-huge, jarring voice echoes. It is definitely male! A vast, muscled creature resembling a bull emerges from the span of light she had outgrown--the Milky Way, itself!! She was as big as the Milky Way! The bull was just as large, made of shimmering blue light, and he regards eagle calmly for a moment. \"GREETINGS, GOLD ONE! I HAD ONLY A MOMENT TO NOTICE YOUR GROWTH, BEFORE YOU EMERGED FROM MY REALM. WHAT A PLEASURE TO MEET ANOTHER AS GREAT AS MYSELF!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"HEE! HELLO, MILKY WAY SPIRIT! SO PLEASED TO MEET YOU, TOO!\" eagle nearly purrs, wiggling her tailfeathers sweetly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"MIGHT YOU BE TASKED WITH BECOMING A NEW STRETCH OF THE HEAVENS, SUCH AS I ONCE WAS?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"YOU GREW TOO?\" eagle asks, batting her goddess eyes gently.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I DID, INDEED. I FINALLY STOPPED AT THIS SIZE, AND MY ENERGIES FORMED THE MILKY WAY. I ASSUME YOU ARE NEARLY DONE, AS WELL!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"OH, I DUNNO! I HOPE NOT, HEE!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"HMM...THERE IS...AN INTERESTING AURA ABOUT YOU,\" the spirit muses, cocking his great head and smiling. \"I FEEL MOST COMPELLED...\"</span></div></div>",

You step back, worried for her, and ask what's wrong. She doesn't look like she's in much pain, but she's definitely being hurt by whatever's affecting her. Because she hadn't looked hurt when she grew before, you guess it's something else making her feel pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear the sound of flapping wings from behind you, much louder than they have any right to be. Turning, you see a huge hawk with dark feathers, with a man riding on its back and holding a weird staff aimed at the eagle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use,\" the man said. \"Even up close, it's impossible to grow this eagle anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look confused at the man riding the hawk, and ask, \"Okay, who are you, and what's with these giant birds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks at you, as if he hadn't seen you yet. \"Oh, look, we have a witness. That means I'll have to kill you so you don't tell everyone about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the man and the hawk, and behind you at the eagle (who has collapsed on the ground, breathing hard), and reply, \"I think nobody would believe me anyway. Now, I'll ask again: who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk landed, and the man got off its back. He was wearing a kind of torn lab coat, and looked like he might have been a scientist of some sort. He tapped the ground with his staff impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Dr. Size,\" he said. \"I've been trying to perfect the science of size control, and I've just had a breakthrough. Using this staff I designed, I can change the sizes of animals, but apparently, it has its limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that explains the giant hawk?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, and the eagle giant--or giantess, rather--behind you. This is something I've been trying to perfect for years, and I've just now learned the trick. I'm planning to field test it on a multitude of animals, and then reveal my findings to the scientific world. Just imagine the uses of giant animals! And the power they could give those who control them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds interesting,\" you say. \"But, how about I just leave now, and you can take this eagle with you. I won't spoil your research to anyone, promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Size looks at you with an evil grin. \"Well, the eagle is useless now. She should revert to her original size in a few hours. But maybe you didn't understand the insinuation of my prior monologue.... These giant animals could help me get whatever I want. Even militaries couldn't stop me. And I can't let anyone live who knows about my research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumps back onto his hawk's back, and the giant bird glares at you. \"Hawk, kill him,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hawk lunges at you, its beak open. but just before it reaches you, something else hits it, knocking it aside. You look in surprise, seeing the eagle standing there, glaring at the hawk. She glances over at you, and her face seems to take on a kind expression. She lifts off, and before you know what's happening, she flies towards you, her talons outstretched. She grabs you in them, holding you tightly as you squirm and shout in surprise, and starts flying away.</span></div></div>",

Curiosity overcomes self-preservation, and you raise a hand to touch the strange barrier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's made of...feathers? Very large feathers, bigger than any bird has business having. And, somehow, familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, avain Caw! resounds in your ears, and your instincts belatedly kick in as you scramble backwards, only to trip on a rock and fall heavily on your rear. You let out an \"Oof!\" of pain and look upwards, remembering the sudden bird-cry--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd find the ever-familiar female eagle standing over you, wings spread, head cocked to one side curiously...and twelve feet tall, covering you in her shadow. Her head was as big as your whole chest, maybe bigger. Her wingspan was easily wider than you were tall! And she was looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you had always liked this particular eagle; how she always seemed to turn up whenever you went hiking, but you also knew that eagles were called \"birds of prey\" for a reason.

And so, with a high yelp, you scramble to your feet and run like heck away from the over-sized bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few steps you realize that may just encourage you to come after her, but that revelation doesn't make you slow down. Neither do the loud wingbeats behind you, and the outsized avian shadow on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure there wasn't anything you could trip over on the path, you risk a look back and find the giant eagle soaring through the air, following you!<br>\r\n\"Oh,come on!!

You just got assigned to holding onto a rope that is holding the elephant down. Suddenly, everyone yells and points into the distance. You think this is unimportant and sit next to the elephant. You being a smart chicken nugget, decided to wrap the rope around your hand several time. There\u2019s no getting that off anytime soon. Everyone is still yelling and wonder why. It\u2019s almost night, what could be seen? Surely not land. Then a shadow passes over. The captain calls all but you to arms. Before anyone can do anything, however, the elephant is suddenly snatched into the air. The rope yanking you into the air as well. You can\u2019t tell what grabbed it, but you decide to find out later. The elephant is trumpeting in pain and your ears going along for the ride. Soon, you come to a nest made of barren, uprooted trees. That\u2019s when you realize what got you. The roc from that book you got at the store. You didn\u2019t believe the story, but now you wish you\u2019d paid more attention. All you remember is that the roc is female. The elephant is dropped into the nest and you can barely make out multiple others, maybe five in total. There are other animals in the heat as well. Goats, pigs, cattle, all clustered in the large nest. What catches your eye, however, are the net fulls of people. It seems the roc is a clever girl, catching humans in hunting traps and fishing nets. You land on the elephant\u2019s back. You notice that none of the animals have claw marks on them, they are all intact. The giant bird lands in the nest, without crushing anything. When she\u2019s lands, she obliviously slices the rope that is tied to your hand. However, it was cut closer to the elephant, you now you have a rope snake on your arm. You jump down and land on the bird\u2019s right foot. She doesn\u2019t notice however, and continues to look at her collection of animals. You make it to under her stomach when she she sits down, amazingly not crushing anything. Now you\u2019re leaning against her stomach and you\u2019re struggling to get back up. The bird starts swallowing the animals whole. As they travel, you can see the bulges they make Andy hear and feel them in her stomach. She\u2019s gone through at least 3/4 of the previous total and now looks satisfied. The only things left are two elephants and the bags of people. The mixture of animals in her stomach are making a horrific ruckus and it\u2019s making you scared. Suddenly, some of them pound and it hits you in the face, startling you. The roc lowers her head to her belly and strokes it with her beak. You dive out of the way and are miraculously not spotted. However, you land on a sharp branch and you cry out. When you look over, the roc is clearly looking at you.</span></div></div>",

It would be impossible for you to try and leave the roc's beak as it is too heavy for you to lift and too much of your body is already inside. While it does not make you happy, the next best thing would be to crawl fully inside of the beak, that way she at least doesn't crush you to death. She might eat you, but she could have done that anyways. It is one less thing for you to be worried about. The roc's tongue undulates underneath you as you struggle to pull your legs inside of the roc's beak. You manage to pull your legs inside before you get stuck. You pull harder and feel your shoes fall off and your feet slip inside. Sitting on the roc's tongue, you pull off your socks as nothing's worse than wet socks and put them in your pocket. You try to stand up but the roc's tongue is moving to much so you slip and fall down. Sighing, you lay there on the roc's tongue, hoping against hope that you will make it out alive. With nothing else to do in the dark cave that is the roc's beak, you slowly drift asleep. When you wake up you are...</span></div></div>",

The sheer size of it was both incredible and worrying. You thought to yourself the possibilities if it managed to escape your home, but your daydreams were quickly broken as you heard the giant monster make its way to the one place you'd least expect it to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surly, the things within your room started to become absorbed into the mammoth slime creature. First it was your chair, then your desk, even your bed! It gurgled, it groaned, and it shuddered. You watched in fear this time as in mere seconds, the contents of your room were gone. You watched as the mammoth green entity grew out even more, forcing cracks into the nearby walls, as more of itself continued to come into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until the creature began to search for more things to fuel its growth, yet something caught your eye. As the slime grew before you, it seemed to be searching more ferociously. It seemed to move quicker, and absorb with more haste than before. It's actions seemed more calculated than before. You began to ponder before it dawned to you. As the slime grows, it becomes more intelligent and thus, desires to grow even MORE. It's an endless cycle really, one that scared the living shit out of you due to the thought of it escaping and having a limitless growth supply from the sun and even the uni--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thought again were disturbed as the groaning grew louder. The gurgling and shuddering increased in intensity, and you now looked before a monstrous blob. It had grown so much, that it occupied not only the living room, but the hallway, bathroom, your room, even the kitchen! Even worse, you saw it try to shift its way upstairs, its gargantuan size nearly suffocating you as it moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think of something quickly, and you somehow mustered the courage to confront this growing alien. you yelled at the top of your lunges, \"STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, it had stopped its advance upstairs, and shifted itself to give you room to breath. A faint bubbling noise began to be heard, and a low groan was emanated. It actually looked.....guilty. As if it was a child giving in to a frenzy, oblivious to the outside world. You smiled faintly at its innocence, and tried to speak a little more calmly, \"Look, I know you probably like...doing that growing thing or whatever...\" The bubbling began to increase significantly, and it shifted its weight sporadically, as if showing a significant sign of glee. It obviously took great pleasure in growing. \"But you have to take things slow for a bit, ok buddy? I don't want you growing out of my house in just one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe low groaning took over the bubbling this time, as if expressing a hint of sadness, but no aggression whatsoever. Looking on it with pity, you tried to comfort it while laughing a bit, \"Hey, come on, don't be like that, you'll have plenty of room to grow once we find you a new place. But you're going to need a name....how bout, Bessy?\" A huge gurgling noise of disgust took hold, it clearly didn't take too kindly to a feminine name. \"Ok...how bout.....Rex?\" Bubbling again, you figured correctly that it or \"he\" enjoyed the new designation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you sincerely took into account just how huge \"Rex\" was now. And you knew just the place to help him grow without worrying about escaping into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were massive, and stretched across every inch of the city. There was plenty of things for him to absorb down there, and he could grow for quite a while before.....well....you didn't want to think about him becoming city sized just yet, though it did catch your interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you had a choice to make.</span></div></div>",

Scared as you were, you couldn't shake that faint feeling of enjoyment, it actually felt good watching this creature quickly outgrow you and dwarf you in sheer mass and size. Your heart skipped a few beats as you started to imagine the true possibilities of its growth, if it's desire to grow was sparked with this ferocity just by absorbing a few seconds of sunlight, imagine how monstrously huge it would get if it stayed in the light for w few minutes? A few hours? Dare you say it, allow it to absorb everyth---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you went again, trailing off inside your head, only to be interrupted by the pleasant groaning of your gigantic friend. Even though \"his\" growth had subsided, for now, it was quite clear that he was enjoying every second of his new-found size. The groans got slightly deeper and deeper as Rex shifted its body around the first floor of your house. You had almost forgotten the fact that he now occupied your ENTIRE first floor. Like before, the creature started to extend itself to hug you, and you were almost crushed against the wall by Rex, feeling the massive alien attempt to display its affection towards you. However, the pressure grew lighter, and you regained your breath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to lean your way past your giant friend, and as far as you could see there was green. Just green. His green gelatinous yet somewhat solid mass had filled your first floor, and his groaning proved he was well aware of that as well. You gave in to the increasing groans, \"Hey. buddy. You feel like growing just a bit more? I got some more stuff upstairs.\" You almost lost your balance as the groaning nearly shook the house following your statement. Squeezing past Rex's body, you started up the stairs, followed by a thin tentacle jutting off of Rex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second floor of your house was roughly the same size as your first. It had another bedroom, bathroom, a storage area, exercise room, and an office for your computer. You opened the door to the bedroom, and breathed heavily before allowing the thin, extending tentacle to move its way in. \"Now buddy, remember, I want you to stay IN the house, ok?\" And just like that, the tentacle shot itself forward with ungodly speed, and latched itself to a nearby lamp. You watched in amazement as it was quickly consumed by the thin tentacle, which started to shift and widen. It groaned as it expanded and thickened. The tentacle, which was no thinner than your Ipod's earbuds, was now as thick as your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shifted, absorbing your cups and clocks on the nightstand, and then the nightstand itself. Groaning as more itself came into existence, the tentacle was twice the width of your thigh, but the groaning suddenly grew louder. You didn't understand your situation until you were nearly knocked on your face when more of Rex poured into the room from downstairs, impatient to grow bigger. You quickly darted out of the room as its contents were completely absorbed, and more of Rex simply expanded into the hallway, dwarfing you even more with his size and power. Rex seemed to be in pure bliss, his desire to grow was insatiable. You watched with a hidden smirk as he poured and shifted himself to the other rooms, each one expanding him even more than the last. groaning more and more, GROWING more and more, until you were finally pushed against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was official, Rex had literally eaten you out of house and home. and the groaning was returned to its previous, low, rising state. You couldn't help but smile at the fact that in less than a day, Rex had not only been no bigger than your sock, but had also outgrown both you, your room, and now, your entire house! The house creaked as Rex's enormous body shifted and repositioned itself. You barely managed to squeeze yourself back downstairs, when something caught your eye. The window no longer shined with beams of light. Duh! It was nighttime! All this growing must have caused you to lose track of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew Rex wouldn't be able to last long in your cramped house now. And nighttime was perhaps the only way of moving him carefully. You quickly remembered your plan. Move him into the sewers, and set up your own little \"home\" there. He could grow quite a....\"bit\", you thought. But, given the fact he was able to absorb everything in your home (and would probably absorbed it too if you hadn't stopped him), the sewer would only be a temporary residence at best. In fact, you knew it would only be a matter of time until Rex outgrew even the pla---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and went back to the task at hand. \"Hey! Come on buddy, it's time I show you a new place we can stay.\" You opened the door after struggling past Rex, and urged him to follow you. The house creaked and moaned as Rex slowly emptied himself from the structure. You watched as he slowly exited the building. At first, you could only see a door sized amount of him, then a car sized. Then a pool sized, until finally the house-sized blob was in full view, and you were....scared to see just how big he really was now. You gulped, but smiled. You knew just how much Rex adores you. Afterall, YOU were the person who helped him get this big in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sewers were vast and magnificent. You used to play down there when you were a child, crossing the city underground using the labyrinth-like maze to get from one end of the city to the other. In fact, you had an old fort you built using your old treehouse deep within the sewer itself. You could let Rex grow as much as he wanted, and you could finally get some sleep. You didn't know how long it would take him to outgrow your new \"home\", but it would be a start. Although you didn't take into account just how insatiable Rex really was.....</span></div></div>",

You begin to walk briskly to where the entrance of the sewers was located, the house sized mass of green slime following behind you. Rex gurgled and groaned every so often, clearly wanting to absorb everything in sight, but keeping its growth-lust in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of walking, you come to the entrance to the sewers. It was a huge tunnel of corrugated metal embedded into the side of a hill, far away from the nearest houses; just inside a minor forest, with several corridors leading into the maintenance tunnels. Turning back to Rex, you watch the slime fidget slightly, and decide to humour him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Rex, I guess you can have a couple of the trees, Just don't go overboard again.\" You say to the slime, who groans and bubbles before hugging you with two slimy tentacles that quickly retract into his...her...its body, before turning its attention to the trees, seemingly picking out which ones to absorb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex uses his green bulk to push you away slightly, and moves towards a particular tree in the sea of foliage. He uses two slime tentacles to surround the base of the tree before absorbing it, allowing it to fall onto his green body like a rather ravenous pillow, before he absorbs all of it, moving onto the next tree, and then the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex's groaning is louder than ever, the creature clearly in a state of bliss.

Less than 24 hours ago, this...thing was only roughly the size of a bean bag. And now? It was bigger than your house! And you knew, deep down, that Rex would only want to keep getting bigger and bigger, and you didn't know how long it would be until he would just give in to his growth lust and start absorbing everything in sight. Though you had to admit, it was rather thrilling watching him slowly dwarf you. The sheer mass of Rex was outstanding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud gurgling and groaning finally tuned down, and by the grace of God, Rex seemed content with the few trees. Gesturing nervously to the entrance, you watched as the mammoth slime slowly approached you, filling your entire vision. At first you thought it was coming for you next, that he had somehow discarded you as a friend, that he was a...monster. But...no....as the titanic slime approached it just simply began forcing its ungodly frame into the entrance. and you followed in suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sewers were vast and long. They ran the entire length of the city. And best of all, they had plenty of materials to keep Rex....busy. You thought it would take a while for Rex to be able to, literally, \"fill up\" the sewers, but, given how quickly he outgrew your home, you were starting to have doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice was shaky this time, nervous as you spoke, \"W-w-w-ell R-r-ex.....we h-h-h-ere.

The Slime had absorbed most of the still water, and had begun to grow long, slimy, tentacles that snaked into multiple pipes, absorbing the flowing contents within and only further fuelling Rex's growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlreadytouching the ceiling with most of his green bulk, Rex begins to grow outwards, into other tunnels... And towards you! You can think of nothing that could help you as the ceiling-high wall of slime advances upon you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd expands safely around you, leaving a large gap for you. While you are thankful to Rex for leaving you room, you have no idea how big he's getting. A thunderous groan sounds from one of the other tunnels, maybe some twelve metres away. It is then joined by another, and another, and another, until the entire sewer shakes with the sheer noise of Rex's growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex starts to absorb the tunnel wall behind you, allowing you more space as he shifts backwards slightly. The groaning noises cease almost immediately, and you guess, as well as hope, that Rex's growth has halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Rex uses two thick slime tentacles to hug you to its bulk, but for some reason, despite hugging you tighter and tighter every second, you feel no discomfort from it at all, even though the pressure being exerted should have powderized your bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex begins to bubble again, obviously pleased beyond measure with his latest spurt. Judging by how long he'd been growing for, and at such a rate, he had to be under a fair portion of the city at this point, which would make him several hundred feet tall, if he hadn't already ballooned into the thousands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex lets go of you and you slide down him onto the floor.

Whatever was coming was getting nearer and nearer. That was it, the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel something looming over her. She was terrified. Just when she was sure then next thing she would feel would be her exoskeleton being cracked open and her insides digested the beast spoke, \"I'm stopping you because your about to do something as awful as it accidental. If you understand this tell me and I'll unstick you, explain what's happening and make it so the bad thing can't happen.

She decided so give it shot, if she didn't she was doomed anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm spider, I'll like to be let out,\" asked the mosquito timidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider came over and unwrapped the mosquito and ate all the sticky silk around it. Then the spider grew from 1 inches across to 1 and half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you seem to have broke a wing, I but that a split first,\" said the spider as it did so it then grew again to 2 inches across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why are you growing,\" asked the mosquito. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know they deeper 'why' of it but I know the cause. 9 days ago now a meteor exploded in earth atmosphere. It was a alien supercomputer or something, people way smarter then me are still trying to find out. When that happened a smaller fraction of all animal, regardless of species were suddenly uplifted to sapience. Fortunately we can all talk to each other and to the humans too. Another effect of it is that when one of those uplifted animals does a good need they grow bigger. I was only a half of Millimetre across when I was uplifted. I've been doing since then what I didn't know I was doing before. Stopping you Mosquitos from giving humans a horrible disease,\" explained the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't planning on doing anything like that, I just wanted a little bit of blood for my babies,\" protested Marina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure of that, but malaria don't care about you intentions. If you have it, which you probably do, it you bite that human there get it to, they get sick and they might die,\" further explained the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I've bit humans before, even a couple after I was uplifted, could I have made them sick?\" asked Marina desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a chance, but even it you did they probably won't die, it still be awful but they'll probably live,\" reassured the spider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I might have killed someone?\" checked Marina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I completely unfair but yes,\" confirmed the spider. \"But what's important is what you do now. Fortunately you don't need blood to live just to lay ridiculous amounts of eggs. So abstain for that for now. But there is a more permanent solution, be can cure you and at the same time help wipe out the disease completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all rather complicated, but first I have to take you to a human. Do climb on my back I'll get you past my non sapient brothers, sisters and cousins so me can call that human\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mosquito climbs on the spiders back and they move off. </span></div></div>",

The whole point of the society was to find non human sapience, meet it and make friends with it. The society was willing to explore any options to find or make this sapience, interstellar travel, dimensional portals, time travel, robotics or massive genetic engineering. As of yet now of their ideas had Bourne fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe things brought up by the speakers so far were either purely theoretical, very very unlikely or would take decades of technological advancement at best. The next speaker started to talk about octopuses and about how they were possibly the closest non human animal on earth to sapience. They had tool use, they had something close to language, they could learn. The only thing holding them back was there very short life spans of just 2 or 3 years. The speaker had found a few relatively small genetic changes that would, hopefully, increase their life spans to near humans levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was soon agreed to fund this project. They would start with just a single octopus, the genetic change would be made in the egg and it would be raised with humans from then on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would soon discovered that the octopus would just keep growing with no upper limit on size. As it increased in size it would also grow smarter and friendlier. </span></div></div>",

You walk over to the eagle, who is looking at the ground in a slightly depressed manner, and begin to absent mindedly rub you hand through the feathers on her belly, before electing to simply full on hug her.

As she approaches the raptor's height of fifty feet tall she looks excited to have finally grown taller than her again, which she does very quickly. Her growth rate skyrockets and she quickly jumps to seventy feet tall, then ninety feel tall, and then to the giraffe's height of one hundred feet tall, which only makes the already joyous eagle even happier. She reaches one hundred and twenty five feet in no time, when her growth abruptly stops. The eagle bends over as her whole body vibrates, and she lurches upwards as she almost instantly grows to two hundred feet tall, then three hundred feet tall, and then five hundred feet tall. The eagle's grown continues to power her up, smashing through the one thousand foot mark, then forcing her body to double in size and making another five hundred feet leap on, and finally stopping her growth at two thousand five hundred feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle looks down at you with nothing but happiness, as you wonder which of your friends will grow next, you gaze up at the titanic avian, who uses her wings to lift you up and place you on top of her head, where she allows you to stroke her feathers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Then, it happens: the orca begins to balloon out bigger and longer and heavier, its smoothly-slick sides pumping out into the eagle and raptor, the tail flowing underneath the enormous giraffe's legs; it fills that space, until the growing giraffe finds its front digits sliding up off the firmament, even as she grows along with the others! The eagle caws gleefully, closing its eyes as it rockets larger, taking to levels of air that no other avian could ever manage, at over 3,000 feet tall, then 4,000, then 5,000; the raptor presses herself into the orca's inflating bulk, rubbing into it with a loud huff through the nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still ride the raptor's growing toe, clinging tight, as the single digit alone lifts you so high up you can see the neighborhood below with ease! At 1 mile in size, the eagle bulges out in girth, flapping her wings approvingly, before she lurches inward and surges up to quadruple that stature, soaring with a joyful screech to over 8 miles in height! The lower clouds play around her ponderous feathers, each tingling not in the breeze, but from the tingling of her growth-soaked body; the giraffe swells up from behind the orca, her neck so long that she can look over the mass of growing fauna, before she, the orca, and the eagle all glance over at the raptor: she shudders worse than all of them, and it's getting more and more intense, even though her 10-mile size matches theirs, all of them towering well above the clouds! But why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clinging to the raptor, you soon realize, constitutes a hug, and a huge, prolonged one, at that!

Even at 10 miles in height, all of them are pushed back by the contours of her shuddering growth; the female reptile lets her tongue flop out cutely, bursting up to 15 miles, then 17, then 22, then 30, triple the size of the others!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing of it is, the bigger she grows, the more you and the other animals find themselves reflexively clutching her inflating sides--meaning all of them and you are hugging her even tighter, more and more growth flooding into her 50-mile tall frame!

The planet shrinks until it matches her staggering size, the stupendously big, evergrowing dinosaur roaring into space impossibly, before the entire planet's population gives in and hugs her tightly, making her tremble and DOUBLE in size, snugging the beachball-sized planet to herself triumphantly. She snorts and nips the moon in her jaws, playing with it, her tongue getting stuck to the colder surface--she blinks at this, then closes her jaws and simply sucks on it until it wears away like candy. She gulps the last bit down and purrs, nosing curiously over on Mars as she grows faster; it barely registers against her body's exploding size, but she likes snuffling on it anyway, blowing it away unharmed as she does so.

If it was wrong to grow like this, why was everyone snugging up to her? Deciding she wasn't about to stop what was so nice, she opened her mouth wide, and closed it again, first to show her many, many enormous teeth, and then, the snort out through her nostrils, blasting half the armada back comically; incensed, the mothership rallies the spiraling pawn-ships back towards formation with its magnetic field emission; opening more laser portholes to answer the gigantically vast female's insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a feral \"hmmph\" of sorts, the raptor turns her head away, only to feel a sudden sting, as thousands of little beams let loose on her cheek and neck; they really don't seem to do much, until the mothership's main cannon hums ominously, the tip of the cannon heating up, before a far larger, wider blast is loosed, the beam so big it actually slams into the female reptile, knocking her immeasurably huge body back a relative inch. Emboldened that their technology can move even such a fantastically godlike creature back at all, they continue blasting away at her; further down on her body, and free of the ray's contact, you and the other giga-animals all stare in shock and concern, hoping this isn't the end of your biggest friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten seconds, you already know it's not even the end, but the beginning--the beginning of something HUGE. The raptor groans and roars like a monster, the sounds all defying the laws of space all the more than before, and as you see her impossibly big muzzle stay closed, you gulp, realizing that her spurt is about to be so big that those roars are just her BODY getting ready to burst bigger. And burst she does, as the aliens begin to back away, putting their vessels in panicked reverse, as the raptor bellows and swells all over, bulging so, so big that her chest alone rushes out to greet the armada, slamming into and pummeling nearly all of the minor ones, pilots all beaming back home before they suffer for the damage she causes just by floating there and exploding bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and BIGGER, AND BIIIGGGERRR!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n80,000,000 miles suddenly seems laughable; she might as well have stayed big as a mere building or skyscraper back<br>\r\non Earth; with the first spurt she boomed out to over 5 times that size, then with a happy growl she expanded out to 8 times that new amount, which then swelled uncontrollably out to 12 times that new size, stacking the growth in such a stupefying manner that you and the others have to hold on tight to stay on her, which still makes her 40,000,000,000-mile body grow all the larger, showing no signs of slowing down whatsoever; her jaws hang open as she huffs happily, her tongue lolling out adorably; with her huffing, she pulls in the entire remainder of the poor little armada, the commanders and leader at the helm panicking, and firing the laser again and again to try getting away, all as she clamps her jaws over them and a good chunk of the galaxy; gulping them down unharmed as they keep firing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another few seconds, she begins to tingle so much that the faraway Sun begins to wiggle around fearfully, as the raptor hugs herself in joy, awash in inside-growth-beams, her toes curling as she b-b-b..b-b-BELLLOOOOWS, roaring out into the heavens, exploding to her very first light-year in size, then 5 light years...14 ly...25ly...60ly...110ly!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBillions of billions of miles flood into her body per second as she snuggles her own growing mass quite gleefully; it just felt so good!

You, the giga-orca and giraffe all wait far, far down below on her lap, looking neck-breakingly far up at the sad sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ratpor's muzzle gets fluffed by a growing mound of feathers, all tingling and bristling and wobbling eerily; the eagle's beak opens, and she chirps weakly, before shuddering hard, squawking louder, and shuddering even harder, then letting loose piercing CAW as she rumbles and bursts hugely up in size, closing her eyes and racing bigger in the raptor's loving grip; the wings and feet and tail all pour out of the reptile's arms, growing longer and larger and wider, still, as her body pumps fantastically in mass! In moments she's half the size of the raptor, then three-fourths, then just as big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcstatic, the raptor hugs her friend sweetly, making the eagle cry out and DECTUPLE furiously in size, growing and growing and growing, now nearly one billion miles in size, remaining teeny planetoids and moons beginning to orbit her obediently, only for most to get stuck in her feathers here and there. The sheer wall of her growing body crashes into the ship, dashing it apart in a fantastic spray of explosions and construct--though really, it isn't even half of a blip to the eagle, who bends her head down and stroke-strokes her chin over the head of the now-finally-smaller raptor, though the affection is beginning to soak into her as well, and she begins swelling gorgeously against her avian pal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait--there's no time for that! A ship about the size of the raptor's entire head beams into their area, loosing thousands of smaller, gnat-like ships--an armada! The loss of one ship has brought the entire army here, and they, unaware of how the last ship was dispatched, begin to ready all their lasers at once, aiming right for the bird of lizard that are starting to fill the galaxy...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Original author: TheCrimsonFreak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go again.\" It's all you can think of saying as the new armada of alien ships opens fire. It's cliche, but nothing else seems to fit this insanity. You almost feel sorry for the aliens; poor saps have no idea what they're in for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Almost.</i> They WERE trying to blow up your newest friends, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, white-hot beams of plasma erupt from the alien fleet towards the Brogdinagian-scale eagle and raptor like a swarm of shooting stars. The alien flagship (the only one that DOESN'T seem less than a speck in comparison) cuts loose with an incredible volume of fire, the starship firing so many beams that you and the other giga-critters have to look away from the lights!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the galaxy-filling dinosaur and her equally big avian friend? They simply share a look...and smile devilshly. How the eagle manages to smirk with a beak, you don't know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the salvo of lasers strikes, the two creatures start nuzzling, the eagle wrapping her wings around the raptor in an adorable hug. The raptor gives a playful roar as the fleet's attack hits her first, kicking off another round of cosmic growth! The dinosaur magnifies exponentially, going beyond her billions of miles in size into light years in scale! Comets smash into ice cubes against her scaly hide, and one unlucky star even goes supernova as her planet-sized tail smashes into it! All the while, she lets out a playful hiss...that actually sounds like she's laughing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a few seconds later, the eagle is struck...and this time, there's no sign of pain or fear about the avian, as she too balloons toward an equal scale with the raptor. As she grows, a few more nearby asteroids enter orbit around the astral-scale avian. A nebula is even swept away by physics-defying wind produced by her giddy wingbeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their growth tapers off, both creatures are at the scale of GODS, easily SEVERAL DOZEN lightyears each. The eagle's wingspan has to be half the length of the Milky Way's spiral arms, if not equal size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the unfortunate aliens? Well, they were now facing not one, but TWO impossibly huge foes, who only got bigger when fired on, AND were now looming over their insignificant fleet like a pair of mischievous goddesses. (Which, in a loose sense, they were.) And they were both wearing devilish grins of cosmic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the raptor's mouth was open, showing every one of her planet-sized fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the alien ships beat a hasty retreat, reversing course and speeding away towards a destination known as \"The Heck Out Of Here!\"<br>\r\nNot that it was of any use, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCutting loose with a playful CAW, the eagle flies out in front of the fleeing aliens and cuts off their line of retreat. The ships at the head of the formation crash helplessly into a feathery wall, exploding like little firecrackers against her bulk; their debris getting tangled in her feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next ships attempt evasive maneuvers, but find themselves literally blown off-course as she flaps her wings-once, twice, three times-creating a physics-defying gust that sends her unfortunate foes carreening off into the void...or crashing into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaves the massive flagship--once as big as the raptor's head, now barely bigger than a gumball for her--and its escorts. The eagle lowers her head, looking like she's going to ram the aliens...<br>\r\nBut a sudden roar from the raptor stops her. Snapping your gaze towards the dinosaur, you see her smirk, then swing her tail. Looking back to the eagle, you see the avian mimic her comrade's grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a burst of speed, the eagle charges the remaining alien ships head-on, closing the distance of several million miles in two seconds. Before the aliens can react, she pivots in mid-flight and snatches the flagship in her talons, then chucks it towards the raptor! The smaller ships are also sent that way, by way of another wing-flap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break out in a cheer as the alien ships fly uncontolably towards the waiting raptor. With a smirk and--you can't believe it--a wink at the eagle, she raises her tail and SWATS the alien ships tossed towards her, like tennis balls, back towards the eagle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho waits with her beak wide open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but cheer yet again, this time joined by the orca and giraffe, as the last alien ships fly right into the eagle's maw. The bird snaps her beak closed, gulping the ships down like candy! She rubs her stomach with a wing, clearly liking the snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive, star-shaking roar bellows from the raptor, soon accompanied by an equally thunderous eagle-cry as both cosmically immense critters celebrate getting rid of the attackers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what happens next,\" you wonder out loud, idly petting the orca. \"Doubt it could get crazier than this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, speaking of which, something new was happening...but what?</span></div></div>",

They were shooting at us, and after we finally get rid of those pesky aliens, you want even more to show up? I think you enjoyed this a little TOO much, friend. And why did you EAT the poor devils?

Some would say it was just like any other birthday gift, like any other stuffed animal that a child may play with as an imaginary friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Jacob, the bear was very special. It had been the very first stuffed animal that he had gotten, at least according to his memory, and he had loved it to death ever since. Jacob would take the stuffed polar bear, which he named Ben, everywhere he went: on walks, bike rides, family picnics, and even to school inside his backpack. Today was especially important since it was the 3rd anniversary of the inseparable duo being childhood best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8-year-old Jacob of course had a full day planned with his best friend Ben, and the two spent the morning and afternoon going to the arcade, eating at a nice restaurant along with his parents, and then going to see the new animated film at the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time to say good night to his soft and fluffy polar bear, he rolled over in his bed, hugging the bear tightly and soon drifting off to sleep.

The stuffed animal began to expand, inch by inch, in Jacob's arms, and was soon 2 feet tall, twice its original size. Soon it was too big for Jacob to hold, and although he didn't feel it, the bear had slipped away from his arms and was gradually growing bigger and bigger beside him on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still the boy continued to sleep as if nothing was out of the ordinary, probably dreaming about random events and blissfully unaware that his favorite stuffed bear was growing bigger and bigger and bigger before him. Ben continued to slowly take up more and more space on the mattress and was soon bigger than it laying on his side. Before being able to push Jacob off of his own bed, however, the polar bear fell down to the ground softly and resumed its gradual growth throughout the rest of the night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob yawned widely as he woke up, stretching his arms and shifting around. He quickly realized something was wrong, however, and looked wildly around for Ben. This didn't take long at all. The boys eyes grew wide and stared in disbelief at what he saw beside his bed. There lay the fuzzy form of his best friend, yet he was absolutely huge! He was almost twice as tall as his bed and one-and-a-half times the size of it altogether!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly scared of what had happened to the bear when he was asleep, Jacob thought quickly and decided it was best to get the massive stuffed polar bear out of his room until he could think of something further to do.

His best friend Ben was almost surpassing two hundred feet tall while lying down, and was on the edge of outgrowing the entire neighborhood! His rate of growth was unbelievable! As the polar bear continued to steadily grow and grow, bigger and bigger and BIGGER still, Jacob found himself sinking further and further down into his cushiony stomach and could no longer see just how far they were rising into the sky. With a little bit of effort he was able to climb out of the pit and find a bit more stable spot on the expansive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jacob could ever know what if felt like to be a mountaineer that reached the top of a snowy peak, this would be it. On his mountain of white, he could only see the sloping fields of pure white around him and the clear blue sky above. He peered off into the distance above the fluff and gasped: The houses were only getting smaller and smaller around Ben's titanic form. He must have been over three hundred and fifty feet tall now while still on his back! As Jacob's mind raced he felt the firm vibrations continually under his feet as Ben swelled bigger and BIGGER, until suddenly---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO, MASTER!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob is caught off guard so much that he falls back into the fluffiness before quickly getting back up onto his feet again, staring around for the source of the huge outburst. He immediately saw the immense face of Ben peering over him, his face lit up brightly dozens of feet above him with a huge stitched smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B..Ben? Is that you? What happened to you!? Why are you growing so big!?...And how can you talk!?!\" Jacob demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHE, IT'S OKAY MASTER, IT'S OKAY!\" Ben reassures, his voice booming across the neighborhood in a deep, masculine voice, which was a little disconcerting due to his kind-natured face. \"I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'VE LOVED ME OVER THE YEARS, AND I'VE LOVED YOU TOO! LOOKS LIKE YOUR LOVE HAS FINALLY REAWAKEN ME AND MY POWERS! WHAT DO YOU THINK, MASTER JACOB? LIKE THE NEW ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only stand there, mouth gape at the huge polar bear. For a wild moment you think that you must still be dreaming, but there is your best friend clear as day, only now he has grown into a mountain of a bear, and with no signs of stopping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT I'M NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING DONE GROWING YET! I STILL HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO SHOW YOU! ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU MY NEXT TRICK...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's face begins to transform, and slowly but surely it becomes the face of a real-life male polar bear as the button eyes are replaced with real ones, the stitched smile turns into real bear lips, and his snout begins to expand and form the realistic shape of a muzzle. The fuzzy ground beneath you also quickly changes into real yet still soft white fur. Ben continues to smile down at you fondly and you can still only gape at his transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL JACOB, ALL I CAN SAY NOW IS: PREPARE FOR THE RIDE OF YOUR LIFE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you are hoisted up into the air in his paw and placed upon his huge snout as he rolls over to stand on his four legs, surprisingly not doing any damage to the multiple streets and homes that his huge paws cover. You stare up into his gigantic eyes as he closes them a bit and the trembling beneath you starts again, only much more massive this time. Although you can't see it Ben's tongue lolls out of his mouth as he enjoys the sensations of growing exponentially bigger, his tiny master and best friend getting smaller and smaller and smaller upon his snout. Four hundred feet....Five hundred fifty feet....Seven hundred...One thousand feet tall!...The polar bear just continues to grow higher and higher and HIGHER into the light blue sky, his paws gently and harmlessly expanding over multiple neighborhoods and blocks at this point as his body swells larger and larger... </span></div></div>",

The front half, stuck in the cavern with you, takes up your entire view; the parental drive is so overwhelming that you find you're already nuzzling up and down on the big tyke's lengthy beak, eliciting a soft but happy coo from the pterodactyl. It's not so bad, really--it is awfully cute, and you kind of like the idea of your child being the biggest of the big! Seems fitting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of 'fitting', the cavern won't do much longer, as due to your nuzzling, a ripply quaking begins deep inside the young'n, getting stronger and stronger, as it closes its big eyes and chirps loudly, before lowering its head against yours and <b><i>bwhoooping</i></b> bigger and bigger, every shuddery breath seeming to pump the beastie larger still! The cavern opening creaks and whines as its edges begin crackling, then crumbling away in clustered chunks; outside, other dinosaurs begin to crowd around the billowing behind, as it bulges up and up, then pussshes firmly out and out, a tiny reptilian tail waggling in joy overhead; they step further and further away, as soon as they gathered, gaping and wide-eyed at the massively growing, 70-foot, ballooning pterodactyl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grows and grows, its long snout rubbing against your entire body, as the growth spurts force the baby dino deeper into the cave, and thus, into you; but wait, you realize the tingling is getting even worse! Does its contact with you still count? The cave relents, as a single jagged fissure forms from the top of the entrance, crackling up and up and up along the mountainside housing it, until, with a furiously loud groan and crumbling sound, the baby dinosaur inflates too big to hold, bashing up and out of the rock facade as it simply sits upright, its head shaking as it blinks and takes in the surroundings, sitting down at over 110 feet tall, many times even your huge size! You don't really know how to feel: are you embarrassed at being this much smaller...or is it even more thrilling to be in charge of such a stupendous hatchling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder, you hear a loud growl from its belly--it just hatched and all, surely it must be hungry...</span></div></div>",

It smiles, more than happy to have you near, as you put your head right up against its belly, gently as you can manage, for a carnivore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen as the rumbling grows worse, a sudden nervous pang racing through you; your gut tells you to back up, but your feet are already sliding back and away on their own! It's his belly, you realize, which balloons out wider and wider, along with the rest of its body--it's growing again!! You gulp and skid back over the turf, as you stare up to see the pterodactyl's smiling beak rise higher and higher up into the air, the baby flapping its wings giddily, clicking its beak as it swells up another 30 feet! Could even that light touch have been countable as a nuzzling, like earlier!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant bends down and scoops your huge self up with some relative ease, giving you a long squeeze as it caws and rubs its smooth beak against your neck and head, as you feel its hide tingling more and more--oh, this is bad! Very bad! You wiggle around uselessly, feeling its arms surge bigger against you, the beak lengthening out longer and thicker as the baby shudders and hiccups 40 feet taller, in one hot, rude spurt, then lurching up another 60 after that! Higher and higher the infant dino surges and shivers, the treetops all crackling as its sheer increasing girth pushes them back dominantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally slip free, sliding far down its stomach, and tumbling clumsily to a roll onto the ground; shaking the impact and embarrassment off, you look up to see the 250-foot colossus, ten times your own proud size, and only minutes old! It dips back down to nuzzle you again, nowhere near done with its first display of a child's affection, when you put out both arms to signal for it to hold on and stay put. You growl, but in a caring way, as it were, motioning for it to sit still and behave, like a good kid. You've no idea what to do next, any contact could grow the kid even more enormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tyke rubs its own belly as it growls, and this time you're certain it's a matter of food--you think--probably!</span></div></div>",

It caws gently, instinctively flapping its monstrously huge wings, kicking up small gales all over down below as it tries to mimic what it watches; you suddenly are forced to hang on tight to its thick neck scales as it gets the hang of things, and amazingly manages to start flapping enough to get some lift going; it takes to what's left of the sky it isn't filling up, and forces reality to further bend to its whims as it gets higher and higher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot built for flight, you panic and hang on tight as you can, the infant cooing some poorly-laid comforts as it pushes itself higher still, actually gaining quite a distance from the ground, even with its fantastic body weight; higher and higher it gets, other pterodactyls going berserk at the sight of a mile-tall family cousin flapping around them, its wind shears caused by its flight sending the other pterodactyls into an uncontrolled tailspin; irritated, several others peck at the infant's head; being such a colossus, the baby isn't at all close to hurt, but the surprise causes it to lose its concentration, and with that gone, the gargantuan tyke is now the one who begins to sputter out in mid-air!

Looking upwards at your face and understanding the reaction that she had caused, she gently nuzzles your chest, snapping you out of your confusion.

For a second, you could have sworn you heard a quiet squeak behind you, but you put it out of your mind as you crawl over to the wall socket, pump in hand, and switch the supply of power off before yanking out the power cord for the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been quite a while since you had taken Nixie out of the closet and inflated 'her' - far too long, in fact. Picking up the pump and wrapping the power cord around it, you hear another squeak from behind you, this time loud enough so as to be audible. Confusion dominating your face, you whirl around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNixie, being an inflatable toy, shouldn't have been able to do anything, really, seeing as how inflatable toys aren't exactly alive. But there she was, her fiery tail gently swishing about; her head turning this was and take to allow her eyes to somehow take in her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, your jaw drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNixie, having completed her brief survey of her environment, trots over to you, her four foot body creaking and squeaking slightly as she approached you. Convinced that this was a delusion or hallucination of some kind, you reach out with a single trembling hand, gently prodding Nixie's coal-black sides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And actually feeling the PVC that she was made of relent ever so slightly to your fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, this was real, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down next to Nixie, you hold you head in your hand, rubbing at your temples. How? and Why? were the two main questions that your brain was trying - and failing - to come up with answers for. Nixie gently nuzzles your chest, directing your attention back to her as she presents her squeaky body for petting. Rubbing the side of her muzzle, you smile as the inflatable Nightmare leans into your hand, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarts to <i>GROW?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNixie gently swells larger, her entire body slowly inflating, even without the pump, and with her air valve closed. Rising a few centimetres taller every second, Nixie rubs against you even as she grows larger, the action seeming to quicken the pace at which she grows. The expanding former-toy quickly reaches the height of your chest as you stand up, finding her coming up to your shoulders mere seconds later, the Nightmare continuing to stretch taller and taller, bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching your own height of six foot even, and then surpassing it, Nixie emits a high-pitched squeaking as she finds herself having to bend her neck downwards more and more to maintain eye contact with you. Hugging her neck, you receive a nuzzle in return, providing the inflatable with what she wants more than anything else: affection - and with it, size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to blow up larger, Nixie noses down on your head and shoulders before returning her head to its normal upright position, feeling it bump the ceiling ever so slightly, before pressing into it. Leaning her head downwards, Nixie begins to fill the room up as her neck, and then her back, presses firmly against the ceiling; her rump pushes against the wall; her sides continually roll outwards; her silver hooves smother more and more of the carpet underneath themselves; and her muzzle gently pushed into you, the inflatable horse nuzzling you even as she grows ever larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer inflation seeming to finally halt, Nixie nickers loudly as her massive body presses into all four sides of the room, barely leaving you enough room to sit down, let alone stand up! Sitting down underneath Nixie's massive and midnight-black body that seemed to have completely filled most of the room, you give her stomach a short rub, hearing the latex squeak as you do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a thought enters your head. Was there enough space for you to be able to even get out of the room? Granted, you didn't feel hungry, and the thought of spending the night being kept warm and cosy by your favourite inflatable toy was rather appealing, but you had to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling forward, your back rubbing Nixie the entire way, you manage to make your way to where the door was being smooshed by Nixie's entire leg, the silver hoof covering a large area of the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nixie could move enough, you'd be able to get out of the room and return later, maybe with some blankets and a pillow so you could spend the night with your Nightmare, but if there wasn't you'd be stuck in here with the massive balloon horse until you could shrink her to a mod manageable size... Or she outgrew the room entirely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there enough space for you to get out of the room?</span></div></div>",

You quickly turn around though and look up to her ponderous head and muzzle \"Don't worry girl I will be back quick. I am just going to get me a pillow, blankets, and some food to make things more comfortable for me\" If an inflatable horse could frown she would as if Nixie was thinking \"Aren't I comfortable enough for you\" but relucantly relates to your going, somehow moving her leg a few more centimeters away from the door, in which you slide your way out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside the room though you take stock of your situation.

You ponder these things while going downstairs to get the extra pillows and blankets from the laundry room while stopping in the kitchen to grab a few things out of the fridge to eat and drink.

As in in reply, the walls of said room, not to mention the entirety of the second story, all begin to moan, groaning and whining as Nixie's thick latex hide presses more and more into them, a soft, cute whinnying being muffled between walls. You push and push, panting from exertion, which seems to only excite the loving inflatable horse all the more, as you feel her hoof slowly inflate all the larger, pushing you down the stairs one awkward step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you're forced back, the more you can hear the walls warping up above, a few stray cracks starting to dance nervously about the ceiling to the first floor (which, upon landing on your rear at the bottom of the stairs, you can see for yourself all too well). Staying seated on the panel-wood flooring, you reflexively scoot back more, watching as the hoof and leg blows up and up, the underside pinching in against the rail and walls to the stairs, before making them crackle and shatter, the rubber digit exploding massively in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting onto your feet, you scramble back and around the living room, just as a great, big muzzle bursts down through the ceiling, a snorted rush of air blowing the rug away, and making the lamps topple over. A loud crash fills the rumbling house, and you wobble your way over to the dining room, to see Nixie's soft, smooth belly bulging down through the drywall, pushing loose pipes and spraying dust as it only swells larger, pushing down onto and crushing the dining room table against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, Nixie, you can stop! Please stop, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a gentle puff of air coming back from the living room; reentering it, you find Nixie's muzzle has grown just shy of the floor. Gadzooks, she must have been thirty feet! Likely, most of it was still somewhat compressed by the walls, but there was just no telling how long they would hold that much rumbling rubber bulk steady.

Pushing yourself back into a sitting position, your head bumping into Nixie's underbelly, you wonder what you are going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you begin to feel the slight thirst and hunger that had begun to develop fade away, as if your needs were somehow being switched off. Hearing Nixie's muffled nickering from where her massive head was smooshed against the wall, you give her belly a soft rub, now having to lie flat on your back due to the inflatable mares slow growth, as there was literally not enough room for you to sit up. As Nixie slowly inflated, filling the last few spaces in the room, her onyx belly begins to press into you, pinning you to the floor while keeping you warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNixie's gentle yet loud nickering can be heard, even as she completely fills up the room, her massively overinflated body leaving not an inch of space as she exerted pressure on all four walls, the ceiling, and the floor, small cracks beginning to form in all six. Nixie was a smart Nightmare, and she knew the the only way for either of you to exit the room would be for her to grow so large that her size would break one of the walls enough so that you could slip out, and she force her bulk through the hole until it widened to allow her entire body through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this would take time, Nixie seemed to have somehow nullified all of your biological needs, including breathing, as well as somehow making you immune to the tremendous pressure her latex body was putting on the walls. Feeling her body bulge ever so slightly larger against the subtly straining walls, Nixie let out a nicker that was muffled by her own tremendous body, as the inflatable Nightmare weighed her two options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could keep you in here, letting you sleep while pinned by her warm and comfy body, storing her energy for one massive spurt in the morning that would let her outgrow the house itself. This would let her spend time with you, her Owner, whom she absolutely adored, before relocating to a more suitable location once she had outgrown your house. However, Nixie wasn't sure just how large she would grow if she did this due to the amount of energy she would store overnight - she may grow slightly larger than the house, but she could lose control of herself and find herself growing and growing and growing, pumping up and inflating unstoppably larger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Nixie could just simply start growing again, spilling into the other rooms on this floor before filling up the house and bursting out of it. It wouldn't be as exciting, but it would be quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Nixie decided on what to do...</span></div></div>",

Certainly, it IS odd, by nature, if anything natural applied to the situation--but you find it fairly nice, her slight, surprisingly-light weight smooshing down on you, just so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, it's great. Either you're breathing up and down into her bulk, or she's breathing over you, not that it matters. It's a sheer wall of rubbery, smooth heat, and at last, the thought occurs to you, laying there: she might-well get bigger. In fact, you can practically feel it throbbing inside her, like some tension--or more aptly, an excitement, laying under all the calm and warm fullness filling your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drift away, the mass of pure affection atop you does indeed thrum and treble with excitement of her own: Nixie, unable to move so much as a latex muscle, lays there in bliss, as though you were holding her tight, even at her size. As she nods off, her muzzle pressing the walls harmlessly, she can feel it building up in her--building up, and up, and up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the reports and extended forecast before the previous day--cloudy and cold. Yet there's enough faint light filtering in through the blinds to your room to cast a few glowing strips across the contours of Nixie's belly and legs to show you that morning's here, and, as you begin to feel, something else. Something big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little rub under her huge belly, Nixie nickers softly, almost in a giggle, before the pressure sets in, the walls start to groan and warp, and you say your goodbyes to the house; you know what's coming, it only makes its own strange sense. Her belly swells softly but insistently against your entire body, before straining tight, then bursting in a surreal, slow heave, pumping bigger and bigger, rolling and dimpling harder across the floor. Then another push flattens you further, and another, as the door to your room gives, and a growing hoof blasts out through it, tearing the hings away amidst the rumbling tug and pull and stretch of her latex digit. The flooring bends down, down, forming into a curve of wailing paneling and sheared carpet. The pipes crack as she bulges even larger, and larger, her muzzle pushing through the wall and closet, casting clothes off through the next room, her head crashing up into and along the ceiling as she seems to smile wide, and breathe herself even larger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower floor awaits as the one above buckles, crackling wide against a widening span of rubbery belly, forcing you to suddenly clutch away at Nixie's slick tummy, trying not to fall onto your back into the living room. The sensation of your fingers drawing and slipping along her body sends a shiver through you that overrides, amazingly, even the momentary surge of self-preservation coursing through you. The problem amends itself quickly, as she balloons even bigger, and bigger, thumping you into the rug painlessly, before again she inflates larger, rolling over you, the furniture, the TV, the dining room, on and on--the tables smash apart, the walls burst out in all directions, and with a happy neigh, Nixie's now-massive rump crashes out through the back of the house, and loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front side pushes out into a bizarre curve, as you feel her inflation force you into the front door. With a snap and a heave, you see yourself out, tumbling back over the drive as a wall of smoke and powdered drywall settles down around you. Shaking off the relative devastation and all, you blink, straighten up, and take a breath, before doing what you knew you'd do since last night (and, admittedly, had kind of looked forward to): you look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNixie wears the gutted shell of the remaining homestead as though it were a diaper she's already outgrown--literally. She must be sitting at over 50 feet in size! Amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, up there, girl?\" you find yourself asking, still weighed under a sheet of baffled incredulity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to almost smile down at you, and it hits--she's not at all done growing, and she knows it, as evidenced by her rumbling tremble, her skin puffing out tighter and tighter. Finally it delivers, and she roars up bigger, and bigger, her pumping sides pushing the walls that had managed to stand to thud off, before her rubber haunches roll meanly over them, then well-beyond, Nixie nickering and breathing herself larger, and larger, and larger, and larger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a little too long to start backing away through the lawn, as she approaches 80 feet...90 feet...100 feet...110 feet...120 feet...s-she just keeps growing! The fences snap, trees bending, yielding, then breaking, the cars on the sidewalk pushed back as her hooves bulge ever-larger, and larger, growing out on either side of you, her rear bulging over the back yard, looming towards the neighbors' homes. She's amazing! All thoughts of worry, though they exist, are pushed aside--they might as well have been the cars pushed aside by Nixie's surging, squeaking bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n150 feet...170 feet...200 feet...</span></div></div>",

You collect the package from the postman and sign for it, before closing the door. You open the package and gaze at what was inside. An inflatable T-Rex, currently uninflated and folded within a sheet of plastic, along with an air pump entered your field of vision as you tore open the cardboard packaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the information you were provided with about it before you ordered it. It was a green colour, with an near 1:1 scale, and measured in at exactly eight and a half feet tall and twelve feet long from snout to tail. When fully inflated you would reach just over its hips, it was so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unpack it in your bedroom and start pumping air into it until, after roughly five minutes, it is fully inflated. Its was several inches too tall for the ceiling, and you had been forced to bend its neck over slightly so it could stand up. Suddenly, a thought occurs to you, and you lay it down on its side, where there is more than enough room. You lay on its side, the green surface squeaking at your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the green PVC stretch and, oddly, tingle slightly as you lay down on it, and begin to drift into sleep...</span></div></div>",

Your inflatable T-Rex was now so large that, laying down on its side, it was half the height of the room you were in, and it had been forced to curl into a fetal position to avoid putting pressure on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, fetal position? How the heck did it move in the first place? You try to move, but find yourself to tired to do so, and slump back onto the dinosaur with a loud squeak from the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel movement, and the inflatable T-Rex...turns its neck and head to look at you. Your muscles seize up, both out of amazement and fear. Almost as if sensing this, the Dino starts nuzzling and licking you, and you begin to feel less afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh and hug the friendly dinosaur, feeling the PVC t is comprised of stretch slightly, and enjoy the squeaking sounds caused by the contact. Suddenly, you sight the inflation nozzle on the T-Rexes belly, and the big Dino uncurls slightly to allow you access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Its tail beats against your bed harmlessly, thump-thumping happily as the toy wags. It clearly has presented its nozzle to you, a hopeful grin forming, full of rounded faux-teeth, and a fit of madness seizes you. More than likely, this was just some dream--but nonetheless, that you were having it to begin with seemed worth some flustering. Still, here you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined that this might as well play out and contribute to a good dream session, you gladly take the tube of the pump and gently insert it over the nozzle, making sure it's good and secure. Once satisfied, you give the Dino a grin, nod, and flick the pump back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inflatable toy seems to be growling in approval, at first--then you realize it's the stretching of its hide, as the balloon-reptile bulges larger against you, starting to push you back; the belly groans and pumps wider, starting to rub and grind softly against your front side, the stretching hide tugging and pulling your shirt in different directions. The Dino sighs and rubs big, giddy circles across its stomach, eliciting a symphony of supple squeals, as it grows and grows and grows. Slowly, the mass of PVC and air starts to flood the remainder of the room, your computer and TV getting nudged aside, before toppling over onto its bouncy body. Larger still the Dino inflates, bobbling the TV and letting the computer monitor sliiiiide over and thud against the wall, before it grows even bigger, smothering both items tight. Its sides bulge flat into all four walls, rolling higher and higher up, as its expanding muzzle bores into you adoringly. The Dino closes its eyes and laps away over you as its head bumps the ceiling, your bedding snapping flatter under its expanding body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on the pump goes, as a lapse of foresight becomes apparent: you left the pump out of reach, too lost in rubbing and stroking its smooth hide, feeling it grow against you! Now the thing is stuck, wedged to the wall by the Dino's growth spurt, and it's still on...</span></div></div>",

She purred as you stroked her fur, pressing into you slightly. While you pet her, you checked your phone to see what was going on in the world. Evie kept up a satisfied rumble the whole time, but it felt like she was constantly shifting in your lap. You didn't think much of it and gave her a scratch behind her ears. Or at least, where you thought her ears were. In reality, you ended up scratching her on the back and had to move your hand up further to reach her head than you should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking away from your phone, you saw Evie stretched out across your bed like you expected. What you didn't expect, was that she was twice the size that she should have been. She looked the same as ever, just on a larger scale, and the look she gave you seemed to ask why you stopped petting her. You started petting her again, watching to see any changes. As you pet her, you could see her whole body swell slightly, getting bigger each time you stroked her fur. After another minute of this, Evie was nearly the size of your dog, and she looked all too happy to stay on your bed and be pet by you.</span></div></div>",

You'd never heard of anything like this happening before. Stranger still, you'd been petting her every day for as long as you'd had her, so why was it only today that she started growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were broken out of your thoughts by a nudge from your golden retriever, Cooper. He was an energetic dog who loved to play and go on long walks. Closely behind him was Evie, incredibly matching Cooper's height. Even though you had seen her larger form earlier, it was surreal to see it in comparison to your normal sized dog. You bent over and started petting Cooper, rubbing him vigorously as his tail wagged quickly. While you were petting him, Evie was staring at you expectantly, in a way that you felt almost looked like jealousy at the fact that you were petting Cooper and not her. While you were looking at Evie, you hadn't even realized that you were subconsciously adjusting your stance to reach higher and higher to continue petting Cooper. Finally you decided to stop petting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to your dog, you realized he had undergone the same transformation as Evie had earlier on your bed. Cooper had grown about a foot in the process, with his back now level with your waist. Based on the way his tail was wagging, he seemed proud to show off his new height to you, pressing himself against your waist to emphasize the increase. Evie took the opportunity to plant herself at your other side. You couldn't resist your pets and resumed petting both of them at the same time. Almost immediately, you could feel their bodies begin to expand in response to your petting. You wanted to experiment with the process a little, so you pet Evie harder than Cooper to see if she would grow more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to pet your pets, it seemed like your hypothesis was being proven correct. Evie was growing faster than Cooper and was well on her way to matching his size for the second time today. It wasn't a competition however, and both of them just looked happy to be receiving so much affection. You decided that you would stop petting them once Evie  caught up to Cooper, and that time was not long off. You finally stopped petting them as Evie's head met Cooper's at the same level as your chest. By your estimate, they were both an incredible 4'6\" tall, and about twice as long as they were tall. Their heads were now as large as your chest, and their eyes didn't have to look up very far to meet yours. From the looks they were giving you, you could tell that they didn't want you to stop petting them and you were strongly tempted to keep giving them what they wanted.</span></div></div>",

It was the mid-afternoon and many visitors were beginning to leave the zoo as it neared closing time but those that remained got to see you feed the various animals. A couple of people had taken sick-leave so you tried to systematically work through each of the enclosures as to not waste time, although the animals were being particularly affectionate today which was making it difficult. The crowd that remained loved it though, giggling as you got barraged by the friendly licks of an excited wolf pack or got nuzzled against by the small herd of gazelle. You were used working with the affectionate animals but you found that each day it was getting tougher to control them, almost as if they were getting stronger or something each time you visited them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you worked your way through the enclosures until you got to the big cats, a few hours have passed and the last of the visitors were leaving. The big cats were your favorite animals in the zoo because they were so laid-back and easy to manage, the felines mainly just sticking to rubbing against you like overgrown house cats before digging into their food. There was one enclosure in particular that you always liked to leave for last, the tiger exhibit. It held one of the zoo's many record holders, a female Sumatran tiger named Karina. Despite being the smallest subspecies of tiger, she out-sized the largest subspecies of tiger by a whole foot making her famous for being a \"giant tiger\". This fame coupled with her location in the zoo made her enclosure the most visited places in the zoo which can sometimes stress her and the other tigers out. By working in her enclosure last it gives you the time to give her some well-needed TLC as the zoo closes to help calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the enclosure and locking the gate behind you grab your feed and move inside the exhibit. The majority of the enclosure was grass with a multitude of ferns and trees on its border to give it an Indonesian jungle theme. You instinctively raise the buckets holding their feed up as a group of tigers saunters over to you and begins to rub against you. As you hand out a big slab of meat to each of the big cats you couldn't help but notice that Karina wasn't among them. She could usually be found in the shelter at the back of the enclosure, a big concrete pen left open so the tigers could either hide from the rain or be separated temporarily. As you approached the shelter you could see through the wire mesh on the front of the pen that Karina was laying down on one of the huge mattresses that the zoo supplied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you enter the shelter Karina stood up and started walking over to you. You spread your arms and braced yourself as she increased her speed towards you before she embraced you in a big tigery hug. She nuzzled against you and rubbed the sides of her face all over you as you tried to lower the incredibly heavy feline down off of you. You really enjoyed spending time with Karina, she was much more affectionate than the other big cats and there was something fun about taking care of a kitten-like giant predator. You could swear she had grown since last you saw her as she sat down on her hind legs, her golden eyes level with yours. An expectant growl came from the tiger as you grabbed the a slab of meat and gave it to her. She barely chewed before you heard a big gulp and saw the bulge of the meat disappear down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karina, you need to chew, girl.\" You try and reason with her as you hand her the last piece of meat, Karina swallowing the meat in the same fashion before letting out a contented growl. With a sigh you put down the rest of your equipment and stroke the side of the tigresses face before she pulls away and rolls onto her back. Despite being the toughest feline on the block she was still very delicate, the multitude of people gawking at her during the day taking its toll on the tiger. You found that some good pampering seems to alleviate her stress, even if it did spoil her a bit. You begin to rub the soft white fur of her belly, giving her a slight massage as you work your hands over her powerful muscles. Going over body you can't help but feel there was more surface area on the tigress as your hands glide through her soft fur, almost feeling as if she was bigger than the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you work your way to her thighs and calves until you eventually reach her big paws that you liked to save for last. Having spent her life in the zoo, her grey leathery pawpads were exceptionally smooth and soft. This was without a doubt yours and Karina's favorite part. Grabbing her large paw in both your hands you slowly work your fingers between her toes as you massaged her paws, continuing for a while until you move onto her main pawpad. Holding her paw you spread both of your thumbs onto her pawpad and begin pressing into in a circular motion, eliciting a growl of pleasure from the tigress. It felt like Karina was constantly pushing her paw towards you while you were pampering her paws so when you move over to the next leg you sit a bit further back to give her some leeway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking your way up her thighs and calves again you felt a strange sensation come from the tigress when your hand reached her paw. You could swear you could see it too, it was as if her body suddenly trembled for a second. Chalking it up to your imagination you resume your massage, repeating the same process as you did with the other paw. With each stroke of your fingers you saw the tiger tremble out the corner of your eye and when you start massaging her pawpad with your thumbs do you finally notice that Karina's paws were definitely bigger. You stare at them, perplexed as you try and wrap your hands around her paw only to find you can barely touch together the tips of your thumbs. In fact, her whole body was bigger! Looking down at Karina you saw that she was completely covering the large mattresss, her head starting to ride up against the concrete wall as she watched you with her relaxed, golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously gulp at the sudden realization that the tiger your indulging probably grew between one or two feet in the space of a few minutes. It made you nervous but you were incredibly excited and curious about the fact. <i>Did I make her grow?</i> To test your theory you continue to knead her paws, pressing your thumbs down hard onto her soft pads. Almost as soon as you press down on them you could see the pad stretch wider, growing almost a whole inch in every direction. You continue rubbing her pawpads and start working your fingers through her toes again, feeling the digits swell in your hand. Looking back down to Karina while massaging her paws you could see her body slowly pulsing bigger as you pampered her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her paws after letting her grow a couple of extra feet you sit back before the much larger tiger, you suddenly have an epiphany. <i>Am I the one causing the animals here to grow up so big? Does me giving them affection cause them to grow or something?</i> You were lost in thought until Karina spat out a quick, impatient growl at you. Something inside of you almost wanted to keep spoiling the giant tigress to see how big she would get. Right now she was big enough to encompass an entire paw over your face and feeling her grow in your hands was strange and exciting. Not to mention all the animals in this zoo including Karina were so good-tempered that you doubt that even at giant sizes they would hurt the public. Not on purpose anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip as you struggle to decide if you want to keep pampering her or to leave before she gets any bigger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thought that you had a special power that could make an animal grow by just doing something as simple as running a hand along their fur blew your mind. It would explain why so many animals in the zoo were so large but what didn't make sense was their slow, inconspicuous growth over your time working at the zoo in comparison to the tiger before you. Within a short time span you had already doubled Karina's already large size! Was it because you spent the most time with Karina or is it because your odd power is getting stronger? Another quick growl of impatience breaks you from your thought as Karina stares at you, her golden eyes begging for more attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome nagging thought in the back of your mind was compelling you to give her all the love and care she wanted just to test the scope of your awakening power but you decided against it. With a tiger already this big in the zoo it was bound to get the attention of the of the Occupational Health and Safety people. If she got any bigger they would most likely say she has to be sent off to some facility or something and that's if they even let her stay after growing as much as she did. Watching Karina flop over to her side you decide it would be best to just leave things be before things get too out of control. Picking up your gear and exiting the concrete and wire mesh shelter you hear a playful chuff coming from the tiger behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour awestruck when you turn around to see Karina meandering out of the shelter. Her back was just about riding along the roof of the small concrete building and you had to crane your head up as she began standing to her full height after exiting the small building. You can't help but think you really underestimated her size as she elegantly saunters over to you, her hips swaying side to side with each step. The tigress was almost twice as tall as you and It was obvious she still wanted attention from you. \"H-hey Karina!\" You stammered while lowering your gear back to the ground and stepped back. \"I'm going home now, alright?\" Karina completely ignores your words and instead keeps determinedly waltzing towards you until her massive furred head impacts your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big cats of the zoo rubbing against you like giant house-cats was typical but the added size of the tiger nuzzling against you inadvertently turned her display of affection into a headbutt. You instinctively clutch onto the fur of Karina's cheeks to stop yourself from getting bowled over as she continues to push her head into your chest. \"H-hey!\" You yelp as she keeps pressing against you. As you try and fend off her advances you suddenly realize she wasn't even actively pushing into you, her head growing wider in your hands becoming painfully obvious. You let go and fumble to the ground as you try and distance yourself as the expanding tiger's growth slowly comes to a stop as she crouches down over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up to the tiger giantess a warm fuzzy feeling welled up in your chest. Making this friendly predator even bigger was oddly exciting and wanted to see her get even bigger but you knew having a massive tiger romping around the city would no doubt cause some issues.  <i>Okay. If I don't want her to get any more bigger I just need to sit here and do nothing until she gets bored, right?</i> Planning your course of action you watch Karina lazily lower herself towards you, placing her thick furry arms to either side of you before she goes in to nuzzle you again. With your hands planted on the grass you brace yourself as her fluffy cheeks brush against your entire face, the tigress letting out playful chirrups while doing so. When your face wasn't full of orange and black fur you manage to look up and still see her form moving despite her lack of movement. You suddenly realize that she was actually still growing! With her head hovering above your face you noticed that she had grown so much that her head was almost the size of your torso!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two stare at each other for a split second as you and seemingly Karina recognized what was happening.<i> She doesn't need me to give her affection to grow, she can just deal it out herself and grow all the same!</i> Karina suddenly opens her maw and gives you a good view of her fleshy maw before a massive tongue brushes along your face. You flinch and tumble on your back from the shock of being covered in her warm saliva. You barely have time to wipe your face before a massive paw pins your leg down and she begins licking your entire body as if you were a little tiger cub. It was definitely apparent that she wasn't about to let you go anytime soon. Your shirt only lasted a few licks before her barbed tongue began to tear the fabric apart. You prepared for the pain of her rough tongue raking across your bare chest but you were surprised when the thick muscle softly combed across your body giving you what felt like a massage, causing you to let out an involuntary moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only lay there and watch as more of Karina began to dominate your view, growing bigger in a stop-start motion with every lick. Every time her tongue dragged across you it stretched a little wider and was able to cover more and more of you. The weight on your legs from the paw pinning you down also slowly intensifying as its expansion made her digits slowly crawl over your waist. As her unrelenting licking comes to a stop you wipe your face again as you look at her. By now Karina must have be at least 20 feet tall, maybe even bigger! The weight on your legs is lifted as she eases her paw off you, although you stay put as you see no point in resisting the tiger's affection at this point. She slowly rises her paw above you, giving you a good view of her pawpads. Behind them, though, you could see what could only be described as a smirk on Karina's face. You feel your face flush red as you realize what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always had a strange fascination with paws and it seemed Karina had picked up on this from your time with her. You're not sure if she was trying to just make herself bigger or just indulge your weird fantasy, but you find yourself grabbing her paw with both your hands as it descends upon your chest nonetheless. Simply just holding onto it you could feel it getting bigger. <i>Heck, she's already this big right?</i> You give in as Karina slowly begins rubbing her paw against your bare chest until it reaches your face. You turn your head to the side as you grip onto her furry toes and let out a contented sigh as you the feel the warm leathery pads spread over you. With your face fully encompassed in her paw you could audibly hear her growth. You could hear pops and crackles as her bones lengthened, fleshy groans as her muscles increased in size and the sound of leather stretching as her pawpads spread over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween gasps of fresh air as she continually ran her paw along the length of your body you could also hear the sound of wood snapping behind her. With a guess you figured that she was starting to get a bit too large for the enclosure and her body was starting to push against the trees and ferns. In fact, you begin to notice that she wasn't kneading you as much as before and was instead just lightly squeezing her toes around your frame. It takes you a second to realize she was doing that because she had grown big enough to fully enclose her paw over your entire body! Each of her toes was bigger than your head and her black keratin claws rivaled the tusks on the zoo's elephants. She continues smothering you under her warm paws for a few more minutes before you feel a gust of cold, fresh air hit your body when she removes her foot off you and stands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made herself <i>really</i> big. You felt like a bug in the grass as you just stared up at her massive body, dumbfounded at her ludicrous size. She completely dominated the enclosure and you guessed that she must be roughly around 50 feet tall. At this size she was more than twice the height of the tiger pen's fence but thankfully the tall trees still managed to conceal her. Obviously happy with the situation Karina happily growls down at you, her added size making her much more louder. As you lean up she adjusts her position in her much smaller habitat and you could actually feel her weight bearing down on the land whenever her paws thumped down to the ground. Content with her size for now she lovingly stares down at you as she seemingly waits for you to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought in your mind was almost compelling you to see how big you could make her, both for the sake of your curiosity and her safety. Her size was definitely going to catch some attention now and friendly or not she probably won't receive a warm welcome if she exits the zoo, making the thought of growing her an even more valid option. Maybe you could even ride on her back and try and guide her out of the city? As you pondered your options you watch the other smaller tigers saunter about the outskirts of the enclosure, obviously confused at the sudden growth of one of their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The food was good, you had near infinite levels of spare time and the view from your cabin was always breathtaking. On the other hand, you were several light years off course from your intended destination, where you would have used the stored DNA from people on other worlds and the machinery on board the ship to establish a colony. The creation chamber did not need DNA to function, but it had never been tested without it, and nobody wanted to run the risk of anything going wrong. Creation chambers were frequently used to provide livestock for fledgling colonies, you recalled, always without DNA. Perhaps that was one reason why DNA was always used to create humans - nobody would want to be placed on the same level as, say, a cow or chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsent mindedly, you look out of the window of your cabin. It was actually the captain's cabin, but you had liberated it for yourself as you were the only living thing on board the ship. You begin to feel lonely, as had been happening with increasing frequency over the course of your time on the ship. You sigh heavily, and weigh your options. Most of the human DNA samples were too old to use, or were simply missing from the Vault. It was obvious you were going to make an animal, if you used the creation chamber. However, unauthorised use of a creation chamber was heavily punished, and although all security on the ship had either been rendered inoperable by you or degraded over time, the Enforcers seemed to have near psychic abilities for finding criminals, even if they themselves had no idea where they were. You close the curtain across the viewing port and walk to the creation chamber, having made your mind up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the creation chamber's room and enter. Rows of flashing red lights adorn the walls, along with a control panel and a set of heavily outlined welding marks indicate where any animals or people are created, as the walls slide apart to allow whatever was created to exit. You approach the panel, and its bottom half raises slightly so as to tilt the screen up towards you. It is a fairly advanced display, with a yellow wireframe background , a space for a silhouette of whatever was being created, its height, and a small picture comparison with a six foot tall human, this being your height. You know it is a touchscreen, so you begin navigating through menus to reach the creation stage. Excited at the prospect of finally having. A companion, and maybe several more after that, you set the chamber to create...</span></div></div>",

You take time in carefully slipping out of her grip, petting her big muzzle and whispering for her to get back up--you'll need to find a new place for her to stay, at this size! Perhaps the Solarium would work? The water filtration cycle was still running, there would be lots of water and some healthy plant life around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lead her out, you have to tuck her sides in bit by bit, helping to force her out of your quarters as she hums and chirps at you, nudging your arm with her snout, thumping her big tail gently behind her as she takes up most of the hallway. You smile, even with (or maybe even on account of) the situation at hand, kind of liking her growth. As if sensing it, she balloons larger mid-hallway, nearly mooshing you into the wall lining, and clicking lovingly to you. Will you make it to the solarium at all, at this rate?

You let a panicked little laugh out between breaths, unable to resist the growing sea dragoness's charming manner--but business is business! You have to get her moving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some severe effort, you work several beams in against her bulging, smooth body, and you work away at them, one after the other, until she pops loose from the doorway, thumping clumsily into the wall on the other end of the hallway--which, thankfully, can still contain her. Barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sides push you into the walls gently with every breath, the rhythmic noise of her belly expanding in and out...it kind of near-hypnotizes you, as you try and guide the sweet-natured creature along. The Solarium is close enough, you know you can make it--and besides, if she were to fill up the cafeteria, your food supply would get compromised. The clear-pane double-doors to the Solarium sliiide open with a mechanized WHOOSH of displaced air, and the sea dragoness perks up at the wave of scents and all within, her fins twitching cutely as she rurrs curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat her thick neck comfortingly, and she actually grins at you--she grins! What an expressive creature...there was really no telling just how smart she was, but clearly, she knew enough; she trundled calmly into the massive space, giggling as the grown patches of grass tickled her underbelly, and made her way towards a pool of water, nearly the size of a small lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask if she wants to go into the water, and she offers a big nod, further astonishing you. You motion, laughing, at the water, and she clickclicks adoringly, nuzzling on your entire body with just her muzzle. The waters push out a little as she augers her gigantic, 25-foot body into the pool, sinking beneath the topside for a moment. You sigh in relief, figuring you might as well head over to the cafeteria to get her some real food, just in case. You speak your intentions over the pool, knowing she should be able to hear you alright, then head off. Within seconds, the water begins to ripple, as the sea dragoness tingles all over, wildly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head back from the food locker, fishes and drinks and fruit in hand, quite a sight meets you, as you stand outside the doors to the Solarium: there she is, looming well-over the water, displacing so much of it that it pools against the bottom of the sliding doors. Her body must be at least 100 feet in size! And...good god, she's bulging even bigger! The water levels slowly drop as she sponges it into herself, trembling and chirping and smiling, before she tingles worse, then BOOMS even bigger, doubling in size! Her growing smooth belly smooshes tight against the borders of the entire Solarium, before she bulges even bigger, and bigger, and bigger, cracks forming in the seemingly indestructible glass panel casing. Step by stunned step, you back away from the wall of blues and yellows pressing furiously against everything containing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaxon begins to blare, as the massive ship's computer begins speaking, in a monotone fashion:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAUTION...CAUTION...UNIDENTIFIED MASS INCREASING IN SOLARIUM...CAUTION...MASS EXPANDING AT EXPONENTIAL RATE...MASS INCREASING 4,000%...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness's enlarged voice cascades through the halls as you hear her giggle happily; the cracks web out wider and wider, as the ship starts to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAUTION...MASS INCREASING...%8,000...%9,000...EVACUATE SHIP...ALL HANDS...EVACUATE SHIP...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS...she absorbs water! What have you done!? You panic, tumbling backwards, as her body erupts free of the Solarium, shattering it in a rolling wave of wet reptilian body mass. Her flippers shoot out and tear through the bordering hallway, her head punching up clear through the roof of the mid-deck you're on. Her growing weight forces an increasingly deep dent in the floor. You look up from the mad display of size as her head forces itself back down into your deck, and she click-clicks lovingly at you, curiously regarding how small you are to her now. Untold hundreds of feet of sea dragoness begin to tremble and bulge out even larger, her body consuming all space available nearby, and you race to the elevators, hammering frantically at the buttons...</span></div></div>",

Behind you, the snaps and clangs and pops of tubing, roofing and sheared metal plates combine with the hiss of steam and the whine of klaxon, all coalescing into a wild roar of sounds, suggesting the ship might break apart any second--and yet, over that all, comes the loving warble and purr of the sea dragoness, as she fills more and more of the ship. Her slick, wet sides bulge bigger into support beams and hallway corners and delivery transit shafts, only to tremble and burst even larger, dominantly shoving all forms of construction away as you hear her coo and balloon loudly in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you wish there were stairs nearby, the elevator finally opens, and you rush in just in time to spot her gigantic eye batting softly, as she watches you leave. You hear something close to a giggle, before her rumbling intensifies, and you hear the wall space where you just were crumple and crash apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Love...you...\" a strange, near-human voice echoes, like some gigantic ghost, down below. Gods, had she just managed some rough speech!? You only have so much time to think on it, as the elevator door whizzes open, and you bolt out towards the escape pods. Again, you hammer away wildly at the sequencing activation button, until the circular doors whirl open in different directions. You climb in, just as that same voice echoes out into the ship, reverberating everywhere:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you! Love you! Don't...l...leaaave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart swells. It really IS her! She's picked up speech, overnight! She doesn't sound sad, really; she sounds much more like a giggly little kid, egging a companion to stick around and play more. Your helmet and suit are already on, when you step in fully, entering the pod, as the doors close, and you shoot out into space. Turning on the intercom channel link, you speak through your helmet's headset:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, honey! I'm outside of the ship now, but I'm still close by! Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hon...honey...Honey!\" you hear her boom back into the ship's speaker system, her voice overflowing with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha...yeah. Honey. That's your new name, okay?\" You forgo yelling at her over the ship, since you technically are the one who made her start growing so massive. Sure enough, with another stretching noise over the intercom, you watch as Honey starts to force the ship's organic plated exterior bulge out more and more, and more...until, at last, and with no sound, the entire giant ship bursts completely apart, leaving only the utterly monstrous-sized sea dragoness floating there, in space. Good lord...going off the ship's rough specs, she was easily a quarter of a mile in size!!! Incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Hi! See you!\" her voice crackles over the intercom. She must have swallowed the intercom system whole, it must have been a part of the ship that hadn't broken to bits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Honey! Yes, I see you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...big!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh...certainly are! You're so amazingly huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee! Made me huge! Love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush inside your helmet, watching in silent awe as she looms closer to your pod. You caution her gently not to hurt it, and she nods and smiles wide. Her had alone vastly outsizes even the pod, it being more the size of her huge, beautiful eyes, which blink as she regards you happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...now?\" she asks, at length. It's sure a fair question! You have some rations tucked into the pod's emergency kit, and some water, so you should be okay awhile...but not forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the thrusters are intact on the pod, so...we just need to find a new place to land!\"</span></div></div>",

Luckily, thanks to the genetic coding, it looks like Honey can live perfectly well in the cold vacuum of space. If anything, she looks totally ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want to go, master?\" she asks, her voice crackling through the intercom; as she queries, you can see her flexible reptilian jaw moving up and down, making you grin. It's just a liiiitle difficult to feel doomed around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I dunno, Honey,\" you start, clearing the worry out of your throat. \"The fuel for the thrusters should hold out for days, and the same goes for the food, if I'm stingy. Hey, wait--what about you? Aren't you...you know, hungry or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my belly is happy. I'm happy too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well, alright, glad you two are fine. Whichever way we head...it had better have a close-by planet, or I'm toast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans turn into bread!?\" she balks, making you smack your head--er, helmet, with a palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't turn into bread. It's just an expression. But seriously, luck had better be on my side, whichever way we go...otherwise...there won't be any coming back froooOOOAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft but noticeable impact shakes the pod, as you look out to see nothing but a splay of yellow and a little blue. You can't see worth a thing, but you can feel you're moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way should I take you?\" she chirps into the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...right! Duh, of course! Just keep going straight, Honey, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel fairly stupid--of course she could move you, and spare the use of fuel. You smile and set remove the helmet, taking a moment to thump appreciatively on the window pane. Clearly, the vibrations reach the other side, tickling her sea dragoness belly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeheeehee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it again, again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you play a little drum solo on the window, and the intercom explodes with laughter. On and on you drum, until you finally need to lay back in your seat, and rest a little. You tell Honey you need a nap, after all the shock of losing the ship. She guiltily replies in the affirmative, and before you nod off, you tell her none of the ship's destruction was her fault. You hope she's nodding out there, because you mean it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master...master? Wake up, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flutter open, to the foggy sight of Honey pushing at the window--all of her, that is. She must only be three feet tall now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-honey!?\" you stammer, sputtering awake. \"What happened? Why are you so tiny again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I think I burned off all that water I absorbed! I've been pushing you for over a day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day!? Why didn't you wake me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were talking in your sleep, and I liked listening, because it felt like you were with me--I mean, big like me, and hugging me, like when I was first born!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...well...you can stop pushing, then. Here, lemme put my helmet on, and you can get in, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat very series of events happens, and in moments the door seals shut again, and you now have a two-foot Honey wiggling around in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warm, warm! It's warm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the heater! And my own heat, a little bit. You still not hungry or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't gotten hungry yet. Should I tell you when I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, that'd be fine, Honey. You're a good girl, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bumps her head up under your chin, sighing loudly, her long tail whipping dumbly about. You laugh, and unscrew a bottled water from your kit to take a drink, when a few little bits float free, bumping and splashing apart on Honey's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry, Honey! Lemme wipe that up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late! The water's absorbed, and Honey balloons about ten inches larger, her little body swelling a little bit larger into you. You wince, hoping it stops there...and, after another two inches, she seems to end it, huffing happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm!\" her bigger tail thump-thumps too close to the ejector button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oop, mind the controls! Here, why don't you take a nap, this time? I'm not going anywhere, so why don't you enjoy your break? I'll turn the thrusters on, and keep guiding us further. I'm sure we'll hit something soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's already asleep, so you hush up, and turn on the propulsion system. As the thruster warm up, you just lean back in your chair and grin, stroking on her like she's a kitten. She even starts to work up a low, lizard-like rumble, smiling as you pet her in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare out into space as you pet Honey, just wondering and hoping if or when you'd find some inhabitable place to land. The comm system whrrs through channel after channel, and no one from control seems to be responding to your messages, as you whisper them, so as not to wake up Honey. She twists and wiggles and stretches and sighs, like some scaly blue cat, her fins perking all over as she smiles. She's shrunken back down to 3.5 feet by now...maybe she's dreaming of being even bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later, and a little red light to the side of the console begins blinking rapidly. Something's being picked up by the motion sensors on the exterior!! </span></div></div>",

But there was nothing out there, your escape pod was alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your eyes away from the console, you look up towards the viewscreen--<br>\r\nAnd see a patch of space off to starboard <i>twist, bend,</i> and <i>distort</i> as another ship comes tearing out of the anomoly, space snapping back to order behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Right. You were looking at an FTL (Faster Than Light) signature just a moment ago, from this very ship. So, you weren't just going to keep drifting through the void, hoping for a livable planet to turn up. That was the good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...The bad news, was that this new ship looked nothing like your old home. You couldn't see the whole thing--it easily dwarfed your puny escape pod, and had jumped in rather close to you--but you recognized weapon mounts when you saw them. And this alien ship had some BIG guns...and missile tubes...and plasma cannons. Also, you were fairly sure that you saw hangar decks arrayed along the port side and lower spine, meaning this thing was probably some kind of carrier/battleship hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, this ship was armed to the teeth, and then some...and it didn't look like humans made it, nor by any of the alien races mankind had met and befriended over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Somehow, I don't think this is a rescue party...</i> Goes through your mind as you gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to confirm that, a growling voice snarls from the comm--twinged with a slight computerized monotone, indicating it was being translated; either by your ship's hardware, or some device the alien had:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Human escape pod on heading Zero-Five-Seven, respond to this transmission at once! We know where you are, and have you outgunned!\"</i> They weren't bluffing: a quick glance at the console confirmed you were being tracked by the ship's sensors...and the targeting systems. No lock-ons, but they DID have you in their cross-hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping again, you pick up the headset and respond, \"Er, Escape pod on heading Oh-Five-Seven responding...who am I speaking with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a series of hisses and growls from the other end...was that alien laughing at you? If he was, it sounded rather sinister...worthy of a decent super-villain, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ha! You don't know?! Poor sap...you have the pleasure of talking to Kaxx Io, the best pirate in this whole blasted galaxy! Now, why don't you just sit tight while I send over a boarding party, hmm? Then, you and I can have a chat--mostly about how you managed to wreck a top-of-the-line colony ship all on your lonesome, and cost me some prime loot that I've been tracking for days!! Oh, and don't think of jumping to FTL and escaping--my guns can charge faster than your engines.\" </i>With one last snarl, the transmission is cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head hits the console, hard. Unbelievable! Some pirate had been stalking your ship for days; that was bad enough, but now he'd been deprived of his prize, and had you and Honey cornered like rats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney...you look back at the sea dragon, still snuggling nicely in bed despite all the racket. You really don't want this pirate to get his hands on her, especially if his goons somehow find out she came from the Creation Chamber--to say that humanity was tight-lipped about that piece of tech would be putting it mildly. Not even Earth's closest, most longtime allies had been let in on the secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if some thug like Kaxx got his hands/claws/tentacles on it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, head still on the console, and see some shuttlecraft--no, gunships--fly out of a hangar bay and angle towards you. Great, just great...in all the infinite vastness of space, the sheer insane size of the cosmos, you had to run into a pirate with a grudge against you, after one day's flight in an escape pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you love and adore Honey, you think that that Creation Chamber has brought you the worst luck in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question remains: <i>What to do about Kazz and his pirate minions?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Raising an eyebrow, you look at the image more closely, realising that the planet's exterior was cracked and riddled with pockmarks and meteorites impact sites. Well, it certainly wasn't the most ideal world... but it'd have to do. One major problem was the lack of any visible water on the planet's surface. Granted, there could be water on the other side, but it'd take too long to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, you know the planet is there. Now you just need atmospheric data and you can have the console calculating an entry vector while you sleep - automatically calculating entry vectors was a notoriously slow, if utterly reliable process. Given how you weren't an expert pilot, you didn't feel like risking everything just so you could make planetfall a few hours earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you cratch and pet Honey, something suddenly occurs to you. It had been several hours since you last ate when you used the Creation Chamber, creating Honey. After that, you had gone to sleep, immediately escorting Honey to the solarium when you woke up. After that, you had gone to gather food, water, and so on, dropping your supplies when Honey's ship destroying growth had started. Then, when you had entered the escape pod and gone to sleep after several minutes of conversing with and drumming on Honey's then massive body, sleeping for a standard day according to Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant you had gone almost two days without food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you didn't feel hungry in the slightest. Come to think of it, that small sip of water was the only drink you'd had in the same time period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning slightly, you look down at Honey's sleeping form. Honey herself had never eaten once sonce she was born. A d she had reported being completely content when you had asked her if she was hungry. Perhaps Honey's presence somehow nullified your need for food and water, to a major extent? You usually got pretty hungry after just seven or so hours, let alone two entire days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, not only were you in the company of a Chamber-created water dragoness who seemingly didn't need food or drink, and could easily shrug off the freezing vacuum of space... but you seemed to be somehow receiving these two properties from her? This would be interesting, to put it lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to the touchpad, you realise that atmospheric analysis and vector calculation would take, in total, about twelve hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing, you think about going back to sleep. It would pass the time, and if your hupothesis about no longer needing food or drink was correct, then no resources would be lost as a result of abnormal amounts of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Honey begins to slowly wake up, you decide that you're going to go to sleep, hugging her like the 'day' she was born. The question was, does she stay at this size, or do you grow her back up to seven feet tall to serve as a warm, scaly bed of sorts?</span></div></div>",

As Honey moves about in your one arm, you use the other to fish a food packet out of the kit attached to the wall. You work the pull tab with your teeth, then take some experimental gulps of the fruit gel within, just to see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, it seems good enough, and your stomach still feels fine. The only thing the action really resolves is that food hasn't been rendered bad for you, or anything. The only real thing you feel, funny enough, is cold...but that shouldn't be the case; the heating system in the pod should have been nominal. Yet, as the soft drone of the vent dies off and sputters, you wait in bridled horror, hoping beyond hope that the heating unit hasn't gone out or died on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" you mutter, as Honey stretches in your grip, then yawns, her cute little jaws opened wide as she makes a little squeaking chirp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what is it?\" the sea dragoness asks, blinking her big little eyes up at you. Already, you're starting to shiver involuntarily, even though you're trying to put up a bold front. \"It feels cold in here again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, well...the heating unit's dead, it looks like,\" you sigh, seeing your breath cloud out into the open. The insulation in the pod is the only reason I haven't frozen to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death!?\" Honey nearly wails, suddenly breathing in and out nervously. \"But you can't die, master! You can't! Please don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, Honey, calm down,\" you gently say, shushing her quietly with a big, loving snuggle. \"I'm not going to die, okay? In fact, you can keep me from danger. Will you help me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, master, yes! What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay here, against me. You're still warm, so I need you to cover me up for a little while, until we land on the charted planet, alright?\" Already you've removed the water bottle. You motion for her to open wide, and you gently pour a quarter of the bottle into Honey's open maw, the sweet little creature drinking obediently. \"After a few hours, take some more water, so you stay giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every gulp, she balloons out, groaning loudly, as her hide pulls tighter over more inflating mass. She gets bigger and bigger, warmer and warmer, inch after inch of her rubbery, soft body creeping over you; in a minute, she's over seven feet in size, her snuggly form completely blanketing you over. She smiles and presses herself on you tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that good?\" she asks, almost purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to respond, but her bulk smothers the words out. Instead, you rub on her belly affectionately, making her giggle and sigh happily. Even if the heating system kicked back into gear, you might just stay buried under her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake to the hard thud of the landing gear as it settles. Land--you must have landed on the planet's surface, at last! Honey had fallen asleep as well, the water bottle still in her muzzle as she snoozes against you. She's insanely heavy...you feel around, realizing she must have overdone it, and gotten way too big at one point, during your sleep; she must nearly fill the pod! Eventually, you squirm your way out from her warm bulk, working your way to your helmet (just in case), which you put on before you wiggle out of the pod door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape seems to rocky and desolate--yet the readings confirm that you can, indeed, breathe the air in the atmosphere, so you take a collecting breath and remove the helmet. Sure enough, you can take in the air! Whew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master,\" a husky, heavy female voice peeps, from inside the pod. You turn to see Honey's head poking out of the pod, her head titling at you as though she were a curious dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you're up! Look, we hit land!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" the gigantic sea dragoness rumbled, shaking the pod. \"I'll join you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wait a little while, and shrink back down; can't have you bursting the thing apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...what should I do, in the meantime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really should get a feel for the lay of the land,\" you start, making her shake the pod worse in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, don't leave me here alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay--well...why don't I look at the heating unit, while you shrink down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way to the pod, and unscrew the panel to the external unit, to tinker around with the wiring, you feel the pod begin to rumble a bit, and rather ominously so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you feel that, Honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was me...\" the giant reptile rumbles, embarrassed, as you feel another rumble, and another...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Original author: Growasaur<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThousands of years of intellect straining to best the world around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillions of minds working together, expanding the core base of knowledge, advancing theories that would boggle any dreamer towards reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProgress that we as a species had once never dared to conceive of, breeding unfathomable technologies across the world, and throughout the ageless cosmos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, all it boiled down to was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNNNNRRRRGHFGHLLLBL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney, a rare product of such mammoth intellect and design, was stuck in a big ball, and was flailing with such vigor that the pod she filled rocked and moaned its escalating distress. Being stuck on this odd new world with the gigantic sea serpent-thing, and having no other way off of it that was currently knowable, you react in kind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HONEYNOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box of wiring you had been fooling with before Honey's trembling rumbles grew so bad flies off, still in your hands, as you thud backwards onto the soil; the remainder of the pod's exterior plating pops and splits, metallic segments exploding free from the frame, which reveals Honey's form as she bulges angrily against it. Yeah...she's still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Master, sorry!\" she groans, amidst a few ill-placed (but impossible to restrain) huffs of bliss. Her reptilian bulk pumps and swells all the more, burrrrssssting slowly and surely against the frame, further warping it, as her thickening neck forces her head higher and higher up. \"I...I can't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't panic,\" you start, as her groans, interior and exterior, get more and more pronounced, loud, and long. \"Just stay cool, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groans grow worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My temperature's pretty nominal, I think! Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't meant literally cool! I just meant don't panic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if bred from some unspoken impatience, the frame gives, blowing apart with a screech of steel and plastics, bits and science-y bric-a-brac flying all about the area. The smoke clears, and a whopping 50-foot Honey looms over you, looking herself over. She peers at you like a dog about to be scolded for swiping a sweet, sweet cookie off the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad?\" she peeps, her teeny voice in no way properly-reflecting her gigantic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I mean, it was probably our one way off this place...and without some power source, this box I have, which DOES contain a distress beacon, is useless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a distress thingie?\" Honey asks, doing the ophidian equivalent of a balk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We couldn't use it then, it was already out of juice, Honey. I would have tried it otherwise. Maintenance on all the pods had been scheduled for later, since a few things needed fixing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, won't they try and find us, when you don't report in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...and they'll look where we were supposed to be, not here. Not unless we get this puppy working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PUPPY!?\" Honey gasps. \"WE HAVE A LITTLE DOG HERE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord...\" you sigh, squaring up your shoulders, \"not a real puppy. The box. This box, here, that I'm holding, sweetie, it's what I was talking about. We...I need to go over slang with you, soon. I know you came built-in with some rough knowledge, which is great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm smart,\" she peeps again, nearly blushing. You wince, then correct course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are, Honey, I know. You're wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her belly a soft pat, and she giggles, before she begins tingling again. With something akin to a low hiccup, Honey begins to swell out even larger, yet again, her sleek hide stretching loudly as she closes her eyes and smiles, ballooning out bigger and bigger against you. She ripples like a water balloon being filled at the tap, on high, her sides getting wider, her back rising higher, and her cute neck growing thicker and longer as she towers further up over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you ask...I dunno!\" Honey sputters, beating you to the punch. You wobble and step back in time with her growth, trying not to get bowled over as she inflates past 60 feet...then 65...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I was asleep, what'd you actually consume!? Just the bottle of water, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welllll...\" Honey huffs, nervously looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Honey, what did you have? Something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have gotten just a tiny bit peckish, and didn't want to wake you,\" she murmured, clearing her rumbly throat. \"And, uh...I may have nommed up a packet of dried food and...what are those pills, that were packaged with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach drops to your ankles, attempting to dig through and into the world's crust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those...are time-release capsules! Those auto-hydrate throughout a time period! How many did you have!? Please, please, don't say--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them. Kind of. For sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those keep releasing water into the system for 12 hours, A CAPSULE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another hiccup, Honey bulges up to 80 feet, then 100, getting rounder and heavier as her body outpaces her neck and head; her flippers grow and grow, her bulging tail thumping uselessly around on the dirt as she covers more and more ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W--well, how big will that make me, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VERY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ooh,\" she giggles, obviously not hating the notion so much; she sees your look, then her celebratory little giggle crumbles into an apologetic little wheeze. 110 feet...130 feet...150 feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's done, fine. If we can't find some cave or cover to lodge in, I'll need to use your body as a cover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat! I can be more help to you, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's great beyond words,\" you sigh. Honestly...it's kind of a cute image, in your head. \"So, we see how far you grow before the first capsule wears off, then we get shelter taken care of, then we look for something to power up this pup--er, box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if all the capsules work at me, at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, then hang your head. God help you both, if she's right about that...because if she is, she's barely even begun to grow bigger...</span></div></div>",

As you are stumbling and looking through the numerous boxes, something black, dusty, and worn catches your eye. Atop a box to your right is an old tome covered in dust that looks like it has gone through some wear and tear over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaps for a moment; you couldn't believe it. You had been looking for this book for years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first got the book about 10 years ago while traveling abroad in Asia. To this day you still can't remember the town's name or the little roadside shop's that you got it at. However, you do remember browsing through the items before your tour guide gave a loud gasp and pointed to the book with the black cover emblazoned with strange symbols. The guide tried to explain it to you with his local language, but you simply shrugged your shoulders. A little exasperated, he seemed to be trying to think of the correct English words. \"Big!\" he said, motioning the rising of something with his arms. \"Big!\" Off-putted a bit from his motions and word choice, you figured it must be important enough to buy as a rare souvenir of sorts, and so you payed the merchant with the local currency and brought it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had finally found it, it must have been up here all these years! You pick it up, blow off the dust, and open the worn and leathery pages. You are surprised to see that all the pages appear blank; you could have sworn there was ancient writing in it before. Disregarding this, you make the decision to use the book to write your short stories in: You were an aspiring writer after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night you open the book upon your desk and turn on the desk light. You put your pen to your lip, thinking about what to write about. After thinking for a couple of minutes your pet golden retriever, Bailey, comes into the room, tail wagging and a grin upon his face before he stands up to nuzzle your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, your mind seems to race incredibly fast before becoming very clear again in a short amount of time. Perplexed, you watch as your hand starts to write on the page of the book on its own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand underlines the title \"My Much Bigger Bailey.\" It's the strangest thing that has ever occurred to you: it was as if someone else was writing the words down, like the pathway between your mind, arm and hand was being controlled like a puppet by some unknown force. However, and perhaps even stranger, you instantly knew that this force was benevolent and not anything bad or evil. It was there to help you, to guide you through your stories. You couldn't decipher the meaning of the title much either. Then, your hand starts to write again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight, my dog Bailey will become even more intelligent, and then have a growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for a moment in anticipation, looking at your dog, before: </span></div></div>",

It's nice to finally be able to speak to you!\" comes a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes and stare, wanting to make sure that what just happened was real. And indeed it was: Your own golden retriever had just spoken to you! \"B...Bailey? Was that you? What just happened?...And how come you can talk!??\" you blurt out, a little clueless about the change of events even though the mystical tome was open and written in right in front of you. The book's pages had also started to glow faintly, although you only noticed out of the corner of your eye as you stare at your dog, open-mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, but master, don't you remember that I've been able to talk ever since you got me as a puppy?\" Bailey says happily, resting his right paw on your shoulder and licking your face affectionately. \"Besides, you've always known I was smart, haven't you?\" he laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong Bailey, I just wasn't expecting you to be this smart!\" you say, managing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the floor began to creak, and you look around for the source of the rumbling as Bailey smiles at you still. \"I just feel like I have all this untapped power within me! And I feel that I have this ability...an ability to grow bigger, much, MUCH bigger! Just for you, master. And haven't you always wanted a bigger, stronger dog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Bailey closed his eyes and began to shudder and slowly grow bigger and bigger and biiigger, the source of the rumbling confirmed. His body vibrated and expanded, filling up more and more of the room. His huge paws and frontside slowly swelled into you, pushing you back to the wall along with your writing desk. Bailey's backside grew and grew further, closing in on the opposite wall, pushing aside chairs, tables, and CD racks. The top of his head threatened to crash through the ceiling at any moment. He must have been 12 feet tall by now! The dog finally opened his eyes once more and smiled down at you, his tongue lolling out happily as he panted a bit. \"Pretty big, huh master! And I can still feel even more power in me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could respond, your writing arm is drawn to the book again, and your hand continues the larger-than-life story: \"Confused as you undoubtedly were, you couldn't help but stare in wonder and admiration at your bigger pet. Even though you were surprised and baffled, you couldn't deny that there was some part of you that wanted to see your golden retriever get even bigger...\" You finish writing the first small paragraph, and then your hand starts to write the beginning of the second:</span></div></div>",

You hear a rumbling from a different part of the boys as Melanie, your pet Dalmatian, grows like Bailey. Before you know it, Melanie has torn through the door into your room, the now seven feet tall Dalmatian eagerly licking all over you. Now that she is in the room with Bailey, she slowly grows to the same massive scale, her rear firmly pushing against the wall, her head cracking the ceiling slightly, and her muzzle blowing up into you by leaving you enough space to sit at your desk as the two giant canines happily pant and poll their tongues about, desiring nothing more than growth, playtime, growth, maybe walkies, and more growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand autonomously picks up the pen and begins to write again, with you watching what it writes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't help but be impressed at the massive size of your canine companions, and can't wait for them to grow more!

In our language, your word 'dog' translates to either 'protector' or 'guardian'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis explained Angel's behaviour to a degree. But you still had questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... but Angel, I don't need protecting. Certainly not to this degree-\" you gesture to Angel's body, which was undoutedly holding most of the house up, her body having grown into the first floor during her spurt. \"-and besides, this is the UK. One of the safest countries on Earth. And if I do need protection, then I'm pretty sure my cricket bat will suffice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel doesn't look convinced, however. If anything, she only seems more concerned. \"No, master, you do need protection! Think about how much you hurt yourself just walking around the house!\" Angel was referring to your annoying habit of stub of your toes on pretty much anything. It was extremely irritating, so say the least. \"And think of that time you broke your arm! If I was bigger, I could have taken care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to rub Angel's muzzle in the hope of calming her down, but she only seems to grow more and more frightened for your safety. \"You're not big enough to protect yourself, master! None of us are big enough to protect our masters! We need to be BIGGER!\" Angel roars, dust and plaster falling from the ceiling. Wait, 'none of us are big enough'... Uh oh. Managing to slip away from Angel's already bulging muzzle, you run up the stairs to the first floor, coming to the landing, which you knew had a window that let you see outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a dozen dogs, all far larger than they ought to be, met your eyes. Here, one that was a 'mere' eight feet tall; there, one matching Angel's size; another three dogs had burst out of their homes, plaster falling from their expanding frames as they walked, carrying their masters to different areas. And the largest of them all, looming over the horizon, was a titanic golden retriever, his mile tall form bulging and stretching and GROWING with each heavy breath, as the dog continues to fill more and more of the skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you hear Angel's muzzle crash out of the house, and she begins to talk in that loud, yet protective and concerned roar again.<b> \"SEE, MASTER? NONE OF US ARE BIG ENOUGH YET!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is then that you make the mistake of asking just how big would be big enough. The answer you receive, is of course, that...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The whole house started violently shaking as Angel began to laugh. Her bulging flank crashes through the wall behind you, the flimsy construct obliterated by the growing canine, as her back slams into the ceiling. The ceiling valiantly resists for just under three seconds before it's completely pulverized by Angel's massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs alarmingly huge cracks begin to appear in the rest of the plaster, you decide to make your escape before the house collapses and you are trapped in the rubble. As soon as you finish that thought you wonder what, if anything, Angel could or would do to help you if that happened and how she would feel being the one who outgrew the building in the first place. Although by that point, you've already scrambled down the stairs and have the key in the lock of the front door, which fortunately rather renders that contemplation moot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're glad to be on the ground floor by now, as when you yank the door open, the noise of the house collapsing around Angel's expanding form reaches your ears. You immediately dive out of the door and sprint down the path, turning to gaze upon the awesome sight of a Husky outgrowing a two-story house as Angel's head - her thick, muscular neck now completely outside of the house - turns to look at you - her eyes filled with love and adoration - and her furiously wagging tail and backside creeps ever closer to the neighbouring house as the roof begins to tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roof bulges upwards in an unnatural manner as slates begin to slide off, shattering against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the house falls unnervingly still, the only sound you can hear in your tunnel-vision state is the sound of your titan of a husky panting deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the roof bulges. Once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, Angel's back bursts explosively out of the roof; tiles and guttering thrown this way and that way as the walls collapse in near synchronization, a cloud of dust billowing up, hiding her huge frame from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble back, bumping into the thick, muscled leg of the now 24-foot tall Pit Bull whom you had seen at only 8 feet just a few mere moments ago. It would seem that he - Buck; and his master Jessica, a doctor at the hospital - had come over to investigate the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Are you okay?\" She gasped, looking quickly between you and the ruins of your home, from beneath the shelter of Buck's huge, muscled chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm alright thanks, but what's happening? Angel just started talking, and then she started growing, and now she's bigger than the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got no idea! It was much the same with me, Buck just started nuzzling me and then he started going on about how he and other dogs were going to become our guardians, and suddenly, he's crushed the sofa under his body and he's still getting bigger! I'm lucky he actually left the house before he hit this growth spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuck lets out a booming laugh, the sheer power of his baritone voice rattling manhole covers and setting off car alarms that hadn't already been activated by the thunderous, earth-shaking steps of the other canine giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is our home Master! Although, I don't think it'll fit me anymore, and it definitely won't fit any of the others!\" He grins, tail whipping around behind him, kicking up a breeze as he turns his gaze back to your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see a now 40-foot tall Angel shake the last of the dust from her stormy grey fur and trot towards you, panting happily all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Buck!\" She rumbles excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angel!\" He thunders. \"I see you didn't let something as weak as a building stand in the way of you preparing to become a guardian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel laughs in response. \"Well, you just took it a bit slower to start! No doubt you'll catch up soon though!\" She laughs again, looking over at the other dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even have time to ask them how they're all growing like this, as your attention is grabbed by the other dogs as you follow Angel's gaze, noticing that the dog that had was just finishing a growth spurt and again matched Angel's size was a Doberman, clearly a male, easily identifiable at such a size. Now, what was his name? Stanley, if you remember correctly, and right now he was lying down, resting in front of what you could only presume was his home, a broad smile on his snout as he gently rested a huge paw on the roof of his owner's sedan - not applying force, just resting it there - while he animatedly spoke with his owner - Nathan, the cashier for that little bakery a little way up the road - and pointing out the other dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid dogs were the trio of canines who had outgrown their homes, each of them now towering above you at a height of what must have been at least 80 feet, their huge bodies so wide, they had to stand with their paws in multiple streets, their paws easily taking up the entire width, lest they crush any houses beneath said paws that sink into the tarmac, their huge, powerful torsos looming over the rooftops with a great amount of clearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male German Shepherd, Simon's his name, you're sure of it, is gushing to his owner who's sitting on his nose - Keith, one of the salesmen at the Ford Showroom - about how easy it'll be to protect him and Lucy, his friend and the local joiner, especially now that the female Shepherd, Katie, is a 'Guardian' too, her tail wagging furiously, whipping up a wind behind her that was strong enough to shake parked cars, the ones whose alarms had timed out starting up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose cars were under the expansive shadow of the towering Rottweiler, Lou, who's currently excitedly explaining to his owner, the local mechanic Grace, who was perched atop his head, what was happening. Although, before you could hear any semblance of an explanation as to why it was happening, your attention was grabbed by a shadow falling over the neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the street, and likely everyone hiding in their homes in panic and fear, all turn to see the sun being blotted out by the still-growing enormous Golden Retriever, his equally enormous grin beaming out across the land with his long tongue lolling out, his deep, heavy, thunderous breaths dissipating clouds and then reforming them with the heat and moisture of his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his head blocks out the last of the sun's light, his growth stops, leaving his looming form illuminated from behind like he was some sort of god, although considering how big he was, and how many laws of physics and biology he had to be defying with that alone, perhaps he, and by extension the other dogs, were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow thickly at that thought looking over at Angel. Could she be a goddess? You have to admit that the thought isn't exactly unappealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to the Retriever, wondering what it must be like to be his owner, and then feel a thrill of concern as you wonder where he's sitting. You can only hope it's not in a populated area; the property damage would no doubt be in the billions, if not trillions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is taken up by Angel, who leans down to gently nuzzle your tiny frame as she giggles softly. She stands up to her full height again and beams down at you. She...</span></div></div>",

While not the most unusual sight, but this time there was something off about Mr.,and Mrs. Dragovich like you couldn't shake the felling that they were hiding something,but it couldn't be bad could it they did build this orphanage and the others and they did treat you and other orphans well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that you had look into it you asked to research a weird topic that caught your eye the topic \"Magic and how to hide to hide from humans\" and of course you had been given permission and here you thought that this was going to be hard, but that was not the challenge as there was a book for every animal inculcating those that shouldn't exist like dragons, unicorns, griffins, etc. see as those book shouldn't be there you decided to read those first and after a few days of reading and rereading the dragon one you had a inkling of who Mr. and Mrs. Dragovich were now they were the mightiest creature that existed and it made scenes how they could operator so many orphanages with little to no difficulty. The book took you that dragons could tell if someone had a pure heart with there eyes, but it was hard to cover up there true eyes often resorting to sunglasses to hide there eyes. Oh so that is why they wear those sunglasses, and it went on to say that dragon like to share there vast knowledge with other magic creature and any others that sought knowable.With your curiosity satiated for now at least you got up to put the book back when you heard \"no need for that at this moment young one\" and you knew by the low growl in the voice who it was Mr. Dragovich you quickly replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't reply vocally only gesturing you to come here, but with a manner that didn't suggest he was mad with you and you brought the book with you. he gentle took it out of you hands and read the title and said \"oh so you know now don't you well than there is nothing we can do now, but to adopt you into our family\" wait what you can do that? you asked a bit shocked. \"well the paper work has to be sortied, but yes and then there is your seal of approve\" he said, but you were so happy you rushed for a hug so fast that he was caught off balance that his sunglasses fell off reveling his dragon eyes and such a beutity color were they a rosey red that not sent a picture of calm though you.

You and him had stuck together for a while now, but he always knew that your smaller stature was always a sore spot for you. One day, you notice your friend is late for a hunt you and him were gonna go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is rushing over to you about a few minutes, holding something in his mouth. \"Hey bud! I got shomting for you!\" He says looking down at you happily. It looks like a strange leg of meat. \"Did you go hunting without me?\" You ask a bit sad. \"Uh uh! Ish a meat piece my family found, shaid it had shome weird properties to it!\" He says with the meat in his mouth still. \"Weird...properties? Like what?\" You ask confused. \"I shink they shaid dat thish would make you bigger if you eat it!\" he explains. You look at him, like he is just pulling your leg. \"Yeah, sure. Just eat it so we can go hunting already.\" You say rolling your eyes. \"Oh, guessh you need shome proof, huh? Okay!\" he says, before biting the leg of meat in half, the other half falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him for a few seconds and nothing seems to happen. \"...See? Nothing happened. Now come on, let's-\" You start before your friend moans loudly out of nowhere, giving you a bit of a jump. Before you can ask him why he had suddenly started moaning like that, you notice him shudder and before your eyes, grow a bit bigger. You jump back a bit, shocked and surprised, before he grunts and huffs and grows again, even more than last time. You are now looking even more up at him, as he stands at 15 feet and 9 inches tall. And you can't help but notice his dick is coming out of it's sheathe. And it looks bigger too. \"Mmm, told you it'd do this!\" He says grinning widely, before panting and moaning as he grew once more, making you take a couple more steps back. You were now starting to regret not taking him up on his initial offering. As he grows past 17 feet tall and still growing, what are you gonna do now?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A good while ago, there used to be an interactive on this site called Giant Friendly Animals, created by Kardo, who left the site just over two years ago. As the name suggests, it focused on animals of all kinds growing - growing, and growing, with no end in sight - but remaining gentle, no matter what unimaginable sizes they reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the efforts of another user who will remain unnamed unless they want to be mentioned directly, I came across a copy of a mostly complete archive of Giant Friendly Animals, and decided to start rebuilding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, the rules for this interactive will be as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">1. Stick to the content rating - E. Reveling in growth and power is okay, and innocent, harmless destruction is as well, but let's not have things like swearing, mature content, or detailed descriptions of gore, okay?</span><br>\r\n<b>Please see the edit at the bottom of the page - this item's age rating has been changed to allow for a greater range of content, though the prohibition on gore still applies.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Try to keep choice chapters to a minimum- or, if they're necessary, type at least a couple of paragraphs for them. This way the interactive won't be clogged up with filler - though as I'll be directly copying the old interactive into this one, this rule will have to be bent to an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If you want something in a chapter you've written to be edited, don't hesitate to ask me. Of course, if you want me to delete an entire storyline I might decline, but it's always worth at least making sure I know about your concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Please try to keep your writing to at least a decent standard. I don't mind if your writing isn't that good, but at the very least it needs to be legible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No fat or weight gain-related content is allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Make sure to have fun - lots of endlessly, unstoppably, insatiably growing fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a side note, all kinds of macro personalities are allowed - sweet and gentle, to greedy and power-hungry - so long as they remain gentle in their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>EDIT - 03/05/2020</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a conversation with a friend I've decided to make some changes to this interactive. First off, the age rating has been raised, to 'May Contain Graphic content'; this is for a reason - I have decided to allow depictions of both muscle and hyper growth in this interactive - just keep things relatively friendly, please!</td>",
