Moving to another city, your mom adopting a daughter, and taking in two other boys, marrying Barbara and her twin sister April, and finding out Trish was just as squishy and malleable as you were. But probably the most positive change you've experienced is seeing yourself be on top for a change. While you've still found yourself getting splattered and eaten, there's been several times when a girl gets smushed under your butt, or has a stay in your own tummy. On top of that, you've quickly made friends with most of the boys in your class, as well as some of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish you could say you enjoy it. As fun as it is to not be on bottom, you find the amount of attention you've been getting to be off-putting, as people seem to gravitate to <i>your</i> bottom. It's somewhat annoying when you're trying to walk to school and some lady just yanks your shorts down and forces herself between your cheeks. You swear your waistline's expanded four sizes since you've moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you're still just as big a target as ever. Gary is still one of the biggest thorns in your side, and to make matters worse, he's made friends in the form of the zombie boy, Gabe, and an alligator boy named Alex. And that's not even counting the older residents. Not even Mary's been able to help you, as she seems to be even more danger-prone than you are at times. You wish you could protect her, but there's just not much you're able to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe today will go by without incident? <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Yeah right...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's on the agenda for today?</span></div></div>",

Today you were meeting Mary at the beach and spend the whole day with her. You slipped your feet into a pair of black sandals and headed over to meet up with your girlfriend. You couldn't help but grin as you made your way over. Mary was the sweetest and cutest girl in the world, and you were lucky to have her as a girlfriend. If there was a girl more perfect, you haven't met her yet. And even then, you were sure that Mary was the only girl for you. There wasn't anything you wouldn't do for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie! Over here!\"<br>\r\nYou turned your head and blushed as you saw her. Mary was standing in the sand wearing a cute pink and baby blue one-piece swimsuit, hopping up and down to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-coming Mary!\", you cried, grinning as you ran over, your eyes shut in innocent bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here, Jackie! I got us a spot!\" Mary sat down and patted a space next to her. She was sitting on a white beach towel with a pink heart pattern, while she patted a towel next to her, a red robot-themed towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you walked over and took your seat on the towel and sighed. \"Thank you for going through the trouble of finding a spot for us, Mary\", you said sweetly. \"I got the whole day planned out. First, we're-\" You were suddenly interrupted as you heard a loud <b>*GULP*</b> next to you, followed by muffled screaming. You turned your head and gasped as you saw that your beloved Mary had been stuffed down someone's throat and was currently nothing but a belly bulge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the predator that's ruined your perfect day?</span></div></div>",

It was Brad, a big mean bully you met back in the water park at Silent Cove. You wished you could rid yourself of the memories of being pushed through his system, and now your beloved Mary was sadly going to experience the same thing.<br>\r\n\"Sup, Squirt\", he chuckled. \"Didn't think I'd see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you...\", you gulped in fear as you scooted away. \"W-what're you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh, me and my bro moved here months ago. Just thought I'd catch some sun...\", Brad then patted his girl-filled gut and licked his lips. \"Sample the local cuisine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's muffled screaming made you angry. You couldn't just let your girlfriend stew away in some big jerk's belly! \"Y-you better let Mary out, you big bully!\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well what're you gonna do about it, you little snotrocket?\", Brad laughed. You yelped as he grabbed your head and pressed your face against his belly, right up to where Mary's face was. \"I guess this is your little girlfriend, huh? Well give her one last kiss goodbye, cus this little lady's a permanent resident of Brad Town now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered as you were pressed up against his gut, frustrated at being so close to Mary, but unable to do anything. You hated to say it, but it might be better to let her digest and apologize to her when she reforms. \"I'm sorry, Mary...\", you whimpered sadly. \"I'll make it up to you tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad suddenly began laughing and shoved you away. \"Didn't you just hear me, shrimp? I said your little girlfriend's staying here forever!\" Mary let out a muffled yelp as Brad slapped his belly. \"D'you know what forever means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nuh uh!\", you whined. \"Don't you know what happens to people when you eat them here? They digest and get reformed the next day, you big dummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say I was gonna digest her!\", Brad chuckled. \"It's called indosom... ednosam... endisom... anyway, she's staying in my gut until <i>I</i> decide to get rid of her.\"<br>\r\nYour face turned white with terror. You heard about something like this in class. It was called endosoma. Predators with this ability could keep anyone in their bodies fully intact for as long as they wanted. If Mary wasn't going to be digested, then she could be trapped in this big bully forever, and you could potentially never see Mary again!<br>\r\nBrad then turned her attention to his bulging gut. \"Better get used to your new home, little lady... unless your boyfriend's willing to do a favor for me.\" The jock had a predatory look in his eyes as he looked you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you felt helpless. Shameful as it was, you often ran away whenever Mary got eaten. It's not that you were a coward. There really was nothing you could do. The bullies were all bigger and stronger than you, and she would be fine come sundown anyway. But this was a different situation. If you didn't do something, you could lose your precious Mary forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

That's harsh\", Brad said as he patted his gut. \"Looks like your boyfriend just ran off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes watered as you heard Mary's muffled sobbing. You weren't running away. You just wanted to get someone to help her. Trying to do it yourself was guaranteed to end in failure. But luckily for you, your step-mothers were both powerful demons! There was no way a regular human was going to stand a chance against them. You ran as fast as your little legs could carry you over to April's estate. You saw her and Camilla eating breakfast as their maid stood by. April quickly noticed you and chuckled as she waved. \"Oh hi there, Jackie!\", April chuckled, quickly picking you up and sitting you on her lap. You blushed heavily as she groped your plump, squishy butt. \"What brings your cute little booty here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya here to spend some time with auntie?\" The short purple demon bent over and winked at you as the two sisters chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... n-no\", you stammered, trying to hide your embarrassment. \"S-some big bully gobbled up Mary, and he said he won't let her out ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... an endo predator, huh?\", April said as she took your hand off your butt and held her chin... though you soon felt her tail brush up against your right cheek. \"That's an easy enough pest to take care of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll help me?\", you asked as you held your hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOPE!\", both sisters said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank as you heard your step-mother and aunt's immediate refusal of your request. \"B-but why not?! She's in trouble and I gotta save her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, kiddo\", Camilla stated as she leaned over and put her fists on her chin, giving you a good view at her juicy purple breasts. \"We don't help goody-goodies, and unfortunately she's the goody-goodiest in the city. Ain't bein' mean about it. Just our policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, there's plenty of other cute girls around here for you to play with\", April said. \"...unless you want to play with us, that is.\" Both demonesses chuckled as they leaned over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned beet red as you quickly hopped off of April's lap and you ran off, not wanting to think about whatever perverted \"fun\" they had in mind for you. They both sighed in disappointment as they watched your run off and out of the estate, leaving you back at square one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked away, you had to think about what you were going to do. Selena was also a demon, and she didn't always follow the rules set by her sisters. But that was an absolute last resort. As much as you hated dealing with your little sister, you were desperate right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRico was another option, but you had to be equally desperate to get him to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that Brad had a brother. Maybe you could get him to help you talk some sense into the jock who ate your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey was a bigger predator than Brad. But she was also quite mean. You knew that she wouldn't help you unless you did something for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother person that came to your mind was Maddy, your big sister's friend and roommate. She had a lot of knowledge of different kinds of predators from her previous home. She seemed to have a... thing for you, though. You weren't sure about getting her help, but you wanted Mary freed from that bully's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of who you ask, there would be some kind of consequences... but you didn't care. Freeing Mary was your main priority right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you call for help?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gulped as you headed over to the apartment complex near the beach. You peered out into the distance to see that Brad hadn't left. You weren't looking forward to whatever was awaiting you. You several encounters with Maddy, and none of them were particularly pleasant. It's not like she was mean. Far from it. She was one of the nicest people you had met since you moved here. You problem, was that she was a massive pervert... and you happened to be one of the cutest boys in the city! The first time you met her, you and Mary took an alternate route to school, hoping to avoid bullies. You didn't get picked on, but Maddy took you by surprise and yanked your shorts down, forcing herself up your butt! You had to spend the rest of the day carrying her around in your tummy until she had passed back down your system... and she'd force herself right back up there before the day was over. Every now and then when you visited your big sister, Nikki, she would perv on you in some way, either by hiding herself in the toilet and popping up between your thighs as you tried to use the restroom, or somehow getting someone to squish her up into a pair of underwear, where you'd suddenly feel her tongue between your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everyone keep doing pervy stuff to me?\", you thought to yourself as you walked up the stairs. You were always scared of going to Nikki's apartment. The zombies always creeped you out. Ezekiel was nice, but you still found him kind of creepy. You could never get used to seeing his eye pop out on occasion. And it didn't help that his little brother was one of your bullies. On more than one occasion, Gabe was waiting there for you to grab you and stuff you down his underwear. Nikki usually found out and punished him, though. You also learned to be afraid of the cheerleaders, who lived right next to your sister. They never picked on you, but they could be just as pervy as Maddy. As you got to your sister's apartment, you rang the doorbell, expecting her to answer. \"M-maybe if Nikki's there, she won't be too bad...\", you thought as you waited for the door to open. Your pupils narrowed as you saw not your sister answer... but Maddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing her usual white, red, and navy outfit and had a pair of pink headphones pulled down from her ears. Once she saw you, her eyes practically glowed as her face turned flush, grinning with joy. \"Jackie!\" You screamed as she grabbed you and pulled you into the apartment before locking the door. She hugged you tight, your face pressing into her breasts as she slipped her hand under your swimsuit and groped your butt. \"I didn't expect one of my favorite boys to come by...\", she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a muffled yelp before you lifted your face. \"Um... M-Maddy... I n-nEED your h-hELP!\" You occasionally cried out as she continued to give your cheeks a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Her face lit up. \"You need <i>my</i> help?\" A grin formed on her face as she giggled to herself as she sat down and set you on her lap. \"Whatcha need lil ol me for, Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... um... M-Mary got gobbled up by this big bully, and he said he's never gonna let her go! S-since you know a lot about different predators, I thought maybe you could help...\" You felt really uncomfortable asking her for assistance, but you were desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think... I <i>might</i> know how to deal with that guy... Butt-\" You yelped as Maddy dug her fingers into your squishy rear end. \"You're gonna have to do a... favor for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nonexistent spine tingled as she winked at you. \"Wh-what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to be my maid for the rest of the whole weekend! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Hehe... I finally get to use that cute outfit I bought...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you heard this. Under normal circumstances, you'd flat out refuse immediately. However, you were desperate to find a way to save your precious Mary. And you needed to take any help you could... no matter the price. \"I'll... I'll do it...\", you whimpered as you turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" You slid off onto the floor as Maddy jumped up and cheered. She quickly ran into her room and into her closet, grabbing a uniform and tossing it to you. \"Now put this on and make it official... and feel free to take your time slipping it on~\" Maddy sat down as you looked at the outfit and blushed. It was a cute maid's uniform... that looked oddly perfect for your size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how long were you holding onto this?\", you whimpered as you slipped out of your swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I dunno... how long have you been living here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you changed into your uniform as quickly as possible. You wanted to get this humiliating experience over with as soon as possible. As you finished changing, you face turned even redder as you tried to stretch the skirt over your pelvis. The skirt was a bit too short, barely covering your backside, and the thigh-high socks squished into your thighs. \"I-I-I think you got the measurements wrong...\", you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... I think I got them juuuust right...\" Maddy licked her lips as she eyed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered as you were dreading the thought of becoming a tool for her perversion... but you made an agreement, and hopefully Maddy would hold up her end of the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do with you first?</span></div></div>",

The jock's stomach was tight, forcing you to curl up into a ball, your face forced up against the wet, sticky wall. You only wanted to have a nice, wholesome little date with your little sweetie, and this big bully just picked you up and stuffed you down his throat like a piece of candy. To make matters worse, it appeared he had no intention of letting you go any time soon! \"J-Jackie!\", you screamed. \"Get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry, Mary!\", you heard Jack cry. \"He's gotta be lying!

Where are you going?!\", you screamed in a panic. \"Aren't you gonna help me?!\" You were shocked by your boyfriend's perceived selfishness. You couldn't believe he would just leave you there, trapped in some awful jock's stomach with no possibility of escape. You yelped as Brad slapped the bottom of his gut, where your rear end was forced up against, causing you to blush heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your little boyfriend ditched you, little missy. That's pretty harsh\", your predator/prison chuckled, his voice echoing around you. \"Oh well. Guess you're sticking with me, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled against the tight stomach walls, but found escape impossible, your feeble attempts only causing the jock to laugh. \"Y-you're wrong, you big bully!\", you screamed. \"Jackie's gonna find some help, and then you'll be sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if he doesn't?\", Brad asked as he looked down at his girl-filled gut. \"You got a lot of faith in someone who just ditched you to save his own skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... he isn't very strong\", Mary admitted. \"But he is cute, and smart, and he's the sweetest boy in the world! I know he's gonna come for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, whatever you say, little lady\", Brad chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Marilyn Evans, you bully!\", Mary cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever your name is, you're just a gut-stuffer now.\" You grunted as you felt Brad's abdomen squeeze you further inside of his belly as he stood up and felt him rub the top of your head. \"Better get ready for some company, cus I'm craving some burgers. Maybe my bro can hook me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't you dare!\", you commanded, which Brad simply laughed off. You bounced slightly as your prison walked over to the pier and over to the local fast food restaurant, Lucha Burger. Brad seemed to ignore you as he headed inside and ordered some food for himself (apparently, having an entire little girl in his belly wasn't filling enough), and soon began eating. You heard him chomp messily into his burger and gulp it down, the chewed up food soon falling on top of your beautiful blonde hair. \"Ewwww!\", you retched as more food began to get squeezed down and fall over you, \"This is so <b>gross</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get used to it, snack\", the bully chuckled as he began to drink some soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced as you felt the sticky, bubbly fluid drain down and flow over your head, soaking into your hair and dripping all over your face. \"It's... it's gonna be okay...\", you said to yourself as chewed up, saliva soaked food dropped over you and soda drizzled on top of you. \"Jackie's going to get some help and get me free... y-yeah... like a knight getting a wizard's help before he saves his princess from the awful dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach juices began to bubble beneath you and you felt him press his hand into his stomach (and you, by extension) before he let out a crude *<b>BELCH!</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to whimper, feeling helpless as you sat in the gut that would be your home for the foreseeable future. \"Jackie... please find help soon...\"</span></div></div>",

My little buddy says you did something to his girlfriend!\" It was familiar but you couldn't quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft, yeah? And what's the biggest slut in the city going to do about it?\" It was Maddy! You had heard Jack talk about her sometimes, she lived with Nikki and that burger guy and seemed to get along really well with Stevie which was kinda weird...But Jack brought HER to save you?! You can't imagine she'd be too much help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hid behind Maddy and gulped, it took a few days to 'convince' her, and while he did learn lots of 'interesting' things, he was a little worried for her. She walked over and nudged Brad's gut, rocking you a bit. \"Eating little girls huh? What, a grown woman too much for ya?\" She scoffed, shaking her head before reaching under her skirt and dropping her panties, kicking them off to the side. \"Let's see how you handle a REAL woman.\" She reached down and yanked down Brad's shorts. \"Jeez you really are a slutty freak aren't you? Well if you want a piece of me have at it.\" He laughed. THIS WAS HER PLAN?! You sat in shock...and several half-digested servings of fries, she was going to fuck him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy plopped herself down on his cock, sliding it in with ease as she locked eyes with him, undoing her hair ribbons and letting her hair flow behind her as she pumped up and down on Brad's cock, letting out soft moans as she fucked him, Jack left to just kinda...watch as she fucked the dude who was keeping his girlfriend trapped in his stomach. Maddy kept pounding away, even as Brad came into her, busting load after load into her, leaving him more and more tired and worn out. \"Holy fuck you are a freak.\" \"What, tired already? Better find yourself a pick me up, get something to eat maybe~?\" She cooed, barely breaking a sweat as Brad irked and glared at her before letting out a sigh, Jack watched as his stomach slowly began shrinking, Mary was saved! ...in a really weird and roundabout way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside you felt your prison rapidly shaking back and forth for about an hour, listening to both Brad and Maddy's moans as they fucked, would this really work? Eventually the acids in the belly began to rise, it was working! You never felt this happy to be digested as the acids filled your almost-home and broke you down in all the good little nutrients Brad needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up several hours later under the dark blue sky, rubbing your head you stood up on the beach and took a breath of fresh air. You were out of that bully's stomach! You walked further up the beach in hopes your little Jackie-poo was there waiting for you...</span></div></div>",

You know that she lives in the apartments with Maddy and the burger boy, but you've never actually visited them yourself, so you don't know which unit they live in. \"I knew I should've gone with Jackie when he visited...\", you say under your breath.

You try to think of where they might be and try to listen and look around for anything that might identify where Nikki might live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the outside of every one of the units looks identical aside from the number in front (probably a demand from the manager).

Not wanting to go hungry, you were forced to eat some of the chewed up, saliva-soaked food that your living prison had eaten. You couldn't eat too much, or Brad would just eat some more, and you'd have to sit in the gunk until he had digested it. Whenever he drank, you had to hold your hands together to catch whatever rained down. You had experienced your first taste of alcohol this way, and everything that came with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brad continued on with his routine. Although he had a large, little girl-filled gut, he kept on as if nothing was different. He'd keep up with college, date several women, and brought them home, forcing you to bounce around as he plowed them. Of course, he made sure to keep up his body, bringing you along with him as he worked out. You were uncomfortably compressed as he lifted weights and did sit ups, your predator not caring that he was practically crushing his belly's resident. He wasn't shy about showing you off, too, occasionally bumping you on your rear and making you squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, and there was no sign that Jack was going to save you. It was tough to sleep as Brad always slept on his stomach, squashing you underneath his weight and snoring loudly. Whenever you <i>did</i> get some sleep, you always had the same dream. The evil dragon snatches the princess up and grins wickedly down at the knight. The princess pleads the knight for help, only for him to run away in fear as she was sent down to the monster's scaly gut.<br>\r\nYou wanted to have faith in Jack, as well as your other friends and family, that they would save you from the belly of this bully. But a little girl can only hope for so long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it came time for the holidays. Brad was at a party, wearing a Santa hat and a bow stuck onto his belly, with the words 'DON'T OPEN UNTIL XMAS' written on it. You wanted to cry, but you still had the slightest glimmer of hope that you would be freed. Maybe a Xmas miracle was in your future. You were somewhat inebriated as Brad had been heavily drinking, and you were up to your chin in alcohol and chewed up snacks as Brad slapped his belly. \"Heya, kid. You still awake in there?\", Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\", you responded sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Wanna stay up to wait for Santa, huh?\", the jock asked. He grabbed a microphone from a karaoke machine and held it to his gut. \"What do ya want Santa to bring you, little lady?\" The crowd went silent aside from a few giggles from the other college students. \"C'mon! Tell us what you want for Xmas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped down some more of the awful mixture that you were drenched in. \"I... I want...\" Your voice blared over the speakers as Brad recorded your frightened voice. \"I want <b>OUT OF HERE!!!</b>\", you screamed as loud as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, folks\", Brad said over the karaoke machine. \"Should Santa give her what she wants? Has she been a good girl this year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the other college students shouting. You could hear some chanting \"YES!\" while others were shouting \"NO!\". You couldn't believe your fate was in the hands of some drunk, horny young adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that settles it!\", Brad said, though he gave no indication of what he meant. This was potentially your last chance to be free of this bully's gut. Will you get your Xmas wish?</span></div></div>",

As he walked to the apartment complex, you suddenly heard a familiar-sounding voice. \"Yo, jockstrap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked back and chuckled. \"Well well, looks like the shrimp brought a fat-ass gremlin with him... and that little burger boy!\" You groaned as you realized who Jack had brought with him. He must have been desperate to have gotten Rico's help. He was almost as much of a bully as Brad, but at least he couldn't keep you inside of him forever... well, he could, but not in the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... didn't tell me it was <u>him</u> you needed help with...\", Ignacio muttered as he backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-tt- Don't worry about 'im, Iggy. This loser's not gonna be any trouble for me\", Rico snapped before he looked back at Jack, who was cowering behind him and Ignacio. \"Just remember, you owe me for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I got it\", Jack stammered. He was scared of what Rico had planned for him, and Mary as well. But he didn't have much choice. Getting Trish to help would definitely end in disaster, the demons refused to mess up anyone else's fun or help a 'goodie-goodie', and your own mother was going to be unable to help, too. If he was more patient, he could possibly find someone else to help, but Jack wanted to save you as soon as possible. \"Just help Mary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got it\", Rico sighed. \"Look, jockstrap, I'm gonna give you a chance to give up this loser's little girlfriend before I show you the food chain around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped as you suddenly bounced around inside Brad's gut while the jock laughed. \"Haha! Already know it, shortstack! Big fish eats the little fish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ain't really that simple...\", Ignacio said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the FUCK up, burger boy! Or I'll smash the rest of your teeth in!\", Brad yelled, causing the short punk boy to shrink in fear and grab at his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRico looked back at his boyfriend and suddenly got an angry look on his face. \"What'd you just say?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me! Now why don't you and your little friends run on home or you're gonna be joining this little brat!\", Brad laughed as he gave his gut a nice slap, making you yelp as his hand struck where your bottom was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you fucked up, jockstrap...\" Rico scowled as he stomped over to Brad... and began to grow! With each step, the shortstacked teen's height increased until he was twice the size of the jock, and his clothes ripped off, leaving him completely nude! \"...you fucked up big time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly cocky musclehead gulped, falling on his rear and crawled away. \"Wh-what the fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like you said, loser! Big fish eats the little fish! Now stay there, little fishy...\" Rico turned around and plopped down on the jock, smothering him in the vast, squishy brown assflesh! As the giant teen boy sat, you also felt yourself being compressed even more by his weight! Brad suddenly began struggling as the booty began to literally engulf him! Rico's flesh began to ooze over him like a sludge, pulling the jock into his already wide behind. \"If you're gonna be an ass to my boyfriend, I might as well make you a permanent part of mine!\" He looked over to Ignacio and smirked. \"Bet you're looking forward to having a chance to pound <i>him</i> for a change, huh, Iggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnacio's face was flush as he watched his boyfriend's booty begin to increase. \"H-he, uh... he's not the one who bashed my teeth out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm just real sensitive about them is all... and he keeps fucking with me about 'em...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well, you're gonna be pounding him and everyone else in my ass anyway once I'm done absorbing him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Rico!\", Jack screamed. \"If you absorb him, you're going to absorb Mary, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shortstacked boi looked down and sighed. \"Ugh, fine.\" Rico began to shrink back down to his normal size, though he now had a very large gut, which quickly began to bulge and wriggle around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you better get me out of here, you fucking gremlin!\", Brad yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, asshole. You're just gonna have to deal with the fact that you got gobbled up by a smaller fish\", Rico chuckled as he slapped his gut. Inside the belly, Brad grunted as the corrosive gel began to dissolve him, making quick work of both the jock and you. You sighed in relief that your little Jackie's plan worked... even if you had now been eaten by two boys in one day. Everything soon went silent as you were reduced to nutrients and fat, further padding Rico's already impressive figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be several hours before you woke up, barely coming too as you heard the crashing of waves against the shore.

Cut it out.\" Lars sounded very mellow, but you got the feeling that he had his limits. \"That's what you get for picking on little kids.\" He then noticed the large gut that his brother was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Brad's chubby brother have it in him to help you?</span></div></div>",

You finally managed to form enough of a mouth to squeak out a yelp as she had started to grind her food on you in frustration just watching the fish woman leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Andrew, Barbie told me you were coming over, what are you doing flattened out here on the mat?\" She lightened up but notably did not remove her foot until a few moments after when it was clear you couldn't really answer her smashed down as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed to get your voice back under control before answering now that she had peeled you up. \"I'm supposed to hang out with Remy\" April had a very... fox like look when you said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Remy is playing at something in the far room down the hall, the one a couple doors down from Janet's room and the activity room. Although, Janet has a few friends over too, the Cheerleaders I believe minus Nikki and Brandy but... If you're waiting off Squishyness you could come and sit in with me, I've got a few more appointments but I'm sure we could have fun even then. I could use the distraction you know, it's rather stressful for me. ufufufu\" That was a strange offer, April usually didn't want anyone sitting in on her meetings, let alone her own kids and you were sure that you hadn't been offered before... but you did come here with a plan and despite promising fun Meetings sounded kinda boring...</span></div></div>",

It was also a way to make you look strong or smart to any demon although April's response was a little more dramatic than you had considered. Her 'disguise' flashed away in a burst of flame, leaving the red skinned demon with silver hair that was your Aunt's true form in it's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, how bold. In that case We'll play a game with... prizes. We'll play as many rounds as I care to, and each round the winner can make one <i>request</i> of the looser and the looser <b>must</b> obey as long as it is within their power. for example if you were to win and ask me to, just an example, grant you a demonic power, I would happily oblige.\" She smiled sweetly as if she hadn't just offered you a ticket to stop getting bullied so bad. You didn't even think about what she would do if she won before you grabbed her hand that she had extended to shake with you. The 'bad' feeling you got was when the hand shake felt like it was burning and you yelped and pulled your hand back, there was a symbol that you couldn't read on your palm now and when you looked up April was showing you the one on her palm. \"The deal is struck.\" she said with a playful grin leaving you suddenly wondering if this wasn't a terrible mistake. \"come with me to the office, we can start there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing much of a point in trying to back out now you walked behind her into the office, which to your surprise was quite large with massive chairs and furnishings and even a bigger meeting table off to the side of the desk. You wondered what kind of game you were going to play, you could barely see over the desk as you saw April's tail flicking over it like she was looking for something. You pulled yourself up into the chair. when she stood up again she had a simple game, checkers which surprised you somewhat. \"we can take turns deciding what to play, for now let's start with a light game. My next meeting is in one hour so we should be able to play at least two things before they show up.\" You watched her set up the board without saying anything, trying to figure out if you would be able to beat April at checkers, she was probably smarter than you but you were pretty good at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"can I go first?\" you would have the advantage and April agreed to let you play red. The game was surprisingly over in just fifteen minutes and mostly because you had been over thinking your moves, from your perspective April was horrendously bad at checkers she was even worse than Bryan! You were excited as April leaned back into her chair 'defeted'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this match is yours Andrew...\" she pouted as if she had been expecting to win with those terrible moves. Well either way this was your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can you give me one of those demon powers?\" you were nervous because you didn't want to accidentally break some sort of rule but for some reason this made April sit up and smile. She walked around the table slowly almost as if she were making it seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course~ One Demonic power just for you\" you looked at her hand and saw the mark glowing as she picked you up suddenly and kissed you on the forhead. A warm fuzzy feeling passed over you and stayed as she set you back down. She licked her lips \"The other powers require a bit more... intense rituals, I'm sure you'd enjoy but this one was fast and I'd like to continue playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kind of confused as you were a bit tingly all over it was distracting. \"What, what power? and why do I feel all weird\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril made a brushing motion with her hand \"just a simple low level 'pleasure' power, it will make anyone you touch feel a nice comforting feeling or... a little more if you manage to make it stronger. As for the weird feeling, it's probably because you don't have the ability to turn the power off so you'll feel like that until you train a little. It's your turn to pick a game though.\" She was very dismissive of your concern, and this wasn't exactly what you meant when you had said you wanted a demonic power. Why couldn't she have given you something like Natalie ability to shrink people Selena totally would have gone strait to that if it had been asked of her. You would just need to try again, it wasn't like it was a bad power but at least you wanted something that would work for you better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let's play checkers again.\" you said knowing how bad she was at the game you were confident you could win against her if you played this game over and over. Unfortunately for you this must have been her plan all along because even a couple moves into checkers you could tell you were not playing against the same person who had gotten demolished last game, she had held back on purpose because she knew what you would ask for. Combined with the distracting tingling feeling it took the game twice as long to finish as you were over thinking every single move and April out played you instantly even then. You saw her collect your last peace as a feeling a dread washed over you. She made a show of casually counting the pieces and checking her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darn, I guess I'll have to make this a quick request... my next meeting is in ten minutes that's not enough for another game before they get here.\" She tapped her chin as if she were thinking. \"Andrew would you please lay yourself down in the big guest chair until my next meeting is over.\" she asked innocently \"and no talking\" You had been sitting in the massive chair since it was the one that had been near the desk, it was big enough for you to sleep on if you wanted. When you didn't immediately start moving the mark on your hand burned a little and you fell backwards and laying in the chair limply. You couldn't even feel the strength to move as April walked over and pulled your legs onto the chair as well and laid you across it. You wanted to ask her what she was doing but even if you moved your mouth no noise was coming out as the red cheeks descended on you to flatten you out. \"Ohhh that power works nicely for you~ I hope my next visitor appreciates all your effort.\" she teased as she got off of your flattened body. Smiled as the door bell rang.. \"Ah that must be my meeting, Don't worry Andrew, I'm not anywhere near board so we'll be continuing for some time unless something else comes up for you or me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch silently as she left and then returned with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wanted to whimper for help, this was way worse than you thought. April sighed as she changed back into her disguise and walked out of sight. You weren't able to even move the chair to see who was coming in but whoever it was they were very quiet as you could only hear April's foot steps as she said some greeting or another and the figure came into view. Not that you recognized whoever this was by name other than the 'Giselle' that you heard from April just a moment ago, but her appearance would have frozen you gawking if you could have moved in the first place. The massive purple slime girl jiggled just standing still, her dark purple only broken up from what you could see by a honey colored pair of panties and a bright yellow bra. She was easily twice April's size, in both height and curves, you didn't quite catch her response before you realized that the huge bottom was coming towards you. You were surprised by the panties sprouting eyes and antennae as well as a mouth, it made a kiss face at you before the gelatinous mass crashed into you. The first thing you registered was the flavor, Honey with a hint of Grape as you were covered by the panties. The second thing was the pressure, despite being larger you had expected less of an impact from the pure jelly form of a slime, it was like she weighed dozens of times what she should even for her height. And even still it was impossibly soft, like a billion warm blankets laying on top of you, if you hadn't been squishy you feel like you would have just simply been swallowed by the softness probably literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven under thousands of pounds of ass it was almost like her body conducted sound, it wasn't... too uncomforatable so you decided you might as well listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And that's why you need to stop trying to claim the park as a part of your Queendom. I've been very clear about this.\" April's voice finsished the part you hadn't been paying attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight shift as Giselle crossed her legs. \"I fail to see how that is my problem, it sounds more like their problem. If they wish to leave their offspring within distance of my resting grounds it is only natural that I should see that as an offering of a meal.\" The purple 'Queen?' said matter of factually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell even without seeing that a response like that was just going to make April gnash her teeth. \"What I'm saying Giselle, is that I want you to stop encroaching towards the suburbs and I've got permission from the city council to offer you something in exchange for your cooperation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a focused shift as she leaned forward the weight sort of just rolled over you. \"Well that is different, but really what sort of offer. I'm not interested in your 'money' you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just so happen to have something just for you prepared-\" She started but a bubbly voice in your head drowned her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Giselle sorry to <b>Bee</b> a bother but maybe you could ask for this slime boy instead of whatever she's got?\" The pun was emphasized but you didn't really understand why it was a pun. You could feel Giselle's mood shift somehow, almost like she had touched your brain as soon as she found out about you. She interrupted April who was still in the middle of explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not take me so lightly 'Mayor' your true bribery has been revealed to me. Or did you perhaps think that you could hide a Male from my watchful eye.\" She said smugly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril of course had no idea what she was talking about until the dots connected in her head, she slid the magic stone back into her desk drawer. \"Of course not~\" She purred as if she had planned this all along. \"I did prepare him especially for you right there didn't I. I'm afraid I can't offer him to you fully though.\" She made a big show of being upset by it not that you could see. \"Although if you promice to stop bothering the suberban moms I suppose you could have your way with him for a day... after that you'll have to convince him to stay.\" Wait what was happening now? Was April selling you off for the rest of the day just to deal with this uppity slime!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no true male slime could possibly even <b>Think</b> of leaving after they've gotten a taste.\" It kind of felt like she was licking her lips when she said that. \"I think that's a deal Ms. Vulpis\" She said shaking April's hand. You felt your inability to move lift even as the meteoric weight pressed you into the inability to move anyhow. You can't believe April had just sold you off to... okay you could believe that, she even made sure you weren't going to be stuck for longer than a day. Yep this was right up her alley if you really thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said the weight lifted off of you and you got to look at Giselle's face for the first time, it was pretty cute at least...</span></div></div>",

She called it a date though, maybe that was a hint? Did she want to go to a date spot, you didn't know what a girl would be expecting from something like that but, you did have an idea maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just the place it's-\" You lost your voice as she dropped you causing you to splat on the ground, only now that you could see her feet you saw one of them was covered in a thin bluish film like a sort of sock or sandal or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, then we shall be on our way.\" She declared, without waiting for you to actually tell her what you were thinking her non 'socked' foot dropped onto you, but rather than the normal simple squash you expected instead it felt like your face stuck to the bottom of her foot and then your body folded in on itself forming something of a cushion over her whole foot. The world was exploded with purple, even the smell and taste the concentrated flavor of grape flowed over you as your body continued to twist over itself a couple of times as whatever force was pulling on you searched for something. It seemed to find it though as you felt a shiver of pleasure from something passing between her toes then wrapping back around into a 'sandal thong' only then did her full weight rest onto you again depressing the full cushioning you had been made into down to a paper thin film on the bottom of her foot. despite all of the pressure on you though, rather than overwhelming pain all you could feel was the pressure and a faint pleasant buzz The Grape was overwhelming it all though, you could barely think about anything else, especially when she started walking, the 'juice' practically oozed out of her. You thought you could hear Giselle talking but it was more like a whisper against the slapping of her feet on the ground, pounding you flatter and farther into grape land. At some point you had started feeling as if you couldn't tell what was even going on around you until you were ripped free of the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cloths were gone now, probably dissolved by Giselle, but you were covered in a thick layer of 'sweat' that you were tempted to continue trying to lick off of you to taste just a little more but you blinked as you looked around, she had actually taken you to the place you had been thinking of! Could she read your mind or something?</span></div></div>",

It was differnt from being unable to move from being smashed, that had some push back, this was just you relaxing too much to do anything. You could still look around so you focused on the door, the chair had been pulled out a bit so that April could smush you but it gave you a view of people entering which only let you know who would inevitably sit on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person to walk through the large double doors was April, her disguise had been put back up to answer the door and melted as soon as she walked into the room. The next person in was as surprising as she was dangerous, Desiree's human disguise melted as she passed the door as well, the massive Demon accidentally ripping her short shorts apart with her sudden shift. The Demon goddess was followed by two of her other daughters Camilla who looked somewhat annoyed and Selena or... Zelenica you supposed when she was in demon form that's what you were supposed to call her and she looked excited. \"Mother, I understand you had some news to share... It was short notice but I got a nice seat for you while we have our meeting.\" She gestured to you laying flat in the seat, The black skinned demon glanced down at you and quirked her lips slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one of Barbara's boys, how opportunistic since your sister isn't here to protect him.\" She said running her finger over your body, it made you shiver even though it was warm. But maybe Aunt April would change her mind if your mom would be mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about Barbie, even if she throws a fit he's agreed to a series of games so there's nothing she can say since he agreed.\" She grinned as she showed the symbol on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the purple skinned aunt had perched herself on an arm rest. \"Ohhh, games? You really stepped in it this time huh puddin\" She called you the nick name she liked using when you were squishy, based on your smell and taste. Camilla suddenly seemed much more interested in what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena had started searching for your hand and lifted it up to find your game mark. \"I don't get it? Why is games so weird? I play games all the time and this doesn't happen.\" She seemed more interested in the game than your situation. dang it why couldn't that brat help you out for once, Jack was right about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree scooted her out of the way, with her hand \"Well I suppose this meeting is about teaching you more of Demon Culture so listen up Zelenica the first thing is-\" and then the dark booty clad in golden leotard slammed into you completely muffling out every single bit of sound that was being made. The giant woman was by far the largest you had ever been sat on by, if April felt like a ton of bricks this was more like someone had dropped a mountain on you. You had definitely splattered quite a bit, spreading nowhere near the amount of her full ass but enough that you were touching skin instead of just parts of her leotard. She shifted a little every once in a while smearing you into the chair, there was a slight shift where she might have had someone in her lap but such a drop in the bucket barely changed how much her booty dominated your whole existence. If only you could hear what was going on maybe you could figure out how to get out of these games but you couldn't even tell who was talking through the pounds of booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tiny bit of sweat that got to you from her bare skin but the vast majority must have been trapped in her leotard, that was probably a good thing, you'd hate to find out what that poor bit of 'spandex' went through daily. Then she was lifting up, your body had done nothing to save the poor cushion of the seat from loosing all it's springy cushioning. You heard the final words as she stood up \"... and with that this meeting is over.\" and suddenly your body sprang back into your control, despite having been pulverized it was like all the energy you didn't get to use to struggle suddenly snapped you back into shape. You felt sore of course but surprisingly in once piece and not stuck to Desiree's booty. The Massive woman leaned down to talk to you for the first time since she arrived. \"Well Andrew, you make a fine cushion, if you ever want a more permanent position I have a nice office chair...\" She must have seen you make a face because all the color drained from yours when she said that. \"I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You know how I can get when I don't have Dommie to toy with, his weekend in heaven is so hard for me you know\" You didn't but you nodded because there was only so much contradicting you would do to the Hell Queen. \"So it's only natural I'd be a bit playful, how about after the <b>games</b> are done I'll get everyone something nice <b>deal?</b>\" She extended her index finger towards you, but you were concentrating on not saying or doing the wrong thing too much to notice her wording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh sure G- Lady Desiree\" You had almost called her Grandma, and that was NOT how Barbara had taught you to refer to her. You hastily tried to cover it up by shaking her finger but suddenly Selena's hand was squishing yours to the finger and then it was covered by Camilla's and then April's. You realized a second too late what was going on  and your hand was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them spoke in unison \"<b>The deal is struck, let the games begin!</b>\" You lost feeling in your legs as the 'fire' burned it's way into your body much stronger this time and a bunch of jumbled details collided in your mind. Flashes of rules and agreements that had been made while you were still stuck under Desiree, and the culprit behind the 'extended' participation was actually Selena. She wanted to practice with the family and since you were already there they decided that you could stand in for Barbra since she was busy. There were still no set rounds but the rules were different. Various games could have more than one winner and looser and in those cases winners would get a request from each looser, even in 'team' games. This had just gotten a whole lot more complicated and as soon as you could stand again you were sitting in a chair next to Selena and flanked by Camilla. Desiree took up most of the other side of the table but April could fit at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree spoke\"So as we all agreed the game doesn't end until everyone has chosen the game the same number of times and the first person to choose a game will be...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were kind of suprised they weren't making you go last but you were still a little out of it, and that dang tingly power that April had given you was starting to get more distracting. You had to think of something none of them would be any good at so you could win and get them to leave you alone it was way to dangerous to continue for even one full round. The one thing you could think is how antiquated that they tended to be, sure Selena wasn't but she was still terrible at... video games! \"tetris, we can play tetris in verses mode.\" there was a collective look of confusion around the table until Camilla snorted out a laugh and snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\na huge t.v. appeared on the wall and controllers in everyone's hands with tetris already loading onto the screen. \"Tha' rules are simple, match blocks to give your 'pponents 'dead' blocks at the bottom of the screen, playas that hit the top lose.\" She explained seemingly reading the rules from the start screen. You might have worried about that but you had to focus on playing the game since everyone was default set to be 'attacking' you for some reason. You weren't some world renowned player but April, Desiree and Selena had never even played before clearly as they made fumbling mistakes and Desiree didn't even seem to be able to figure out how to rotate the blocks. Despite that you focused and beat April first, knocking her out after the second speed up, and then Selena by the fourth while Desiree practically beat herself without anyone interfering by the fifth. You were starting to get confident, but even as you deleted block after block Camilla seemed to be evenly matched with you. but then you looked over at her, she was only half paying attention! when you looked back at the screen she slammed down the maximum penalty bricks and you weren't fast enough. the elimination noise sounded and Camilla's tiny wings brought her to sit on the table while you continued to look at the screen even as it diteriorated into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple skinned demoness had a grin as she looked down at you. \"Thought 'ch were pretty clever huh puddin' that's whatcha get for underestimaten' a demon. Now lick my feet looser.\" You felt the mark burn and your arm reached out before you could stop it to yank the boots off of her and notice that she didn't have socks before your face moved forward tongue out and started licking the salty sweat off of her foot like ice-cream that was melting too fast. Your eyes watered from the smell and taste but even putting your hands on her calf trying to yank your body away did nothing. \"and don't miss between the toes\" she said casually before turning her attention away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, I'm getting a new sound system in my room, order it with your card.\" You saw April curse under her breath and pull out her phone, you get the feeling Camilla had been bugging her about that for some time. \"Zel... hmmm Gimme a third of your candy stash.\" the younger demon made like she was going to say no at first but then you heard her yelp like she had been bitten by a dog and Camilla was holding a bag of what might be gumballs or jawbreakers. \"Calm down squirt, I only took a third. You're hordin' 'em anyway.\" The bag she had was one of those three pound candy bags, that was only a third of what Selena had! You don't know why Camilla wanted the candy so much but it seemed like a lot. You had cleaned all the sweat from the first foot and had forcibly moved to the second, leaving only the banana scent in your wake. \"and Mom... ah let me get a shopping card, I want enough for a full outfit from Hell. The top end stuff from Deavolo's shops\" Desiree conjured a card from flames and handed it to Camilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too greedy, daughter you know how competitive these things get when you take too much.\" Desiree seemed to be warning Camilla but it seemed like the comment was directed at Selena. You regained control of you body only to half and cough and Camilla to squeeze your tongue between her toes before you could get away. She wiggled her toes and laced the your tongue through the gaps before pulling away really fast and making it roll up like a cartoon. You were having a hard time getting the taste out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're really good at that~ loose to me again and I might need you to comfort me more puddin' you're even better than usual\" She kicked the shoes too the side and decided to put her feet in your lap instead of sitting in her chair right. You would have complained... if you could feel your tongue. Camilla meanwhile tossed some of the small candies in her mouth and you tried to focus on who was next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selena seemed absolutely livid that Camilla had taken her candy and it was apparently her turn to choose the game. You were not prepared for what she said though. \"We'll play brick by brick. You all know but I'll explain the rules for Andrew. The game lasts until one team gives up, the team members sit on the biggest team members lap and add weight until someone gives up. Since there are five of us but Mommy is so big Mommy and April and Camilla can be on a team and I'll be a team with Andrew.\" This game sounded like you'd have a huge disadvantage, it didn't make sense why she would choose to have you as a partner, but you couldn't complain. \"Don't worry since this is a Hell game the mark will be reading to see when you give up even if you can't talk. Mommy can you drop the blocks, twenty second intervals should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla and April looked at each other. \"Uh Zelencia that's not a game it's-\" \"Are you tryin to torture us you runt!! I Aughta-\" The two of them shut up as Desiree clapped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mark has already excepted it as a game. If you two would like to forfit instead I don't mind taking a loss here.\" She said calmly and they looked at each other again and shook their heads. \"good then each of you get a thigh... oh we'll sit on the floor, these chairs will absolutely break before we're done. Zelencia you're shorter so you sit in his lap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the chair fly out from under you and Selena jump right into your lap and wiggle to get comfortable. \"Ohhh that's a good idea, here I'll share with you so you don't ruin this for me\" You wanted to question what she meant but you were overwhelmed by a sudden sensation of pleasantness, the weight of her not quite crushing your lap didn't bother you anymore. \"Ohh this is gonna be so good.\" she squirmed as you got into the same position Desiree had with your legs folded under your knee. \"Ready! Start\" As soon as she said it there was a finger snap and a stone brick at least twice your size started falling from the ceiling, you almost panicked but it was too late. You and Selena were splattered to goop instantly. You expected the pain to overwhelm you immediately but instead you felt... excited, pleasurable? euphoric? Wait when Selena said she would share... another weight slammed into you and you felt the moan from the splattered form on top of you and had to resist the urge to moan yourself. The second strike had been a hit of ecstasy along with a skull splitting spike of pain. You tried to make sense of it but every time you collected your thoughts another strike rained onto you until you were only groaning along with her in time with the strikes. You were waiting for the next strike, anticipating it when suddenly the weight was gone. You were still blind as Selena was on top of you but you could tell the game was over. did you win? did you lose? no you hadn't given up it was clearly the other team that had given up. Selena was too much of a masochist to ever have lost this, if her sharing her feelings with you was any indication. Of course she was the first one to reform and you were left stuck to her somehow all rolled up onto her butt as she sat back in her chair with a light squelch barely noticing you hadn't gotten off on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, let's see. You were so mean earlier Sissy Cammi it makes me want to get more out of you. Ohhh I know, I want that Soul Drink you've been saving. I never had one...\" Camilla's eyes bulged as her face turned sour and a can not unlike a soda can whirled into the room and she tossed it over to Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning squirt, that stuff is way too strong for you, you ain't ready heck Barbie can barely handle her drinks.\" Camilla warned but Selena was already opening it and chugging so that Camilla couldn't take it back later. You tried to contact Selena but suddenly felt yourself heating up, why did it suddenly feel much better under her cute butt. wait why did you think that? She hadn't cut off the connection yet and you were getting a bit light headed from whatever she was drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, that's sooooo good. it's like a super soda! Mommy I want more can I have more for later please please please.\"  Desiree stopped herself from chuckling and reached into a black portal pulling out a six pack of the cans with different colors. \"these are yours, AFTER the game young lady, if you drink them all now you'll get sick.\" Camilla was nearly floored by how many Desiree had just causally happened to have with her. \"Aaaapril, I wanna club houuuse for my friends. leemy have a spooot.\" April sighed and took out her phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she seemed to remember you were on her team and shifted on top of you \"Aaandrew what are you doing down there.\" She whined yanking you out from under her. \"you gotta get your stuff too.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going mad though, Selena still hadn't cancelled her spell if she even could and everything was turning pink. When you finally spoke up you had been staring at April's slightly exposed clevage for a few minutes. \"Well? What are you gonna ask this time Andrew.\" you could only sputter stupidly, but the only one that seemed to catch on to what had happened was Camilla she wasn't about to say anything until you were done though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued staring and somewhat by accident you just said \"Boobs\" and your head bobbed up and down fixated on the jiggle. When asked if you just wanted to press your face in them by Camilla you continued bobbing your head until April grabbed you and shoved your whole head in her cleavage. They were so soft, you just went limp and let it happen as you were dragged over and the same was done by Camilla and then when you were deposited in Desiree's. Suddenly the connection cut off and you felt constricted as you slowly sank farther into the ebony cleavage. You were actually amazed by how much give that Desiree's boobs had, they were so soft that you weren't even flattened out by them you were just slowly slipping farther in aided by a massive amount of sweat you tried to say something but your head went under just then and then the giantess brought her hands up and smashed them together even harder flattening you out on the inside and rolling you around until you had picked up all of the sweat. only then did she set you back outside and let you reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say you're doing remarkably well at these games, and at... other things. Maybe you would make a good sweat rag too, you seemed to enjoy that quite a bit.\" She laughed as you shook your head and backed up into your chair. Selena was... not content to sit alone anymore jumping into your lap and hanging off of you, you were kind of afraid of how she was acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next game was starting and the one choosing it was...</span></div></div>",

Then we'll start talking, anyone who says the word that they were given looses.\" She clapped her hands together happily as paper and pens appeared on the table. Selena reluctantly let go of you and stopped trying to eat your ear to get her paper. You looked to your left, Camilla would be the one you were writing for, how could you make sure she got eliminated was there anything she said often enough that it would come up in conversation no matter what? Then the idea struck you, she'd been calling you by that dumb nick name this whole time so you wrote that on the paper surely she couldn't resist taunting you for the whole game. Everyone else had made their choices as well it seemed, hopefully Camilla knew what Desiree would say well enough to eliminate her too. You couldn't read your own of course but you knew what everyone else needed to say, 'Puddin' for Camilla, 'No Fair' for Selena, 'Only ones left' for April and 'Soul' for Desiree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around after nobody had started talking, April cleared her throat \"I forgot to mention, if thirty seconds pass and you haven't said anything you also loose.\" Selena jumped up immediately surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! you didn't say that before we started\" She accused and felt the paper in her hands burn up denoting that she had lost. \"Huh? Huh? what happened?\" She looked at the ashes confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the word you weren't allowed to say Selena\" You answered her quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's quite right daughter, you appear to have been eliminated.\" Desiree sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, even little puddin beat you without help this round\" Camilla laughed and felt her own paper burn causing her to stop in a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that was yours dear sister, it seems our nefew had you pegged from the start.\" She covered her mouth to prevent herself from laughing at Camilla too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla looked at you with a slightly more burning fury than you were used to, what was she so mad at you for! it wasn't your fault she was so predictable. She rolled her eyes and scooted her chair closer, and so did Selena. \"Not against the rules to keep on talkin if you're elminated is it?\" She asked, and you got nervous as the two demons closed in towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-but you can't stop me from being able to talk that would be against the rules!\" You nervously said as they each grabbed one of your hands you no longer had the option of trying to run. \"What are you doing! Let go\" You were a little panicked as April didn't agree to your 'addendum' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax puddin, I'm just feeling a little hunger since I got some time after being eliminated. Lemmy chomp on your arm a bit.\" You were about to refuse when Selena stuffed your hand in her mouth and started chomping away and you yelped instead. Taking that as her cue Camilla did the same. \"Aunt april do something.\" you whined as the two of them had started chomping their way up your arm treating you like gum. but she was practically ignoring you in favor of a present conversation with Desiree in which neither of them have said their phrase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yehhh shooo yummmmy\" Selena didn't even seem to be in her right mind and Camilla was just matching her pace up your arm. Thankfully it was nowhere near as painful as a full body squash but their slimy mouths and rhythmic chewing were a bother. You were trying to think of things to say still but they had nearly reached your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the weather like in-\" You were cut off as selena had reached the end of your arm and just shoved your whole head in her mouth, licking you all over and compressing your head down to a manageable size for her to chew when the pressure doubled. Even though you were already in Selena's mouth, it seems like Camilla had just shoved both of you into hers and sucked the rest of your bodies in mashing you together like two sticks of gum. The strawberry-esq flavor mixed with saliva and got into your mouth, it was like strawberry syrup but you were having a hard time keeping yourself separate, the teeth mashed and mixed you filing your senses with Strawberry Banana until suddenly you were spit out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game's over... Mom won as soon as you got eliminated.\" You lay there in a lighter pink blob more like Selena's normal looks than her hot pink demon form. You tried to move and felt a giggle from Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelencia <b>regain your senses</b>\" Desiree commanded and suddenly you felt a ripping sensation and a wild rapid shift until you realize Selena had completely reformed but you were still mashed up and sitting on her tongue. She rolled her tongue back and brought you back into her mouth absently chewing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird? Tasty though.\" She said mashing you until some 'juice' came out and then blowing a bubble. As soon as you were nearly as big as she was she snapped her fingers and you were fully reformed. You blinked and looked at her wondering what that was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree was the one that answered. \"If Zelencia hadn't pulled you apart herself you would likely have been permanently fused onto her somewhere. As thanks for my... help you will now know and voice your desires until the magic of our contract fades.\" You felt the burn in your hand as the magic took effect but... was that really a punishment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thankyou\" You weren't sure that you had wanted to thank her but as soon as the thought had passed your brain it had come out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camilla, I believe you have paperwork to file. You'll be doing that after these games are over. April, I have some souls that have reached assertion, you'll be in charge of the meeting regarding this.\" Desiree seemed to have had some actual work in mind for her daughters as well, who knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe games had two more rounds, hopefully you could get through them unharmed.</span></div></div>",

The purple demon hummed for a second as if she was considering her options. \"Dance Dance Revolution.\" She said snapping her fingers the dance pad appeared one large enough for Desiree to play as well. \"Taking turns, we'll do this elimination style Two players go head to head, looser added to the looser until only one remains.\" That was deceptively simple, and you were okay at games like this, not like Camilla had a significant height advantage. In fact if April was any good at video games she'd be the one to watch out for. \"Puddin you're up first, and verses... Mom you wanna give it a go?\" Okay so she wasn't making it easy, Desiree made the machine groan when she stepped onto it. You couldn't reach the screen so Desiree got to choose the song. You got ready to go since the song she chose was rather easy, you got exactly one step off before you were thrown completely off balance by the practical earthquake that Desiree dancing caused. You were tossed into the air and fell back down and then again, and a third time you splattered out on the left arrow right before the looser screen played. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree had not been expecting to win but she was excited all the same as she smiled down at you. You were about to try and reform and get up when Camilla's still bare foot landed on you. \"My turn next. Let's go\" She Started the song, a hard mode song even and flung herself around on the buttons slamming her boot into you over and over seemingly not bothered by the massive earthquake Desiree caused flailing about on the dance pad. \"Perfect Game!\" Camilla wiped the sweat off her forehead as Desiree feigned disappointment and went to sit back down. Camilla it seemed did not have any plans to let you go rest while the game was going on as she steamrolled both of her sisters. The match was over and it seemed like this time the one to choose had easily won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I think this time I want to make... secret requests.\" She said peeling you off the dance pad. \"Starting with Puddin' here, bee are bee\" She said stepping into a side room. \"Alright Puddin' you really got me last time huh? Lemmy show ya what a real gotcha is like. Reverse Desiree's command, Once you think of what you want you say the opposite, or just say what you don't want the most I don't care which.\" She smiled having given you your command and tossing you out of the room. \"Next!\" She shouted as you fluttered onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as Selena leaned over you. \"What did she tell you to do?\" She asked but you felt even though you could talk you couldn't tell her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much.\" You ended up saying and she took that to mean you didn't want to talk about it leaving you alone to actually reform. You had to win this last game, whatever it was you didn't want to know what would happen to you if you lost you had to ask for them to leave you alone, at least for the rest of the day since you missed your chance because of Selena last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Desiree's turn to choose a game...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After everyone had met in the side room with Camilla you were all once again sitting at the table as Desiree pondered what game she wanted to play. \"Oh I know, Let's play Demon's Dice. It's been so long since the lords of hell have been able to arrange a get together, I'd hate to get rusty.\" She said as if she hadn't just dropped that this was the kind of party game she would play with other demon lords. How were you supposed to win even? \"It's perfectly simple, nothing too complicated for new players.\" She explained as cups full of five dice appeared in front of each of you. \"It's like Liar's dice but each round the players will sacrifice one of their dice to the random dice pool in the middle. Once all the rolling is done we'll guess how many of a particular kind of dice there area, you can't go down in number or how many that you think there are and we continue to go up until someone calls bluff. The player that is wrong is eliminated from the game.\" You gulped, this was impossible wasn't it, you weren't a great liar and figuring out if any of your demon family was faking knowledge would be not worth it. You resolved to just try and play as strait as possible... the only problem was that by your first Anti you realized you couldn't say a single thing the way you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was actually where the bad news ended for you in regards to the game, Apparently the command Camilla had given you had made you nonsensically good at bluffing and before you even realized what was happening you were the only one left against Desiree who seemed... confused? It was hard to tell what was on her mind but it seemed like she didn't understand how you had managed to make it past the first round. You of course figured that it wasn't possible for her to loose now that it was just the two of you and you wanted to surrender now but you couldn't say it thanks to Camilla. You slapped the dice down one more time and peeked under... your pool was all sixes, that was either impossibly good luck or bad luck. Desiree looked satisfied with her roll as well. \"Three sixes.\" She declared, seemingly trying to corner you directly off of the bat, you knew there were more so all you had to do was go for no more than the number you had and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine Sixes\" You blurted out before you could stop yourself eyes going wide as you realized how ridiculous that would be, there were only ten dice left and each of you only could see four of them. Desiree seemed to realize as well and gave an amused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't giving me many choices... I suppose I'll call that a bluff.\" She said casually lifting her dice to reveal three sixes and a one, and then your dice to show four sixes, and finally the hidden dice... they were both sixes. Desiree opened her mouth to speak and then closed it again clearly shocked. \"You, win?\" She almost seemed to be asking a question. \"I see I see, very interesting~ I suppose this will be the last round, go claim your prizes.\" She wasn't exactly smiling anymore, more like a neutral expression of someone that had not gotten their expected outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, yes, yes now you could finally Tell Camilla to leave you alone. You walked up to her and opened your mouth \"Aunt Camilla, can you-\" you felt something weird in your throat \"Greet me with that cute booty bump every time we see each other, the one where you land on me.\" Your eyes bulged at the words that ended up coming out. You HATED when she greeted you like that, why? oh... this was going to be bad. Camilla laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no Problem Puddin' you didn't need a magic compulsion to get me to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to Get April to let your mom know what happened before you messed everything up worse.\"April can you make sure my mom doesn't know anything about what happened for these games for as long as possible?\" like that... Why couldn't you just shut up, this was awful! April smirked at you and started typing something into her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Selena approached curiously, she was confused at what you were doing but didn't seem to want you to stop. \"Selena please you have to- ahhh- next time you see jack squish him and give him to your friend as a gift from meeeee- ahh- in exchange for a date.\" The thoughts of how you could accidentally ruin your life were spilling out of your mouth like vomit, and you could hear Camilla barely able to breath from laughing. Selena was talking to you but you didn't even hear what she said over the pounding in your own ears. And then she was there, towering above you, Desiree waiting for your last request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered your mouth to stop yourself from saying anything stupid immediately like having her step on you and your eyes started going up, until you remembered what you had thought at the very start of the meeting. And of course you couldn't stop yourself from saying your twisted thought out loud. \"I want to know what that Leotard feels like, Desiree can you stretch me out into one for you.\" You felt a pit in your stomach, you should have been able to keep your mouth shut, but for a moment it was as if the whole world was holding it's breath and then a melodic laugh broke the silence. You realized that it was Desiree's, you'd never heard her laugh like that before it was... pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can! My, my my, I didn't think that true thoughts enchantment would get me such interesting results.\" She gripped you in one of her hands instantly smashing you to putty in her soft grasp. \"I suppose I should put a time limit on it though... oh no need for that, I'll just consider it if Barbra insists on having you back eventually. I should wonder how you knew my favorite leotard was feeling a bit of wear and tear, even soul fabric gets worn down a bit after a few centuries.\" She seemed to disregard the thought as she fully grasped you with both hands. \"now, I know you're quite stretchy but I'm a big girl. I'm sure you'll love being pulled to the limit though.\" She said with a sadistic grin as she pulled her hands all the way apart, like any resistance you might have had didn't even exist. You wailed and were surprised when the noise came out, that one pull might be the farthest you've ever been pulled out while squishy. You tried to look at the other demoness in the room for 'help' but they all seemed to be occupied not looking at you if they did feel bad at all. Camilla was still dying of laughter though. You yelped again when she took another yank, and another. Then she placed a foot on you and pulled up. You were having trouble thinking of anything but pain as you suddenly registered a giant mirror near you. Desiree must have summoned it You  were being shown what you looked like, Desiree was talking but you couldn't hear it over the throbbing in your head. You looked at your form, you don't know what you had expected but you saw a rectangular sheet of translucent material with the faint outline of a face comically stretched to the Dark Godesses massive size. \"... and a pinch of magic~\" you caught the last bit as you were suddenly folded in on yourself now looking out from the inside of a translucent leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy down there? I think I'll get dressed the traditional way, just for you.\" She smiled Suddenly no longer dressed in her golden leotard, her nakedness filled you with a mix of emotions. Then the ebony foot descended into you and you realized just which part you were looking out of. You were pulled up past her thicc thighs and snugly pressed your face into her ass Your eyes were just over the small of her back but your nose and mouth were over the ass and the next thing after just how 'perfect' you were made to stretch was how warm Desiree was. Almost warm enough to be a sauna on her own the beads of sweat were already finding their way to your tongue and, a few more flavors you were trying not to think about. She posed in front of the mirror leaning over so that your body was supporting the weight of her breasts and your mouth was pulled into her crack just a bit, you could see her skin through yourself. \"Ohh, you are comfortable~\" She purred \"Unfortunately this color doesn't work for me, since you're durable I'll just use you for both.\" She said matter of factually before snapping her fingers and suddenly you were identical to the leotard she had been wearing before, just now it was made of you instead of whatever else. You whimpered as she slapped her ass making you jiggle along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day wasn't over though...</span></div></div>",

Her extensive round bottom was taking the wind right out of you effortlessly. Sadly, the dream ended abruptly at the best part, with Kiki shaking you in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Sarah, stop dozing off so much in class,\" Kiki muttered with her fur ruffling towards her friend's care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry, Kiki,\" You said, gently rubbing your eye awake. \"I'll try not to next time,\" telling her. You then bent over, grabbing your bag as the bell rang. At which point, a hefty stack of books dropped on your hand still place on the desk that made you screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I was aiming for squishy little head of yours,\" Caitlynn affirmed, standing over you, giggling to your pain that was the music to her ears. \"Here's the deal, Sarah, I require all my homework done by you for tomorrow! Or else..\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what!\" Kiki ridiculed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlynn smirked as she grabbed your ponytail to that sort of bothersome response made by Kiki. You watched as she lifted her skunk tail, showing off her silk purple panties before shoving your face between her cheeks. \"This is what! She has the pleasure of serving my ass as panties all day,\" Caitlynn laughed, dragging your face further up her ass, letting loose a blast of gas right in your face. \"Phew, and that's only a preview. So you better not fail or do actually,\" Caitlynn laughed, leaving the classroom. You were in a frenzy coughing up the after inhalation of Caitlynn's repellent spray. It took the assistance of Kiki to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Kiki asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded, not having the heart telling Kiki you held a rancid after taste still. \"Look, I see Faith and Grace,\" you spoke, shoving the books in the backpack to join your other friends. \"Hi, girls,\" you greeted, trying to hide your stinky breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Sarah, Kiki,\" the twins said in harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls,\" you replied, having your head low hinder the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say where's Holly?\" Kiki questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went off to the library and told us to meet her at the mall!\" Faith replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on, let's go already!

Nikki <i>did</i> say that you'd always be welcome to try out... \"I'll meet up with you later. I'm gonna head out to the field\", you told your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna try out for the cheerleaders again?\", Kiki asked, a smirk forming on her face. \"You know you have to get your grades up to even be considered, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as Grace and Faith chuckled. Nikki talked to the headmistress and got her to overlook your grades if you could perform the routine with the rest of the cheerleaders. The head cheerleader practiced with you so you could get it down, but unfortunately, you were never able to complete it when it came time for the actual tryouts. It wasn't so much your malleable body that got in the way, as Nikki was just as squishy and she was the head cheerleader. You just tended to get flustered around all of the cute girls and it was tough to keep your focus and stay in one piece. Sometimes you'd get so aroused by their thick hips and plump breasts that you'd melt a little and have to get peeled off of them. If you managed to get on the team, not only would you not have to worry about your poor social standing or have to do Caitlynn's homework anymore, but you'd be able to be around the hot cheerleaders every day after school. You practically drooled at the thought before shaking your head. \"L-look, Nikki's a friend, okay? She set it up so I'd have a better shot\", you told your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna discourage you, but you don't exactly have the best track record when it comes to tryouts...\", Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it kinda seems like some of the cheerleaders might not want you on the team...\", Faith continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm still gonna give it a shot\", you told them. \"If I don't make it, I'll meet you back at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki put her hand on your shoulder. \"I'll head over with you\", she mewed. \"I wanna make sure no one messes with you during tryouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at your friend as you stood up. \"Thanks, Kiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith and Grace giggled. \"We'll head over to meet Holly. Good luck, Sarah\", they said in unison. The four of you would head out of the classroom together, though you would part ways shortly after. You and Kiki shoved your extra text books into your lockers and headed out to the field and saw the cheerleaders getting a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically drooled as you saw their bodies glisten in the sunlight. You were caught off guard as you heard a familiar voice cry out to you. \"Hiiiii Sarah!\" Nikki quickly ran up to you and giggled. You blushed as the cute cheerleader's trademark pigtails bounced with each step, along with her large, jiggly breasts. She stopped just short of you and squirted her water bottle into her mouth.\"I guess you're wanting to try out again?\", she asked. \"You're always welcome to give it a shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi, Nikki...\", you stammered before regaining your composure. \"*ahem* Yeah, I think I'm ready to try again.  Is there... any chance you could just let me on the team... you know, without a tryout?\", you asked. It was kind of selfish to flat out ask to be let on the team, but if there was a chance she could do that, you wanted to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki winced at your question. \"Sorry, Sarah\", she said in a disappointed tone. \"I know you're my friend, and I'd love to help you out, but it just wouldn't be fair to the other girls if I just gave you a spot on the squad. They're already kind of upset for letting you even try out with your poor grades...\" You frowned at her answer. You were honestly expecting her to say something like that. She noticed your expression and put her hand on your shoulder. \"But hey! I'm sure if you can make it through a routine in one piece, that ought to put their worries to rest!\" Nikki went to hug you, but then grabbed her nose and fanned the air. \"You, er... might want to use the shower first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sorry... I had a run-in with that skunk girl...\"<br>\r\nYou exited the locker rooms after cleaning up and changing, joining the other cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay girls!\", Nikki cried out, getting everyone's attention. \"We've got a potential new recruit with us today!\", she pointed over to your direction, which brought about a couple of claps from Jenna and Brandi, but the other girls groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this loser again\", Shauna groaned under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That weird bitch is just gonna fuck us up\", Quianna muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi, the chubby firefly girl, suddenly piped up. \"Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Have her do the 'lighthouse routine'! I've been dying to try it out and we finally have enough people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... lighthouse routine?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's basically the same routine we'd have before the pyramid formation we practiced, only Randi gets on top and... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was quickly interrupted by Jenna. \"She moons the audience and flashes the light in her butt\", the bunny girl sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as the firefly seemed really enthusiastic, though her mood dropped a bit when Quianna interrupted. \"Ain't no way you're getting on top\", the black girl snapped. \"You're gonna break everyone's backs if your fat ass gets on top!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi's wings began to vibrate as she suddenly started hovering and fumed at her teammate's insult. \"I'm not fat! I am <b>tiny</b>, and <b>cute</b>, and this is a <b>really</b> good idea for a routine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki thought for a moment. \"Well... I guess with Sarah with us, we'll have some extra support... Alright, Randi, we'll go with your routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firefly girl jumped up in the air with joy as Nikki reassured you. \"Don't worry, you basically know this already. You'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nikki!\" You looked over to the bleachers and saw Kiki cheering you on, though you were still worried about the other girls. Your fears would have to wait, as Nikki tossed you a pair of pom poms and started up her boom box. You were somewhat familiar with the routine, so you did your dances and posing as perfectly as you could. However, there were occasions when you passed by the other cheerleaders where you started messing up. The first time, you miss-stepped after catching sight of Brandi's booty. The second time, you suddenly tripped on something. When you looked back, you could see Quianna and Shauna smirking. It appeared they were definitely out to get you. Nikki looked worried for you, but she put that aside to continue the routine. Brandi, Jenna, and Quianna held their hands down and lifted Nikki, Shauna, and you, respectively. You could feel Quianna seeming to shake your leg and saw Shauna grinning over at you. You gulped as you looked at them. As much as you would love to get splattered on either of them, you didn't want them to mess up your chance of getting on the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Randi would run up and jump up, doing a flip in the air before hovering up to the top of the column, her wings barely able to keep her chubby form up for very long before she landed in yours and Nikki's hands, her weight already proving to be tough to hold up. \"R-Randi, you don't have to shine your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby firefly ignored Nikki as she lifted her skirt up and pulled down her spats and panties, the light in her butt shining brightly as the 'lighthouse' began to struggle beneath her weight. \"I-I can do this...\", you told yourself. \"Just a little longer...\"</span></div></div>",

Jewel of course had gone ahead of you to school, and your mom was already gone so the peaceful breakfast made it a good start. You at least were happy that you could wake up at your own pace, even if it was harder getting to school when you weren't with Jewel. The bus would be the big hurdle today since you hadn't gotten up in time to join jewel on her walk there or catch a ride with your mother Jillian. You didn't often take the bus because of it's inherent dangers, namely the other students but it wasn't like running all the way would get you very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell yourself today would be different though, it wasn't that hard to get through a whole day without being squashed, you could definitely do it this time, even if the record was not in your favor. A breakfast bar was good enough and then it was only a short jog to the bus stop. The usual crowd was there, The hunt sisters Grace and Faith and Jenny O'hair as they were the students on your block. Jenny was barely paying attention to anything but her phone and the cow girls would hardly see you if you stood too close to them so you kept a 'safe' distance. When the bus pulled up you were the last one on so as to avoid being caught underfoot, you considered where to sit since this was one of the first stops only a couple of seats were filled unfortunately that meant you had to choose a spot someone else was unlikely to want. The front of course was highly coveted but at the same time it was very visible meaning that it was easy to avoid accidents of people not noticing you since they could even see you from outside of the bus. The middle seats were unpopular in general so it wasn't likely anyone would be picking them if they had the choice meaning you could possibly skip interaction all together. The last option was to go all the way to the back and try to take the seat that would cause the least problems when you needed to actually get off of the bus. You wished you had made a plan earlier.. \"Hey kid bus is moving get in a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have any more time you go to...</span></div></div>",

The mid stop was the apartments where you were pretty sure some of the more 'dangerous' students lived. You practically held your breath as Lassie barreled past towards the back of the bus and the cheer squad started piling in. That was when your plan started to backfire, Quiana had stopped at your seat with a pensive look on her face. \"Scoot in green boi, I feel like sitting up here today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated a moment but you got a look from the bus driver, it would get you sent to the principal if you decided not to listen to Quiana since she was a Blue vest student. Reluctantly you moved closer to the window and the dark skinned cheerleader plopped down next to you. You tried to not pay attention to her, but it was very obvious that she was staring at you. \"Uh, can I help you?\" That was probably a poor choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked \"Hmm I wonder.\" She licked her lips and you swallowed nervously, that was usually a bad sign. \"I think you might just be able to,\" She was leaning over you so you'd have to tilt your head up to look at her face or else you would just be buried in her boobs. She took the opportunity to put her finger on your head and spin you around until she could flip you to the exact opposite of a sitting position with your head hanging off the side and your feet up. \"Just hold still like that for a sec\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell if she was just messing with you or not but that was obvious the moment she stood up slightly and moved herself over you, this was a bad scenario. You tried to move a bit but your brain short circuited when she pulled her own panties down and plopped her bare rump right onto your body, only your head was sticking out between her legs and if she closed her thighs she'd be smooshing your face. \"wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe silenced you by pulling the back of your head so your face wound up in her pussy. \"Shhh, I'm just feeling a little hot. Do a good job and you're free once we're off the bus, Heck I'll even make sure you ain't left behind.\" You try to tell her to let you go but all that did was stimulate her a bit and it was clear you weren't going to get a chance to talk your way out, was it really that bad of a deal?</span></div></div>",

You knew there were quite a few stops on the way so it was just the case that you would have to watch them. This couldn't hold your interest forever though and after one or two stops you were very tempted to take a short nap. The lack of people coming to bother you contributed a fair bit to your heavy lidded approach since it would be another half an hour before you would even get to the school being one of the first stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a startling jolt to the long bench that was the back seat that snapped you to attention, the blue hair and black vest caught your attention as the students with black shirts were few and far between Hilda if you recalled her name correctly but she had sat on the other side but there was still a shadow coming over you and the dread was immediate. Lassie was one of the other black vest students but unlike Hilda the dog girl was massive even compared to most of the other students and had a bad habit of not listening to or noticing the much smaller students. In fact she looked like she was simply skipping along with here eyes closed towards the back. You scrambled into the corner to make room but scooting wasn't fast enough you tried to stand up and move but tripped over your own feet in a panic. You rolled over just in time to get a look at the 'Moondog' wrestling logo on her panties before the booty they were covering crashed into you with a particularly loud SQUISH and a slow hiss as the actual material of the seat caved in to her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meteor impact of furry butt would have been bad enough just resting on top of you but Lassie wiggled and lifted and dropped again having sat her tail down wrong farther splattering you across her massive rear. You felt the slight jiggle above as her tail started to wag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hildy look they added squishy cushi to the seat!\" She seemed to not actually have noticed you at all and attributed it to extra padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I don't feel it.\" The blue haired girl casually waved the excited dog girl off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLassie looked confused for a moment but then lifted up and dropped down again making another much softer squishing sound. \"Ehhh? But it makes a squish noise.\" She bounced again still easily covering your whole body with her butt even as she spread it out. The day had started off so good too...</span></div></div>",

You are the daughter of the mayor of another popular city, Irma Solos, and were granted a boon by the Goddess Ishtef that gave you a squishy, malleable body that tasted of green apples. Your mother sent you to live in Spectrum Bay under the assumption that it was just an ordinary city filled with different peoples, attempting to rid you of your perverted nature and urges. You just can't help but dive down people's throats or force yourself up their butts. It just feels too good!<br>\r\nIt came as a bit of a surprise, then, that Spectrum Bay was not only just as bad as your former home of Ishtef, but was the main reason other people move over here. It's literally the backbone of the city's economy.<br>\r\nHowever, you're still committed to trying to finish school. Your grades have always been poor because of how easy it is for you to get distracted by some cute boy's bulge and try to force yourself down his pants. This year, your grades are actually good, and you might have a chance to graduate this year (though, your attendance is still a problem).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly made friends with Nikki, the head cheerleader and one of the more popular girls in school, and probably the nicest girl in town. She tries to keep you from doing anything pervy to her little brothers or the zombies, but it's so hard to keep your urges in check when they're just so <b>cute</b>! The only one you're able to control yourself around is Ezekiel, the teen zombie boy in one of the other apartments, and only because he's Nikki's boyfriend.<br>\r\nBoth of you live in an apartment owned by Ignacio Lopez, the cute latino boy who manages the local Lucha Burger. You wished he was up for more fun, but he's usually too tired or stoned to do anything.<br>\r\nNikki's been trying to get you to go out with her and Zekey for the night, along with Iggy and his boyfriend, Rico (with whom you've had <i>many</i> encounters with).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately, you've become the babysitter for Stevie Morrison, looking after the innocently sadistic little boy and gleefully going along with his little games and becoming little more than a toy for him. Barbara doesn't seem to mind at all, just happy that someone is actually willing to watch him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could hear Nikki's pop music playing as she helped Ignacio get ready while you got dressed yourself. Earlier, you were upset that Barbara had called you to let you know she didn't need you tonight, and more so when you found out Ignacio had plans. But your spirits were lifted when he and Nikki invited you to join them. You wore your usual white, red, and navy outfit and sat in the living room. \"Come ooonnnn\", you whined. \"It's gonna be daytime before you and burger boy finish...\" Suddenly, the music stopped and the door opened. Nikki walked out with her hair out of her trademark pigtails, allowed to hang down, wearing a cute white and black top, with pink lipstick and a pair of black high heels. What made your jaw drop, though, was Ignacio. She had combed his mohawk to the side, covering the left side of his head, and dressed him in a plaid purple skirt, and a purple camisole under a black long-sleeved net shirt... though he still had a pair of black boots and his mask. You never could understand why he never took it off... or how he ate with it on. \"Oh my gosh! You made Iggy look so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour short roommate blushed and looked away. \"I... think this might've been a bad idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh quit being such a grump\", Nikki said as she bent down to his level. \"Rico's gonna like it~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah, of course... but that's not what I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIggy was interrupted as a car honked outside and Nikki squealed. \"That's Zekey! C'mon, let's go!\" She quickly snatched up Ignacio and ran outside, leaving you to lock the door. You quickly followed them downstairs and found Nikki's zombie boyfriend, Ezekiel, standing outside. He was wearing a greaser-style getup. A pair of skinny black jeans, a studded belt, a tank top, and a leather vest, along with the bandages he used to cover the stitches holding him together. With him was Rico Salazar, Ignacio's boyfriend. He was wearing a pair of skinny jeans as well, though they appeared to be a bit too small, as they struggled to contain his fat, squishy booty. He also had on a pair of custom order shoes, an open white shirt (which exposed his chest and the lil bit of tummy pudge), and a purple thong with both the side straps visible for all to see. As usual, he was paying more attention to his phone than anything else. Nikki ran down and dropped Ignacio off and hugged her Zekey, giving him a kiss and leaving pink lipstick on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rico looked up from his phone at Ignacio. \"Um... Nikki dressed me like this... I don't hate it, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we're definitely gonna have to get you out of that soon\", Rico said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I mean, I don't think it's <i>that</i> bad...\" Ignacio saw that the shortstacked boy had a hungry look in his eyes and was biting his lips. The short grumpy manager's face turned bright red, even showing through his mask as he tried to look away. \"O-oh... you mean that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you sneaked over, trying to get your face between Iggy's cheeks... only for Rico to pull him away, and bring him in for a selfie, causing you to splat face-first into the car. You grumbled as you peeled yourself off the side as Ezekiel came to help. \"Oh hey, Maddy\", he said in a sort of monotone voice. \"Nice to see you're joining us, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as he went to help. Even though he was Nikki's boyfriend, it was hard not to stare at the cute zombie boy. \"Y-yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staring was interrupted as Nikki ran over to hug him. \"Zekey and Rico found this new club that opened up, so we're gonna stop there first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was <i>gonna</i> play there tonight, but those assholes tried to lowball me\", Rico grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're probably worried about budget stuff... or something\", Ignacio yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked as you bent down to your roommate's level. \"Awww, is Iggy feeling sweepy?\", you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, pervert\", he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you two quit bitching. Let's get there before it gets too crowded.\" Ezekiel unlocked the car and got into the driver's seat, while Nikki got in the front seat and you and Ignacio got in back, though you quickly noticed that there wasn't enough room. \"Oh yeah, there's only enough room for four in my mom's car... I didn't think the gremlin was gonna come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... guess I'm gonna have to share with someone...\", Rico said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened and you practically drooled at the thought of the short latino boy's fat ass squishing you into the seat... but your hopes were crushed along with Ignacio's abdomen as you heard the wind get knocked out of his lungs as Rico plopped his thick booty on top of his boyfriend. \"Lucky...\", you grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzekiel drove around, appearing to be lost before stopping at a parking lot of a large night club. He and the others got out (with Ignacio gasping as his boyfriend hopped off of him) and the five of you began to walk up. You clenched your skirt as you saw all of the cute guys walking around. You wanted to just yank their pants off and force yourself down their cocks, but you promised Nikki that you'd try to control yourself. You all walked past the bouncer before Ezekiel got a table. \"I gotta eat something first\", the zombie boy said. \"Hunger pangs are startin' to get bad, and I don't wanna freak out or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but we just got here\", Nikki whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be up in a bit, babe\", Zeke said. \"Don't let me keep you from having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... okay. You know where to find me~\" Nikki blew Ezekiel a kiss before heading out on the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched your friend head out, you were still practically drooling. Maybe Nikki wouldn't notice if you had a <i>little</i> fun...</span></div></div>",

You have the thankless job of running the only fast food restaurant in town, Lucha Burger. Very rarely do you go a day without having trouble with either one of the customers or one of your employees. Although, even you admit that you're pretty stubborn at times. You hate having to deal with special orders or coupons, sometimes denying them outright. And you hate having to change your employees schedule up when they want to change their hours. This has led you to becoming pretty unpopular. As long as you get through the day in one piece, you don't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the manager, you don't get much free time to yourself. What little free time you do get, you try to spend with your boyfriend, Rico. Because he's a fairly popular DJ though, your schedules don't always match up, but you still end up spending the night at each others houses often. For some reason, you aren't stubborn at all around him. You're always up for whatever he wants to do, even if it involves you spending hours with your face wedged between his fat asscheeks or being led around on a leash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour roommates get on your nerves sometimes, but they're too sweet for you to actually be mad at. They sometimes bring the kids that they babysit in the apartment, and have parties while you're trying to sleep. On more than one occasion, someone's sneaked into your room and had you as a snack while you were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been trying to keep up your reputation as a pred, but it's been pretty tough lately. Especially since the little slime guy, Dominic, has gotten a taste for you. It's pretty humiliating being prey for someone who's seen exclusively as prey themselves, but you kinda enjoy it. He's kind of cute, even if he's a couple hundred years your senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going on today?</span></div></div>",

Vore is commonplace, and there are several residents who's bodies are squishy and malleable (and rather tasty). Just because they're vulnerable, though, doesn't mean they're at the bottom of the food chain. With enough practice, anyone can be a predator... sometimes someone will simply shove themselves right up your booty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's more than just vore going on, though. If you aren't careful, you could be turned <i>into</i> a squishie, or even end up in someone's underwear drawer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a city full of different species of predators, it can be difficult to make it through the day without something going wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA list of characters within the world of Spectrum Bay.

While some characters can be digested or smashed, they will walk out of the ocean and onto the beach once the sun sets as if nothing happened... though they'll walk out without their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) You can switch to another character at any time. Just try to have the switch make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Some characters are meant to only interact with certain characters. Please respect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Try to use proper grammar and punctuation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Please keep chapter at a decent length. No one-sentence chapters. Bridge chapters are understandable, but try to limit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) If you'd like, you can introduce your own character in the \"new student\" or \"tourist\" choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) Just about anything is allowed.
