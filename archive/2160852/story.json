Moving to another city, your mom adopting a daughter, and taking in two other boys, marrying Barbara and her twin sister April, and finding out Trish was just as squishy and malleable as you were. But probably the most positive change you've experienced is seeing yourself be on top for a change. While you've still found yourself getting splattered and eaten, there's been several times when a girl gets smushed under your butt, or has a stay in your own tummy. On top of that, you've quickly made friends with most of the boys in your class, as well as some of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish you could say you enjoy it. As fun as it is to not be on bottom, you find the amount of attention you've been getting to be off-putting, as people seem to gravitate to <i>your</i> bottom. It's somewhat annoying when you're trying to walk to school and some lady just yanks your shorts down and forces herself between your cheeks. You swear your waistline's expanded four sizes since you've moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you're still just as big a target as ever. Gary is still one of the biggest thorns in your side, and to make matters worse, he's made friends in the form of the zombie boy, Gabe, and an alligator boy named Alex. And that's not even counting the older residents. Not even Mary's been able to help you, as she seems to be even more danger-prone than you are at times. You wish you could protect her, but there's just not much you're able to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe today will go by without incident? <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Yeah right...</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's on the agenda for today?</span></div></div>",

Today you were meeting Mary at the beach and spend the whole day with her. You slipped your feet into a pair of black sandals and headed over to meet up with your girlfriend. You couldn't help but grin as you made your way over. Mary was the sweetest and cutest girl in the world, and you were lucky to have her as a girlfriend. If there was a girl more perfect, you haven't met her yet. And even then, you were sure that Mary was the only girl for you. There wasn't anything you wouldn't do for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie! Over here!\"<br>\r\nYou turned your head and blushed as you saw her. Mary was standing in the sand wearing a cute pink and baby blue one-piece swimsuit, hopping up and down to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-coming Mary!\", you cried, grinning as you ran over, your eyes shut in innocent bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here, Jackie! I got us a spot!\" Mary sat down and patted a space next to her. She was sitting on a white beach towel with a pink heart pattern, while she patted a towel next to her, a red robot-themed towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you walked over and took your seat on the towel and sighed. \"Thank you for going through the trouble of finding a spot for us, Mary\", you said sweetly. \"I got the whole day planned out. First, we're-\" You were suddenly interrupted as you heard a loud <b>*GULP*</b> next to you, followed by muffled screaming. You turned your head and gasped as you saw that your beloved Mary had been stuffed down someone's throat and was currently nothing but a belly bulge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the predator that's ruined your perfect day?</span></div></div>",

It was Brad, a big mean bully you met back in the water park at Silent Cove. You wished you could rid yourself of the memories of being pushed through his system, and now your beloved Mary was sadly going to experience the same thing.<br>\r\n\"Sup, Squirt\", he chuckled. \"Didn't think I'd see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you...\", you gulped in fear as you scooted away. \"W-what're you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh, me and my bro moved here months ago. Just thought I'd catch some sun...\", Brad then patted his girl-filled gut and licked his lips. \"Sample the local cuisine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's muffled screaming made you angry. You couldn't just let your girlfriend stew away in some big jerk's belly! \"Y-you better let Mary out, you big bully!\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well what're you gonna do about it, you little snotrocket?\", Brad laughed. You yelped as he grabbed your head and pressed your face against his belly, right up to where Mary's face was. \"I guess this is your little girlfriend, huh? Well give her one last kiss goodbye, cus this little lady's a permanent resident of Brad Town now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered as you were pressed up against his gut, frustrated at being so close to Mary, but unable to do anything. You hated to say it, but it might be better to let her digest and apologize to her when she reforms. \"I'm sorry, Mary...\", you whimpered sadly. \"I'll make it up to you tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad suddenly began laughing and shoved you away. \"Didn't you just hear me, shrimp? I said your little girlfriend's staying here forever!\" Mary let out a muffled yelp as Brad slapped his belly. \"D'you know what forever means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nuh uh!\", you whined. \"Don't you know what happens to people when you eat them here? They digest and get reformed the next day, you big dummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say I was gonna digest her!\", Brad chuckled. \"It's called indosom... ednosam... endisom... anyway, she's staying in my gut until <i>I</i> decide to get rid of her.\"<br>\r\nYour face turned white with terror. You heard about something like this in class. It was called endosoma. Predators with this ability could keep anyone in their bodies fully intact for as long as they wanted. If Mary wasn't going to be digested, then she could be trapped in this big bully forever, and you could potentially never see Mary again!<br>\r\nBrad then turned her attention to his bulging gut. \"Better get used to your new home, little lady... unless your boyfriend's willing to do a favor for me.\" The jock had a predatory look in his eyes as he looked you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you felt helpless. Shameful as it was, you often ran away whenever Mary got eaten. It's not that you were a coward. There really was nothing you could do. The bullies were all bigger and stronger than you, and she would be fine come sundown anyway. But this was a different situation. If you didn't do something, you could lose your precious Mary forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

That's harsh\", Brad said as he patted his gut. \"Looks like your boyfriend just ran off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes watered as you heard Mary's muffled sobbing. You weren't running away. You just wanted to get someone to help her. Trying to do it yourself was guaranteed to end in failure. But luckily for you, your step-mothers were both powerful demons! There was no way a regular human was going to stand a chance against them. You ran as fast as your little legs could carry you over to April's estate. You saw her and Camilla eating breakfast as their maid stood by. April quickly noticed you and chuckled as she waved. \"Oh hi there, Jackie!\", April chuckled, quickly picking you up and sitting you on her lap. You blushed heavily as she groped your plump, squishy butt. \"What brings your cute little booty here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya here to spend some time with auntie?\" The short purple demon bent over and winked at you as the two sisters chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... n-no\", you stammered, trying to hide your embarrassment. \"S-some big bully gobbled up Mary, and he said he won't let her out ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... an endo predator, huh?\", April said as she took your hand off your butt and held her chin... though you soon felt her tail brush up against your right cheek. \"That's an easy enough pest to take care of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll help me?\", you asked as you held your hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOPE!\", both sisters said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank as you heard your step-mother and aunt's immediate refusal of your request. \"B-but why not?! She's in trouble and I gotta save her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, kiddo\", Camilla stated as she leaned over and put her fists on her chin, giving you a good view at her juicy purple breasts. \"We don't help goody-goodies, and unfortunately she's the goody-goodiest in the city. Ain't bein' mean about it. Just our policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, there's plenty of other cute girls around here for you to play with\", April said. \"...unless you want to play with us, that is.\" Both demonesses chuckled as they leaned over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned beet red as you quickly hopped off of April's lap and you ran off, not wanting to think about whatever perverted \"fun\" they had in mind for you. They both sighed in disappointment as they watched your run off and out of the estate, leaving you back at square one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked away, you had to think about what you were going to do. Selena was also a demon, and she didn't always follow the rules set by her sisters. But that was an absolute last resort. As much as you hated dealing with your little sister, you were desperate right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRico was another option, but you had to be equally desperate to get him to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that Brad had a brother. Maybe you could get him to help you talk some sense into the jock who ate your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey was a bigger predator than Brad. But she was also quite mean. You knew that she wouldn't help you unless you did something for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother person that came to your mind was Maddy, your big sister's friend and roommate. She had a lot of knowledge of different kinds of predators from her previous home. She seemed to have a... thing for you, though. You weren't sure about getting her help, but you wanted Mary freed from that bully's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of who you ask, there would be some kind of consequences... but you didn't care. Freeing Mary was your main priority right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you call for help?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gulped as you headed over to the apartment complex near the beach. You peered out into the distance to see that Brad hadn't left. You weren't looking forward to whatever was awaiting you. You several encounters with Maddy, and none of them were particularly pleasant. It's not like she was mean. Far from it. She was one of the nicest people you had met since you moved here. You problem, was that she was a massive pervert... and you happened to be one of the cutest boys in the city! The first time you met her, you and Mary took an alternate route to school, hoping to avoid bullies. You didn't get picked on, but Maddy took you by surprise and yanked your shorts down, forcing herself up your butt! You had to spend the rest of the day carrying her around in your tummy until she had passed back down your system... and she'd force herself right back up there before the day was over. Every now and then when you visited your big sister, Nikki, she would perv on you in some way, either by hiding herself in the toilet and popping up between your thighs as you tried to use the restroom, or somehow getting someone to squish her up into a pair of underwear, where you'd suddenly feel her tongue between your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does everyone keep doing pervy stuff to me?\", you thought to yourself as you walked up the stairs. You were always scared of going to Nikki's apartment. The zombies always creeped you out. Ezekiel was nice, but you still found him kind of creepy. You could never get used to seeing his eye pop out on occasion. And it didn't help that his little brother was one of your bullies. On more than one occasion, Gabe was waiting there for you to grab you and stuff you down his underwear. Nikki usually found out and punished him, though. You also learned to be afraid of the cheerleaders, who lived right next to your sister. They never picked on you, but they could be just as pervy as Maddy. As you got to your sister's apartment, you rang the doorbell, expecting her to answer. \"M-maybe if Nikki's there, she won't be too bad...\", you thought as you waited for the door to open. Your pupils narrowed as you saw not your sister answer... but Maddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing her usual white, red, and navy outfit and had a pair of pink headphones pulled down from her ears. Once she saw you, her eyes practically glowed as her face turned flush, grinning with joy. \"Jackie!\" You screamed as she grabbed you and pulled you into the apartment before locking the door. She hugged you tight, your face pressing into her breasts as she slipped her hand under your swimsuit and groped your butt. \"I didn't expect one of my favorite boys to come by...\", she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a muffled yelp before you lifted your face. \"Um... M-Maddy... I n-nEED your h-hELP!\" You occasionally cried out as she continued to give your cheeks a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Her face lit up. \"You need <i>my</i> help?\" A grin formed on her face as she giggled to herself as she sat down and set you on her lap. \"Whatcha need lil ol me for, Jackie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... um... M-Mary got gobbled up by this big bully, and he said he's never gonna let her go! S-since you know a lot about different predators, I thought maybe you could help...\" You felt really uncomfortable asking her for assistance, but you were desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think... I <i>might</i> know how to deal with that guy... Butt-\" You yelped as Maddy dug her fingers into your squishy rear end. \"You're gonna have to do a... favor for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nonexistent spine tingled as she winked at you. \"Wh-what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to be my maid for the rest of the whole weekend! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Hehe... I finally get to use that cute outfit I bought...</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you heard this. Under normal circumstances, you'd flat out refuse immediately. However, you were desperate to find a way to save your precious Mary. And you needed to take any help you could... no matter the price. \"I'll... I'll do it...\", you whimpered as you turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" You slid off onto the floor as Maddy jumped up and cheered. She quickly ran into her room and into her closet, grabbing a uniform and tossing it to you. \"Now put this on and make it official... and feel free to take your time slipping it on~\" Maddy sat down as you looked at the outfit and blushed. It was a cute maid's uniform... that looked oddly perfect for your size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how long were you holding onto this?\", you whimpered as you slipped out of your swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I dunno... how long have you been living here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you changed into your uniform as quickly as possible. You wanted to get this humiliating experience over with as soon as possible. As you finished changing, you face turned even redder as you tried to stretch the skirt over your pelvis. The skirt was a bit too short, barely covering your backside, and the thigh-high socks squished into your thighs. \"I-I-I think you got the measurements wrong...\", you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... I think I got them juuuust right...\" Maddy licked her lips as she eyed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered as you were dreading the thought of becoming a tool for her perversion... but you made an agreement, and hopefully Maddy would hold up her end of the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do with you first?</span></div></div>",

The jock's stomach was tight, forcing you to curl up into a ball, your face forced up against the wet, sticky wall. You only wanted to have a nice, wholesome little date with your little sweetie, and this big bully just picked you up and stuffed you down his throat like a piece of candy. To make matters worse, it appeared he had no intention of letting you go any time soon! \"J-Jackie!\", you screamed. \"Get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry, Mary!\", you heard Jack cry. \"He's gotta be lying!

Where are you going?!\", you screamed in a panic. \"Aren't you gonna help me?!\" You were shocked by your boyfriend's perceived selfishness. You couldn't believe he would just leave you there, trapped in some awful jock's stomach with no possibility of escape. You yelped as Brad slapped the bottom of his gut, where your rear end was forced up against, causing you to blush heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your little boyfriend ditched you, little missy. That's pretty harsh\", your predator/prison chuckled, his voice echoing around you. \"Oh well. Guess you're sticking with me, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled against the tight stomach walls, but found escape impossible, your feeble attempts only causing the jock to laugh. \"Y-you're wrong, you big bully!\", you screamed. \"Jackie's gonna find some help, and then you'll be sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if he doesn't?\", Brad asked as he looked down at his girl-filled gut. \"You got a lot of faith in someone who just ditched you to save his own skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... he isn't very strong\", Mary admitted. \"But he is cute, and smart, and he's the sweetest boy in the world! I know he's gonna come for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, whatever you say, little lady\", Brad chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Marilyn Evans, you bully!\", Mary cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever your name is, you're just a gut-stuffer now.\" You grunted as you felt Brad's abdomen squeeze you further inside of his belly as he stood up and felt him rub the top of your head. \"Better get ready for some company, cus I'm craving some burgers. Maybe my bro can hook me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't you dare!\", you commanded, which Brad simply laughed off. You bounced slightly as your prison walked over to the pier and over to the local fast food restaurant, Lucha Burger. Brad seemed to ignore you as he headed inside and ordered some food for himself (apparently, having an entire little girl in his belly wasn't filling enough), and soon began eating. You heard him chomp messily into his burger and gulp it down, the chewed up food soon falling on top of your beautiful blonde hair. \"Ewwww!\", you retched as more food began to get squeezed down and fall over you, \"This is so <b>gross</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get used to it, snack\", the bully chuckled as he began to drink some soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced as you felt the sticky, bubbly fluid drain down and flow over your head, soaking into your hair and dripping all over your face. \"It's... it's gonna be okay...\", you said to yourself as chewed up, saliva soaked food dropped over you and soda drizzled on top of you. \"Jackie's going to get some help and get me free... y-yeah... like a knight getting a wizard's help before he saves his princess from the awful dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach juices began to bubble beneath you and you felt him press his hand into his stomach (and you, by extension) before he let out a crude *<b>BELCH!</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to whimper, feeling helpless as you sat in the gut that would be your home for the foreseeable future. \"Jackie... please find help soon...\"</span></div></div>",

My little buddy says you did something to his girlfriend!\" It was familiar but you couldn't quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft, yeah? And what's the biggest slut in the city going to do about it?\" It was Maddy! You had heard Jack talk about her sometimes, she lived with Nikki and that burger guy and seemed to get along really well with Stevie which was kinda weird...But Jack brought HER to save you?! You can't imagine she'd be too much help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hid behind Maddy and gulped, it took a few days to 'convince' her, and while he did learn lots of 'interesting' things, he was a little worried for her. She walked over and nudged Brad's gut, rocking you a bit. \"Eating little girls huh? What, a grown woman too much for ya?\" She scoffed, shaking her head before reaching under her skirt and dropping her panties, kicking them off to the side. \"Let's see how you handle a REAL woman.\" She reached down and yanked down Brad's shorts. \"Jeez you really are a slutty freak aren't you? Well if you want a piece of me have at it.\" He laughed. THIS WAS HER PLAN?! You sat in shock...and several half-digested servings of fries, she was going to fuck him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddy plopped herself down on his cock, sliding it in with ease as she locked eyes with him, undoing her hair ribbons and letting her hair flow behind her as she pumped up and down on Brad's cock, letting out soft moans as she fucked him, Jack left to just kinda...watch as she fucked the dude who was keeping his girlfriend trapped in his stomach. Maddy kept pounding away, even as Brad came into her, busting load after load into her, leaving him more and more tired and worn out. \"Holy fuck you are a freak.\" \"What, tired already? Better find yourself a pick me up, get something to eat maybe~?\" She cooed, barely breaking a sweat as Brad irked and glared at her before letting out a sigh, Jack watched as his stomach slowly began shrinking, Mary was saved! ...in a really weird and roundabout way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside you felt your prison rapidly shaking back and forth for about an hour, listening to both Brad and Maddy's moans as they fucked, would this really work? Eventually the acids in the belly began to rise, it was working! You never felt this happy to be digested as the acids filled your almost-home and broke you down in all the good little nutrients Brad needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up several hours later under the dark blue sky, rubbing your head you stood up on the beach and took a breath of fresh air. You were out of that bully's stomach! You walked further up the beach in hopes your little Jackie-poo was there waiting for you...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't until you wandered into a thick fog that you realized you probably should have waited for the life guard to bring you home. You squinted and stared at the dimly lit area, which looked almost like an abandoned skate park. \"H-hellooooo!\", you called out. \"Is anyone there? I think I'm lost! I need to find the mayor's house!\" You weren't very familiar with Mayor April, but she seemed nice enough to Jack. Maybe she would be able to help you... if you could find your way out of here. \"Helloooooo! Hmm... I don't think anyone's here...\" Your thoughts were interrupted as you tripped and fell into a pool of purple goop, your small form getting stuck in the slime like a piece of fruit in gelatin along with a small darker purple thing that looked like a grape. \"Eeewww! What is this stuff?!\", you tried to call out before your mouth was filled with the slime. It was surprisingly sweet tasting, like very rich grape juice. Before you could contemplate eating some, the jelly that was surrounding you began to move and take shape... revealing itself to be the Slime Queen, Giselle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime soon took the shape of a very tall and curvy young woman, the \"grape\" sliding through the gel and on top of her head, forming a sort of crown shape. The regal slime yawned as she stood up and sat down, the young girl inside of her keeping in place in her abdomen as the rest of her body wobbled while she stretched. \"*YAWWWNNN* It seems someone wandered into my Queendom...\" She looked down and saw a frightened young girl uselessly flailing inside of her. \"Oh, it's a girl. *sigh* I was hoping that a male would find their way into my territory. I can hardly call it a harem if all I have is one male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were extremely frightened as the slime lady you were trapped in began talking. You had heard Miss Barbara warn Jack and Bryan to stay away from the Slime Territory, but you didn't expect that you would find yourself in here. Having zero knowledge of the region or any monsters, you had no idea what to expect. You could only hope that appealing to her would have some sort of effect on your situation. \"P-please let me go, miss!\", you begged her, though your mouth was quickly filled with grape-flavored slime again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... perhaps transforming you will provide me with another male.\" The core of the Slime Queen (what you thought was a grape) began to glow as she began to rub her girl-filled belly. You began to panic and flail as much as you could as you felt your body begin to go numb. You tried to scream as loudly as you could while you felt your body begin to lose it's shape, liquefying into a pinkish fluid. Your limbs were the first to go, before you pelvis, and then your abdomen, until finally your screams were silenced as your entire body was transformed into a transparent pink sludge. Everything went black for a moment until you could finally open your eyes. You looked around to see that you had been reduced to a sentient blob with just a blinking pair of eyeballs. Your prison wobbled as Giselle patted her belly. \"No need to worry, my new subject. Your body will need a moment to take shape. In the meantime, be thankful that your Queen is kind enough to allow you to rest in her body. In the past, Royal Jellies would simply spit out their newly created slimes as soon as the transformation was complete.\"<br>\r\nYou were very confused and scared at what had just happened. Your Queen? New subject? You weren't allowed to process things for very long before you felt your body being drained out of her stomach, and what you assumed were her bowels.<br>\r\n\"It seems your body's decided it's new form. Let us see what's become of you.\" The Slime Queen stood up and spread her asscheeks before squeezing your pink slimy form out of her body. When she felt that you were completely out, she turned around and looked down at your slowly forming body curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat form do you take now?</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to go hungry, you were forced to eat some of the chewed up, saliva-soaked food that your living prison had eaten. You couldn't eat too much, or Brad would just eat some more, and you'd have to sit in the gunk until he had digested it. Whenever he drank, you had to hold your hands together to catch whatever rained down. You had experienced your first taste of alcohol this way, and everything that came with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brad continued on with his routine. Although he had a large, little girl-filled gut, he kept on as if nothing was different. He'd keep up with college, date several women, and brought them home, forcing you to bounce around as he plowed them. Of course, he made sure to keep up his body, bringing you along with him as he worked out. You were uncomfortably compressed as he lifted weights and did sit ups, your predator not caring that he was practically crushing his belly's resident. He wasn't shy about showing you off, too, occasionally bumping you on your rear and making you squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, and there was no sign that Jack was going to save you. It was tough to sleep as Brad always slept on his stomach, squashing you underneath his weight and snoring loudly. Whenever you <i>did</i> get some sleep, you always had the same dream. The evil dragon snatches the princess up and grins wickedly down at the knight. The princess pleads the knight for help, only for him to run away in fear as she was sent down to the monster's scaly gut.<br>\r\nYou wanted to have faith in Jack, as well as your other friends and family, that they would save you from the belly of this bully. But a little girl can only hope for so long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it came time for the holidays. Brad was at a party, wearing a Santa hat and a bow stuck onto his belly, with the words 'DON'T OPEN UNTIL XMAS' written on it. You wanted to cry, but you still had the slightest glimmer of hope that you would be freed. Maybe a Xmas miracle was in your future. You were somewhat inebriated as Brad had been heavily drinking, and you were up to your chin in alcohol and chewed up snacks as Brad slapped his belly. \"Heya, kid. You still awake in there?\", Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\", you responded sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Wanna stay up to wait for Santa, huh?\", the jock asked. He grabbed a microphone from a karaoke machine and held it to his gut. \"What do ya want Santa to bring you, little lady?\" The crowd went silent aside from a few giggles from the other college students. \"C'mon! Tell us what you want for Xmas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped down some more of the awful mixture that you were drenched in. \"I... I want...\" Your voice blared over the speakers as Brad recorded your frightened voice. \"I want <b>OUT OF HERE!!!</b>\", you screamed as loud as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, folks\", Brad said over the karaoke machine. \"Should Santa give her what she wants? Has she been a good girl this year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the other college students shouting. You could hear some chanting \"YES!\" while others were shouting \"NO!\". You couldn't believe your fate was in the hands of some drunk, horny young adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that settles it!\", Brad said, though he gave no indication of what he meant. This was potentially your last chance to be free of this bully's gut. Will you get your Xmas wish?</span></div></div>",

Your only chance at seeing your friends and family again had been dashed by a room full of drunk, horny teens and young adults. Your prison was soon filled back up with foul-tasting beer and you were forced to down more of it until you began to feel woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the party, you had completely given up hope that you would leave. If no one bothered to save you before, they weren't planning on doing it now. This was your life now. Your entire world was confined to Brad's tight stomach. Your sustenance would be what he ate and drank. You began to grow used to the taste of the already chewed up food mixed with saliva. You would learn to scrunch up with him each time he did situps. Your mind would slowly begin to break, and eventually you would begin to grow fond of him. You would see the outside world as an awful place. Out there, you used to get sat on, transformed into lewd things and objects for other people's comfort. In here you were safe. You got fed every day, and Brad never abandoned you. Unlike... that one boy. You couldn't even remember his name now. Not that it mattered now. You were never going to see him again anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his workouts, you would begin to cheer Brad on as he lifted weights, helping him push himself past his limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough eventually, he'd get tired of having to work around the little girl that lived in his stomach and he stopped exercising as often, gaining a good deal of weight. Soon enough, it'd be tough to even tell that he had someone in there with all of the weight he gained. He somehow still managed to take some girls home every now and then and they would have a laugh over your surprised yelps every time you were smushed under their combined weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't stop eating, though. You would be constantly surrounded by food, some of it not even chewed up. Whenever you slept, it was always in a pool of stinking mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, he was sitting at home watching TV and drinking a beer, occasionally scratching his girl-filled gut before downing a plate of chips. \"Th... thank you for dinner, Mister Brad...\", you said weakly as you scooped up the chewed up nachos into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it, gut girl\", the college student chuckled as he chugged the rest of his beer. \"Nice to see you finally settled in to your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of... of course\", you responded, your mind having long since been warped by your surroundings and the constant taunting. \"This is where little girls belong... in the tummy of a big strong predator...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, little lady\", Brad laughed. \"I bet if your little boyfriend heard you, he'd... huh. Y'know it's funny, I gulped you down to mess with him, but I forgot all about him. Heck, I haven't even seen him since then. Guess some other pred got to him, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a boyfriend\", you said. \"I only have... you, Mister Brad. And that's all I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad laughed it off, but you were completely serious. As Brad got older, you would remain the same size and age in his gut. As Brad slept on his girl-filled belly, your dreams of knights and dragons were gone. Instead, you dreamed of being made into various dishes and being served to your big, strong predator. You sighed in your sleep as you had grown to love your new life in the bully's gut.</span></div></div>",

He was scared of what Rico had planned for him, and Mary as well. But he didn't have much choice. Getting Trish to help would definitely end in disaster, the demons refused to mess up anyone else's fun or help a 'goodie-goodie', and your own mother was going to be unable to help, too. If he was more patient, he could possibly find someone else to help, but Jack wanted to save you as soon as possible. \"Just help Mary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got it\", Rico sighed. \"Look, jockstrap, I'm gonna give you a chance to give up this loser's little girlfriend before I show you the food chain around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped as you suddenly bounced around inside Brad's gut while the jock laughed. \"Haha!

Now why don't you and your little friends run on home or you're gonna be joining this little brat!\", Brad laughed as he gave his gut a nice slap, making you yelp as his hand struck where your bottom was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you fucked up, jockstrap...\" Rico scowled as he stomped over to Brad... and began to grow! With each step, the shortstacked teen's height increased until he was twice the size of the jock, and his clothes ripped off, leaving him completely nude! \"...you fucked up big time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly cocky musclehead gulped, falling on his rear and crawled away. \"Wh-what the fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like you said, loser! Big fish eats the little fish! Now stay there, little fishy...\" Rico turned around and plopped down on the jock, smothering him in the vast, squishy brown assflesh! As the giant teen boy sat, you also felt yourself being compressed even more by his weight! Brad suddenly began struggling as the booty began to literally engulf him! Rico's flesh began to ooze over him like a sludge, pulling the jock into his already wide behind. \"If you're gonna be an ass to my boyfriend, I might as well make you a permanent part of mine!\" He looked over to Ignacio and smirked. \"Bet you're looking forward to having a chance to pound <i>him</i> for a change, huh, Iggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnacio's face was flush as he watched his boyfriend's booty begin to increase. \"H-he, uh... he's not the one who bashed my teeth out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...

Looks like you're sticking with me, little lady\", he chuckled. You held your hands to your face and sobbed as Brad began to walk away, his prize still occupying his belly. He quickly went shopping for more clothes, as he was still naked. He would leave with a pair of shorts and a button-up shirt that he left open. \"Heheh, gotta change up my wardrobe to accommodate for my little gut-filler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet, you jerk!\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, is the little princess sad she won't see her boyfriend again?

He headed up with his prisoner in tow, struggling a bit as he had to adjust himself to accommodate for your weight. When he entered his apartment, his fat brother, Lars, was sitting on a bean bag chair with his boss, Ignacio (who's voice you recognized from earlier). \"Oh... guess the kid's plan didn't work...\", you heard him say. There was something different about his voice, though. He sounded almost sleepy, and he was coughing a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You watch your mouth, you little gremlin\", Brad snapped. \"I'm still pissed at what your fat ass boyfriend did to me!\" He began to stomp over to the short latino guy before Lars stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dude. Cut it out.\" Lars sounded very mellow, but you got the feeling that he had his limits. \"That's what you get for picking on little kids.\" He then noticed the large gut that his brother was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Brad's chubby brother have it in him to help you?</span></div></div>",

It's been a few months since his mother married both your mom and her twin sister. Unfortunately, you haven't been able to enjoy your new family much. For some reason, the knowledge that your mother has always been a demoness hasn't done much to change your view of her. However, your aunts seem to get a kick out of messing with both you and Jack. While they just seem to make Jack uncomfortable, you've found yourself being transformed, squashed, eaten, and all kinds of other awful predicaments by the two of them. On top of that, your own mother has squished you on accident quite often, though lately she's been a bit less apologetic. You figure it's because she's around her sisters more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Jack likes to spend more time with Mary or Ash, he's still your best friend, and you often hang out with him and your fox cousin, Remy. Even though he acts somewhat normal, Remy has a habit of occasionally pulling different pervy pranks on other students. He's sometimes made you an unwilling accomplice of some pranks pulled on his uptight sister, Janet, whom you normally find too much of a prude to want to be around, even if she is pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, you've had kind of a problem. Jack's little sister, Selena, has a cat named Ian, who's bite can turn other people squishy like Jack. For some reason, you seem to be his favorite target, and you've spent much of your time living in Spectrum Bay as a vulnerable squishie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately today isn't any different, as you're still recovering from being bitten just yesterday. You feel like you're close to returning to normal, but if you were to get squished, you might be in danger of being stuck in that state, unless you were to get bitten again or your mom or aunts were to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been one to let a little bit of squishy-ness keep you from enjoying your day, though. You've still got things you want to do (or have to do) today.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't exactly out of character for her but your mother usually would have at least said good bye if she didn't have something on her mind, well whatever it was you shouldn't bother with it since you were already here. You were about to ring the door bell when the front door swung wide on it's own catching your feet under it and flattening you out across the door mat rather than into the wall like you would have expected from a sudden door opening. A green foot found it's way onto your face, planting the fishy didget over most of your face so only one eye was looking up. The green skinned fish woman in a pink swimsuit still seemed slightly wet and you couldn't see her face passed her boobs she paused there on your face looking over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd say it was a pleasure doing business with you but I'd rather you didn't call so suddenly\" She was talking to your Aunt you realize, even as the salty fishy taste was starting to drown your other senses out of focus, you'd hate to wonder what it was like under her for longer but thankfully it was only a mild painful shifting of weight as she walked over you and out. The silver fox Anthro that was your aunt April stepped onto you now but she had taken smaller steps landing her high heels onto your crotch with a light squish as she watched the fish woman go. You finally managed to form enough of a mouth to squeak out a yelp as she had started to grind her food on you in frustration just watching the fish woman leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Andrew, Barbie told me you were coming over, what are you doing flattened out here on the mat?\" She lightened up but notably did not remove her foot until a few moments after when it was clear you couldn't really answer her smashed down as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed to get your voice back under control before answering now that she had peeled you up. \"I'm supposed to hang out with Remy\" April had a very... fox like look when you said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Remy is playing at something in the far room down the hall, the one a couple doors down from Janet's room and the activity room. Although, Janet has a few friends over too, the Cheerleaders I believe minus Nikki and Brandy but... If you're waiting off Squishyness you could come and sit in with me, I've got a few more appointments but I'm sure we could have fun even then. I could use the distraction you know, it's rather stressful for me. ufufufu\" That was a strange offer, April usually didn't want anyone sitting in on her meetings, let alone her own kids and you were sure that you hadn't been offered before... but you did come here with a plan and despite promising fun Meetings sounded kinda boring...</span></div></div>",

You tried to call out for him, but that only got you a mouthful of foxbutt as he shifted his hips and swung one of his rod-like controllers around. \"RRRMMMMNNNN!!!\"<br>\r\nAs much as you called out, your words were muffled by his bottom and he was too engrossed in his game to notice. You had to try and hop on your knees each time he jumped, and move your head and torso around along with his movements. You didn't want to get squashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Gonna have to try better than that, Zack! I'm number one in the region for a reason!\" Remy seemed to be playing against one of your classmates, and his movements getting more intense. Finally he landed one final blow and you could faintly hear Zack groaning from your friend's headset as Remy panted. \"Heh... better luck next time, buddy!\", he chuckled before he finally turned his headset off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally\", you thought. \"He's gotta notice me now.\" ...only that wasn't the case. He kept his headset on and walked over to his game chair. It was one of those rocking bean-like chairs that other kids used when they played video games. Jack had one, too, but you could personally never understand why they had them. They weren't very comfortable to you, and you would rather just grab a couch cushion and sit on the floor. You weren't able to see past Remy's buttcheeks and his bushy tail before he took his headset off and sat down. You were finally free from the cord, but only just in time for Remy to press his big furry butt on top of you, squashing you and reducing you to a light flesh-colored pancake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... this thing's a little comfier than usual\", the fox boy said as he wriggled his hips. You groaned as your cousin shifted on top of you, wishing you could have done more to get his attention, like yank on his tail or something. \"Hehe, I guess mom was right about me gaining weight!\" Remy caught his breath as he continued sitting on his new cushion, and you were mentally screaming at him to lift his fat furry butt up.</span></div></div>",

It was also a way to make you look strong or smart to any demon although April's response was a little more dramatic than you had considered. Her 'disguise' flashed away in a burst of flame, leaving the red skinned demon with silver hair that was your Aunt's true form in it's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, how bold. In that case We'll play a game with... prizes. We'll play as many rounds as I care to, and each round the winner can make one <i>request</i> of the looser and the looser <b>must</b> obey as long as it is within their power. for example if you were to win and ask me to, just an example, grant you a demonic power, I would happily oblige.\" She smiled sweetly as if she hadn't just offered you a ticket to stop getting bullied so bad. You didn't even think about what she would do if she won before you grabbed her hand that she had extended to shake with you. The 'bad' feeling you got was when the hand shake felt like it was burning and you yelped and pulled your hand back, there was a symbol that you couldn't read on your palm now and when you looked up April was showing you the one on her palm. \"The deal is struck.\" she said with a playful grin leaving you suddenly wondering if this wasn't a terrible mistake. \"come with me to the office, we can start there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing much of a point in trying to back out now you walked behind her into the office, which to your surprise was quite large with massive chairs and furnishings and even a bigger meeting table off to the side of the desk. You wondered what kind of game you were going to play, you could barely see over the desk as you saw April's tail flicking over it like she was looking for something. You pulled yourself up into the chair. when she stood up again she had a simple game, checkers which surprised you somewhat. \"we can take turns deciding what to play, for now let's start with a light game. My next meeting is in one hour so we should be able to play at least two things before they show up.\" You watched her set up the board without saying anything, trying to figure out if you would be able to beat April at checkers, she was probably smarter than you but you were pretty good at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"can I go first?\" you would have the advantage and April agreed to let you play red. The game was surprisingly over in just fifteen minutes and mostly because you had been over thinking your moves, from your perspective April was horrendously bad at checkers she was even worse than Bryan! You were excited as April leaned back into her chair 'defeted'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this match is yours Andrew...\" she pouted as if she had been expecting to win with those terrible moves. Well either way this was your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can you give me one of those demon powers?\" you were nervous because you didn't want to accidentally break some sort of rule but for some reason this made April sit up and smile. She walked around the table slowly almost as if she were making it seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course~ One Demonic power just for you\" you looked at her hand and saw the mark glowing as she picked you up suddenly and kissed you on the forhead. A warm fuzzy feeling passed over you and stayed as she set you back down. She licked her lips \"The other powers require a bit more... intense rituals, I'm sure you'd enjoy but this one was fast and I'd like to continue playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kind of confused as you were a bit tingly all over it was distracting. \"What, what power? and why do I feel all weird\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril made a brushing motion with her hand \"just a simple low level 'pleasure' power, it will make anyone you touch feel a nice comforting feeling or... a little more if you manage to make it stronger. As for the weird feeling, it's probably because you don't have the ability to turn the power off so you'll feel like that until you train a little. It's your turn to pick a game though.\" She was very dismissive of your concern, and this wasn't exactly what you meant when you had said you wanted a demonic power. Why couldn't she have given you something like Natalie ability to shrink people Selena totally would have gone strait to that if it had been asked of her. You would just need to try again, it wasn't like it was a bad power but at least you wanted something that would work for you better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let's play checkers again.\" you said knowing how bad she was at the game you were confident you could win against her if you played this game over and over. Unfortunately for you this must have been her plan all along because even a couple moves into checkers you could tell you were not playing against the same person who had gotten demolished last game, she had held back on purpose because she knew what you would ask for. Combined with the distracting tingling feeling it took the game twice as long to finish as you were over thinking every single move and April out played you instantly even then. You saw her collect your last peace as a feeling a dread washed over you. She made a show of casually counting the pieces and checking her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darn, I guess I'll have to make this a quick request... my next meeting is in ten minutes that's not enough for another game before they get here.\" She tapped her chin as if she were thinking. \"Andrew would you please lay yourself down in the big guest chair until my next meeting is over.\" she asked innocently \"and no talking\" You had been sitting in the massive chair since it was the one that had been near the desk, it was big enough for you to sleep on if you wanted. When you didn't immediately start moving the mark on your hand burned a little and you fell backwards and laying in the chair limply. You couldn't even feel the strength to move as April walked over and pulled your legs onto the chair as well and laid you across it. You wanted to ask her what she was doing but even if you moved your mouth no noise was coming out as the red cheeks descended on you to flatten you out. \"Ohhh that power works nicely for you~ I hope my next visitor appreciates all your effort.\" she teased as she got off of your flattened body. Smiled as the door bell rang.. \"Ah that must be my meeting, Don't worry Andrew, I'm not anywhere near board so we'll be continuing for some time unless something else comes up for you or me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch silently as she left and then returned with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You weren't able to even move the chair to see who was coming in but whoever it was they were very quiet as you could only hear April's foot steps as she said some greeting or another and the figure came into view. Not that you recognized whoever this was by name other than the 'Giselle' that you heard from April just a moment ago, but her appearance would have frozen you gawking if you could have moved in the first place. The massive purple slime girl jiggled just standing still, her dark purple only broken up from what you could see by a honey colored pair of panties and a bright yellow bra. She was easily twice April's size, in both height and curves, you didn't quite catch her response before you realized that the huge bottom was coming towards you. You were surprised by the panties sprouting eyes and antennae as well as a mouth, it made a kiss face at you before the gelatinous mass crashed into you. The first thing you registered was the flavor, Honey with a hint of Grape as you were covered by the panties. The second thing was the pressure, despite being larger you had expected less of an impact from the pure jelly form of a slime, it was like she weighed dozens of times what she should even for her height. And even still it was impossibly soft, like a billion warm blankets laying on top of you, if you hadn't been squishy you feel like you would have just simply been swallowed by the softness probably literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven under thousands of pounds of ass it was almost like her body conducted sound, it wasn't... too uncomforatable so you decided you might as well listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And that's why you need to stop trying to claim the park as a part of your Queendom. I've been very clear about this.\" April's voice finsished the part you hadn't been paying attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight shift as Giselle crossed her legs. \"I fail to see how that is my problem, it sounds more like their problem. If they wish to leave their offspring within distance of my resting grounds it is only natural that I should see that as an offering of a meal.\" The purple 'Queen?' said matter of factually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell even without seeing that a response like that was just going to make April gnash her teeth. \"What I'm saying Giselle, is that I want you to stop encroaching towards the suburbs and I've got permission from the city council to offer you something in exchange for your cooperation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a focused shift as she leaned forward the weight sort of just rolled over you. \"Well that is different, but really what sort of offer. I'm not interested in your 'money' you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just so happen to have something just for you prepared-\" She started but a bubbly voice in your head drowned her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Giselle sorry to <b>Bee</b> a bother but maybe you could ask for this slime boy instead of whatever she's got?\" The pun was emphasized but you didn't really understand why it was a pun. You could feel Giselle's mood shift somehow, almost like she had touched your brain as soon as she found out about you. She interrupted April who was still in the middle of explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not take me so lightly 'Mayor' your true bribery has been revealed to me. Or did you perhaps think that you could hide a Male from my watchful eye.\" She said smugly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril of course had no idea what she was talking about until the dots connected in her head, she slid the magic stone back into her desk drawer. \"Of course not~\" She purred as if she had planned this all along. \"I did prepare him especially for you right there didn't I. I'm afraid I can't offer him to you fully though.\" She made a big show of being upset by it not that you could see. \"Although if you promice to stop bothering the suberban moms I suppose you could have your way with him for a day... after that you'll have to convince him to stay.\" Wait what was happening now? Was April selling you off for the rest of the day just to deal with this uppity slime!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no true male slime could possibly even <b>Think</b> of leaving after they've gotten a taste.\" It kind of felt like she was licking her lips when she said that. \"I think that's a deal Ms. Vulpis\" She said shaking April's hand. You felt your inability to move lift even as the meteoric weight pressed you into the inability to move anyhow. You can't believe April had just sold you off to... okay you could believe that, she even made sure you weren't going to be stuck for longer than a day. Yep this was right up her alley if you really thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said the weight lifted off of you and you got to look at Giselle's face for the first time, it was pretty cute at least...</span></div></div>",

Impress me and your reward will be great, disappoint me and... well do not disappoint me.\" She Declared you could already feel her hands dissolving your shirt as she said the word disappoint, you gulped a little not knowing what to do. She called it a date though, maybe that was a hint? Did she want to go to a date spot, you didn't know what a girl would be expecting from something like that but, you did have an idea maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just the place it's-\" You lost your voice as she dropped you causing you to splat on the ground, only now that you could see her feet you saw one of them was covered in a thin bluish film like a sort of sock or sandal or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, then we shall be on our way.\" She declared, without waiting for you to actually tell her what you were thinking her non 'socked' foot dropped onto you, but rather than the normal simple squash you expected instead it felt like your face stuck to the bottom of her foot and then your body folded in on itself forming something of a cushion over her whole foot. The world was exploded with purple, even the smell and taste the concentrated flavor of grape flowed over you as your body continued to twist over itself a couple of times as whatever force was pulling on you searched for something. It seemed to find it though as you felt a shiver of pleasure from something passing between her toes then wrapping back around into a 'sandal thong' only then did her full weight rest onto you again depressing the full cushioning you had been made into down to a paper thin film on the bottom of her foot. despite all of the pressure on you though, rather than overwhelming pain all you could feel was the pressure and a faint pleasant buzz The Grape was overwhelming it all though, you could barely think about anything else, especially when she started walking, the 'juice' practically oozed out of her. You thought you could hear Giselle talking but it was more like a whisper against the slapping of her feet on the ground, pounding you flatter and farther into grape land. At some point you had started feeling as if you couldn't tell what was even going on around you until you were ripped free of the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cloths were gone now, probably dissolved by Giselle, but you were covered in a thick layer of 'sweat' that you were tempted to continue trying to lick off of you to taste just a little more but you blinked as you looked around, she had actually taken you to the place you had been thinking of! Could she read your mind or something?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't even put up a mild struggle to get yourself in a better position, your muscles simply did not listen to you, even the usual feeling of attempting to reform wasn't working despite your mind being very actively trying to get your body to move. It was differnt from being unable to move from being smashed, that had some push back, this was just you relaxing too much to do anything. You could still look around so you focused on the door, the chair had been pulled out a bit so that April could smush you but it gave you a view of people entering which only let you know who would inevitably sit on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person to walk through the large double doors was April, her disguise had been put back up to answer the door and melted as soon as she walked into the room. The next person in was as surprising as she was dangerous, Desiree's human disguise melted as she passed the door as well, the massive Demon accidentally ripping her short shorts apart with her sudden shift. The Demon goddess was followed by two of her other daughters Camilla who looked somewhat annoyed and Selena or... Zelenica you supposed when she was in demon form that's what you were supposed to call her and she looked excited. \"Mother, I understand you had some news to share... It was short notice but I got a nice seat for you while we have our meeting.\" She gestured to you laying flat in the seat, The black skinned demon glanced down at you and quirked her lips slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one of Barbara's boys, how opportunistic since your sister isn't here to protect him.\" She said running her finger over your body, it made you shiver even though it was warm. But maybe Aunt April would change her mind if your mom would be mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about Barbie, even if she throws a fit he's agreed to a series of games so there's nothing she can say since he agreed.\" She grinned as she showed the symbol on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the purple skinned aunt had perched herself on an arm rest. \"Ohhh, games? You really stepped in it this time huh puddin\" She called you the nick name she liked using when you were squishy, based on your smell and taste. Camilla suddenly seemed much more interested in what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena had started searching for your hand and lifted it up to find your game mark. \"I don't get it? Why is games so weird? I play games all the time and this doesn't happen.\" She seemed more interested in the game than your situation. dang it why couldn't that brat help you out for once, Jack was right about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree scooted her out of the way, with her hand \"Well I suppose this meeting is about teaching you more of Demon Culture so listen up Zelenica the first thing is-\" and then the dark booty clad in golden leotard slammed into you completely muffling out every single bit of sound that was being made. The giant woman was by far the largest you had ever been sat on by, if April felt like a ton of bricks this was more like someone had dropped a mountain on you. You had definitely splattered quite a bit, spreading nowhere near the amount of her full ass but enough that you were touching skin instead of just parts of her leotard. She shifted a little every once in a while smearing you into the chair, there was a slight shift where she might have had someone in her lap but such a drop in the bucket barely changed how much her booty dominated your whole existence. If only you could hear what was going on maybe you could figure out how to get out of these games but you couldn't even tell who was talking through the pounds of booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tiny bit of sweat that got to you from her bare skin but the vast majority must have been trapped in her leotard, that was probably a good thing, you'd hate to find out what that poor bit of 'spandex' went through daily. Then she was lifting up, your body had done nothing to save the poor cushion of the seat from loosing all it's springy cushioning. You heard the final words as she stood up \"... and with that this meeting is over.\" and suddenly your body sprang back into your control, despite having been pulverized it was like all the energy you didn't get to use to struggle suddenly snapped you back into shape. You felt sore of course but surprisingly in once piece and not stuck to Desiree's booty. The Massive woman leaned down to talk to you for the first time since she arrived. \"Well Andrew, you make a fine cushion, if you ever want a more permanent position I have a nice office chair...\" She must have seen you make a face because all the color drained from yours when she said that. \"I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You know how I can get when I don't have Dommie to toy with, his weekend in heaven is so hard for me you know\" You didn't but you nodded because there was only so much contradicting you would do to the Hell Queen. \"So it's only natural I'd be a bit playful, how about after the <b>games</b> are done I'll get everyone something nice <b>deal?</b>\" She extended her index finger towards you, but you were concentrating on not saying or doing the wrong thing too much to notice her wording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh sure G- Lady Desiree\" You had almost called her Grandma, and that was NOT how Barbara had taught you to refer to her. You hastily tried to cover it up by shaking her finger but suddenly Selena's hand was squishing yours to the finger and then it was covered by Camilla's and then April's. You realized a second too late what was going on  and your hand was trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them spoke in unison \"<b>The deal is struck, let the games begin!</b>\" You lost feeling in your legs as the 'fire' burned it's way into your body much stronger this time and a bunch of jumbled details collided in your mind. Flashes of rules and agreements that had been made while you were still stuck under Desiree, and the culprit behind the 'extended' participation was actually Selena. She wanted to practice with the family and since you were already there they decided that you could stand in for Barbra since she was busy. There were still no set rounds but the rules were different. Various games could have more than one winner and looser and in those cases winners would get a request from each looser, even in 'team' games. This had just gotten a whole lot more complicated and as soon as you could stand again you were sitting in a chair next to Selena and flanked by Camilla. Desiree took up most of the other side of the table but April could fit at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree spoke\"So as we all agreed the game doesn't end until everyone has chosen the game the same number of times and the first person to choose a game will be...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were kind of suprised they weren't making you go last but you were still a little out of it, and that dang tingly power that April had given you was starting to get more distracting. You had to think of something none of them would be any good at so you could win and get them to leave you alone it was way to dangerous to continue for even one full round. The one thing you could think is how antiquated that they tended to be, sure Selena wasn't but she was still terrible at... video games! \"tetris, we can play tetris in verses mode.\" there was a collective look of confusion around the table until Camilla snorted out a laugh and snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\na huge t.v. appeared on the wall and controllers in everyone's hands with tetris already loading onto the screen. \"Tha' rules are simple, match blocks to give your 'pponents 'dead' blocks at the bottom of the screen, playas that hit the top lose.\" She explained seemingly reading the rules from the start screen. You might have worried about that but you had to focus on playing the game since everyone was default set to be 'attacking' you for some reason. You weren't some world renowned player but April, Desiree and Selena had never even played before clearly as they made fumbling mistakes and Desiree didn't even seem to be able to figure out how to rotate the blocks. Despite that you focused and beat April first, knocking her out after the second speed up, and then Selena by the fourth while Desiree practically beat herself without anyone interfering by the fifth. You were starting to get confident, but even as you deleted block after block Camilla seemed to be evenly matched with you. but then you looked over at her, she was only half paying attention! when you looked back at the screen she slammed down the maximum penalty bricks and you weren't fast enough. the elimination noise sounded and Camilla's tiny wings brought her to sit on the table while you continued to look at the screen even as it diteriorated into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple skinned demoness had a grin as she looked down at you. \"Thought 'ch were pretty clever huh puddin' that's whatcha get for underestimaten' a demon. Now lick my feet looser.\" You felt the mark burn and your arm reached out before you could stop it to yank the boots off of her and notice that she didn't have socks before your face moved forward tongue out and started licking the salty sweat off of her foot like ice-cream that was melting too fast. Your eyes watered from the smell and taste but even putting your hands on her calf trying to yank your body away did nothing. \"and don't miss between the toes\" she said casually before turning her attention away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, I'm getting a new sound system in my room, order it with your card.\" You saw April curse under her breath and pull out her phone, you get the feeling Camilla had been bugging her about that for some time. \"Zel... hmmm Gimme a third of your candy stash.\" the younger demon made like she was going to say no at first but then you heard her yelp like she had been bitten by a dog and Camilla was holding a bag of what might be gumballs or jawbreakers. \"Calm down squirt, I only took a third. You're hordin' 'em anyway.\" The bag she had was one of those three pound candy bags, that was only a third of what Selena had! You don't know why Camilla wanted the candy so much but it seemed like a lot. You had cleaned all the sweat from the first foot and had forcibly moved to the second, leaving only the banana scent in your wake. \"and Mom... ah let me get a shopping card, I want enough for a full outfit from Hell. The top end stuff from Deavolo's shops\" Desiree conjured a card from flames and handed it to Camilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too greedy, daughter you know how competitive these things get when you take too much.\" Desiree seemed to be warning Camilla but it seemed like the comment was directed at Selena. You regained control of you body only to half and cough and Camilla to squeeze your tongue between her toes before you could get away. She wiggled her toes and laced the your tongue through the gaps before pulling away really fast and making it roll up like a cartoon. You were having a hard time getting the taste out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're really good at that~ loose to me again and I might need you to comfort me more puddin' you're even better than usual\" She kicked the shoes too the side and decided to put her feet in your lap instead of sitting in her chair right. You would have complained... if you could feel your tongue. Camilla meanwhile tossed some of the small candies in her mouth and you tried to focus on who was next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selena seemed absolutely livid that Camilla had taken her candy and it was apparently her turn to choose the game. You were not prepared for what she said though. \"We'll play brick by brick. You all know but I'll explain the rules for Andrew. The game lasts until one team gives up, the team members sit on the biggest team members lap and add weight until someone gives up. Since there are five of us but Mommy is so big Mommy and April and Camilla can be on a team and I'll be a team with Andrew.\" This game sounded like you'd have a huge disadvantage, it didn't make sense why she would choose to have you as a partner, but you couldn't complain. \"Don't worry since this is a Hell game the mark will be reading to see when you give up even if you can't talk. Mommy can you drop the blocks, twenty second intervals should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla and April looked at each other. \"Uh Zelencia that's not a game it's-\" \"Are you tryin to torture us you runt!! I Aughta-\" The two of them shut up as Desiree clapped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mark has already excepted it as a game. If you two would like to forfit instead I don't mind taking a loss here.\" She said calmly and they looked at each other again and shook their heads. \"good then each of you get a thigh... oh we'll sit on the floor, these chairs will absolutely break before we're done. Zelencia you're shorter so you sit in his lap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the chair fly out from under you and Selena jump right into your lap and wiggle to get comfortable. \"Ohhh that's a good idea, here I'll share with you so you don't ruin this for me\" You wanted to question what she meant but you were overwhelmed by a sudden sensation of pleasantness, the weight of her not quite crushing your lap didn't bother you anymore. \"Ohh this is gonna be so good.\" she squirmed as you got into the same position Desiree had with your legs folded under your knee. \"Ready! Start\" As soon as she said it there was a finger snap and a stone brick at least twice your size started falling from the ceiling, you almost panicked but it was too late. You and Selena were splattered to goop instantly. You expected the pain to overwhelm you immediately but instead you felt... excited, pleasurable? euphoric? Wait when Selena said she would share... another weight slammed into you and you felt the moan from the splattered form on top of you and had to resist the urge to moan yourself. The second strike had been a hit of ecstasy along with a skull splitting spike of pain. You tried to make sense of it but every time you collected your thoughts another strike rained onto you until you were only groaning along with her in time with the strikes. You were waiting for the next strike, anticipating it when suddenly the weight was gone. You were still blind as Selena was on top of you but you could tell the game was over. did you win? did you lose? no you hadn't given up it was clearly the other team that had given up. Selena was too much of a masochist to ever have lost this, if her sharing her feelings with you was any indication. Of course she was the first one to reform and you were left stuck to her somehow all rolled up onto her butt as she sat back in her chair with a light squelch barely noticing you hadn't gotten off on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, let's see. You were so mean earlier Sissy Cammi it makes me want to get more out of you. Ohhh I know, I want that Soul Drink you've been saving. I never had one...\" Camilla's eyes bulged as her face turned sour and a can not unlike a soda can whirled into the room and she tossed it over to Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning squirt, that stuff is way too strong for you, you ain't ready heck Barbie can barely handle her drinks.\" Camilla warned but Selena was already opening it and chugging so that Camilla couldn't take it back later. You tried to contact Selena but suddenly felt yourself heating up, why did it suddenly feel much better under her cute butt. wait why did you think that? She hadn't cut off the connection yet and you were getting a bit light headed from whatever she was drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, that's sooooo good. it's like a super soda! Mommy I want more can I have more for later please please please.\"  Desiree stopped herself from chuckling and reached into a black portal pulling out a six pack of the cans with different colors. \"these are yours, AFTER the game young lady, if you drink them all now you'll get sick.\" Camilla was nearly floored by how many Desiree had just causally happened to have with her. \"Aaaapril, I wanna club houuuse for my friends. leemy have a spooot.\" April sighed and took out her phone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she seemed to remember you were on her team and shifted on top of you \"Aaandrew what are you doing down there.\" She whined yanking you out from under her. \"you gotta get your stuff too.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going mad though, Selena still hadn't cancelled her spell if she even could and everything was turning pink. When you finally spoke up you had been staring at April's slightly exposed clevage for a few minutes. \"Well? What are you gonna ask this time Andrew.\" you could only sputter stupidly, but the only one that seemed to catch on to what had happened was Camilla she wasn't about to say anything until you were done though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued staring and somewhat by accident you just said \"Boobs\" and your head bobbed up and down fixated on the jiggle. When asked if you just wanted to press your face in them by Camilla you continued bobbing your head until April grabbed you and shoved your whole head in her cleavage. They were so soft, you just went limp and let it happen as you were dragged over and the same was done by Camilla and then when you were deposited in Desiree's. Suddenly the connection cut off and you felt constricted as you slowly sank farther into the ebony cleavage. You were actually amazed by how much give that Desiree's boobs had, they were so soft that you weren't even flattened out by them you were just slowly slipping farther in aided by a massive amount of sweat you tried to say something but your head went under just then and then the giantess brought her hands up and smashed them together even harder flattening you out on the inside and rolling you around until you had picked up all of the sweat. only then did she set you back outside and let you reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say you're doing remarkably well at these games, and at... other things. Maybe you would make a good sweat rag too, you seemed to enjoy that quite a bit.\" She laughed as you shook your head and backed up into your chair. Selena was... not content to sit alone anymore jumping into your lap and hanging off of you, you were kind of afraid of how she was acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next game was starting and the one choosing it was...</span></div></div>",

Then we'll start talking, anyone who says the word that they were given looses.\" She clapped her hands together happily as paper and pens appeared on the table. Selena reluctantly let go of you and stopped trying to eat your ear to get her paper. You looked to your left, Camilla would be the one you were writing for, how could you make sure she got eliminated was there anything she said often enough that it would come up in conversation no matter what? Then the idea struck you, she'd been calling you by that dumb nick name this whole time so you wrote that on the paper surely she couldn't resist taunting you for the whole game. Everyone else had made their choices as well it seemed, hopefully Camilla knew what Desiree would say well enough to eliminate her too. You couldn't read your own of course but you knew what everyone else needed to say, 'Puddin' for Camilla, 'No Fair' for Selena, 'Only ones left' for April and 'Soul' for Desiree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around after nobody had started talking, April cleared her throat \"I forgot to mention, if thirty seconds pass and you haven't said anything you also loose.\" Selena jumped up immediately surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! you didn't say that before we started\" She accused and felt the paper in her hands burn up denoting that she had lost. \"Huh? Huh? what happened?\" She looked at the ashes confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the word you weren't allowed to say Selena\" You answered her quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's quite right daughter, you appear to have been eliminated.\" Desiree sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, even little puddin beat you without help this round\" Camilla laughed and felt her own paper burn causing her to stop in a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that was yours dear sister, it seems our nefew had you pegged from the start.\" She covered her mouth to prevent herself from laughing at Camilla too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla looked at you with a slightly more burning fury than you were used to, what was she so mad at you for! it wasn't your fault she was so predictable. She rolled her eyes and scooted her chair closer, and so did Selena. \"Not against the rules to keep on talkin if you're elminated is it?\" She asked, and you got nervous as the two demons closed in towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-but you can't stop me from being able to talk that would be against the rules!\" You nervously said as they each grabbed one of your hands you no longer had the option of trying to run. \"What are you doing! Let go\" You were a little panicked as April didn't agree to your 'addendum' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax puddin, I'm just feeling a little hunger since I got some time after being eliminated. Lemmy chomp on your arm a bit.\" You were about to refuse when Selena stuffed your hand in her mouth and started chomping away and you yelped instead. Taking that as her cue Camilla did the same. \"Aunt april do something.\" you whined as the two of them had started chomping their way up your arm treating you like gum. but she was practically ignoring you in favor of a present conversation with Desiree in which neither of them have said their phrase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yehhh shooo yummmmy\" Selena didn't even seem to be in her right mind and Camilla was just matching her pace up your arm. Thankfully it was nowhere near as painful as a full body squash but their slimy mouths and rhythmic chewing were a bother. You were trying to think of things to say still but they had nearly reached your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the weather like in-\" You were cut off as selena had reached the end of your arm and just shoved your whole head in her mouth, licking you all over and compressing your head down to a manageable size for her to chew when the pressure doubled. Even though you were already in Selena's mouth, it seems like Camilla had just shoved both of you into hers and sucked the rest of your bodies in mashing you together like two sticks of gum. The strawberry-esq flavor mixed with saliva and got into your mouth, it was like strawberry syrup but you were having a hard time keeping yourself separate, the teeth mashed and mixed you filing your senses with Strawberry Banana until suddenly you were spit out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game's over... Mom won as soon as you got eliminated.\" You lay there in a lighter pink blob more like Selena's normal looks than her hot pink demon form. You tried to move and felt a giggle from Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelencia <b>regain your senses</b>\" Desiree commanded and suddenly you felt a ripping sensation and a wild rapid shift until you realize Selena had completely reformed but you were still mashed up and sitting on her tongue. She rolled her tongue back and brought you back into her mouth absently chewing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird? Tasty though.\" She said mashing you until some 'juice' came out and then blowing a bubble. As soon as you were nearly as big as she was she snapped her fingers and you were fully reformed. You blinked and looked at her wondering what that was all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree was the one that answered. \"If Zelencia hadn't pulled you apart herself you would likely have been permanently fused onto her somewhere. As thanks for my... help you will now know and voice your desires until the magic of our contract fades.\" You felt the burn in your hand as the magic took effect but... was that really a punishment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thankyou\" You weren't sure that you had wanted to thank her but as soon as the thought had passed your brain it had come out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camilla, I believe you have paperwork to file. You'll be doing that after these games are over. April, I have some souls that have reached assertion, you'll be in charge of the meeting regarding this.\" Desiree seemed to have had some actual work in mind for her daughters as well, who knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe games had two more rounds, hopefully you could get through them unharmed.</span></div></div>",

The purple demon hummed for a second as if she was considering her options. \"Dance Dance Revolution.\" She said snapping her fingers the dance pad appeared one large enough for Desiree to play as well. \"Taking turns, we'll do this elimination style Two players go head to head, looser added to the looser until only one remains.\" That was deceptively simple, and you were okay at games like this, not like Camilla had a significant height advantage. In fact if April was any good at video games she'd be the one to watch out for. \"Puddin you're up first, and verses... Mom you wanna give it a go?\" Okay so she wasn't making it easy, Desiree made the machine groan when she stepped onto it. You couldn't reach the screen so Desiree got to choose the song. You got ready to go since the song she chose was rather easy, you got exactly one step off before you were thrown completely off balance by the practical earthquake that Desiree dancing caused. You were tossed into the air and fell back down and then again, and a third time you splattered out on the left arrow right before the looser screen played. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree had not been expecting to win but she was excited all the same as she smiled down at you. You were about to try and reform and get up when Camilla's still bare foot landed on you. \"My turn next. Let's go\" She Started the song, a hard mode song even and flung herself around on the buttons slamming her boot into you over and over seemingly not bothered by the massive earthquake Desiree caused flailing about on the dance pad. \"Perfect Game!\" Camilla wiped the sweat off her forehead as Desiree feigned disappointment and went to sit back down. Camilla it seemed did not have any plans to let you go rest while the game was going on as she steamrolled both of her sisters. The match was over and it seemed like this time the one to choose had easily won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I think this time I want to make... secret requests.\" She said peeling you off the dance pad. \"Starting with Puddin' here, bee are bee\" She said stepping into a side room. \"Alright Puddin' you really got me last time huh? Lemmy show ya what a real gotcha is like. Reverse Desiree's command, Once you think of what you want you say the opposite, or just say what you don't want the most I don't care which.\" She smiled having given you your command and tossing you out of the room. \"Next!\" She shouted as you fluttered onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as Selena leaned over you. \"What did she tell you to do?\" She asked but you felt even though you could talk you couldn't tell her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much.\" You ended up saying and she took that to mean you didn't want to talk about it leaving you alone to actually reform. You had to win this last game, whatever it was you didn't want to know what would happen to you if you lost you had to ask for them to leave you alone, at least for the rest of the day since you missed your chance because of Selena last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Desiree's turn to choose a game...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After everyone had met in the side room with Camilla you were all once again sitting at the table as Desiree pondered what game she wanted to play. \"Oh I know, Let's play Demon's Dice. It's been so long since the lords of hell have been able to arrange a get together, I'd hate to get rusty.\" She said as if she hadn't just dropped that this was the kind of party game she would play with other demon lords. How were you supposed to win even? \"It's perfectly simple, nothing too complicated for new players.\" She explained as cups full of five dice appeared in front of each of you. \"It's like Liar's dice but each round the players will sacrifice one of their dice to the random dice pool in the middle. Once all the rolling is done we'll guess how many of a particular kind of dice there area, you can't go down in number or how many that you think there are and we continue to go up until someone calls bluff. The player that is wrong is eliminated from the game.\" You gulped, this was impossible wasn't it, you weren't a great liar and figuring out if any of your demon family was faking knowledge would be not worth it. You resolved to just try and play as strait as possible... the only problem was that by your first Anti you realized you couldn't say a single thing the way you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was actually where the bad news ended for you in regards to the game, Apparently the command Camilla had given you had made you nonsensically good at bluffing and before you even realized what was happening you were the only one left against Desiree who seemed... confused? It was hard to tell what was on her mind but it seemed like she didn't understand how you had managed to make it past the first round. You of course figured that it wasn't possible for her to loose now that it was just the two of you and you wanted to surrender now but you couldn't say it thanks to Camilla. You slapped the dice down one more time and peeked under... your pool was all sixes, that was either impossibly good luck or bad luck. Desiree looked satisfied with her roll as well. \"Three sixes.\" She declared, seemingly trying to corner you directly off of the bat, you knew there were more so all you had to do was go for no more than the number you had and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine Sixes\" You blurted out before you could stop yourself eyes going wide as you realized how ridiculous that would be, there were only ten dice left and each of you only could see four of them. Desiree seemed to realize as well and gave an amused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't giving me many choices... I suppose I'll call that a bluff.\" She said casually lifting her dice to reveal three sixes and a one, and then your dice to show four sixes, and finally the hidden dice... they were both sixes. Desiree opened her mouth to speak and then closed it again clearly shocked. \"You, win?\" She almost seemed to be asking a question. \"I see I see, very interesting~ I suppose this will be the last round, go claim your prizes.\" She wasn't exactly smiling anymore, more like a neutral expression of someone that had not gotten their expected outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, yes, yes now you could finally Tell Camilla to leave you alone. You walked up to her and opened your mouth \"Aunt Camilla, can you-\" you felt something weird in your throat \"Greet me with that cute booty bump every time we see each other, the one where you land on me.\" Your eyes bulged at the words that ended up coming out. You HATED when she greeted you like that, why? oh... this was going to be bad. Camilla laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no Problem Puddin' you didn't need a magic compulsion to get me to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to Get April to let your mom know what happened before you messed everything up worse.\"April can you make sure my mom doesn't know anything about what happened for these games for as long as possible?\" like that... Why couldn't you just shut up, this was awful! April smirked at you and started typing something into her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Selena approached curiously, she was confused at what you were doing but didn't seem to want you to stop. \"Selena please you have to- ahhh- next time you see jack squish him and give him to your friend as a gift from meeeee- ahh- in exchange for a date.\" The thoughts of how you could accidentally ruin your life were spilling out of your mouth like vomit, and you could hear Camilla barely able to breath from laughing. Selena was talking to you but you didn't even hear what she said over the pounding in your own ears. And then she was there, towering above you, Desiree waiting for your last request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered your mouth to stop yourself from saying anything stupid immediately like having her step on you and your eyes started going up, until you remembered what you had thought at the very start of the meeting. And of course you couldn't stop yourself from saying your twisted thought out loud. \"I want to know what that Leotard feels like, Desiree can you stretch me out into one for you.\" You felt a pit in your stomach, you should have been able to keep your mouth shut, but for a moment it was as if the whole world was holding it's breath and then a melodic laugh broke the silence. You realized that it was Desiree's, you'd never heard her laugh like that before it was... pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can! My, my my, I didn't think that true thoughts enchantment would get me such interesting results.\" She gripped you in one of her hands instantly smashing you to putty in her soft grasp. \"I suppose I should put a time limit on it though... oh no need for that, I'll just consider it if Barbra insists on having you back eventually. I should wonder how you knew my favorite leotard was feeling a bit of wear and tear, even soul fabric gets worn down a bit after a few centuries.\" She seemed to disregard the thought as she fully grasped you with both hands. \"now, I know you're quite stretchy but I'm a big girl. I'm sure you'll love being pulled to the limit though.\" She said with a sadistic grin as she pulled her hands all the way apart, like any resistance you might have had didn't even exist. You wailed and were surprised when the noise came out, that one pull might be the farthest you've ever been pulled out while squishy. You tried to look at the other demoness in the room for 'help' but they all seemed to be occupied not looking at you if they did feel bad at all. Camilla was still dying of laughter though. You yelped again when she took another yank, and another. Then she placed a foot on you and pulled up. You were having trouble thinking of anything but pain as you suddenly registered a giant mirror near you. Desiree must have summoned it You  were being shown what you looked like, Desiree was talking but you couldn't hear it over the throbbing in your head. You looked at your form, you don't know what you had expected but you saw a rectangular sheet of translucent material with the faint outline of a face comically stretched to the Dark Godesses massive size. \"... and a pinch of magic~\" you caught the last bit as you were suddenly folded in on yourself now looking out from the inside of a translucent leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy down there? I think I'll get dressed the traditional way, just for you.\" She smiled Suddenly no longer dressed in her golden leotard, her nakedness filled you with a mix of emotions. Then the ebony foot descended into you and you realized just which part you were looking out of. You were pulled up past her thicc thighs and snugly pressed your face into her ass Your eyes were just over the small of her back but your nose and mouth were over the ass and the next thing after just how 'perfect' you were made to stretch was how warm Desiree was. Almost warm enough to be a sauna on her own the beads of sweat were already finding their way to your tongue and, a few more flavors you were trying not to think about. She posed in front of the mirror leaning over so that your body was supporting the weight of her breasts and your mouth was pulled into her crack just a bit, you could see her skin through yourself. \"Ohh, you are comfortable~\" She purred \"Unfortunately this color doesn't work for me, since you're durable I'll just use you for both.\" She said matter of factually before snapping her fingers and suddenly you were identical to the leotard she had been wearing before, just now it was made of you instead of whatever else. You whimpered as she slapped her ass making you jiggle along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day wasn't over though...</span></div></div>",

Your face suddenly turned white as you began to feel a very familiar tingling and you watched an equally familiar black cat zip by. \"Oh no...\" You had been bitten by Ian, and were now turned into a squishie like Jack and his family. No one had to tell you that this was bad. You had experienced it too often in your short time in Spectrum Bay, and had been squished and eaten by numerous residents... even Jack and your mother! \"That kitty... I should've been paying attention...\" You wished you could just go back home, but your teacher, Miss Beldam, doesn't take kindly to truancy. Your friend, Rosalyn, failed to show up after running out of her special sunscreen, and she punished her by transforming her mother into a tattoo on her bum for a week. You didn't want anything happening to your mom because you didn't want to go to school, so you pressed on and looked for your friends... and you didn't have to look long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Mary\", a familiar monotone voice called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\" You yelped and jumped forward before turning around and seeing your friends, Rosalyn, and her cousin, Daisy. \"O-oh, hi, Rosie, and Daisy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiiii, Mary!\", the overly excitable Daisy cried as she waved at you. \"Me and Rosie were gonna take auntie Ivy's limo, but I thought that since it's such a pretty day out and Rosie's got a bunch of stock of her special sunscreen, maybe it'd be a good idea to walk through the woods, so I got Rosie to come with me and it's soooo pretty and lush in the forest! We got lost for a little bit, but Rosie was able to figure out where we were by talking to a fruit bat! I didn't even know she could do that, but she did, and we managed to make it over here just in time to meet up with ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... th-that's nice!\", you said. Daisy was quite talkative, and it was admittedly tough to tell what she was saying some of the time with how much she rambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... I made this on the way over, and I thought you might like it...\" Rosalyn turned her face away and presented you with a bracelet made from a very pretty tropical flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gasp* Oh, Rosie, that's so thoughtful!\", you squealed as you put it on. \"You're such a great friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't able to see as Rosalyn blushed a bright red, though she stopped as she began to sniff the air. \"Cotton candy... Uh... Mary, did you get bit by that cat?\", the vampire girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood back a bit. \"Er, yes, I did. Selena's kitty bit me just before you and Daisy got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gasp* Oh no! That means you're gonna be all squishy like Jack and Selena and Bryan and Sarah and Nikki and Rico and Miss Harper and those twins that go here and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we get it, Daisy\", Rosalyn interrupted before grabbing your hand. \"I'll protect you as long as you need me, Mary. I won't let anything happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really sweet, thank you!\", you responded. Rosie was so kind and generous, you couldn't understand why anyone would call her creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm here to help look out for ya too!\", Daisy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at your friends as you touched their shoulders. \"Thank you both very much\", you told them. \"I'm glad to have such great friends like you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned back to the school, you missed it as Rosalyn began blushing again while Daisy giggled. The bell would soon ring as the three of you found your seats. Unfortunately, you were seated away from your friends, who were near the back, both of them sitting between your brother, Gary, and his zombie friend, Gabe. You were sat in front of the class along with Jack, though you unfortunately weren't right next to him. He was sitting between his friends, Andrew and Remy. You gulped as your worst enemy, Sirena, began to sit down next to you. The \"princess\" of the sea creatures had always tried to make a meal of you. In fact, your first day at school was spent gurgling away in her belly. She always spoke down to you, and said that you should feel honored to be the chosen meal for the sea princess. You were more grossed out by the smelly fish girl than anything. Vore was a normal part of life in Spectrum Bay (and at least one other large city, if you remember your social studies lesson correctly).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be much longer before the teacher walked in. \"Good morning class\". The teacher, a witch, had a powerful aura about her. Even without knowing that she was a magic user, with her pale skin, various scary-looking tattoos, and glowing eyes, she gave off the impression that she wasn't one to cross. As a result, none of her students were lower grades. No one wanted to see what would happen if they began failing her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Miss Beldam\", the class recited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch teacher looked over her class once and smiled. \"Nice to see everyone is present today.\" As she began going through her lesson, you gulped as you looked around you, trying to pay attention to the lesson, but also keeping your eye out, as you're quite vulnerable now.</span></div></div>",

Her extensive round bottom was taking the wind right out of you effortlessly. Sadly, the dream ended abruptly at the best part, with Kiki shaking you in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Sarah, stop dozing off so much in class,\" Kiki muttered with her fur ruffling towards her friend's care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry, Kiki,\" You said, gently rubbing your eye awake. \"I'll try not to next time,\" telling her. You then bent over, grabbing your bag as the bell rang. At which point, a hefty stack of books dropped on your hand still place on the desk that made you screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I was aiming for squishy little head of yours,\" Caitlynn affirmed, standing over you, giggling to your pain that was the music to her ears. \"Here's the deal, Sarah, I require all my homework done by you for tomorrow! Or else..\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what!\" Kiki ridiculed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlynn smirked as she grabbed your ponytail to that sort of bothersome response made by Kiki. You watched as she lifted her skunk tail, showing off her silk purple panties before shoving your face between her cheeks. \"This is what! She has the pleasure of serving my ass as panties all day,\" Caitlynn laughed, dragging your face further up her ass, letting loose a blast of gas right in your face. \"Phew, and that's only a preview. So you better not fail or do actually,\" Caitlynn laughed, leaving the classroom. You were in a frenzy coughing up the after inhalation of Caitlynn's repellent spray. It took the assistance of Kiki to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Kiki asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded, not having the heart telling Kiki you held a rancid after taste still. \"Look, I see Faith and Grace,\" you spoke, shoving the books in the backpack to join your other friends. \"Hi, girls,\" you greeted, trying to hide your stinky breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Sarah, Kiki,\" the twins said in harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls,\" you replied, having your head low hinder the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say where's Holly?\" Kiki questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went off to the library and told us to meet her at the mall!\" Faith replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on, let's go already! I need a new bra,\" Grace responded, messing your face between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, pounded between Grace's boobs until you were stretched out, and decided to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you stood there with your head beginning to reform, you wanted to go to the mall with your friends, but as you looked outside, you could see the cheerleaders gathering. Nikki <i>did</i> say that you'd always be welcome to try out... \"I'll meet up with you later. I'm gonna head out to the field\", you told your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna try out for the cheerleaders again?\", Kiki asked, a smirk forming on her face. \"You know you have to get your grades up to even be considered, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as Grace and Faith chuckled. Nikki talked to the headmistress and got her to overlook your grades if you could perform the routine with the rest of the cheerleaders. The head cheerleader practiced with you so you could get it down, but unfortunately, you were never able to complete it when it came time for the actual tryouts. It wasn't so much your malleable body that got in the way, as Nikki was just as squishy and she was the head cheerleader. You just tended to get flustered around all of the cute girls and it was tough to keep your focus and stay in one piece. Sometimes you'd get so aroused by their thick hips and plump breasts that you'd melt a little and have to get peeled off of them. If you managed to get on the team, not only would you not have to worry about your poor social standing or have to do Caitlynn's homework anymore, but you'd be able to be around the hot cheerleaders every day after school. You practically drooled at the thought before shaking your head. \"L-look, Nikki's a friend, okay? She set it up so I'd have a better shot\", you told your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna discourage you, but you don't exactly have the best track record when it comes to tryouts...\", Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it kinda seems like some of the cheerleaders might not want you on the team...\", Faith continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm still gonna give it a shot\", you told them. \"If I don't make it, I'll meet you back at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki put her hand on your shoulder. \"I'll head over with you\", she mewed. \"I wanna make sure no one messes with you during tryouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at your friend as you stood up. \"Thanks, Kiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith and Grace giggled. \"We'll head over to meet Holly. Good luck, Sarah\", they said in unison. The four of you would head out of the classroom together, though you would part ways shortly after. You and Kiki shoved your extra text books into your lockers and headed out to the field and saw the cheerleaders getting a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically drooled as you saw their bodies glisten in the sunlight. You were caught off guard as you heard a familiar voice cry out to you. \"Hiiiii Sarah!\" Nikki quickly ran up to you and giggled. You blushed as the cute cheerleader's trademark pigtails bounced with each step, along with her large, jiggly breasts. She stopped just short of you and squirted her water bottle into her mouth.\"I guess you're wanting to try out again?\", she asked. \"You're always welcome to give it a shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi, Nikki...\", you stammered before regaining your composure. \"*ahem* Yeah, I think I'm ready to try again.  Is there... any chance you could just let me on the team... you know, without a tryout?\", you asked. It was kind of selfish to flat out ask to be let on the team, but if there was a chance she could do that, you wanted to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki winced at your question. \"Sorry, Sarah\", she said in a disappointed tone. \"I know you're my friend, and I'd love to help you out, but it just wouldn't be fair to the other girls if I just gave you a spot on the squad. They're already kind of upset for letting you even try out with your poor grades...\" You frowned at her answer. You were honestly expecting her to say something like that. She noticed your expression and put her hand on your shoulder. \"But hey! I'm sure if you can make it through a routine in one piece, that ought to put their worries to rest!\" Nikki went to hug you, but then grabbed her nose and fanned the air. \"You, er... might want to use the shower first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sorry... I had a run-in with that skunk girl...\"<br>\r\nYou exited the locker rooms after cleaning up and changing, joining the other cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay girls!\", Nikki cried out, getting everyone's attention. \"We've got a potential new recruit with us today!\", she pointed over to your direction, which brought about a couple of claps from Jenna and Brandi, but the other girls groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this loser again\", Shauna groaned under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That weird bitch is just gonna fuck us up\", Quianna muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi, the chubby firefly girl, suddenly piped up. \"Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Have her do the 'lighthouse routine'! I've been dying to try it out and we finally have enough people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... lighthouse routine?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's basically the same routine we'd have before the pyramid formation we practiced, only Randi gets on top and... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was quickly interrupted by Jenna. \"She moons the audience and flashes the light in her butt\", the bunny girl sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as the firefly seemed really enthusiastic, though her mood dropped a bit when Quianna interrupted. \"Ain't no way you're getting on top\", the black girl snapped. \"You're gonna break everyone's backs if your fat ass gets on top!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandi's wings began to vibrate as she suddenly started hovering and fumed at her teammate's insult. \"I'm not fat! I am <b>tiny</b>, and <b>cute</b>, and this is a <b>really</b> good idea for a routine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki thought for a moment. \"Well... I guess with Sarah with us, we'll have some extra support... Alright, Randi, we'll go with your routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firefly girl jumped up in the air with joy as Nikki reassured you. \"Don't worry, you basically know this already. You'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nikki!\" You looked over to the bleachers and saw Kiki cheering you on, though you were still worried about the other girls. Your fears would have to wait, as Nikki tossed you a pair of pom poms and started up her boom box. You were somewhat familiar with the routine, so you did your dances and posing as perfectly as you could. However, there were occasions when you passed by the other cheerleaders where you started messing up. The first time, you miss-stepped after catching sight of Brandi's booty. The second time, you suddenly tripped on something. When you looked back, you could see Quianna and Shauna smirking. It appeared they were definitely out to get you. Nikki looked worried for you, but she put that aside to continue the routine. Brandi, Jenna, and Quianna held their hands down and lifted Nikki, Shauna, and you, respectively. You could feel Quianna seeming to shake your leg and saw Shauna grinning over at you. You gulped as you looked at them. As much as you would love to get splattered on either of them, you didn't want them to mess up your chance of getting on the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Randi would run up and jump up, doing a flip in the air before hovering up to the top of the column, her wings barely able to keep her chubby form up for very long before she landed in yours and Nikki's hands, her weight already proving to be tough to hold up. \"R-Randi, you don't have to shine your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby firefly ignored Nikki as she lifted her skirt up and pulled down her spats and panties, the light in her butt shining brightly as the 'lighthouse' began to struggle beneath her weight. \"I-I can do this...\", you told yourself. \"Just a little longer...\"</span></div></div>",

Jewel of course had gone ahead of you to school, and your mom was already gone so the peaceful breakfast made it a good start. You at least were happy that you could wake up at your own pace, even if it was harder getting to school when you weren't with Jewel. The bus would be the big hurdle today since you hadn't gotten up in time to join jewel on her walk there or catch a ride with your mother Jillian. You didn't often take the bus because of it's inherent dangers, namely the other students but it wasn't like running all the way would get you very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell yourself today would be different though, it wasn't that hard to get through a whole day without being squashed, you could definitely do it this time, even if the record was not in your favor. A breakfast bar was good enough and then it was only a short jog to the bus stop. The usual crowd was there, The hunt sisters Grace and Faith and Jenny O'hair as they were the students on your block. Jenny was barely paying attention to anything but her phone and the cow girls would hardly see you if you stood too close to them so you kept a 'safe' distance. When the bus pulled up you were the last one on so as to avoid being caught underfoot, you considered where to sit since this was one of the first stops only a couple of seats were filled unfortunately that meant you had to choose a spot someone else was unlikely to want. The front of course was highly coveted but at the same time it was very visible meaning that it was easy to avoid accidents of people not noticing you since they could even see you from outside of the bus. The middle seats were unpopular in general so it wasn't likely anyone would be picking them if they had the choice meaning you could possibly skip interaction all together. The last option was to go all the way to the back and try to take the seat that would cause the least problems when you needed to actually get off of the bus. You wished you had made a plan earlier.. \"Hey kid bus is moving get in a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have any more time you go to...</span></div></div>",

You were confident that this was the right choice so you sat just a little on edge the whole time as each stop passed without incident, the blue vest students didn't look at him for long having better things to do. The mid stop was the apartments where you were pretty sure some of the more 'dangerous' students lived. You practically held your breath as Lassie barreled past towards the back of the bus and the cheer squad started piling in. That was when your plan started to backfire, Quiana had stopped at your seat with a pensive look on her face. \"Scoot in green boi, I feel like sitting up here today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated a moment but you got a look from the bus driver, it would get you sent to the principal if you decided not to listen to Quiana since she was a Blue vest student. Reluctantly you moved closer to the window and the dark skinned cheerleader plopped down next to you. You tried to not pay attention to her, but it was very obvious that she was staring at you. \"Uh, can I help you?\" That was probably a poor choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked \"Hmm I wonder.\" She licked her lips and you swallowed nervously, that was usually a bad sign. \"I think you might just be able to,\" She was leaning over you so you'd have to tilt your head up to look at her face or else you would just be buried in her boobs. She took the opportunity to put her finger on your head and spin you around until she could flip you to the exact opposite of a sitting position with your head hanging off the side and your feet up. \"Just hold still like that for a sec\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell if she was just messing with you or not but that was obvious the moment she stood up slightly and moved herself over you, this was a bad scenario. You tried to move a bit but your brain short circuited when she pulled her own panties down and plopped her bare rump right onto your body, only your head was sticking out between her legs and if she closed her thighs she'd be smooshing your face. \"wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe silenced you by pulling the back of your head so your face wound up in her pussy. \"Shhh, I'm just feeling a little hot. Do a good job and you're free once we're off the bus, Heck I'll even make sure you ain't left behind.\" You try to tell her to let you go but all that did was stimulate her a bit and it was clear you weren't going to get a chance to talk your way out, was it really that bad of a deal?</span></div></div>",

You knew there were quite a few stops on the way so it was just the case that you would have to watch them. This couldn't hold your interest forever though and after one or two stops you were very tempted to take a short nap. The lack of people coming to bother you contributed a fair bit to your heavy lidded approach since it would be another half an hour before you would even get to the school being one of the first stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a startling jolt to the long bench that was the back seat that snapped you to attention, the blue hair and black vest caught your attention as the students with black shirts were few and far between Hilda if you recalled her name correctly but she had sat on the other side but there was still a shadow coming over you and the dread was immediate. Lassie was one of the other black vest students but unlike Hilda the dog girl was massive even compared to most of the other students and had a bad habit of not listening to or noticing the much smaller students. In fact she looked like she was simply skipping along with here eyes closed towards the back. You scrambled into the corner to make room but scooting wasn't fast enough you tried to stand up and move but tripped over your own feet in a panic. You rolled over just in time to get a look at the 'Moondog' wrestling logo on her panties before the booty they were covering crashed into you with a particularly loud SQUISH and a slow hiss as the actual material of the seat caved in to her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meteor impact of furry butt would have been bad enough just resting on top of you but Lassie wiggled and lifted and dropped again having sat her tail down wrong farther splattering you across her massive rear. You felt the slight jiggle above as her tail started to wag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hildy look they added squishy cushi to the seat!\" She seemed to not actually have noticed you at all and attributed it to extra padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I don't feel it.\" The blue haired girl casually waved the excited dog girl off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLassie looked confused for a moment but then lifted up and dropped down again making another much softer squishing sound. \"Ehhh? But it makes a squish noise.\" She bounced again still easily covering your whole body with her butt even as she spread it out. The day had started off so good too...</span></div></div>",

You just can't help but dive down people's throats or force yourself up their butts. It just feels too good!<br>\r\nIt came as a bit of a surprise, then, that Spectrum Bay was not only just as bad as your former home of Ishtef, but was the main reason other people move over here.

Earlier, you were upset that Barbara had called you to let you know she didn't need you tonight, and more so when you found out Ignacio had plans. But your spirits were lifted when he and Nikki invited you to join them. You wore your usual white, red, and navy outfit and sat in the living room. \"Come ooonnnn\", you whined. \"It's gonna be daytime before you and burger boy finish...\" Suddenly, the music stopped and the door opened. Nikki walked out with her hair out of her trademark pigtails, allowed to hang down, wearing a cute white and black top, with pink lipstick and a pair of black high heels. What made your jaw drop, though, was Ignacio. She had combed his mohawk to the side, covering the left side of his head, and dressed him in a plaid purple skirt, and a purple camisole under a black long-sleeved net shirt... though he still had a pair of black boots and his mask. You never could understand why he never took it off... or how he ate with it on. \"Oh my gosh! You made Iggy look so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour short roommate blushed and looked away. \"I... think this might've been a bad idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh quit being such a grump\", Nikki said as she bent down to his level. \"Rico's gonna like it~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah, of course... but that's not what I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIggy was interrupted as a car honked outside and Nikki squealed. \"That's Zekey! C'mon, let's go!\" She quickly snatched up Ignacio and ran outside, leaving you to lock the door. You quickly followed them downstairs and found Nikki's zombie boyfriend, Ezekiel, standing outside. He was wearing a greaser-style getup. A pair of skinny black jeans, a studded belt, a tank top, and a leather vest, along with the bandages he used to cover the stitches holding him together. With him was Rico Salazar, Ignacio's boyfriend. He was wearing a pair of skinny jeans as well, though they appeared to be a bit too small, as they struggled to contain his fat, squishy booty. He also had on a pair of custom order shoes, an open white shirt (which exposed his chest and the lil bit of tummy pudge), and a purple thong with both the side straps visible for all to see. As usual, he was paying more attention to his phone than anything else. Nikki ran down and dropped Ignacio off and hugged her Zekey, giving him a kiss and leaving pink lipstick on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rico looked up from his phone at Ignacio. \"Um... Nikki dressed me like this... I don't hate it, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we're definitely gonna have to get you out of that soon\", Rico said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I mean, I don't think it's <i>that</i> bad...\" Ignacio saw that the shortstacked boy had a hungry look in his eyes and was biting his lips. The short grumpy manager's face turned bright red, even showing through his mask as he tried to look away. \"O-oh... you mean that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you sneaked over, trying to get your face between Iggy's cheeks... only for Rico to pull him away, and bring him in for a selfie, causing you to splat face-first into the car. You grumbled as you peeled yourself off the side as Ezekiel came to help. \"Oh hey, Maddy\", he said in a sort of monotone voice. \"Nice to see you're joining us, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as he went to help. Even though he was Nikki's boyfriend, it was hard not to stare at the cute zombie boy. \"Y-yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour staring was interrupted as Nikki ran over to hug him. \"Zekey and Rico found this new club that opened up, so we're gonna stop there first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was <i>gonna</i> play there tonight, but those assholes tried to lowball me\", Rico grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're probably worried about budget stuff... or something\", Ignacio yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked as you bent down to your roommate's level. \"Awww, is Iggy feeling sweepy?\", you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, pervert\", he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you two quit bitching. Let's get there before it gets too crowded.\" Ezekiel unlocked the car and got into the driver's seat, while Nikki got in the front seat and you and Ignacio got in back, though you quickly noticed that there wasn't enough room. \"Oh yeah, there's only enough room for four in my mom's car... I didn't think the gremlin was gonna come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... guess I'm gonna have to share with someone...\", Rico said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened and you practically drooled at the thought of the short latino boy's fat ass squishing you into the seat... but your hopes were crushed along with Ignacio's abdomen as you heard the wind get knocked out of his lungs as Rico plopped his thick booty on top of his boyfriend. \"Lucky...\", you grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzekiel drove around, appearing to be lost before stopping at a parking lot of a large night club. He and the others got out (with Ignacio gasping as his boyfriend hopped off of him) and the five of you began to walk up. You clenched your skirt as you saw all of the cute guys walking around. You wanted to just yank their pants off and force yourself down their cocks, but you promised Nikki that you'd try to control yourself. You all walked past the bouncer before Ezekiel got a table. \"I gotta eat something first\", the zombie boy said. \"Hunger pangs are startin' to get bad, and I don't wanna freak out or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but we just got here\", Nikki whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be up in a bit, babe\", Zeke said. \"Don't let me keep you from having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... okay. You know where to find me~\" Nikki blew Ezekiel a kiss before heading out on the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched your friend head out, you were still practically drooling. Maybe Nikki wouldn't notice if you had a <i>little</i> fun...</span></div></div>",

You've taken in several kids to live with you, married both your life-long friend, Barbara and her twin sister, April, both of whom you love dearly. You've also taken the responsibility of helping raise their children. As you sip your morning tea, you groan as you notice that your medication has run out. For the past year and a half, you've been taking some candy-like medicine to keep your body from being malleable all the time, and it's produced by the bratty young genius, Jacqueline Creed, who happens to be your worst enemy. The chubby little girl had already made it a point to make your life miserable, and now that you live just a fifteen minute drive (and a ferry ride) away from her, she's found even more opportunity to make your life hell. Unfortunately, since the company she runs is responsible for much of the city's economy, your demonic wives aren't able to do anything about her, aside from convincing her to take it easy on you. She used to mail your prescription to you after you paid the ridiculous price for it, but since you live in the same city, you're now required to go directly to Mire Island and get it from her yourself. You don't ever leave without being put through some sort of machine she's working on or being used as a seat cushion for either herself or one of her employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be a good idea to avoid her as long as you can. After all, a large house like this has a lot of chores that need done. You <i>could</i> get one of the kids to help, but you usually end up going back over their work and doing it yourself. And expecting Becky or Rico to do anything at all is pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it could be a good day to spend with your wives or the kids. You do have a gym to help run with Barbara and Tina. Maybe you could see her and help someone with their workout. April has been needing some attention as well. You normally hate being stretched and molded, but with her, it seems quite pleasurable. Although, staying with her has the caveat of being around her obnoxious sister, Camilla.<br>\r\nIt's a good day to take the kids out to the beach, though. Despite living here for several months, you have yet to plan a family outing. Maybe today would be a good day for your household to enjoy the sand and sun.</span></div></div>",

You have the thankless job of running the only fast food restaurant in town, Lucha Burger. Very rarely do you go a day without having trouble with either one of the customers or one of your employees. Although, even you admit that you're pretty stubborn at times. You hate having to deal with special orders or coupons, sometimes denying them outright. And you hate having to change your employees schedule up when they want to change their hours. This has led you to becoming pretty unpopular. As long as you get through the day in one piece, you don't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the manager, you don't get much free time to yourself. What little free time you do get, you try to spend with your boyfriend, Rico. Because he's a fairly popular DJ though, your schedules don't always match up, but you still end up spending the night at each others houses often. For some reason, you aren't stubborn at all around him. You're always up for whatever he wants to do, even if it involves you spending hours with your face wedged between his fat asscheeks or being led around on a leash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour roommates get on your nerves sometimes, but they're too sweet for you to actually be mad at. They sometimes bring the kids that they babysit in the apartment, and have parties while you're trying to sleep. On more than one occasion, someone's sneaked into your room and had you as a snack while you were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been trying to keep up your reputation as a pred, but it's been pretty tough lately. Especially since the little slime guy, Dominic, has gotten a taste for you. It's pretty humiliating being prey for someone who's seen exclusively as prey themselves, but you kinda enjoy it. He's kind of cute, even if he's a couple hundred years your senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going on today?</span></div></div>",

You rolled your eyes at the usual jokes made about it stunting your growth before grabbing it and leaving. You pulled your mask down to take a sip before immediately pulling it back up. Your teeth got smashed in by some asshole when you were in high school, and you were really sensitive about it. The mask helped to hide them (some folks also seemed to find it hot). Before you could take a second sip, you were suddenly surrounded in a familiar bright teal light! \"Oh fuck, not again!\", you cried, dropping your coffee as you suddenly began to shrink! It took only a few of seconds for you to be reduced down to just two inches tall! As you heard a familiar sadistic giggling, you groaned. \"Goddammit... I bet it was that little brat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly plucked up off of the ground and sighed as you hung there with the back of your shorts gripped between their finger and thumb. \"Look, whatever it is you want for free, you can have-\" As you looked at the face of the person who picked you up, your eyes went wide in fear. She was a short, dark-skinned woman with shoulder-length red hair, and a very thick figure. She was wearing a black sports bra and a pair of purple lycra mini shorts, along with a purple sweatband and some running shoes. \"M-Mom?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Iggy\", Camilla chuckled as she placed you on the palm of her hand. \"Didn't expect to see my baby boy on my morning walk. Hope you're ready to make mama some money!\" Your world suddenly went dark as she pressed her face into you and gave you a big kiss, her lips completely engulfing your body. It almost felt like you were going to be sucked in before she took her face back. Your mother owned a good amount of the businesses in Spectrum Bay, one of them being Lucha Burger, the restaurant that you were tasked with running. Anyone else would jump at the chance to be put in charge of a business that was owned by their parents, but you weren't working there by choice. She kept most of the profits, and you were only given enough to live off of (which is why you had no problem letting Nikki and Maddy live with you to help with rent). You would quit if you could, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom, I can't!\", you insisted. \"Didn't you see what just happened to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla put a finger to her chin. \"Hmm... You 'member where you were for twenty years?\", she asked with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and looked down. \"I... I was fat on your ass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you 'member <i>why</i> I let you come out?\", your demonic mother asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* To run your business for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! And you 'member what happens if you can't do that...?\" Camilla held you in her fist and brought you back around, pressing you face-first into her sweaty, lycra-covered booty. As the doughy flesh engulfed you, you swear you could hear the pathetic groaning of your brothers and sisters trapped for an eternity as the demonic shortstack's assfat. \"You wanna go back home to mama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I-I'll do whatever you want!\", you yelled. It was 20 years ago that your mother found you and gobbled you up and turned you into assfat. Of course, by then you were in such a pitiful state that it was almost welcomed. When she acquired another business, she decided that running it full-time was boring and she plucked out your soul and reformed you, giving you a deal: run her business for her and keep the money coming, or go right back to an eternity padding her booty. You couldn't really say no, and you've been stuck there ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Camilla brought you back to her face and put her hand on her hip. \"Hmm... now what's my baby boy gonna be doin today...?\", she wondered aloud as she tossed you up and down in the air.</span></div></div>",

I guess Nikki's brother might be able to help...\" Your thoughts were interrupted as the door opened, and your roommates walked in along with several others you weren't familiar with. There was a grey bunny anthro with long brown hair wearing red short shorts and a white sleeveless shirt their legs were really thick, and they didn't seem to be wearing shoes. There also seemed to be a human girl with her long black hair in twintails. She was wearing a pink hoodie with a white bunny on the chest, along with a purple skirt and knee-high socks with black shoes. There was also someone with blue-ish black shoulder-length hair and a grey button-up shirt. They had grey-ish brown pants, and mismatched shoes, with one of them being grey and the other white. They were probably Maddy's friends. She had mentioned that they were coming over. The bun was probably Mat, and the twintail girl was Kimmy. The barista-looking friend must have been AE, then. Following them, were a few people you were familiar with. There was Nikki's boyfriend, Zeke, and his little brother, Gabe. Also following them was Nikki's little angel brother, Zaine. He was honestly the one you were the happiest to see right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is pretty nice, Maddy\", said the Kimmy as she walked into the living room. \"I still haven't seen that ghost lady you told me about, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can't wait to see that rainbow ocean at sunset... By the way, where's that grumpy roommate you were talking about?\", asked Mat as they shut the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ignacio?\", Maddy asked. \"He runs the burger place, so we probably just missed him. As for that creepy ghost lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your poor friend works so very hard\", Zaine said as he hovered in the air. \"I feel so very awful for him and his situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki hugged her little brother. \"Aww... it's fine, Zainey\", the cheerleader assured. \"That's what he chose to do, and I'm afraid there isn't much we can do about it. We can just be as good of friends as we can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could bite him\", Zeke said. \"He can't be taken to Hell if he can't die. You want me to bite him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... I'm sure he wouldn't like that\", said AE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You have an idea, Gabe?\", Zeke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh! Guh-guh!

Right here, assholes! I need your help!\" They didn't seem to notice you as they continued on their conversation. Then they began to head over to the couch.

You were fortunate that your mom plucked you up when she did. \"At least I'm able to get to them here...\" You neared the edge of the stairs and hopped down, sighing in relief that you were near the edge of the staircase. As you set foot on the ground floor, you walk toward the center of the room to get a better view of the house. It was tough to tell where you were in this house even when you were normal sized. Maybe it would have been a good idea to look around more before you were shrunk.

With all of the toy robots and video game figures on the shelves, you figure this room must belong to Nikki's little brother, Jack. You met him once, when his sister shrunk you before. He failed to notice you and sat on you, squashing you underneath his butt for a little while before he noticed you. After a misunderstanding (involving a second meeting with his rump), he was nice enough to help you find your way home. Of course, you just ended up getting eaten, but it was still nice of the boy. Maybe he could help you this time, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked inside and headed over to where his game systems were. He seemed to have a pretty good selection, even if some of the controllers had some semi-transparent gunk on them. Rico always wore gloves when working with his music equipment, so you figured it was probably his \"sweat\". You knew from experience that squishies got particularly sticky when they sweat. You looked through the boy's room to see if he was in here, climbing on top of one of one of those weird rocking gamer chairs kids seemed to often get. You didn't see him, but you didn't need to wait long for him to arrive. He was looking to be exhausted and sweaty. \"*pant* Why's it so hot today?\", he groaned as he locked the door behind him. \"I thought I was gonna melt... good thing Remy brought that water gun.\" Jack sighed as he quickly began to strip down and grab a box of tissues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned bright red as he dropped his underwear, too. You weren't proud to admit it, but Jack easily had the best butt you've ever seen. Rico's was something to behold, and was much bigger, but something about Jack's plump butt was entrancing... so much so that you failed to notice as you were soon met with the familiar sight of Jack's huge butt about to drop on top of you! \"W-wait! Kid, watch where you- MMMMFFF!!!\" You were quickly silenced as the boy plopped his plump squishy buns on his chair, smushing you in the process! You attempted to cry for help, but your mouth was filled with the sweet and salty-tasting butt flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! I-is somebody there?!\", Jack asked, quickly looking around. He apparently didn't feel the tiny guy he has smushed under his buttcheek. \"Hm... Might've been from Rico's room...\" The boy turned the tv on to play one of the dvds he had sneaked out of Kris' room... and began gripping his slowly erect cock. He bit his lip as he rubbed his dick, sitting back and pressing more of his weight on top of you. You couldn't hear much from your position under the boy's asscheek, but you could definitely hear moaning. This was not where you wanted to be. Shrunken people and horny boys do not make for a favorable combination, at least from where you were sitting... or, rather, where Jack was sitting. Unfortunately, as you knew from your experience with Rico, maneuvering underneath a mass of squishy flesh is damn near impossible. As you uselessly struggled, you were just going to have to hope Jack wouldn't want to play with the shrunken guy he found under his butt...</span></div></div>",

You blushed as you were moved closer until your face was pressed against one of his buttcheeks. The soft, malleable flesh conformed perfectly to your face, as if you were being engulfed by a balloon filled with molasses. The normally sweet strawberry scent was overpowered by a funky, salty stench. \"Um, oops. That's not where you were supposed to go\", Jack said as he pulled your face from his cheek. He grabbed a handfull of buttflesh and spread the cheek out of the way, exposing his twitching pink anus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! It was a misunderstanding, kid! You gotta belive me!\", you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", Jack responded. \"You're going up my butt, and you're gonna stay there until I think you've been punished enough.\" Jack seemed unsure of what he was doing, but he was intent on punishing the tiny pervert. You grunted as your face was pressed into the pink anus. Jack bit his lip as he forced you up his pucker, finding that he enjoyed the feeling of the tiny guy struggling against him. It was rare that he was able to overpower someone else and have such control, and he'd be lying if he said he didn't enjoy the power he had now. The boy pressed his finger on your feet and shoved you all the way up inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you were finding out that despite smelling sweet on the outside, Jack's insides were quite rotten. The walls of his rectum were much stickier than regular people's, and his bowels reeked of rotten strawberries and rancid milk, mixed with a weird sludge-like smell. \"Ugh... this is disgusting...\", you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grabbed a pair of underwear and pulled them back up, cutting off his little prisoner's escape route. He looked back and squeezed his cheeks together. \"I'm gonna keep you there for a couple of days, and I <i>might</i> let you out if I think you're being good enough. So you better behave.\" You sighed as you listened to the dorky little boy boss you around while he kept you imprisoned up his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do to deserve this?\" As you tried to make yourself comfortable, you were suddenly hit by a burst of stinking wind as on the outside, Jack let out a rotten berry-smelling fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy blushed and fanned the air. \"Hehe, uh... sorry about that\", he said with embarrassment in his voice before going back to \"warden mode\". \"N-no wait, no I'm not!\" Jack put his hands on his hips and pouted. \"If you're gonna keep snuggling up to my butt, then you gotta deal with everything that comes out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a whimper as Jack sat back down, turning his movie off to play a game. As he sat down, his weight compressed you even more. \"Well...\", you thought. \"... It's only a couple of days... Maybe I can convince him to take me to that little brat after it's over...\"</span></div></div>",

You knew the boy from when Maddy babysat him, and he was a handful even when you were at full size. On more than one occasion, he had sneaked into your room while you were sleeping and gobbled you up. Now that you were only a couple inches tall, he was bound to be a nightmare. \"Hey!\", the little boy cried as he looked down at the teeny guy. \"You Iggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped once more and chuckled uneasily. \"Hehe, y-yeah.

S-Stevie, don't do that!\", you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, you funny, Iggy\", the boy giggled. \"You always too sleepy to play, so I nom you, but you up now. You wanna play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStevie soon stopped tossing you and allowed you to begin to get your bearings. \"Uh... n-not now, okay?\", you said as calmly as you could. \"You have to let me... actually, I need you to take me to the girls. The younger girls, a couple years older than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you wanna play wiff the girls?\", Stevie asked. \"They icky. You play wiff me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...

But now you more little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt more than a little annoyed at the (admittedly smart) joke about your height. \"Gee, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Stevie's innocently sadistic mind began to work.

You fell a short distance before you landed, sliding down the fabric of his undies before you were crashed into his groin. You let out a muffled yelp as the boy let the waistband of his underwear and shorts snap shut, compressing you against his genitals. Your glasses slid off as your lower body was forced against the young boy's sac, and your face being pressed into the head of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, you safe down there, Iggy\", Stevie giggled. \"Les go to my room and play!\" The boy scuttled over to the staircase and crawled up, his groin occasionally rubbing up against the steps. You grunted as you felt your body occasionally hit the carpet-covered stairs, forcing the much larger boy's full weight to press on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... at least if he crushes me, I'll reform at full size... maybe...\" Reformation was a bit odd. Sometimes if you were eaten or crushed, you might be able to reform at full size. However, there were many times where the person would reform at the size they were before they perished. As Stevie continued crawling, you suddenly felt something engulf the top of your head. \"Huh? Oh fuck...\", was all you managed to get out before your head was swallowed by Stevie's cock! As he continued heading up the stairs, he giggled at the funny feeling as more of your body was forced into the hungry member. You squirmed as hard as you could and tried to pull your head out, only for his groin to hit the steps once more and your arms and upper body were forced in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the top of the stairs and to his room, he shut the door and stretched his underwear and shirts out and couldn't help but giggle as he looked down. His babysitter's shrunken roommate was waist-deep in his penis, with his little legs kicking and flailing uselessly as you tried to escape. \"Heehee! My peepee eat you up, Iggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\", you groaned as you tried in vain to escape from the tight fleshy tube. \"I'm not gonna hear the end of this from Maddy, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a sliver of hope as Stevie grabbed your feet, but it was crushed as he forced them in. \"You peepee food, now Iggy!\", he giggled as he fed you to his hungry cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you little brat!\", you cried out as you were pushed all the way into his penis. You felt his fingers push you further in, squeezing his cock down until there was no chance of you escaping on your own. You could hear his laughter from inside his body as you were slurped further inside. Finally, you were deposited into a tight, smelly chamber...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Spectrum Bay is a city full of various kinds of people, each more predatory than the last. Vore is commonplace, and there are several residents who's bodies are squishy and malleable (and rather tasty). Just because they're vulnerable, though, doesn't mean they're at the bottom of the food chain. With enough practice, anyone can be a predator... sometimes someone will simply shove themselves right up your booty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's more than just vore going on, though. If you aren't careful, you could be turned <i>into</i> a squishie, or even end up in someone's underwear drawer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a city full of different species of predators, it can be difficult to make it through the day without something going wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA list of characters within the world of Spectrum Bay. You don't necessarily have to use someone from here.<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sta.sh/21sw92n3ol6t\" target=\"_blank\">https://sta.sh/21sw92n3ol6t</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've written numerous stories and made several comics with the city's residents.<br>\r\nThe stories are here:<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://aryion.com/g4/view/483535\" target=\"_blank\">https://aryion.com/g4/view/483535</a><br>\r\nAnd the comics can be found here:<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://aryion.com/g4/view/626666\" target=\"_blank\">https://aryion.com/g4/view/626666</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====================================================================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Death isn't permanent. While some characters can be digested or smashed, they will walk out of the ocean and onto the beach once the sun sets as if nothing happened... though they'll walk out without their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) You can switch to another character at any time. Just try to have the switch make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Some characters are meant to only interact with certain characters. Please respect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Try to use proper grammar and punctuation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Please keep chapter at a decent length. No one-sentence chapters. Bridge chapters are understandable, but try to limit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) If you'd like, you can introduce your own character in the \"new student\" or \"tourist\" choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) Just about anything is allowed. Magic/transformation/aliens/ect.<br>\r\nThe only thing I won't allow is excessive gore and scat.</td>",
