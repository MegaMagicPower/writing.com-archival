I have to look good in case I run into any reporters!\" Stephen Salt, patriarch of Salt house announced to the other 3 members of his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad is going on another research trip and he's leaving us at home. Typical.\" Summer, the older daughter, said this without even looking up from her newspaper. (Some might question the truthfulness of a school girl reading the newspaper over her breakfast, but that just goes to show that Summer Salt was not your average schoolgirl.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear, I already told you. You girls are still a bit too young to travel with me and your mother. Besides, adventuring is no reason for you to miss several days of school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...But what if something happens HERE while you are gone?\" Mouse, the younger daughter asked while desperately pulling on her dad's sleeve. \"Maybe- Maybe Mrs. Hobbs gets kidnapped\" (Mrs. Hobbs was their next-door neighbor and one who Mouse particularly hated, ever since the old woman caught her chasing after her cats) \"or we and mom get attacked by burglars...Well, it COULD happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Salt gave his wife a hearty laugh and a big, broad smile.<br>\r\n\"Ah, the girls have such imaginations, don't you think, dear? Now, girls, what is it that your dad always says?...Adventure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...only happens in fiction...\" the girls replied obediently in chorus. \"You might want to think a bit more about that one, dad.\" Summer added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, no more backtalk. Obey your mother while I'm not at home, and Summer, look after your sister while your mother is out visiting her friends and shopping, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two parents were still waving and laughing while they crossed the house treshold and waited for the taxi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather than us, THEY are the ones who act like something out of fiction\" Summer muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do now, Summer?\" Mouse* asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(*Mouse's parents haven't christened their youngest daughter Mouse. Her old name, which she now refused to wear, even though it was affectionately hand-picked by her mother, was Susan. However after a complicated childhood incident gained her the nickname \"Mouse\", she took to the new title like a fish takes to water. She used it when she introduced herself and she even put it on all of her school supplies and clothing, after carefully scrubbing off the original text first, of course. Her parents tried to resist her, but eventually gave in, and from that point onward, nobody be they friend or stranger was allowed to address her by any other name.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer knew that look on her sister's face.<br>\r\nTheir parents have barely stepped outside, and she was already thinking of trying out something against the house rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer glanced outside the window. The milkman was finishing up his rounds, some early birds were gathering on the roadside. Business seemed as usual in the sleepy town of Hollering Heights. And yet, something felt off.<br>\r\nHer sixth sense was telling her that this wasn't going to be just like any other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to...</span></div></div>",

I've had it all planned out. We'll leave a message on the door to tell them where we had gone if they come back sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse scratched her head. She knew her sister was weird.

However this was not very surprising - hardly anybody in Hollering Heights usually locked their doors in the summer. Public safety was considered to be good in the small town, and every family with children tended to keep their doors open for the kids of other families when they came to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this Summer entered the house without thinking too much into it. The main rooms seemed to be empty but she could hear some faint sounds from upstairs, so she followed the stairs up to the bedrooms. However, as she swung the first door open, she immediately wished she had knocked.<br>\r\nFor she had stumbled upon a most unbelievable scenario...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge and Abby were both in their school uniforms, but they were unbuttoned and both girls were barefoot. Abby was sitting on a chair and Marge was tying her wrists with some sort of rope. Around them on the floor were various other equipment like cuffs, a collar, and a whip.<br>\r\nBoth parties were so shocked that neither of them moved for 5 seconds.<br>\r\nIt was Margaret who came round first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Get her!\" she yelled in panic. Summer turned around to run, but the two girls were faster.<br>\r\nShe tried to get free, but Margaret had a grip on her like an iron vise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do with her, Marge?\" Abby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop her from escaping.\" Margarter barked, her teeth chattering.<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed the long rope that's previously been used on Abby's wrists and they promptly tied Summer to the chair. Her ankles were fixed to the front legs of the chair, making her soles face upward. Her wrists were bound together and secured to the backrest. Margaret then put her palm over her mouth so that she wouldn't scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few intense seconds, Marge removed her hand.<br>\r\n\"Look - you can't tell anyone what you saw here. Got it? If you do...I'll just...You can't imagine what I'll do to you...\" she said, pacing up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-ut WHAT did I see?\" Summer blurted out. \"All I saw were you two, I mean, it's not like you did anything ba...\" Her voice trailed off under Margaret's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk.\" Her face fell. \"You think my parents would accept a-an L-word? If this gets out of here I'm finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Marjie, I didn't know you were ashamed of me?\" Abby asked playfully and pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret turned away from Summer and grabbed the hands of her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I could be ashamed of you.

She glanced around searching for something that could help her out and found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the grand emotional scene seemed to be over because Margaret came over to Summer again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, do you SWEAR you'll never tell this to anyone? I'll remind you that you have no choice unless you want to feel my wrath.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Summer tried begging Abby to let her go, \"Please let me go Abby, I promise I won't ever barge in like this again, just don't tickle me please\" Abby smiled \"Sorry Summer, I would like to let you go but if I did that then I would be the one Marge would tickle all day because I let you go\" Summer knew she was in so much trouble, Marge and Abby always teamed up on kids at school whenever either one of them got a hold of them, and Summer knew how they tickled their victims to the brink of insanity, not letting up even an inch no matter how much their victims begged. Summer had always been able to avoid them at school but now she had no where to run and no other kids to take the fall so she could escape, she knew hell was coming her way fast and there's nothing she can do to stop it. If her sister had come with her then she might have been able to help but Mouse had decided to go over to her own friends house while Summer came here. Abby sat down in front of Summers bare soles, as she eyed them up and down for a couple seconds before beginning Summers Tickle Hell, Abby began by teasing Summer with sliding one finger up and down her right arch, Summer immediately cringed as she felt Abby's finger make contact with her arch, she tried to hold in her laughter but with Summer's feet being some of the most hypersensitive feet around she was only able to last about 5 seconds before she started cracking up. \"HahahahahahNoooooStttooooopppppllleeeaasseeeeHahahahahaha\" Abby then began slide all her fingers up and down Summers right arch which made Summer laugh louder. Summer already felt like she couldn't take much more and the torture had just started, how would she be able to survive a whole day of this. Then Abby grabbed Summer's toes with one hand and began spidering her fingers underneath Summer's toes which sent Summer into hysterics \"HahahahahahahahaOoooMmmmyyyyyGoooooddddddpllleeeaaassseeesttoooopppphahahah ahahahaha\". Meanwhile in the other room Margaret could hear Summer's laughter echo throughout the house which was music to her ears, her assistant was doing a great job so far but the worse was still yet to come for Summer because Abby's tickling is nothing compared to Margaret's so if she thinks she is in hell now, she will be in for a big surprise once Margaret gets her fingers on her. \"Lunch is just about done which means I will be able to have some fun with our guest soon as well\".</span></div></div>",

She tested her toes, like she was tuning up a piano, then she grabbed the foot and turned it this way and that way. She started giving little baby tickles on various spots, her fingers visiting the insteps, the curves of the sole, the heels. Summer was close to crying because she realized she was learning about what parts were the most sensitive and would make Summer beg and scream and cry the most. So that when she finally got serious, her attack was going to be devastating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, it was Abby who became the focus of Summer's loathing.<br>\r\nSummer now had a massive hatred for Abby. Previously she made the mistake of putting her down as just an innocent lackey to carry out Marge's whims, but now she realised that she was a girl for whom empathy was just another word in the dictionary.<br>\r\nAs she scratched her sole, humming to herself happily, she acted like all the frantic flapping and toe-twirling wasn't even there. At least Marge responded to Summer's twitches and cries, if only to try to experiment and get a better reaction out of her, but Abby just disregarded her predicament and carried on mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer knew she was sensitive. But she felt like up until this point she never fully realized what that really meant. Every minute, every SECOND unlocked new unexplored depths of despair in her. And all of this with only a couple of feathers and fingers...Summer felt like she was about to break down crying from the humiliation alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, is someone coming down with the giggles?\" Margie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer shook her head and her tears were falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickle tickle little girl\" she sung.<br>\r\n\"NOPLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her amazement, Margaret actually stopped at this point.

She probably just naively obeyed their command to come over alone, and delivered herself right into their trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer, what's going on?\" Mouse asked confused while Margaret locked the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the torture chamber, Summer's sister. We're going to be your hosts. I don't know much about you yet but don't worry: we're all going to get to know each other as friends pretty well by the end of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer saw Margaret and Abby circling around her sister like vultures.<br>\r\nWhy did you just come here instead of calling for help Mouse, why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse saw that Summer was panting, half-naked and tied up and the coin finally dropped, but there was nowhere to run to. Their captors just laughed at her efforts to get past them. Margaret who was much stronger than even Summer could restrain her effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do, what to do...\" Margaret mused. \"Perhaps we should just continue with Summer's payback...\" She slid a finger over her exposed sole.<br>\r\nSummer let out an animal scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, no, I don't want to use them up too fast. Abby, tie up the little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver Mouse's protests, they tied her arms and legs to Margaret's bed effortlessly.<br>\r\nThen, to Summer's suprise, Margaret started undoing the ropes that were attaching her to the chair.<br>\r\nAs soon as both legs and one hand of her was free, Summer started undoing the other ropes furiously, and was kicked in her side as a reward and fell to the floor next to the bed, sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret then ordered Abby to tie ropes around Summer's wrists and ankles, and forced her to kneel down at the end of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Summer Salt, this is how it goes.\" she ordered her. \"Every time we see you NOT tickling her, we'll start tickling you. And YOU KNOW HOW BAD THAT IS RIGHT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" Abby added, grinning. \"If you don't tickle her then we will tickle you AND her.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! With seconds!\"<br>\r\n\"And don't think you can get away with just some weak tickles. We will only spare you if you can impress us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh\" Summer panted. \"You two are out of your minds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there really no way out from this devious trap? She could not bring herself to do all that's been done to her to somebody else, especially her own sister. But maybe the only way out was to make them believe she'd comply...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered something Mouse did to her once, and hoped it'd be enough.<br>\r\nCursing that she had to make herself look as if she betrayed her, she slid a palm over the left side of Mouse's thigh, then back and over her sides. Mouse barely even giggled and Summer was watching the other two hoping this'd be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOnoNo, you're doing it all wrong!\" Abby brushed her aside.<br>\r\n\"You have to savor all the little reactions, like this, see?\" she stated pinching and squeezing Mouse's toes and tummy skin that made the younger sister buckle and unleash a deep throaty laugh.<br>\r\n\"OK then. We'll give you a test run and show you how it's done first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-I didn't start yet...\"<br>\r\n\"Too late.\" Margaret stated brutally.<br>\r\nShe switched on the electric toothbrush. \"Five minutes start...now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched her toy to the little sister's sole and Mouse's body immediately became electrified.<br>\r\nSummer closed her eyes (though she couldn't filter out Mouse's desperate laughs and yells). The only thing she could have hope in now was Mouse's extraordinary stamina. She cursed their fate as Mouse laughed herself silly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finally was over after what seemed like a lifetime, Abby offered the brush to Summer again.<br>\r\n\"Last chance. If you don't do it, it's another fifteen minutes with the brush for BOTH of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse then screamed...</span></div></div>",

Margaret however, kept calm and said: \"If you were forced to tickle her, why are you completely untied and you can escape anytime?\" Summer noticed that she was completely untied, her clothes just right beside her and the door was open, not blocked by anyone or anything. When or how the escape route was free for her, she did not know, but she was certain that she could not escape when they untied her from the chair. She tried to explain this to Mouse but Abby then joined in, try explaining this too and she wriggles her fingers under Mouse's shirt, exploiting one of her most ticklish spots. Sunmer tried to convince her that these are all lies but her little sister had believed Margaret's lies and she now looks at Summer: \"So you set this whole thing up huh sis?\"<br>\r\nMargaret offered Mouse an offer that made her grin. \"how would you like to turn the tables and get revenge by tickling your sister?\" Mouse loves being tickled, her blonde hair always made a mess when she laughs so she tied it up as a ponytail. Summer however absolutely hates being tickled, something Mouse likes to tease her about at home because her extreme ticklishness always used as an advantage by her little sister. And Mouse knows all her most ticklish spots.

While the boys were looking at her, curious for her response, her sharp mind shifted into a higher gear. \"You boys are really in trouble for breaking the rules.\" Ken looked in surprise towards Todd, fear in his eyes. Todd shook his head but dropped the skirt. \"Naah we can peek anytime we want.\" It was clear to Summer that the boys really worried about breaking written rules. And they had indeed. Meanwhile the girl saw the piece of paper in front of her inner eyes. \"No, you silly chaps. The rules say that for sports/PE which is not done barefoot there is a Level 2 punishment.

Instantly she tried to push it away with her other arm, in vain because it was tied tightly to the chair. It appeared again on her left underarm. She flinched and wiggled her arms as much as the restrictions allowed. 'There is nothing there.' Summer said to herself. It is just imagination. But it came back. Now something soft lightly trailed from the the elbows to her wrists. About half way was the poor girl's weakest point. She squealed when the feather went by. Otherwise it seemed to be just bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got worse when the number of feathers first increased to two, then doubled again. Now her skin had not time to recover from the light teasing but shouted for scratching to be believed. But Summer could not do anything about it. The young detective bit her lips, clenched her teeth, sighed and begged for stopping the teasing. It was partly successful because the feathers were now back again to two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaaaaaa\" she screamed when she felt her head being squeezed to something warm and wet, in an arm lock. When she heard Abby's voice very, very close and felt her lips touching her ear, a high pitched squeal followed. That's why she missed the first few seconds of what Abby had to say to her. But the merciless girl held her victim tightly and continued to whisper into her ear. \"...will tickle torture every single inch of you. You will beg, plead, fight, break and cry. And find out that it will not help you.\" Summer was overwhelmed by fear. She had seriously miscalculated this step and would pay dearly. \"Please not\" she managed to say between the squealing from the ticklish feeling on her ear and underarms. \"I will do an oath.\" This was the strongest proposal she could think of, although she instantly thought about how to avoid a breach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you will. But you will find out that this will even not be necessary.\" The feathers had finally ceased to tease her underarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it got worse for Summer. How?<br>\r\n- feather in her ear<br>\r\n- a ticklish neck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having lost her shoes already, the legs were bare up to the knees where a dotted yellow skirt covered the calves. From her sitting position at Summer's legs she could see something bright peeking from under the skirt. She stared at the place a bit too long, as Summer slammed her legs tight. \"What are you thinking?\" the tied up girl complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby felt caught too early. She kneeled in front of Summer and squeezed the bare legs just over the kneecaps. \"AaaaaaaghOhhhhhhhToooomuuccch Pleasse\" the girl howled. But the strong hands were pinching again and again. Summer tried to hop around with the whole chair, screaming and pleading. \"Stooooooooooop\" she screamed. \"Open your legs\" Abby commanded. Her captive opened her mouth but did not say anything. Abby pinched again. \"Open your legs and you will get a short break\". After very few seconds Summer opened her legs a bit, just as much as she thought she could tolerate. She already needed any break she could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abby, you are really speeding up\" Margaret cackled from the kitchen. She had the same thoughts, but would have delivered more tickle torture before. \"Good girl\" she heared Abby say sweetly. \"Oh no no no, please not there\" she heard Summer moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Abby took a new position next to Summer's side. \"After this break we will explore more ticklish flesh\" she said, while very slowly lifting up Summer's shirt. \"Leave that down\" the helpless detective commanded. But inch for inch of the girl's tight upper body was revealed. Her tummy and bellybutton - an outie - were flawless. Her ribs protuded, making Abby smile even brighter. That would be a tickle feast. Her fingers just touched the warm skin when the shirt was reaching the little plain white sports bra below. \"Hey, don't expose my top\" Summer tried to sound firm, but the shirt rose further. Abby then pulled it over the girl's head, where it rested on her neck in a roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to start now? Sides? Bellybutton? Ribs?</span></div></div>",

Her victim clenched her teeth and tried to hold it, but the harsh tickling made her squeal in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the results the ribs were the spot which caused the most discomfort for Summer. And Abby wanted to exploit it. \"Oh look at those sweet little ribs.\" she cooed. \"I can see each one of them. I wonder how many there are...\" Summer shook her head. \"You cannot see all of them. And no need to count. There are twelve pairs of them.\" Abby tilted her head. \"You freak know the number of your ribs?\" The little detective sighed. \"Not only mine. Every human has the same number in general.\" Abby had enough of this lecture. \"OK, let's play a game. I indicate them and you count them. One.\" and Abby poked with her fingers into Summer's sides, inching up until she met some resistance. \"Iiiiiiiieeeeeeeek Nooooo\" the poor preteen girl screamed. \"You think you are smart but you have forgotten already the only rule of this game. Again\" and Abby repeated the step, now knowing where to poke and soon finding her target. \"Oooooowiiiiee not so hard.\" Silence. \"One\", Summer hastily added, having no appetite having Abby to repeat. \"Aaaahaaa haaaaa twooooooo\". And it went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby had a lot of fun. She did not really care whether she did the same one again or skipped one, but Summer cared. \"Weeeehaaadthisssonee\" she shouted when Abby lingered too long. \"I don't think so\" was a casual response. When number six or seven was reached, by Abby's counting, she encountered the sports bra's cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- go on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- count back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- decide do witch to the thighs</span></div></div>",

It was also clear that there would not be a one-off solution. Targeting Margaret would have her retaliate even if Summer could deliver a good blow, i.e. solve a mystery that the girl was responsible for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer decided to discuss with Mouse what had happened at their school and town over the last couple of weeks that could be considered as unusual or unexpected. In a second step they would decide for which of those incidents the duo was suspect of being involved in. Surprisingly quite a lot incidents, minor and major, came back from Mouse's mind. But the more precise information Summer was able to read out easily because she took down such events in her diary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top five events were finally decided. The most relevant event seemed to be the mysterious \"sickness\" of a new boy in their school two weeks ago. His parents had bought a shop in town, forcing him to move to the school during the term. He had been there for a few weeks when he was reported to be sick for two days. Not only that he had told at least two differing stories what had caused him to stay at home. Summer had overheard his mother saying that the boy \"had not been really sick, but, you know, we could not tell anyone...\" before they were out of earshot.

No, at home would be a much better place. Still Summer knew that since about the time of the incident he turned down most invitations to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, you know Jeremy, the boy whose parents took over that shop downtown?\" Mouse shook her head. How was she supposed to keep track of her bigger sister's numerous boy contacts? \"I know the shop and something you said about it, but I have not seen him ever. Is he suspicious of having done something?\" Summer shook her head. \"Not done something, but something mysterious happened to him. I'd like to find out.\" Mouse cocked her head. \"Why would you like to? Is he cute?\" Her sister shook her head again, more energetically. \"No, I mean yes, I mean I just...Hey. Stop that. I am a detective, and irrespective of the person, I want to inquire.\" Mouse was grinning. \"Hmhm. Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister was just too young to understand the serious tasks assigned to such role, Summer thought. She may be of use still. Keeping her on board could mean that Summer could delegate some lower tasks to her. \"He does not accept invitations and refuses to meet anyone after school. His mother picks him up just after the bell.\" Mouse pondered. \"If they own a shop they must have money. Maybe mum wants to sell some jewels to them. We could come along.\" Summer frowned. Good ideas were her own resort. But maybe this was a good proposal from her assistant. What else? Meeting him by chance somewhere was not really probable. Jeremy's only closer friend was a boy one class above them. She could make friends with him. But that would need to happen quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Ask mum<br>\r\n- Ask his friend</span></div></div>",

The other boy handed over a closed box with a lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl needs your assistance in her cooling down period. Your know the drill.\" The boys accepted and took position. Steve stood next to the poor girl's upper body while the other boy stood on the opposite side of the girl, next to her hips. The warden pulled out an oversized Ice Watch, rather the size of an alarm clock, from the box. Five minutes did the timer display. Summer's eyes dashed between the box which now had it's lid open, and the two boys. They both had their names painted on the left side just above their nipples. On their shoulders they wore painted badges in an oval shape. Right across the name tag they wore differing little painted forms which looked like medals for Summer.

She gulped and tried to be brave, as long as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warden lifted Summer's dress and sports bra and pushed the first ice cube into it. It landed on the upper side of her perky little left boob. \"Ohh sh...\" she sighed and grasped the hands of the boys tightly. \"Aaaargh\" followed when the next ice cube found its target. It stopped at the side of her right breast. \"That's enough she yelled, But she saw the warden pick one another one. Two steps to her hips. The boys still looked into Summer's eyes. She felt her skirt being lifted and a cold item sliding down into her panties. It rested to the left side of her slit. The very little pubic hair she had there yet did little to protect the ultra sensitive skin from the merciless eyes. When the warden left the room Summer looked at the Ice Watch. 4.38 left.

The boy was more clumsy with his touch and no expert like the grown up warden. It tickled much less and it was well. bearable. He seemed to have missed where she was most sensitive because he was going there only very carefully. The warden watched this with a frown. This boy was too careful with this exercise for her taste. Just when she wanted to say something Ben provided his result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse rose from her relaxed position in shock and screamed in the highest pitch when he said \"She is very sensitive on these spots\" and wiggled his index fingers into spots on her side mid way between hipbone and belly button, the belly button itself and an inch below it left and right from it, the insides of her hipbones and at the hem of the skirt in the center. He finished his piece of guided tickle-learning with a quick raspberry next to her hipbone. Mouse had her eyes wide open and was panting heavily.

Who is she?\" \"She is also a wrestler, a good one, and much smarter than John.\" \"She is not\". \"She is!\" and their disagreement on this subject needed a settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's younger sister eagerly jumped on the bed, rose to her feet again, and towered over the boy. \"Hey, what the...\" the boy started, but he was unable to finish when Mouse hopped, and let herself drop onto Lucas, with her midriff landing the boy's belly, head and feet in a 90 degrees angle from him. Although most of her weight was held by her hands and feet, the impact on his stomach was impressive enough, measured by an \"Ufffff\". Resting there skin on skin was actually nice, but Mouse, or better Alexa, rose again, straddled the boy, and beamed. \"What move was this?\" \"A splash?\" \"Almost, but not good enough. Think again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun on her butt, making the boy groan under her slender weight, and now faced his feet, while Lucas could only see her back and two cute feet next to his body. If just could get his hands free he would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owieee nonononono\" he cried, when he feld surprisingly strong girlish fingers squeeze his thighs where the shorts ended. He could see 'Alexa' turn around, smile, continue. The boy clenched his teeth, flexed his muscles, and was able to hold it for a few seconds without making any sound. Sensing this, Mouse changed tactics to casual circles with her finger nails on the inner thighs. Seconds of silence ticked away, with legs moving. \"Don't forget to breathe\" she said, reminding Lucas that he had held his breath during those first seconds. When he exhaled, Mouse dug her fingers in deep, and the boy howled with laughter. She had to raise her voice to make herself audible. \"Little John is not tough as big John. Beg my, little John, to tickle you somewhere else.\" A few seconds of howling, a few seconds of silence, and a hissed \"Somewhere else.\" appeared. When the tickling continued, \"Please\" was added.

The other alternative was towards his knees, which required Mouse to lift her butt from his stomach and rise to her knees. The boy could not believe that Mouse was providing such a show for him. Something white was peeking from below her skirt. It was tight enough to display the details of female anatomy prevailing at that age. But he could not enjoy this when fingers pinched just above his knees. \"Nananana aaaaaahaaaaaarraargh\" he squealed, his leg wiggling but being unable to escape. Sighing, Mouse settled back into her earlier position, reached behind her to her right, and pinched into the soft spot just above his hipbone. After a second of silence and a hip trying to retreat into the bed cover, a shrill shriek was accompanied by as much bucking as the boy could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse turned her head and beamed a cute smile at him. \"Our little John Cena here is a weak screamer. Not a snowball's chance in hell he has against Alexa\". Lucas gritted his teeth and could not think of a proper reply. He was desparate to be a strong and wicked boy, but those girlish hands drove him insane. \"I am strong and I ...and I...refuse to laugh from now on.\" Mouse was stunned by this simple statement of 'alternative facts'. Thinking about it, she rose from the bed and casually walked to the foot board where the boy's feet were toe tied and waiting for their treatment. Two fearful eyes followed her steps. \"If you refuse to laugh, it is know the best time for some merciless soles tickling. Otherwise you would laugh so loud that you would hurt my ears.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alternative facts held for astounding eight seconds. When stroking went to scribbling, he broke the silence with an ear splitting screem. \"NOOOOOOOtooooohard\". Panting he added \"Not fair\". Mouse cocked her head. \"Not fair? You lie just held for thirty seconds. And your insult towards the policeman was more than unfair. It was a crime and showed your lack of respect. And that respect I will teach you know.\" Further seconds of scribbling and shouting passed, then the boy screamed \"Sooorry. I am sorrry. Please stop.\" The junior warden paused the tickling. \"Now: what was the wrestling move I did earlier?\" Lucas frowned. He had already forgotten. \"Want me to do it again? Or five minutes on your feet ?\" \"Again, again\" the boy called out eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mouse had landed hard on his midriff, he exhaled and said \"Crossbody splash\". \"Very good\" she replied, and sat on his hips. Resting her fingers on his sides and softling tickling them towards the ribs and back, eliciting giggles, she softly said. \"Now, John, tell me exactly what you are sorry for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked like true progress and she had just started to feel proud, and Lucas seemed to be nicer than most other boys. She said nothing and clenched her fists, thereby squeezing the boy hard into his sides. He howled, but that was of no concern to her. Seeing that she lost her confidence, the boy beamed. It was true. John Cena was not only tough, but also smarter than any girl that would dare to mess with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting into a cruel smile, Summer's younger sister nodded and confirmed. \"You are tough, indeed, a real wrestling hero. Never gives up. Although your situation is, eh, hopeless?\" Lucas was pleased to hear the first words, but that stopped soon. \"See, I'll explain to you.\" Mouse was calm now. \"I can move.\" She jumped to her feet and danced, wiggling her butt towards him. \"You can't. And I can touch you where I want. That is...\", following a description of human body parts, from wrists to soles, each of them prodded or stroked, with varying degrees of grunting and squealing. When Mouse finished, she held her fingers an inch from the base of his tied toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try telling me what to do.\" Lucas was confused. What should he tell her to do? Leave the room was his preference, so he tried. The girl rolled her eyes, having expected a smarter command. She shook her head and said no. \"But now it's my turn. Say \"Stop I am too ticklish on my toes.\" The boy gulped. He started to understand where the discussion was leading to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than twenty seconds later a panting boy had shouted the word as good as he could muster. \"See? Me, Alexa, I am strong, smart and evil.\" She almost chuckled when she tried to say this with a stern voice. \"You, John, are weak, very ticklish, and can't really move.\" When Lucas opened his mouth she could read that cussing would come next. She was quicker with a cold remark. \"And John, something's wrong with your wrestling dress.\" Not understanding, the boy kept his mouth open and said nothing. \"I mean\" the girl hastily added, \"have you ever seen John Cena faith wearing ugly plain orange shorts? Not much of a picture I can say\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo quickly Lucas complained that this was his prison clothing and was none of his choice. Before he had completed his statement he realised that he had made a mistake. Mouse left his feet and climbed onto the bed again, her fingers like claws, approaching the waistline. \"Nooooooooo. Leave them on. Are you nuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse</span></div></div>",

The flat ends looked to the left and right, while one of those ends was next to a chest so they could not see it. Wondering why they still could not roll it made them discover that it had a solid metal foot incorporated where the diameter maximum was. From both sides shackles protruded which seemed to be fixed by chains that might be extended from the interior of the cask, like anchors. Pulling at them did not help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse frowned. Would the poor people who had to carry the cask have their wrists shackled to it to prevent them running away with precious content? Was it an overly complex mechanism to fix it into a metal ring in a cellar to keep thefts in despair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer was not convinced. She did not see a proper opening where some liquid could be poured into it or be removed? There was no tap and no wooden cover where a tap might sit. Only where one pair of the shackles was resting there were gaps in the wood, cut by human hand. But pushing or pulling did not avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse meanwhile peeked into the gap where the chest was standing. \"There is something odd. Some bars.\" She sneezed from having inhaled layers of dust, in turn blowing up further dust until she was coughing in the middle of a little dust cloud. \"Let's move the chest then.\" Summer commanded, before she allowed her younger sister to enjoy some support. \"Well spotted sis.\" The chest was heavy, as a proper filled chest should be, but moving it one foot was enough. Both girls saw two bars of wood protruding from a center, like a primitive steering wheel. When they turned it with combined force it moved with metallic clicking sound. The chains of the shackles extended from their hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer felt hot by now. Her sister kept staring at her, probably thinking \"my big sister is not as good a detective as she thinks.\". She had to do something. An idea came to her mind. \"Lie down over the cask.\" Mouse protested. \"I don't. If you lock me up and go away I would be here on my own in this dusty place.\" Confirming her view she sneezed again. Dust tickled inside her nose, making her rub it. \"Silly girl. I will not go away. And I will not lock you up. At least not until I have found the keys.\" Mouse was not convinced but carefully put her belly onto the cold wood and steel. Her skirt rose when she stretched herself. She could reach the shackles. It was not really comfortable but it would only be for a short test, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was in her position she found that there was an uneven surface where the elbows rested. She rubbed them there and told Summer what she had discovered. Her big sister pondered. Did they really...? \"Mouse, turn around\" Summer told her younger sister. Obeying she slipped down from the cask to put her feet the other way. \"No, not that. Lie down on your back.\" Mouse looked at her with wide eyes. \"I am not so flexible. This is weird.\" She shivered from the thougt of being exposed that way. \"Please sis I want to solve this riddle.\" Again, Mouse complied. She bent backwards. It was not painful, just odd. \"Look. I can reach the shackles.\" Summer saw that they did not have key holes but were open on one side. She put the wrists and ankles of her younger sister into the shackles. She looked cute. Her panties protuded as her skirt had risen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let me out.\" Mouse casually kicked her left foot to pull at the chain. <br>\r\nBANG. Instantly the chains retracted. Through the flaps Mouses's feet disappeared into the device. The chains were much shorter now, stretching the girl properly. \"Owweeee help me pleaaase\" she wined. \"I will pull at the wheel to the other side\". Summer raced to the wooden bars. They moved just one click into the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaah\" Mouse screamed. \"Something is poking into my butt. Stinging.\" Summer tried to keep calm although she almost panicked. Squeezing tightly into the gap her eyes were within inches of the center of the wooden wheel. She saw that it had two little flaps, just enough for two fingers. Should she try and stick her fingers into it. Would she be trapped as well or find the key for the solution?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she pondered she heard something ticking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped<br>\r\nSolution<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most of them were in Dad's handwriting and contained his personal notes and story ideas, but the depths of that pile also held curious newspaper cut-outs, dictionaries for strange, rare languages, maps to faraway countries, copies of police and FBI reports, antique first editions of rare books, and unknown people's personal diaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer also knew for a fact that somewhere in Dad's study there'd a secret safe (possibly more than one), but it was not worth looking for as it only held what Mr. Salt considered to be his greatest treasure: the manuscript of his next upcoming book. For all his skepticism towards danger that characterized him, Mr. Salt was deeply paranoid when it came to one specific fear: he was convinced that greedy reporters would be lurking on every corner seeking to steal his book, and reveal it to the audience before the publisher could. When he was close to finishing a book, not even the sisters were allowed to come near the study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer walked to the head of the table and picked up some pages from the top of the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was a letter from the editor, with a picture of the next book's cover.<br>\r\nFor some reason, all of dad's covers had guns and roses in them, whether they also featured mean-looking yet scantily dressed men and women to hold them or not.<br>\r\nAnother page turned out to be the cover page of an earlier draft, with the current title at the top:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#23th novel<br>\r\n\"Dear, stop or I'll shoot first!\" by Stephen J. Salt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhile some previous titles had been crossed out:<br>\r\nWho Took My Squirrel?<br>\r\nThree Men and a Rowboat.<br>\r\nThe Red Rose. <br>\r\nThe Omega Clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Summer spotted the blue dossier which lay in pile inconspicuously. As she pulled it out, a bunch of old photos fell out. Intrigued, she sat down and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse, not nearly as excited by a bunch of files as Summer, opted to inspect Dad's souvenirs instead.<br>\r\nRight next to a big cabinet that held Dad's awards (plaquettes, diplomas and trophies) from various writers' associations, there were a bunch of shelves that held the collection that Mr. Salt dragged back home with him from his trips. <br>\r\nJust like with the documents, it was sometimes difficult to tell which one of them was junk and which ones highly valuable.<br>\r\nMouse right now was examining a monkey statuette, about 10 inches tall, with glass (?) gemstones for eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Summer was making an amazing discovery. <br>\r\nMr. Salt in the research of his novel had stumbled upon an ancient mystery called the Omega Code.<br>\r\nThe code was used as a secret language first by the Soviets, but was subsequently stolen and utilized by the Americans during the Cold War. It was based on an old African language that nobody ever was able to decipher. Thus, the code hold significance not just for scholars of ancient history, but also to intelligence agencies who wanted to gain access to USA or Russian state secrets.<br>\r\nTo Mr. Salt, this was only material to work from; but Summer could see that without noticing it, her dad has collected all the evidence he'd have needed to solve the code.<br>\r\nIt was all there, waiting for a person who could decipher them, such as herself, to come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should the sisters do?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m familiar with some of my dad\u2019s research and I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t mind if I divulged just a few details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChinnery turned around with an expression of delighted curiosity, though betraying a hint of triumph which didn\u2019t escape Summer\u2019s attention. \u201cWhy Miss Salt, you do me a tremendous service and I promise I\u2019ll only take up a few minutes of your time\u201d he said merrily as he stepped over the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, come into the living room! Would you like a drink?\u201d Summer offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA cup of tea would be swell, if that\u2019s no trouble ma\u2019am\u201d replied Chinnery with the exaggerated courtesy of a seasoned expert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kettle boiled, Chinnery and Mouse sat down in the living room while Summer slipped upstairs to lock her father\u2019s study with a key from the set her parents has left. Although she had no immediate reason to distrust the reporter, it couldn\u2019t hurt to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the tea was served, Summer joined the other two and began to summarise various elements of her father\u2019s research and past work, taking care to skirt anything which might have been considered too sensitive. She especially avoided mentioning the contents of the blue dossier she had found shortly beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, Chinnery listened and jotted a few notes on a small pad while Mouse shifted restlessly in her seat, still taking little interest in current events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChinnery maintained a relatively convincing air of professional curiosity throughout Summer\u2019s makeshift expose, though Summer herself, ever perceptive, could tell his interest was beginning to wane. Although she had deliberately only stuck to information she suspected the reporter already knew, part of her itched to at least hint at the significance of what she had uncovered in the study. Chinnery\u2019s earlier eagerness has stirred her pride and it wasn\u2019t often Summer encountered an adult who was willing to take her so seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chinnery was beginning to lower his notepad, her temptation won over and she blurted out \u201cAnd I know his next book has something to do with the Omega Code but I\u2019m not certain-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe what!?\u201d Her guest\u2019s eyes snapped upwards suddenly and his hands froze in their position of lowering the pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Omega Code\u201d Summer repeated, taken aback by his sudden outburst. \u201cI think it\u2019s some kind of secret language which has something to do with the Cold War.\u201d She questioned whether she was saying too much even as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 see\u201d Chinnery muttered softly, relaxing again in his seat, though Summer noted the hunger which had replaced the previous mild curiosity in her guest\u2019s eyes. \u201cDo you know any more about this Omega Code, Miss Salt? I\u2019m sure our readers would be delighted to get the inside scoop on your father\u2019s upcoming novel and it\u2019s themes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I know\u201d Summer tried to sound earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely you can give me a teeny bit more?\u201d The reporter leaned forward pencil in hand, the hungry expression never leaving his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, I don\u2019t know any more about this Omega Code thing\u201d Summer tried again. From the corner, Mouse had been thoughtfully observing Chinnery\u2019s newfound fascination in what her sister had to say.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? Is there any chance I could get a quick peek at some of your dad\u2019s notes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not - besides, I\u2019m not sure where Dad keeps his notes\u201d Summer lied defensively, already regretting her earlier revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you are!\u201d Chinnery insisted. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019ll be our little secret and I might even be able to write you into my article as a co-author!

It was her mother checking in from work, so Summer took the phone upstairs for privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChinnery finally seemed to accept defeat, sinking back into his seat and snapping his fingers in comical irritation. \u201cRats!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Didn\u2019t you ever think you\u2019d have to do more than just smile and ask questions to get to the truth?\u201d Mouse added cheekily, as if to provoke him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a very good point miss, come to think about it\u201d Chinnery conceded again, looking Mouse up and down with new perspective. \u201cThe public has a right to know and if you\u2019re not willing to cooperate willingly, well, maybe more drastic measures are justified.\u201d He shook his head and looked at her again baffled. \u201cBut surely it\u2019d be easier just to tell me? There shouldn\u2019t be a need to go that far. Be reasonable honey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, there\u2019s no way me or Summer could possibly hand over the location of his files. Those are private and you have no right to see them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026 I guess you leave me no choice.\u201d said Chinnery in resignation as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just hope you don\u2019t use the duct tape in the drawer by the phone to tie me up!\u201d Mouse said happily, her tone again taking Chinnery aback but he soon grinned and retrieved the silver roll of tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wound several lengths of tape around both of Mouse\u2019s wrists, securing them to the arms of the chair. He then knelt to tie her bare ankles together and also taped her knees. Finally, he wrapped the tape around her lower chest and the back of the chair, limiting her ability to buck and squirm. Mouse barely resisted throughout this interval, though she maintained her transparent facade of innocence with soft cries of \u201cOh no, what do you think you\u2019re doing? You\u2019d better untie me right now! There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll ever get me to reveal Daddy\u2019s secret files!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished, Chinnery stood and took a moment to inspect his handiwork before\u2026</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Something soft and smooth caressed the sole of Summer's foot, drawing her out of her unconscious state.  It began slowly, at her heels, slowly crawling up the length of her foot to the base of her toes, then back down again.  She shifted uncomfortably and tried to pull away, but something held her legs fast.  The sensation continued, slow and gentle, teasing her sensitive flesh.  Her face split into a wide grin, and before she could control herself, a peal of girlish giggles erupted form her diaphragm.  Whatever it was, it wasn't stopping.  In fact, it only seemed to feed on her mirth, now flicking up and down the length of her soles, switching from one foot to the other at random.  Summer squealed, unable to contain herself.  Her body writhed against her control as her giggles escalated into full belly laughter.  Her eyes bugged in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in the family living room.  The room seemed darker than it should be, but she couldn't tell why.  All she could focus on right now was her predicament.  She sat upright on one end of the love seat, and someone had gone to great trouble to tie her up.  Her wrists had been bound together, secured to another rope coiled around her chest, keeping her hands elevated and visible.  Her legs had been tied together, just above the knees and at the ankles.  The coffee table had been pushed up close to the small sofa's cushions, her legs stretched out across its surface, another rope securing her ankles down to the table's leg.  Someone had removed her shoes and socks; she thought she could see them discarded haphazardly on the floor.  Her big toes had been tied together with a bit of string, allowing her toes to curl, but preventing her feet to pull away from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman knelt on the floor before her trapped feet, tormenting her soles with a white feather.  It tickled her like crazy, like nothing she'd ever felt before, and she thrashed and struggled in vain to free herself or evade the feather's kiss.  But this woman knew exactly what she was doing; a tiny, sadistic smirk had quirked up one corner of her mouth as she meticulously feathered the teenager's bare feet.  Before long, Summer collapsed into the love seat, her muscles going limp with over-exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahaha--ohohohoho plehehehehease!\" She begged, hoping the woman would show some mercy.  \"Stahahahahap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she did stop, pulling the feather away.  As her laughter faded into giggles, Summer puffed out a sign of relief.  Her tummy fluttered with nervous butterflies.  She had no idea what was going on.  The last thing she remembered before blanking out was researching the Code that Dad's notes had gone over.  She had been so close to cracking it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped audibly.  The Code!  That must be what this was all about.  But before she could open her mouth to speak, she saw the woman lowering the feather again.  Not towards Summer, however, but another, smaller pair of bare feet that had also been tied down atop the coffee table.  Twisting her head, she saw Mouse seated next to her, tied up in an identical manner.  She was still unconscious, but rapidly came to as the feather began stroking her soles.  The younger sibling yelped and began squirming almost immediately.  Summer felt pity for her little sister, but at the same time, was glad she wasn't the one being tickled anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took less than a minute for Mouse to crack.  Very quickly the feather had gotten to her, eliciting peals of frantic laughter as her back arched and legs kicked helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nohohohohoho mohohohohohohore!\"  She begged, desperation ringing in her voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the woman complied, pulling the feather away.  She simply sat back and watched the girls, her baby blue eyes weighing and measuring them.  She passed a hand through her honey-blonde hair, pushing it away from her eyes.  Her rose-red lips curled into a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You children are quite ticklish.\"  The woman said.  Summer recognized the undertone of an accent in her voice, but could not place it.  \"It would be a shame if I had to continue torturing you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran down Summer's spine, making her shudder.  Her toes curled unconsciously at the thought of enduring that feather's touch again.  \"W-what do you want?\"  She asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled.  \"Smart girl.\"  She reached under the coffee table and slapped two things on the surface:  Dad's folder containing his notes on the Code for his story, and Summer's notebook, which she'd been taking notes in while trying to decipher the Code.  \"These notes are incomplete.\"  The woman said.  \"I need you to translate the code for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\"  Summer asked, trying to sound defiant and hoping her nervousness didn't show through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you don't, you and your sister are in for the tickling of a lifetime.\"  The woman said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Mouse whimpered, shifting uncomfortably in her seat.  \"Summer, I don't know what's going on, but I don't think I can take another tickling like that.  Just tell her what she wants.  Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer looked away from her sister.  \"I...can't, Mouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why not?!\"  She insisted, desperation in her voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that Code Dad's been working on is very important.  I don't know who this woman is, but if she gets her hands on it she can decipher top secret documents used by the US government.  Or the Russian government.\"  Summer tried to shoot the woman a defiant glare.  \"I don't know who you think you are, but I don't think anyone willing to break into houses and torture children should have that kind of power.  I won't help you.  Final answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame, really.\"  The woman said, giving a faux sigh.  She turned her head to someone else, a large man standing near the picture window facing out into the front yard.  \"Keep an eye out for the mother's return.  If the girls don't talk, perhaps we can persuade Mommy to give us what we want.\"  She turned back, flashing Summer with an evil smile.  \"Perhaps their ticklishness is inherited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't say anything, only nodded and continued watching out the window through a crack in the curtains.  Summer now understood why the room was so dark.  The curtains had been drawn just enough to leave that crack for the man to watch through.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" the woman purred, wafting the feather in the air for Summer and Mouse to see.  \"Who should I start with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer felt nauseated and questioned whether or not she'd made the right call.  She couldn't stand being tickled!  And she knew Mouse was going to pay for her defiance.  Mouse whimpered pitifully, and Summer saw her trying to back into the couch cushions despite the ropes.  Their eyes met, and Summer hoped hers didn't look nearly as wide-eyed with fear as her sister's.  \"It'll be okay, Mouse.\"  She tried to reassure her.  \"Someone will come for us.  I'm sure of it.\"  She almost believed it herself.  Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How touching.\"  The woman said.  \"I think I'll start with...\"</span></div></div>",

The older sister looked outright shocked. Her feet wiggled in sympathy. Summer's mouth opened but nothing came out. The code needed to be protected at all cost. She need more time to think. The mean adults were already on the wrong path by tickling Mouse, providing the cute little detective with time to think. Mouse would need to hold on. How could they be so mean to her little sister? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mouse howled and squealed, alternating pitch at the same time when the electric toothbrush changed position between her tooes and at the center of her soles. \"SUUUUUUUUUUMMER TEELLLL HER!\" she begged. But Summer only shook her head and looked towards the ceiling. She would delay conversation as long as possible. \"Do you have no sympathy for your sister?\" the women said to Summer when she gave Mouse a brief pause? The little girl was panting heavily and moaned \"No more please. I...\" but her flow or words was stopped by sharp fingernails resting on her soles. \"Shut up. Only your big sister is allowed to talk.\" Mouse bit her lip. Talking, rather begging, was her favorite habit when she was in trouble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like when your sister gets tickle tortured. Isn't that right Summer?\" The woman rose to her feet. She was standing in front of two adjacent pairs of tied up feet. Her words were not answered. Summer gulped instead. 'THINK HARD' she shouted to herself. 'What time is it? When would her parents come back? Would any friends come over and knock at her door?' She pulled hard at her bonds but they did not give in. \"Why don't you answer?\" the woman cooed, her fingers stroking Summer's arches. It tickled but also felt kind of nice, almost caring. Mouse could not stand the silence but did not want to draw attention. Would her sister really....? She shuddered at the thought. Summer grinned and shook her head. Neither the woman nor Mouse understood whether that was an answer or whether it was just caused by the casual tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,, next round.\" The woman reached behind her and picked up a large hairbrush with mean looking stiff bristles. Both girls screamed \"NO!\" at the same instant. Summer felt her ankle grabbed and tensed. The tickle attack from the bristles on her unprotected soles was causing a ticklish agony that blocked any way of thinking. Her whole body screamed in protest. After an eternity, which was rather a few seconds only, the bristles left her soles which tingled. Summer could not remember what she had screamed. \"Two minutes of this for your sister now! Think how unbeareable ten seconds were for you. Last chance. The code?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse begged and pleaded. She even offered to clean the house, wash the car, something she usually despised. Summer's mind raced. Two minutes would drive her sister mad. What now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Tell a false code<br>\r\n- Refuse again</span></div></div>",

I think...<br>\r\nI'll let you guys have a few rounds with my partner Bernard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe signaled for the large man to step closer.

If you want to get out of this now, I would if I were you. He always gets his answers. It's not even two months ago that he had a pair of girls just like you like this, and they sang like birds<br>\r\nonce they tried out what he could do with just one feather, like that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry Victoria\" the man licked his lips. \"A minute and they'll be BEGGING to have you back instead and to be allowed to tell me all of their secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's okay Summer, she thought, it's just some tickling.<br>\r\nWhat could be so bad about this Bernard, he's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHATWHAT WHAT\" she yelled out in surprise as the hard end of the feather started by hitting her pressure points.<br>\r\nThe same feather was producing all kinds of new motions.<br>\r\nIt felt good but it kinda tickled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe!\" Summer giggled and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you like this, how about this then.\"<br>\r\nThe feather changed to teasing tickles all over the side.<br>\r\nThe feather's tip was following the shape of the foot perfectly, caressing it like a long-lost friend never again leaving its side.<br>\r\n\"NNNGH. Waiiit...heehnng\" (smile)<br>\r\nShe threw her head back and did not laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about...\"<br>\r\nHe reached over and tried to squeeze her thighs.<br>\r\n\"Wo-hoo-hoo! Ho-hoo!\" Summer grinned and kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria, help me out with this girl.\"<br>\r\nSummer bit her lips when an arm was forced over her head, and the man's partner dug her nails into her underarms.<br>\r\n\"Hey no touchy.\" she begged. The woman raked her fingers over her supple skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you gonna tell us?\"<br>\r\nSummer adjusted her position.<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Not gonna tell us huh.<br>\r\nOkay...<br>\r\nSee how you like it when I go right under the toes.\"<br>\r\nSummer flinched hard when the base of her toes was touched. <br>\r\n\"Ah! No! xD\" She shut her eyes and shook her head to try to hold back the giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the situation, she was having a bit of fun. Holding back information from evil villains, this is what it all was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wouldn't admit it, but her feet liked the attention. The tickling wasn't so bad yet, and it was strange and thrilling to find out just what some nerves on her feet could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmgh. Couldn't you just massage them?\" she sighed, trying not to buck too much when her sides, lower legs and toes were squeezed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you misunderstand us. This isn't a fun session, this is a questioning session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill displeased, the woman told her partner<br>\r\n\"Bernard, continue. I'm going to go find something that can <i>really</i> tickle this girl.\"<br>\r\n\"My pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman left the room and Summer sighed in relief, maybe with just one crook around she could finally think of an escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever just then, by pure accident, the feather found the soft part of her arches. It took all her reflexes to not to suddenly burst out roaring, but the sudden jump, \"pff\" and swollen cheeks were unmistakable.<br>\r\nBernard tried it again.<br>\r\n\"Ooh momm-\"<br>\r\n...and again...and again...<br>\r\n\"snkt snkt snkt Eeeeeeheheh eee!\"<br>\r\nBernard tried out a small toothbrush. Summer began bucking.<br>\r\n\"Ooh yeah!\" the older crook said as Summer's sole curled and uncurled and the little girl was jumping on her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you gonna tell us now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Eeehehahahyah no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your funeral little girl!

If she wanted the tiniest chance of escape she had to keep the criminal from finding this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's ticklishness varied with her mood. And right now, owing to regular sleep, calmness of knowing she'd do the right thing, the thrill of discovery from earlier, a comfortable chair, relative feeling of safety of home and other factors, this wasn't too bad. But she knew her mood could change easily at any time and turn this helpless girl into a screaming mess. The important thing was not to panic, but it was always hard to focus on that in the throes of tickle-torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tormentor realized that too, because he was focused on testing out new methods on her legs and feet, amazed by the different reactions he got each time. When he was bulling the balls of the feet, Summer's voice hit high pitches; when she went down onto the heel, she was shaking and cursing with a deep laugh. When you moved the feather along the sides, she was singing and jump so much she might break out of the restraints; yet when you hit the points on her arch in the right order she became tame and purred like a kitten. It was certainly a fun thing to watch, and each new method would reveal more; it was shocking that such a variety of reactions could come from the same girl. He hoped Victoria'd be back soon, he couldn't wait to try out what a new tool would achieve on this person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer, bravely holding on, was kept worried by other thoughts. If the ropes could gave way by now they would have. It didn't seem like she'd get out of there without outside help. Just getting the pair to leave wouldn't be enough, she had to convince them to release them, somehow. And she had to keep this sicko away from Mouse.</span></div></div>",

It kinda made Summer suspicious of her Dad - if he didn't really need to go that far on his research trips, then what had they all been for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Mouse, look friendly\" she hissed to the younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl in a green shirt opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. You're Summer and...Mouse?\" She raised an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story.\" Summer said, and sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<i>- No, I'm not a reporter or police! I'm just calling trying to find a friend of my father...No, I'm not lying!<br>\r\nNo, I'm...Please don't put it down! Please, I promise you, I won't bother you...Yes I understand you don't want to get involved in anything...Just...Could you maybe give the phone to your dad...<br>\r\n- Dad doesn't talk to anybody he doesn't know or who would be calling him on this phone. Bye.<br>\r\n- Please! Please! Okay, just one more thing. Do you know anyone called...Victoria?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Victoria?<br>\r\n- Yeah, and the man's name, I think, was Bernard.<br>\r\n- Are you one of them?<br>\r\n- Are you one of...who?<br>\r\n- Oh. Well, then...nothing. <br>\r\n- Wait!<br>\r\nSummer said, desperate not to let the phone to be put down.<br>\r\n- Look, I-.. I'm a hobby detective. OK, I'm still in training, and...<br>\r\nI don't know what happened to you, but...Maybe I could...help you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was almost half a minute of silence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Okay.</i><br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAnd now there they were all piled into the Swansons' living room. The Salts had a nice multistorey family home but the Swansons' flat looked even more luxurious, the ceiling in the living room was as high as Summer's room would be in their own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn and Vanessa looked friendly enough, and the three immediately found a common topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickling is like, literally the worst thing you can do to a person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Summer smiled happily at this unexpected sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was dangling her feet. She must be feeling shy around new people, Summer thought, or she'd have surely interrupted just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was horrible.\" Vanessa sighed. \"My little feet are still tingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer looked at them left and right.<br>\r\n\"So...What happened?\"<br>\r\nThe two sisters looked at each other, both expecting the other to speak first.<br>\r\n\"Well\" Vanessa finally began. \"It all started about a month ago, on a day when we were...\"</span></div></div>",

I guess there's a lot of magazines I can read.\" Katelyn then walked upsrairs to her bedroom and layed down on her bed, then took out a magazine and read away. Vanessa sat on the couch and thought of something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All of a sudden, the doorbell rang. She walked to the door and looked through the peephole. no one was there. \"Freakin' Ding-Dong-Ditchers...\" She started walking back to the couch until the door rang again. She walked to the door with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Katelyn's voice came from behind. She was standing at the base of the stairs, looking in through the kitchen at the front door of their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not sure.\" Vanessa shrugged. \"I looked out the peephole the first time the bell rang, but nobody was there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Freakin' ding-dong-ditchers.\" Katelyn sighed, walking briskly towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My thoughts exactly.\" Her sister beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When the elder sister reached the door, she peered through the peephole. Just as Vanessa said, nobody was standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"See anything?\" Vanessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nothing. Just some kids messing with us.\" She smiled deviously over her shoulder at Vanessa. \"If it happens again, I'll tell 'em off.\" This made Vanessa giggle. Though their parents disapproved of it, Katelyn could curse like a sailor when she wanted to. Both girls turned away from the door and headed towards the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No sooner had they passed the threshold of the kitchen, however, the doorbell rang again. Katelyn pivoted quickly and sprinted for the door, her feet pounding on the kitchen's linoleum floor. She threw open the door and looked around. There were no signs of anyone having been there. Katelyn started shouting. \"Alright you little...!\" Profane words and threats of unpleasant consequences spilled out of her mouth at an alarming rate as she berated the ding-dong-ditchers to the whole neighborhood. Vanessa stood in the kitchen, practically holding her sides with laughter. When she felt satisfied that she'd gotten her point across, Katelyn slammed the door closed, then proceeded to smile warmly at her little sister and give a satisfactory nod. \"That should do it.\" She said proudly. Vanessa was still giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girls again left for the living room, and neither one was really all that surprised when the doorbell didn't ring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both girls, however, were surprised when they entered the living room. A middle-aged man, both tall and well-muscled, was crouched on the floor in the middle of the room. He wore all black clothing, and was rifling through a black duffle bag. When the girls stood frozen in shock, the man looked up and gave them a sinister smile. \"Mornin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who are you?\" Katelyn asked, wide-eyed with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm acquainted with your folks.\" Something in his voice made Katelyn think that the man was being less than truthful. She could feel a small bubble of fear forming in the pit of her stomach. Her eyes darted nervously around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Back door.\" He responded before she could even finish the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm looking for something that belongs to your parents. Something you lovely ladies are going to help me find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katelyn heard a fearful whimper from Vanessa, and instinctively stood in front of her little sister. She swallowed before speaking again, not sure she wanted to hear the answer to her next question. \"And if we refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man's grin widened. \"Well...let's just say I have ways of convincing you to help me.\" His hand reached for the duffle bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not wanting to find out what the man was grabbing, Katelyn quickly grabbed Vanessa's wrist and turned around, intending to run back through the kitchen and out the front door. Her plan was ruined, however, when she found a woman standing in the kitchen doorway, blocking the sisters' way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello, girls.\" The woman said, her smile just as sinister as the man's. \"Looking to run off, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not stopping to answer, the girls scrambled toward the stairs. Katelyn hoped to find some measure of escape if she could lock them in one of the bedrooms upstairs.</span></div></div>",

The younger sister started to scream but the sound was quickly muffled. Katelyn stopped and turned to see her sister being held securely in the man's arms, one of his hands holding a cloth over her mouth and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Vanessa!\" Katelyn yelled. Not thinking about her self, she launched herself back down the stairs, intending to attack the man and free her sister. Once off the bottom stair, however, she felt the woman's hands grip her shoulder's firmly, halting her progress. \"Let go of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just settle down, dear.\" She heard the woman's voice behind her. \"We don't want all this ruckus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let go of my sister, you creep!\" Even as the words left her mouth, Katelyn saw Vanessa's eyes droop, and her body went limp. \"Vanessa! What did you do to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, she's just sleeping.\" The man said, gently laying the unconscious Vanessa down on the ground. \"Just like you will be soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katelyn felt the woman's grip on her tighten. Though she thrashed with all of her strength to get free, she couldn't. Her eyes widened with fear when she saw the man stand up, and moved the cloth that had knocked out Vanessa toward her own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No! Don't! Get that away from me!\" She screamed. He cries were muffled as the cloth covered her nose and mouth. Within moments, she felt lightheaded. Her muscles started going slack, and her thrashing became less violent. Before she knew what to do, she was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n Katelyn regained consciousness some time later. She opened her eyes wearily, and found herself staring at the living room ceiling. Her limbs felt heavy, and as she went to stretch them, she found they wouldn't move at all. Her grogginess faded quickly as her attention focused on her lack of mobility. Picking her head up, she took in her predicament; and was horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The living room couch had three segments, and the two end segments were built like reclining chairs. The backs tipped back, and a footrest popped out of the base. However, these particular recliners were motorized, not mechanical. There was no lever to pull, only a button that slowly reclined the seat and raised up the footrest. No amount of pressure could force the seat back into it's \"standard\" position. The entire recline/un-recline processes depended on that button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katelyn found herself sitting on one such end of the couch, with the seat fully reclined. The back was tilted halfway down toward a laying-down position, and the footrest was all the way up, bringing her legs straight out in front of her. Her legs were tied together at the ankles and knees, with additional cords of rope securing those joints to the footrest, and preventing her from moving her legs much. More rope was used to secure her waist to the back of her seat. Her arms were also tied together, at the wrists and elbows, and stretched over her head. A length of rope tied around the loop holding her wrists together disappeared over the top of the couch. She assumed it had been tied off to one of the couch's legs, because she couldn't pull her arms forward in the least. She struggled against her bonds, testing them. Though she found that the ropes had been tied securely enough to keep her from moving all that much, they weren't tied tightly enough to cause pain or cut off circulation. In fact, the rope seemed rather soft and smooth against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Katelyn?\" She heard Vanessa's voice off to her left. Turning her head and struggling to look over the back of the couch's middle segment, she found Vanessa, tied up in the exact same manner she was, on the other end segment of the couch. Vanessa's eyes were wide with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Vanessa! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can't move.\" Vanessa's voice trembled. \"I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can't either.\" Katelyn tried to make her voice sound reassuring, but wasn't sure it worked. \"But don't be scared. We're going to be fine.\" She wished she could believe that, taking their situation into account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, the pair of intruders walked into the room. Making sure to stand where both girls could see her, the woman smiled cheerily at them. \"Well, I'm glad to see you're both awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girls made demanding questions in unison. \"What do you want?!\" Katelyn asked as Vanessa inquired \"Why are we tied up?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Patience, children.\" The woman made a soothing gesture with her hand. \"Listen to what I have to say, and you'll understand why we're here.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>by Ishimura42 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn and Vanessa sat in silence, waiting for the woman to proceed with her explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The woman cleared her throat. \"My name is Victoria. My associate over there,\" she waved a hand in the man's direction, \"is Bernard. While this may be hard to believe, your parents work for the United States government. More specifically, they're international spies, working to gather information relating to national security and foreign threats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Spies?\" Vanessa's tone was one of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's preposterous!\" Katelyn demanded. \"Our father is a teacher, and our mother is a doctor! The idea of them being spies is ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And yet they do seem to take a lot of vacations, don't they?\" Victoria smirked. Katelyn stopped to think about that. It was true, now that she thought about it. Their parents did go on vacation fairly often...at least once a season, as far as her memory could tell. Sometimes they'd be gone for a weekend, as was the case now. Other times they'd be gone for a whole week. It was just something she'd never thought to question before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm not saying that I believe you,\" Katelyn began, \"but supposing our parents were spies, like you claim...that still doesn't explain why you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Or why you have us tied up like this.\" Vanessa added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, girls,\" Bernard stepped forward to take over the discussion. \"Victoria and I are freelance spies. We take jobs for whoever has the money to pay. And right now, we're being paid to find a vault your parents have hidden somewhere in this house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Our employer has reason to believe that this vault contains some top-secret files that contain information he would rather stay out of government hands.\" Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now I know you're joking.\" Katelyn sighed. \"Why on earth would the government allow its employees to keep top-secret files hidden in their homes? Such sensitive information would surely be kept under high security at the Pentagon or some other government building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Smart girl.\" Victoria smiled. \"And while you are right on the money with that fact, there are exceptions to that. Especially when the government suspects that this information in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In danger from what?\" Vanessa sounded irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In danger from being stolen, of course. Or, worse yet, destroyed. There's an ongoing investigation trying to root out a mole in your parents' division. They suspect somebody inside is leaking information to foreign leaders. And so, the more trusted associates, like your parents, keep their files hidden at home, and off the record. At least, until the infiltrator is found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I hate to ruin it for you guys, but I don't know anything about any vault of secret information.\" Katelyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Neither do I.\" Vanessa added. \"Can you untie us now, please? My arms are uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"While that might be so, please forgive us if we don't take your word for it.\" Bernard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And even if that is the truth, there is more that you could provide us with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Like what?\" Katelyn asked. Her voice dripped with sarcasm. The absurdity of the situation was getting on her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your parents,\" Victoria said, \"despite their career, are very tender-hearted people, who love their daughters very much.\" Katelyn's heart sank into her stomach. She wasn't sure she liked where this was going. \"Even if we find the vault we're looking for, it's sure to be safeguarded by some sort of lock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The most common types of locks on this sort of vault,\" Bernard pitched in, \"are numeric keypads. They require that a certain sequence of numbers is entered in before the lock opens. It's not uncommon for there to even be multiple numeric sequences before the lock opens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In short,\" Victoria chimed in, \"We believe that the vault is locked by two numeric codes; and each of you girls holds one of the codes. Whether you realize it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vanessa gasped, but Katelyn just rolled her eyes. \"This is insane.\" She said. \"Your story makes no sense, I'd almost prefer it if you'd have just robbed us. I don't know anything about any hidden vault. And I certainly don't remember my parents giving me any sort of numeric code.\" Vanessa nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then, I guess we're just going to have to jog your memory. On both accounts.\" Victory smiled evilly at the sisters. Vanessa gulped, and even Katelyn was starting to have second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And...how do you plan to do that?\" Katelyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We've had to do all sorts of interrogations before, in our line of work.\" Bernard said, crouching down to dig through the duffle bag he had brought with him. \"Oftentimes, we have to use pain as a motivator.\" Vanessa whimpered and started testing the ropes holding her. Katelyn just sat in silence, dread growing in the pit of her stomach. \"But many times, our victims have been trained to endure pain, and they can resist our methods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, we developed a new method.\" Victoria said cheerily. \"It doesn't cause any lasting pain, and doesn't leave any marks on the victims. If performed correctly, the victims can even endure this method for very extended periods of time. And I am happy to announce that all of our interrogations have been successful ever since we've started employing this method of torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both girls were shifting uncomfortably now. Their imaginations were running wild, trying to figure out this horrible torture before it was revealed to them. Neither of them wanted to ask the question, but Katelyn finally stirred up the resolve. \"So...what are you going to do to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bernard smiled evilly and withdrew his hand from the duffle bag. Held lightly between his fingertips was a long, white feather with a stiff quill. He held it up for the girls to see, and waved it gently through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're going to tickle you.\" Victoria said, almost mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sisters' eyes widened when they saw the feather, and both of them started struggling against the ropes holding them down at the word \"tickle.\" Both girls were exceedingly ticklish. Vanessa shuddered, remembering a time that her friends had gang-tickled her. It had been horrible. One girl held down Vanessa's arms, while another held down her legs, and a boy spent 15 minutes tickling her all over, trying to find her worst spots. She remembered squealing the most when her tummy and bellybutton had been tickled, and she practically screamed when the boy had squeezed her knees. But the absolute worst had been when the boy removed her socks and used a ball-point pen to doodle on her bare feet. Those sensations made her scream with ticklish agony. Similar thoughts ran through Katelyn's mind as she recalled her previous boyfriend tickling her intently on one occasion. Her worst moments had been when he had gently stroked his fingers along the hollows of her underarms, and when he would gently knead his fingertips into her sides and ribs. Like her little sister, Katelyn's absolute worst had been when her boyfriend scratched his fingernails along the bottoms of her bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Another realization hit the girls hard. Their parents were gone for the weekend, and the girls didn't have any plans for the weekend. It was Friday, and their parents had left at 10:00 this morning. Katelyn figured it couldn't be any later than 11:30 or noon at the very latest. Her heart sank. Their parents weren't expected to be home until late Sunday evening. Their captors had at least a full 2 days to tickle the sisters' all they wanted before their parents came home. Vanessa nearly panicked when she realized this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know anything!\" Vanessa blurted out. \"Please don't tickle me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not that! Anything but that!\" Katelyn was squirming in her seat, trying to find some weakness in the ropes. \"Please, no tickling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two intruders smiled at each other. The girls were already begging, and the torture hadn't even started yet. They expected their work to be done shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bernard, I'll let you take the first session. I'm going to see if there's anything to eat in the kitchen.\" Victoria strode out into the kitchen, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well ladies, it looks like it's just you and me for now.\" His evil smile broadened. \"Well, us...and my feather.\" The girls suddenly sat very still in their seats, neither of them wanting to draw the man's attention to themselves. \"First thing's first, I suppose.\" He mused. Walking over to Katelyn, he gently grabbed the the toes of her socks between his index fingers and thumbs, and slowly peeled them off of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katelyn cringed and tried to pull her feet away from the man's hands, but it was no use. The ropes held her ankles firmly in place. She cursed herself silently for wearing ankle socks today. \"Oh no, please. Not that.\" Katelyn begged. \"My feet are too ticklish. I'll go crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is that so?\" Bernard chuckled. \"Well then I guess you'll have to start remembering things a little more clearly, for the sake of your ticklish feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katelyn's toes curled as she felt her socks slide over her arches. She gasped as he suddenly jerked her socks the rest of the way off of her feet. He took a moment to look at her soles, admiring how pretty they were, and how cute her toes looked when they were curled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your turn.\" Bernard said, looking over at Vanessa. The younger sister squeaked in surprise. She struggled as her socks, too, were removed. Slowly at first, but then abruptly yanked off at the end. Surprisingly, she never begged to keep her socks. Katelyn thought it may have been because she was too scared to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bernard spent a few moments admiring Vanessa's bare feet, before taking a step back and looking from one sister to the other. Finally, he wafted his feather in the air before them. \"Alright, girls. Who wants to go first?\"</span></div></div>",

They each silently hoped they wouldn't be tickled first, knowing and cursing that in doing so they were dooming the other sister to ticklish torment. The silence seemed to stretch on forever, though it was only a minute or two, before Bernard spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No volunteers?\" He asked, his voice feigning surprise. \"Well then,\" An evil smile crossed his face, \"I guess I'll just have to start with the little one.\" And with that, he took two steps and sat cross-legged on the floor, his face parallel with Vanessa's tiny bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vanessa's eyes widened further when she realized she was going first, and she immediately started thrashing against the ropes holding her in place. \"Oh no, please!\" She begged, her voice frantic. \"Please don't tickle me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then tell me where the vault is hidden.\" Bernard demanded. He couldn't contain his smile. Vanessa's toes were curled in defense, and her soles wrinkled. He could tell already that she was very ticklish, and expected to have some fun with this interrogation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I--I don't know!\" Vanessa's voice seemed on the edge of tears. \"Please, I don't know anything about a vault! Don't tickle me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, I'll tickle you.\" Bernard's voice a hint of a playful threat. \"And I won't stop until you tell me where the vault is.\" With that, he raised the feather up and began lightly tracing its sharp tip up and down Vanessa's right sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Eep!\" Vanessa squeaked in surprise when she felt the feather on her foot. For a moment, a very brief moment, she locked her jaw and bit her lip, hoping to hold her laughter in. Her right foot twitched and jerked as she felt the feather's tip slowly caress her sole, traveling from her heel to the ball of her foot and back down to her heel. It was only a matter of seconds, however, before Vanessa's lips gradually widened from a smirk, to a smile, to a grin. Her eyes were watering from the strain of holding her laughter in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It only took ten seconds of this light tickling for Vanessa to break into a fit of uncontrolled giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...heh...hehehe...ehehehehehehehehahahahahahahahahahahaha! Oh nohohohohohohohohohohoho! Ple--hehehehehehehehe--plehehehehehehehease stohahahahahahap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you ready to talk?\" Bernard asked playfully, gradually increasing the speed at which his feather traveled over poor Vanessa's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"B..buhahahahahahahat I don't knohohohohohohohow ahahahahahahanything! I swehehehehehear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then I guess I'll have to keep tickling until you do know something.\" The feather's tip began to swirl in tiny circles, teasing the sole of Vanessa's foot as it continued to travel from heel to ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe!\" The poor girl was beside herself with giggling. She couldn't find the space between her forced giggles to even beg for relief. A wide smile crossed her face, and her eyes were squinted from the effort of laughing so much. She didn't think it could get much worse than this, but Bernard was only beginning the torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He began lightly sliding the feather back and forth along the undersides of Vanessa's toes. \"EEP!\" Her toes curled on reflex, blocking the feather out. \"No--hehehe--not there...hahahaha....\" She gasped through her forced laughter. To her horror, Bernard used his free hand to peel her toes apart, uncurling them, and resumed stroking the feather back and forth along the undersides. \"Noooohohohohohohoho! Hahahahahahahahahahaha! Plehehehehehehehehease! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\" Vanessa's giggles had erupted into full belly laughter. Bernard was sure she would have reached that point anyways, just by slowly teasing her sole, but he was curious and wanted to see exactly where this girl was most vulnerable. He continued to torment the girl's toes for several minutes, delighted at the way she shrieked with laughter whenever he probed the tip between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Much to Vanessa's horror, it only got worse when the feather found her instep. All semblance of thought left her mind as she felt the feather lightly scratch up and down the length of her arch. \"AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! PLE--HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA--I--HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! 4; Vanessa couldn't even beg coherently anymore. Her mind was given over completely to the sensation on her foot, and the attempts to beg relief were nothing more than instinctive. It was the most ticklish thing she had ever felt. Her memory of the ball-point pen paled in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally, after what felt to Vanessa as eternity, Bernard stopped. He gave her a couple of minutes to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you ready to tell me where the vault is?\" He asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vanessa could only sit and pant as she tried to regain her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is that a no? Well then, I guess we'll just have to...\"</span></div></div>",

Hows that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled frightened yelling was then heard from underneath the gags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer began to feel a small tickling sensation in her latex covered armpits. She gave a small giggle but quickly regained control of herself. Until the tickling intensified and she completely lost it.after what felt like hours (in reality 5 minutes), the tickling stopped. She then began to feel her shoes being taken off. Once both shoes were off, a very pungent oder of BO spread across the room, as summer hadn't taken her shoes off in about a week. Her face turned red, and she tried to hide her embarrassment. She then felt her small pink socks being removed as well. The person with her socks then ungagged her, stuffed the socks in her mouth, and regagged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female interrogator called over her partner, and said \"you get her armpits, i'll take her feet.\" They both agreed and began tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer was struggling to free herself from the bonds that kept her in place, to no avail. But she did begin to sweat profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male interrogator said he didn't think the tickling was torturous enough for her, so suggested taking off her catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female agreed, and began to cut away at the catsuit, revealing only a semi-transparent bra, and her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then looked at her male partner, and told him to leave. He followed orders, and quickly ran out of the room. She then began to lick the sweat from Summers armpits, which was the worst tickling so far for Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was satisfied with the torture, she ungagged Summer and asked if she wanted to relinquish any information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer defiantly yelled \"NO, ILL NEVER TALK!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female interrogator chuckled, and calmly said \"ok\".</span></div></div>",

Mouse? Help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA confused Summer was gently grabbed by four hands and forced onto the bed.

What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, honey, just relax...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Summer, her feet were a private zone. <br>\r\nEven though nothing bad was being done to them, there was no way she could relax while somebody was touching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Mouse from the corner of her eye and suddenly a blindfold was pulled over her eyes.<br>\r\nNow, she was bound AND blinded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what is this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Why'd I need a reason to spend time with my daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just a bit of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer did not like where this was going and gritted her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never call me up here unless you think I did something bad. You think you have some dirt on me, and you're trying to make me admit it! I just know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever gave you THAT idea?\" her mom said, letting go of the peds and started playing with her toes instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you're tickling me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I?\" she asked absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I can't tell you what you want me to tell you if you don't tell me what it is! This is all unnecessary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you insist...\"<br>\r\nHer mom paused, drumming her fingers on Summer's soles.<br>\r\n\"Your father and I have been worried about your grades, honey. It seems as if your mind hasn't been on your studies lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh...I guess that was true. Summer was always a diligent student, but recently she's been too enamored with her detective reference guidebooks to really pay attention to what's been going on at school.<br>\r\nShe's also gotten in a couple fights with teachers over disagreements about theoretical subjects, and because they had caught her sneaking around school, or getting into fights with misbehaving kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea her mother would take them all this seriously, but it seemed like she expected her to apologize So she did. <br>\r\nBut mother just went:<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, you know we'd never love you based on just your grades. We have no business forcing you to care about what you don't want to, or to tell us what has been distracting you from them lately.<br>\r\n...Mouse, take the other foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" Summer said weakly and scrunched her soles, as if THAT helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo-hooo huhuhehahahoo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt danced around under her, but it did not help the ticklish feeling coming from her feet at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer had heard of people being called \"passive-aggressive\"; he understood it meant that they paid back others for stuff they did while they pretended that it did not bother them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was otherwordly. She's going to make me piss my pants just so to make me tell her what she thinks she knows!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been collecting old articles...\" There was no way she would admit her hobby to her just like that, but it was being forced out of her in smaller bits. \"And old rocks and glasses, too!\" Her mom just went \"That's interesting, honey.\"<br>\r\nShe had long, pedicured nails that dug cruelly into Summer's soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is attempted murder, she thought My own mother is going to murder me. Famous kid detective killed by mom, that's what the newspaper is going to say...Please. Please not my soles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my soles, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes your soles dear. Your ticklish little soles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's mind raced. What else could she possibly tell her? There was nothing that she would've wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Kinda have a crush on Daniel from class B! Please don't tickle me any more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh, hush. That's good to know. But c'mon dear, you hurt me.<br>\r\nYou think I'd pry on my daughters' private relationships?...Mouse, bring the brushes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He asked me out yesterday!\"<br>\r\nSummer gabbled, soles flapping about trying to hide.<br>\r\n\"He game me cinema tickets for Friday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the brushes hover over her soles. <br>\r\n\"Please, mom, I promise! I will be the best daughter ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her amazement, the brushes actually drew back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad at you honey, I'm really not. But you should confide in us a little more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was tickling the soft soles of Summe with her fingetrips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, that's too soft! Stop!\" Summer screamed, feeling close to fainting from the maddeningly gentle torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer's mind was in panic, she didn't know whether she was being let go or just being kept in a false sense of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her mom seemed to be finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, my ribs. Ooh, I have a killer headache.\" Summer sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so good to have this little talk, honey. You know if you have a problem you can always come to me and I will listen. I'll come back to untie you in a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer said nothing, she was too exhausted.<br>\r\nShe just lay here for about five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she...</span></div></div>",

This is where Summer and Mouse were now headed - though Mouse understandably objects to the idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a baby!\" she sulked, feeling insulted. \"Mom knows I can look after myself! If she lets you off on your own then why do I have to be stuck in some stupid playground?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah we KNOW you can Mouse, but mom thought maybe it'd be safer and you'd enjoy it more too if...\"<br>\r\n\"Mom has the stupidest ideas. I'm going with you. That's final.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point they reached the entrance, where a middle-aged lady was waiting for them with a broad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be little Mouse. Oh, my, look at you\" she said, pointing at her flip-flops. \"you have the cutest little toes! I'm so envious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse eyed her suspiciously.<br>\r\n\"Piss off lady. I haven't agreed to any of this.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh heh heh...\"Summer interrupted. \"She can be a little foul-mouthed, but I'm sure she's going to like it here...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, absolutely!\" the daycare staff lady went. \"We've got everything here: board games, hoops and jump ropes, books, music...\"<br>\r\n\"Hmpf.\" Mouse was unimpressed.<br>\r\n\"We also - I'm only telling you this secret - have some special toys only for the best little children in the back room...\"<br>\r\nShe  bent down and whispered something into Mouse's ear.<br>\r\nMouse's eyes opened wide.<br>\r\n\"You know what Summer? I think this is a good idea after all. You can go and I will stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay suddenly, I'm not so sure about this.\" Summer said.<br>\r\n\"Mouse, what's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I just think this lady is very nice.\"<br>\r\nShe hugged the older woman's leg and flashed her best shit-eating grin at Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ookay...Maybe I should come in with you just to check on everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse wrinkled her face.<br>\r\n\"What, you wanted to leave me here and now you don't want to? I told you I'd be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you says so.\" Summer said. \"If anything happens, just call mom or I'll be back in an hour or two OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah sure. No need to rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer gave them one more weirded-out glance, shook her head in disbelief and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older lady patted Mouse on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, would you rather see the toys in the back now or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked to the back room where Mouse jumped for joy. It must've been used as a storage room because it contained all sorts of large plastic parts, presumably from jungle gyms, toy castles or the like. But the most interesting item was in the back where two of those plastic parts had been attached to a stretcher, forming crude foot stocks.<br>\r\nWhile the two plastic slabs were too weak to be able to seriously restrain anybody especially an adult, they could probably trap a child for a while before they could free themselves.<br>\r\nMouse squeaked and ran up to it. She slipped out of her flip-flops and quickly climbed on board, slipped her feet into the device and and stretched out on the padded mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's noone else coming for the next hour so we can have plenty of fun, whatever you like.\" the lady said sweetly. Mouse's plump little feet looked adorable, she just wanted to caress and fondle them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse was pleased with herself. A whole hour of tickling and neither mom nor Summer can complain or interrupt her.<br>\r\nShe lay back and stretched  her soles, ready for the wonderful feelings to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should the story go now?</span></div></div>",

Jamie and Chris took their places at Summer's feet and Mouse walked up to Summer's belly only to hear Jamie's voice \"Mouse no, you can have your turn when me and Jamie are done, 3 people will be to much, we promised Summer we wouldn't go all out\". Mouse got a pouty look on her face, she wanted to tickle her big sister so bad and she didn't want to hold back either, she thought holding back made tickling boring. \"Fine\" Mouse replied as she crossed her arms in disappointment, Summer mouthed the words thank you to Jamie while Mouse wasn't looking. Jamie winked at Summer and then her and Chris began Summer's very easygoing tickling session as they both slid just one finger up each of Summer's soles, Summer giggled as Jamie and Chris teased Summer's feet with their lone fingers, to be honest Jamie didn't like taking it easy either, she was just like Mouse when it came to tickling, hardcore is the best way but she made a promise so she put the thought out of her mind and continued her light tickling on Summer's foot. Chris decided to change tactics as he grabbed Summer's foot and started lightly dragging his tongue up and down her arch, Summer's small giggles began to get a little louder once she felt Chris's tongue on her foot then Jamie decided to join Chris so she began dragging her tongue along Summer's other foot as well, this made Summer's giggles turn into full sized laughter but it still wasn't to terribly bad, Summer knew that this was still them taking it easy on her. Once Jamie and Chris were done licking Summer's soles they stopped and Jamie told Mouse that she could have her turn but she was going to be watching her to make sure she didn't go on an all out tickle assault on Summer's belly. Mouse sighed as she replied back to Jamie \"Fine I will take it easy on her\", Mouse approached Summer's belly and began lightly dragging her fingers across her sisters belly eliciting small giggles from Summer once again, Mouse couldn't believe how boring this was, and she usually loves tickling but this taking it easy stuff was getting a little annoying to Mouse, she wanted so bad to make her big sister squeal but she knew if she did Jamie would stop her right away. Mouse then put her face down to Summer's bellybutton and began swirling her tongue inside once again turning Summer's giggles into full laughter. Once Mouse was done she went with Chris into the other room and Jamie untied Summer \"See I told you I wouldn't break my promise\" Summer smiled at Jamie her best friend in the world \"yea thanks for taking it easy on me, I know I am not as fun when it comes to your favorite hobby but I do appreciate you keeping your promise\" Jamie and Summer both smiled at each other before Jamie asked Summer \"So who is going to get tickled next\"?</span></div></div>",

I only started teasing you back after you did them to me. You were the one who first invented those tickling-games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer did not expect this. She frantically searched her memory.

But feel free to leave and break the house rules.\" Before Summer could make a proper response her sister rushed up the stairs following her two friends into her room. The door shut with a bang. Miss Salt followed her sister for a few steps up the staircase, changed her mind and went back to her newspaper left at the breakfast table. Her junior detective occupation required a more thoughtful response. Had she charged into the room occupied by two hyperactive girls - the quiet one did not count here -, she would rather be ridiculed when the door closed again. Mouse should have told her that she had invited friends on this Saturday morning. It was an unusually early time in the day for kids to come over. Looking at her newspaper without reading further she pondered, that the time was too early unless Mouse was up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up the breakfast table, leaving Mouse's used dishes on it, she went into the living room and started one of her favorite movies with the volume turned up. When it started she removed her socks and traipsed up the stairs slowly, leaving out the ones that would creak when you stepped on them. The voices of the movie were booming even on the first floor, rendering any pure listening operation at the door to her sister's room impossible. Summer entered the room next to Mouse's room, which housed the household items like the ironing board and hoover. After locking the door she removed the items from the cupboard and squeezed herself into the narrow space. She opened a small wooden frame in the back wall of the cupboard and reached through the large hole in the wall and leaned forward. It had taken six precious days for her to cut that hole in the wall. Mouse had cherished the mirror she received as present from her sister, not looking at it close enough to see that it was a two way mirror. Now Summer had a prime peeking spot into her sister's room. A small microphone with headphones provided sound. </span></div></div>",

We have this case where an abandoned pediatric psych ward was apparently shut down a few years back after being found out for not having any actual patents, but taking kids and doing experiments on them that involved laughter in some way. As you can probably guess, the whole mess was covered up. We were going to investigate this further, but decided to get some help from detectives with a little more experience than us. We realized you were local from the flyers and posters you put up to advertise your detective agency, so we contacted you\" said Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you want to work together?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it would be an honor to work with such great minds as yourself and your sister. So, are you in?\" asked Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second, I'll have to talk it over with Mouse\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think Mouse? This boy's also a junior detective and he wants us to work on a case with him, you up for it?\" asked Summer to her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll go grab my gear\" said Mouse as she went off to find her detective kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, where should we meet?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the hospital itself? It's called St Giggles Psychiatric, you can search for it and it should come up\" said Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer typed in a name and found an address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, got an address. See you there in about 1 hour\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" said Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two detectives put the phone down and Summer went to grab Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon mouse, we're going to St Giggles\" called Summer into Mouse's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, just grabbing my UV Light and a liquid collection thingies in case of blood\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I highly doubt there's gonna be blood, it's not exactly a murder scene\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you never know\" said Mouse as she came out with the liquid collection tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Miss CSI. You all set now?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, got everything I need\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\" said Summer as she grabbed her kit and headed down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we get there?\" asked Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our wooden go-karts. they can fit two people in at once, so it's perfect if we all need to move from place to place\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do this\" said Mouse as she headed for the back yard where the go-karts were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Hour later, Summer and Mouse turn up to St Giggles, where Nathan and Vincent were already waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm Nathan and this is Vincent, I believe we spoke on the phone\" said the tallest boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed we did. I'm Summer, nice to meet you\" said Summer as she shook Nathan's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're looking for evidence of the experiments. We should stick together in case this place isn't entirely abandoned\" said Vincent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good Idea\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Guys, we are entering our crime scene\" said Summer as she and Nathan led the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the building, they realized it was very dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone got a flash light?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got mine\" said Mouse as she turned it on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\" said Nathan as he activated his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine's right here\" said Vincent as he turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, where should we check first?\" asked Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse piped up with a suggestion, she thinks they should check<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can't do anything with those even if you manage to get them, you need special software\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some. It can only find people who've been in the criminal system in the last 5 years or on the medical board for the last 10, but it's still quite handy\" said Vincent as he applied some powder to the brush and started brushing the keyboard lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the HECK does he even have that?\" thought Summer in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Summer, I found a liquid\" said Mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A liquid? In the nurse station?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, collecting it with the Integriswab now\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer was confused, what liquid could possibly still be here after years of this place being abandoned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she spotted a vile was tipped over and some liquid had poured out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I just found your liquid Mouse, but I'm not to sure what this liquid IS\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, bag and tag it so we can compare the samples using my laptop and kit later\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you bought your laptop with you? And more importantly, it can DO THAT?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just in case we needed to compare samples of something, I have software on there that gives a rough comparison. Like, if you put Coke or Sprite on a swab and then put it in the analyzer, it'll come back as carbonated soda\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you and Vincent even GETTING this software?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a number of sites, I'll leave em by your computer when we get home\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, they're bound to help me as a junior detective\" said Summer as she screwed the lid onto the vile and placed it into a plastic bag labeled \"Unknown Liquid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, all bagged and tagged\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The computer's all yours, Summer. I got a set of print to run through the system\" said Vincent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you going to get that back to our crime lab? it's too big to put into your go-kart and something might break\" said Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I DON'T have space on my go-kart. But, what I DO have is a friend with a little mettle wagon who owes me a favor\" said Summer as she pulled her cell phone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer went into the main hall of the hospital to make a call, but Nathan noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, this emergency exit door is open. And the bar's still pushed in\" said Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does THAT mean?\" asked Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That someone was here before us, but left in a hurry when WE showed up. It also means if I can match a print from the door to someone, we have a suspect\" said Vincent as he dusted the bar for prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a partial, which won't mach up to ANYTHING unless we already have a full print\" said Vincent as he used some adhesive lifting tape to take the print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, calls been made. My friend is 10 minutes away\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just found out that someone was JUST HERE\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOSH, ARE THEY STILL AROUND?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if these shoe prints are anything to go by, they lead OUT the door\" said Vincent as he snapped a picture of the shoe print for later comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they start near the puddle of liquid I found\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the liquid was left by our run away suspect\" said Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find out soon enough\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, Summer receives a text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read \"Hey Summer, I'm outside with the wagon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Mouse, grab the keyboard and mouse, Nathan, grab the monitor, Vincent, you get the wires while I grab the computer itself. Let's go\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four detectives walked outside, they saw Chris standing next to a blue wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris? What are YOU doing here?\" asked Mouse, surprised to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my wagon that Summer needed\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder WHY she was owed a favor\" muttered Mouse as she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put it this way, it's nothing like you think\" said Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Are you SURE you didn't give him a quick smooch but he wanted to keep it secret?\" joked Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WISH\" said Summer to Mouse, making both girls snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Summer, and is that an OLD COMPUTER?\" asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a case about some experements that were carried out here before this place shut down, you think your wagon can hold this thing?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it should\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked at the hospital and looked really uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" asked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...OH. Uh yeah, I'll be fine\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take it easy with Bessy, she's my favorite wagon\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You named your wagon Bessy\" smirked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know that's kind of dorky, so don't tell anyone, OK?\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you owe me another favor\" smirked Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Vincent with me, Nathan with Summer. Let's roll\" said Mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nonce they got to Nathan and Vincent's place, they split into 2 groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan and Summer were working with big evidence, such as the computer they had just carted and carried up the stairs, While Nathan and Mouse work with forensics, such as fingerprints, liquids, DNA and Documents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey worked for 30 minutes before there was a break in the case... </span></div></div>",

Now.\" he urged. Instead he heard a door open somewhere in the large room and multiple footsteps announced the arrival of visitors. Nathan gritted his teeth. There was nowhere to go and nowhere to hide. He chose to face the horrible bunch and kept his eyes open. The doctor arrived with the same four nurses that had tackled and sedated the group earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us go you nerds.\" the boy hissed from his helpless position. \"Hahaha that was a good one\" chuckled the doctor. \"He called you nerds.\" he repeated to the nurses who did not consider it to be that funny. \"And I meant you as well.\" the boy added with anger, looking at the doctor. Dr. Giggleton was not amused at all. \"How do you dare, boy. You don't know how to adress a doctor. You must treat me with honor. I have cured generations of cheerless kids and made them scream for joy.\" \"psssst not so loud\" Summer added, her eyes still closed. \"switch off the tv\" she added. \"I give her a wake up call\" one of the nurses added and took a stiff goose feather out of her pocket. Dr. Giggleton and the nurses watched with scientific interest and followed the tip of the feather with her eyes. Nathan became slightly nervous as the feather was approaching his right foot, but it's target was the bare sole of the older girl's left foot that was tied to the boy's ankle and rested on top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip landed on the big toe, circled it and slowly trailed down to it*s base. \"GHHHHHHN MHHHTTEEHEE MMMMMMHMHM MHHHH MH MH\" Summer grunted and started turning her foot when drawing back did not work. Easily the feather followed and zig-zagged over the sole with it's tip. \"GNNNHAAAAA WHHHHHN OGNNNNNNNH\" Nathan had watched the feather move but was now lowering his head and tilted it to watch Summer's face. Her mouth was contorted by a twisted smile. She looked really cute, he thought. The feather turned at the heel, drew a circle around the ankle and started to go up again. The reaction became stronger. \"MMHHHH HNNNNNNN UH UH UH TEHEHE\" Summer groaned louder, her leg started to jerk. Nathan watched with interest as the girl's expression was growing both by agony and happyness. Dr. Giggleton waived another nurse to tease the other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MHHHHHH GNHHHHH MH MH MH FFFFFFN TEEHEHEHEHE GOOOOOOD GNNNNNNNNHHHH\". \"mhhhh what? where?\" Vincent was being woken up by something which was tearing at his ankle. \"What? Who are you? Wait Dr. Tinnitus and....\" Dr. Giggleton fumed but a loud scream erupted from Summer. \"IIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEK IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEK\". She was wide awake now, her eyes big and both legs still jerking from the treatment of both feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Wake up Mouse<br>\r\n- Tickle time</span></div></div>",

And guess - it involves tickling hahahaha.\" Dr. Giggleton had found his dignity again and stood in front of four pairs of tied bare feet. \"Nurses! Present the feathers!\" The four nurses draw with a practised swing move their stiff goose feathers from their pockets and raised them high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pathetic. And you, you are not a doctor, you should be treated in a lunatic asylum.\" Nathan was still angry but silently wanted to show off in front of the girls. Summer looked over as much as she could turn her head, briefly admiring him but chastened him for his lack of negotiation skills. \"Ok Ok. What do you want from us Dr. Wigglington?\" \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Wigglington Summer his name is...\" \"SILENCE!\" Dr. Giggleton roared while the nurses had a hard time not to laugh. \"Giggleton, Dr. Giggleton, that is my name. You will remember it, if your mind is still sane after today. Now we....what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cute sniffing came from the side of the oversized makeshift bed where the four kids were tied side by side. Mouse was still asleep but was wrinkling her nose. It was obviously itching but she could not move her arm to scratch her nose. \"Why is she still sleeping? She has not heard what I said. I need more discipline in here.\" The nurses rushed over to the sleeping girl, the youngest of the four. One of the nurses whispered something and held her feather over the girl's face. Then she slowly lowered it between her eyes and drew it slowly over the short nose. \"HOOOEEF\" Mouse raised her upper lip showing her large front teeth. The feather took the same route again but ended squarely over the nostrils. \"FFFFFIIEEEEF\" the girl groaned and blew the air out of the nose, wrinkling it afterwards but getting no relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother feather joined the game<br>\r\n- on her cheeks<br>\r\n- on her feet   </span></div></div>",

Stop it!\" ordered Summer,nervous about her little sister which she could not see because Vincent's head was in between. But Dr. Giggleton held a finger to his closed lips and pulled a silver spiky pin wheel from his pocket. He indicated with the wheel to a pair of bare feet. Summer and both boys looked at the ghastly tool and shut their mouths. The sedating medicine was still in their blood limiting the level of activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother nurse approached the still sleeping girl. Mouse was stirring although the feather had stopped to tease her small nose. Keeping their silence both nurses started to draw lines, triangles and circles over the girl's cheeks. \"MMHH MMMMMMMMMMMHHHHH\" the girl groaned when the feather touched a soft spot and tried to scratch herself. When moving her arms did not work at all she turned her head to the side to rub the cheek on the cushion. But the other feather took advantage of the fully exposed neck. \"OOOOOOOOHHHH\" Mouse exhaled in a funny way and tried to rub her neck but it did not touch anything, her eyes still closed. Suddenly a smile appeared on her mouth. A feather touched her cheek and caressed her lips. The girl smiled even more. One nurse carefully rose the cloth of the nightie and stuck her feather below towards the collarbone. \"TEHEHEHEHE HEHEHEHEH\" the whole girl shuddered. \"Not there Peter. It tickles hehehe\". \"Interesting\" the nurse grinned and gently pushed the feather further and drew it back, teasing the skin towards her shoulders and the beginning of the chest. \"TEHEHEHHE PEEETER NOAHAHAHA\". The other feather softly touched her now pouted lips. Mouse shuddered again, shouted \"KISS ME!\" and opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" yelled Summer. \"Who is Peter? Do you kiss?\" Vincent was looking at the little girl next to him with a different view. Did she have a boyfriend? Did they even kiss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Giggleton decided to<br>\r\n- \"clean\" the feet with soap and brushes, done by the nurses<br>\r\n- test the pin wheel (himself)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
