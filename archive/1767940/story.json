Alex enters the building and is greeted by her boss, Mrs Bulla. Mrs. Bulla was an over 300 pound woman in her late 30s. She had long fair hair which she kept in a bun, her facial features were flawless which she enhanced with well skilled applied makeup such as red lipstick and eye shade. She had fancy manicures every day giving her gleaming finger nails. Mrs Bulla went to the spa daily constantly maintaining her smooth supple skin with lotioned massages. She adorned herself with extravagant jewelry wearing necklaces, rings, bracelets, and earrings that would make any woman envious. But what really impressed people was her gorgeous body, filled with jiggly fat. Her belly was massive, stretching her taut dress which would tear to shreds if it wasn't so well made. Her legs appeared as if drums of cottage cheese had been pumped into them. Her extremely gargantuan buttocks swayed and rippled with each step. Her beautiful face was filled with fat, with jowels jiggling as she spoke. Mrs Bulla's arms were utterly smothered in lard, fat hung from the limbs and jiggled with the slightest movement. Her boobs were monumental, colossal bags of fat that were every bra's worst nightmare, spilling out of any constricting clothing these soft cannon balls bounced with every breath. Mrs Bulla was wearing a low cut red dress and expensive red high heels eating a huge ice cream cone. \"Ah you must be Alex- OH MY! you're so skinny!\" Mrs Bulla exclaimed somewhat freaked out. Alex could only mutter and look down at her feet. \"I know I'm weird.\" \"hmm whats that?\" Mrs Bulla said joyfully moving closer to Alex. \"I know I'm skinny but I was never able to eat enough.\" Alex said. To all of Mrs Bulla's employees it was common knowledge that she was extremely generous and charitable. \"Well that changes today hun, forget about work we need to get you fat ASAP!\" Mrs Bulla said wrapping her thick squishy arm around Alex \"You're gonna spend the day with me, eating and living lavishly, plus I'll get to know you, I always like to know my employees.\" Mrs Bulla said gesturing to a servant. \"Craig two mega burgers!\" she said. \"Right away ma'am\" said the diligent servant who quickly came with a platter carrying two massive burgers loaded with everything from several strips of bacon to beig drenched in sauces. Mrs Bulla immediately grabbed one of the behemoths and sunk her teeth into it moaning in ecstacy as the greasy food slide down her throat. Alex picked hers up finding it very heavy and takes a bite. Alex's eyes lite up as the high calorie substance traveled throughout her body activating her fat cells.   Alex knew being around Mrs Bulla would make her beautiful.   </span></div></div>",

This woman would run her life from now on, determining Alex's work and pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha glanced over, jiggling her chins.<br>\r\nHer face lit up and she reached her hand out to shake Alex's, chiming dozens of precious bracelets made out of quality gold and diamonds. She looked to be sporting at least 3 million dollars worth of jewelry on her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there, you must be the new secretary. I'm glad to meet you.\"<br>\r\nThey shook hands, Bertha's chubby fingers wrapping around Alex's thin ones.<br>\r\n\"My, you're awfully thin. Your portfolio said you're eighteen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex was woken up from her bed by the sound of the alarm. Rolling over, she realized that when she went to bed she slept for 12 hours, and it was time to get to work. Rather than walk all that way, she summoned her hoverchair. That did not mean she did not want to stand, however. She very much wanted to stand to see how she looked. Doing so, she turned towards a mirror on the nearest wall and was repelled by her size. At a mere 65 centimeters, her waist did not equal her smallest friends. And therefore her sexiness did not either.<i>I must become fatter if I am to have even the smallest chance of love</i>, Alex thought, pinching what little fat she did have. And indeed it was true. She had to be assigned a boy at prom because she was so thin that nobody liked her. Her hoverchair reached her, and she fell into its soft cushions.<i>And more fat I will gain</i>, she vowed internally. Taking care not to move a muscle, she went down from her apartment, into the street, and into Glutcorp\u2019s offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex floated to her cubicle, she could not help but notice that everyone\u2019s eyes were on her, and she distinctly heard the mutterings of her coworkers about how thin she was. Everyone wondered if she was unhealthy.<i>I am trying! I will become sexy!</i> Alex wanted to shout. But she knew if she did, she would most likely lose her job. And so it was in silence that she floated to her cubicle and opened up her editing program. Her first project of the day was a sub assembly on a car. The design team had a problem with a fastener that connected the integrated vending machine to the dash. As it turned out, the materials used in the fastener were of poor quality. It was Alex\u2019s job to determine what materials were best. And she set upon the job with the intense focus of a new employee.<br>\r\n\u201cDonut run!\u201d Came the shout. \u201cAbout time,\u201d Alex muttered. After dealing with the fastener issue, she validated the design of a crash net, ran a simulation on a new hoverchair, and filed the reams of paperwork needed to begin clinical testing of a new feeding machine for reverse anorexia clinics. In short, she was mentally exhausted. A coworker approached with Alex\u2019s box of donuts. Taking them, she looked at the selection today. It was a dozen donuts, but instead of deep fried jelly filled and chocolate, it was a new mix. Four were deep fried chocolate. Another four were glazed crawlers. Two were deep fried bacon donuts, and the last two were glazed. Alex could not help but mutter \u201cMe gusta\u201d before she began eating. And eat she did. She ate each DVD sized donut from the outside in, eating it like a bird so as to not waste a single calorie. Despite this, it did not take long for her to finish. Inside of ten minutes, she was done. Burping softly, she rubbed her belly. \u201cWork day over. Enjoy the rest of your day,\u201d came the shout over the intercom. Going out, Alex began the next activity of her day. Speed dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many minutes of floating outside the well appointed building, she asked a guy floating in the front if this was girlsgonefat dating. \u201cWhy indeed it is,\u201d he responded. Floating in, she went to the clerk in front and said \u201cAlex done. Reporting for dating.\u201d \u201cTable 7,\u201d the clerk said. Floating to table seven, she rested and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went as she expected, more or less. Guy after guy came to her and they were given five minutes to talk, and most conversations ended as expected. They said they liked her, but she needed to gain weight. Just as she was finished, another guy approached. She expected it to go as all her other conversations did. \u201cHello,\u201d Alex muttered, not wanting to talk. \u201cHello indeed,\u201d the guy muttered, looking her over. \u201cWhat is your name and age?\u201d the guy asked. \u201cAlex. Age 18. And yours?\u201d Alex asked. \u201cJack. Age 18.\u201d The man responded. This Jack was a weird one, Alex knew. While he was big and fat like any other good man of this generation, there seemed to be a dexterity that others of his size lacked. The way in which his fingers moved intrigued Alex. \u201cIt is not like we can talk anyways. The speed dating time is over,\u201d Alex muttered. Jack countered, most eloquently, \u201cWe\u2019re adults here. We can do as we please. Shall we continue this conversation elsewhere\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There can be no other reason for this. Either that or this is an elaborate prank.</i> She thought. She almost did not go, but in the end decided to <i>I only lose minutes of my life,</i> she reasoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex floated down to 451 Washington avenue. And much to her suprise, Jack was there, and waving at her. She floated towards him, unsure if he would dart away. Suprisingly, he didn't. \u201cLet's eat,\u201d he said, floating in. Alex followed him. And to her suprise, there was indeed an all you can eat buffet in the place. Jack floated up to the hostess and asked for a table for two. \u201cMore like one and one twelfth,\u201d she replied snarkily. Regardless, they got a table. And Alex and Jack floated in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was uncalled for,\u201d Alex muttered. \u201cI agree,\u201d Jack responded. \u201cIt's not as though weight is a genetic thing. One simply needs to consume more calories than they burn. You have not had the opportunity to do that until now, or at least that's how it seems to me.\u201d \u201cYou would be correct. I have had a rather restricted life,\u201d Alex replied. \u201cIndeed? Explain?\u201d Jack responded. \u201cLet me put it this way. My parents only let me eat 2,000 calories a day. And they made me do these things called push ups. They were terrible. I was sweating...\u201d Alex paused when she saw Jack recoil in obvious horror. \u201cOnly 2,000 calories a day. Surely you mean a snack?\u201d He practically shouted. \u201cNo. Per day,\u201d she responded. \u201cAnd what is a push up?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cLet me show you. Please don't hate me.\u201d Alex begged. \u201cI promise not to,\u201d Jack said. And with that, she stood up. Then she lay on the floor. And then raised herself up on her hands. And let herself down, still on her hands. Then she laid back on her hoverchair. Somewhere a girl screamed in terror. \u201cNever do that again. Never!\u201d Jack shouted, clearly traumatized. \u201cI thought you said you wouldn't hate me.\u201d Alex responded. \u201cI don't. But never do that again.\u201d Jack said. \u201cI do not intend to,\u201d Alex muttered, looking down in shame. \u201cGood. And now to eat. You better impress me. Especially after what you did,\u201d Jack muttered, punching his order into a tablet, and Alex doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack noticed a serving robot used for only the heaviest orders. He knew it was not for him, as he only ordered a normal amount. But it came to his table. \u201cHere's your order sir,\u201d it said, handing out two forty pound burgers and the expected amount of fries. And then it turned to Alex. \u201cAre you sure you can eat so much madam,\u201d it asked.\u201dYes,\u201d Alex responded. \u201cVery well,\u201d it said, pulling  out three forty pound burgers, a bacon covered half sheet cake, and a two gallon milkshake. It then left. And the eating began. Jack watched Alex over his own food. In little more than an hour, Alex ate everything. And her belly was quite a nice shape.<i>Impressive,</i> Jack thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex came up from her feast slowly. She realized then that she had in fact out eaten Jack. Rubbing her spherical belly slowly and leaning back, she noticed Jack do the same. \u201cimpressed?\u201d She asked. \u201cVery. Here's my number,\u201d Jack said, leaving. And Alex left for her own appartment, called Jack, and dreamed about her next day at work. Or another date;<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have some matters to discuss.\"<br>\r\nAlex didn't even need to control her levi-chair, Bertha has full control of all the equipment in the company, including the chairs. It just floated behind Bertha's extra wide one. They hovered into an elevator and it started going to floor #200.<br>\r\nBertha noticed Alex admiring her fine necklaces.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see you noticed my neck jewelry. I only purchase the finest from the top shops in the city.\"<br>\r\nBertha smiled as she pulled one of the many from her neck.<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Alexis. consider it a gift from me to you. I like to treat my employees like family around here. And you're just like a daughter to me.\"<br>\r\nAlex blushed as Bertha slipped a necklace over her, it was worth at least 3X her yearly salary.<br>\r\n\"You see, dear, I expect the up most respect from my family, is that understood? You wouldn't disobey your mother, would you?\"<br>\r\n\"No ma'am! I respect you very much.\"<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Now let's take this to my floor.\"<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped at room #200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha hovered out and Alex follow suite.<br>\r\nShe was greeted to hundreds of expensive paintings, all of Bertha. They hovered over to her desk, which was the finest desk Alex had ever gazed upon.<br>\r\n\"Now you see Alex, I like to keep the image of society around here. It's good to be big and fat! Almost everyone is nice and plump like moi!\"<br>\r\nBertha gave a generous pat to her belly and a loud belch came from her mouth.<br>\r\n\"What you are doing with your body is strange to me. You are one of the smartest employees here, your GPA is a solid 4.5, and I see you rising up the corporate ladder quickly. But you really need to gain some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Mrs.Glut, I've always wanted to big like you, but my parents never fed me enough to get big like all the models. When I was little, all the school girls were <br>\r\nbig, and I was so small. All the girls waddled by the time they were in elementary school, and I was always like a twig.\"<br>\r\nA single tear dripped down her thin cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now dear! It's ok, I understand. That's why I've called this little meeting. I'd like to inform you that we're going to get you nice and big. I've signed you up for a fattening session after work today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''A bunch of highly trained professionals will put you into a machine and get you to the weight you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Thank you very much Mrs.Glut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember what I said. I like to treat my employees like family, and a daughter never disobeys her mother. I expect good work out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am! You're under my command!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now go to your fattening session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex motioned to get up, but she noticed the levi-chair was already taking her out of the building. It moved over to her hover-cycle and and she got on. It auto-piloted itself to the city fattening center.<br>\r\nA voicechat came up on her e-glasses.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Alexis. I hope you don't mind I've taken control of your ride for the evening. Just a friendly boss to employee gesture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message ended and Alex rode to the center. Alex was concerned that Bertha was being 'too' nice to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Bertha sent you! Right this way, Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large nurse waddled Bertha to a wall with several buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick your future size! Please feel free to take your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked over her choices...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the year 3000, nearly everyone is obese. Fashion shoots flaunt models with titanic bellies. Meals are massive. Hovering chairs and cars mean that very few people move. In this world, fat is considered sexy. Only a small subset of the population is thin, and Alex is among them. She does not like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex woke up and grabbed her clothes she set out the night before. As always, she hated the small size. Whereas most of her friends in high school wore 10XXXL\u2019s, her clothes were so small they could fit inside her friend\u2019s legs. Her pants were so small in the waist that a flea could fit in them. They were so small that they had to be tailored to her frame. As did her shirts. And bras. And pretty much everything else.  No normal sizes fit her. And it was all because of her parents, restricting the amount of food she could eat. It was because of her parents she was the size she was. <i> If only I was allowed to eat more food, then I would be the size of my friends, and less abused,</i> Alex thought. Because of her weight, she was the target of constant bullying at school. Everyone called her stick. <i> My problems are to be solved. </i> Alex comforted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into a temporary hoverchair, Alex went to the solution to her problems. The Bureau of Employment. There she was to receive an official ID, an upgraded hoverchair, and a job. In short, she would become an adult. <i> At last I can break free of my parent\u2019s grip,</i> she thought. Turning into the building, she floated to the receptionist\u2019s desk and spoke. \u201cMy name is Alex Mathers. I have appointments for hoverchair sizing, ID, and at the job office,\u201d she said. The receptionist looked at her \u201cOh yes. Second, third, and ninth floors respectively\u201d she said, turning her hoverchair in the direction of the elevator. \u201cthanks,\u201d Alex muttered, floating in that direction. She got into the elevator and pushed the button for the second floor. As she traveled, she could only think about how small she was.<br>\r\nThe hoverchair designer shouted \u201cYou so thin!\u201d when he saw Alex. Alex responded \u201cI know,\u201d in a shameful tone. \u201cPlease. I beg you. Give me my hoverchair so I can grow,\u201d she continued. The designer then pulled out a tablet full of specs, selected some, and a moment later a hoverchair popped out from a rapid 3-D printer. Alex marveled at its size, as it was designed to fit up to a half ton human. The automated feeding hands were just as she imagined them. The seat seemed extremely comfortable, and as she sat in it a moment later, her suspicions were confirmed. \u201cLet me know if you outgrow it,\u201d the designer said. \u201cI plan too,\u201d Alex responded as she floated away rubbing her stomach, contemplating her new lack of limitations and what they would do to her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex then went to the ID center on the third floor to receive her official, adult, ID. After the initial shock of the clerk at her size, the ID assignment was normal. She was asked to hover in front of a screen and the clerk had the camera adjust so as to focus on the head and shoulders. It then took a picture and the ID was printed and handed to her. Once again, Alex floated away, only this time to get a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the job assignment office, she had the by now expected exchange with the secretary and laid back in her hoverchair. She was sweating profusely, as this was the defining moment of her life. If there was an employer willing to take a girl as thin as her, then she would be given a company house and could gain weight. If there was not, then she would return to her parents and not gain a pound.<i> I have been waiting for many hours now. Maybe I should leave.</i> Alex thought. Just as she turned to leave, having given up all hope, she heard a shout. \u201cAlex Mathers. The job director will see you now.\u201d Alex sighed internally. <i>I may not be hopeless after all,</i> she thought, turning towards the job office again and going into the job director\u2019s office. Despite her newfound confidence, she could not help but perceive the sound of the door shutting behind her as ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job director\u2019s office was voluminous. 20 meters back, a giant hoverdesk was lit by natural light from behind. Curtained windows along the length immersed the rest of the room in darkness. The job director was looking at the outside through the window. \u201cAlex. Come in,\u201d he said. As Alex floated slowly towards the director, he had already begun speaking. \u201cAs both you and I know, your performance thus far has been admirable. You have achieved perfect scores on all your standardized tests. You have a 4.5 GPA in tough classes. In fact, you are an impeccable student and employee. There is just one problem\u2026\u201d \u201cmy weight.\u201d Alex interrupted. \u201cWhy yes,\u201d the director responded, \u201cWhy are you so thin,\u201d he continued. The tears began coursing down Alex\u2019s cheeks. \u201cIt is my parents. They restricted my food intake. They restricted it so much that while every other girl waddled by the end of preschool, I could not, no matter how hard I tried.\u201d She sobbed. \u201cYou poor child,\u201d the director said. \u201cLet me guess already. I did not get a job,\u201d Alex sobbed. \u201cYou did, though.\u201d The director said. Alex interrupted yet again. \u201cI bet it is a horrible job, though,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cYou have gotten the best job for your skills. You are now a machine programmer at Gainers Central HQ,\u201d the director stated. Alex sank back into her hoverchair in awe. Immediately, her thoughts became chaotic. <i>Gainers Central. The reverse anorexia company. And I will be working on their feeding machines. Yes!</i> Alex thought. \u201cWhen should I report for work?\u201d Alex inquired. The director shouted, \u201cThey\u2019re so excited to have you they want you right now!\u201d \u201cTell the man I\u2019ll see him soon!\u201d Alex shouted. She then turned and rocketed down the halls in her hoverchair, exhilarated at her newfound speed. She burst out the door of the jobs office and rocketed down the street. She turned left. Then right. Then right again. Then left, her hands moving the controls of the hoverchair so fast it seemed as though they were guided by muscle memory alone. <i>It should be around this corner.</i> Alex thought. It was not there. <i>Okay. Maybe the next.</i> not there either. Now Alex was getting concerned. <i> I\u2019ll give it one more corner before I begin to freak out, she thought.</i> She turned the last corner, and there was Gainers Central.</span></div></div>",

She remained small, so small. Even now, finally cresting five feet at 19 years old, she was dangerously underweight at 75 pounds. Her doctors told her she needed to put on weight, her mother wanted her to put on weight, even she wanted to put on weight, but nothing seemed to work. She always stayed her same gaunt self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day, something new appeared. A new restaurant opened in town. Lizzie had made a habit of eating fast food in a attempt to put on weight, but until now it hadn't worked. This restaurant,called \"Swell Ego\", boasted a large menu, including foreign favorites like Euros, Gyros, Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Borscht, Schnitzel, Curry, all sorts of bread, all with a calorie laden twist on them. Lizzie's eating habits allowed her to eat an impressive amount, so when she tabulated how many calories she was able to eat in a single sitting there, even she was amazed with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6,000 calories in one meal?\" her mom said as she looked at her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Six Thousand. I counted it three times to be sure.\" Lizzie replied, as her mom handed the notes back to her. Lizzie's hands then moved down and rubbed her round stomach, still full from dinner at Swell Ego. The food sat heavy in her, making her feel fatter already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this'll actually help you put on some weight!\" her mom said, placing a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so...\" Liz said as she got up, holding her stomach almost like a pregnant lady. \"I'm going to go to bed, that meal has me pooped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, get some rest, that should help some weight pile on.\" her mom replied as Liz waddled her way to her room. She entered and stripped down and then put her pj's on. Her stomach peeking out under the shirt. She crawled into her bed, hands on her stomach and drifted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Lizzie slept roughly through the night, her body churning the food through her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie awoke, groggy. She dragged herself out of bed and walked to her bathroom. She entered and used the toilet, a refreshing feeling washing over her as she finished. She stripped off her pj's, noticing her stomach wasn't swollen anymore and turned on her shower. She waited for the water to heat up and noticed her scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noting to lose.

Polly scarfed down the greasiest meal in her life and felt an unbound elation unlike ever before. Polly then went to other fastfood restaurants feeding her body some desparately needed calories. Throughout the week Polly indulged in sweets and takeout utterly defying her diet. At the end of the week Polly had a photo shoot modeling a new swimsuit but to the crew's surprise Polly wasn't her thin self. Polly stuffed her body into the bikini with her belly hanging over, a cushy muffin top, boobs spilling out of the top which was digging into her back fat, her ass was wide and squishy opposed to her normal flat rear, her thighs ridden with a trace of cellulite, and her arms were thicker than her typical bone like arms.

Now showing pride in her curvier figure, Polly fashioned herself in a tight leopard skinned dress that displayed her recently developed cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Polly walked through the building she noticed numerous images of their plus sized clientele. Posters of women much larger than her, in bikinis or lingerie decorated the walls. Was she really going to become one of those women, she thought.

Women are losing interest, especially the younger ones. After years of society barking at them to lose weight, women are starting to phase them out. Every week brings a new miracle diet which always disappoints in the end. The average woman simply finds the act of losing weight a waste of time. Its just not worth the effort, especially since nearly every woman regains her lost weight. Hard to keep it off with all of the fast food restaurants in the country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolly found Buck's explanation very comprehensible and grew all the more curious \"Makes sense.

It wasn't that she didn't like her friends coming over, far from it actually, or that she was embarrassed about her family's modest nest egg that they seemed to be surviving quite nicely off of. Her mother was polite and kept her nose out of her daughter's business as a good mother should, and Michelle was usually either out with friends or holed up in her room playing some kind of video game. It was Cassie, her clean-nosed little goodie-goodie of a sister who hadn't done much of anything wrong in her entire life flaunting her college education. Okay, that might have been an exaggeration, but still the point remained that Bailey didn't feel comfortable around Cassie since she had started college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough at the insistence of her friends, Bailey was inclined to bring them around quite often: whether she liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis increase in company led Cassie to prepare a larger quantity of food to match with the larger quantity of guests. It was no strain on her or the family; Cassie loved to cook for larger crowds and her mother Wanda had no objections to splurging a little for more ingredients. Almost every other night, if not every night of the working week, Bailey was goaded into inviting at least one or two of her friends over for dinner and Cassie was happy to oblige with a few extra servings here and there. It wasn't awkward in the least for anyone at the table, at least not after a while. Soon enough most of Bailey's friends had become like members of the family themselves; laughing, telling jokes at the dinner table, staying over for the weekends if they weren't too busy! Wanda even joked that she should \"just sign the adoption papers and get it over with!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed, the demand for Cassie's delicious food spiked as she grew more and more handy around the kitchen. Many, many plates of seconds were served as the table of gourmands' appetites grew more accustomed to Cassie's fine cuisine and, as predicted, bellies and figures did soften quite a bit. It started out simply enough with a few earnest bouts of energy in Cassie that urged her to push her culinary envelope, but when the complaints coming from the table resounded \"is this really all that she's cooking?\", Cassie was happy to oblige the eager eaters with another course. Few saw the pattern, namely Hera, and swore off of visiting for good (or at least until Bailey got her own place) though the others remained fixed to their spots at the ever-growing kitchen table; doomed to grow rounder and rounder amongst themselves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie stood at her usual place on every Saturday morning; in front of the stove whipping up something tasty and delicious for breakfast. Today's menu was bland in culture though extraordinary though Cassie's specialty; pancakes. Unlike most other pancakes though these were stacked high on top of each other, made with only the finest of purchasable mix, and (upon Michelle's request and unto no objections) were: topped with blueberry syrup, suffocated in whipped cream, covered chocolate flakes, and crowned with a single cherry. It was a pain to make every other weekend or so, but it seemed to make everybody happy enough. Using her worn spatula to flip another griddle cake, Cassie winced as a bit of melted butter splashed onto her unprotected arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" she hollered, instinctively recoiling to clutch the afflicted area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\" her mother cried cautiously from the living room, \"Are you alright in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie cursed to herself quietly before answering, \"Yeah, I'm alright Mom!\" To convince herself and ease her suffering, she blew gently on the quickly flushing spot on her wrist. \"Are you sure, I could come in there and help, you know?\" Ever the fighter, Cassie shrugged it off. \"No, I'm alright Mom!\" she shouted back, \"You just keep doing what you're doing, breakfast'll be ready in a bit!\" Cassie hated all the shouting in the house, probably the most out of everyone. It made it hard for her to study, especially when somebody wanted something from her and she was holed up in her room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at her mother now, it seemed to be the only option short of a strict plan of diet and exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" she shouted, concluding the shouting match between her and her daughter. Without a second thought, the older woman's portly fingers began dancing once more across her keyboard. It really wasn't like she could have gotten up to help Cassie if there was an emergency, certainly not in a timely manner anyway. A desk job combined with her rather sedentary lifestyle- not to mention her increasingly lackluster eating habits- had landed her a far ways away from her once svelte, rather firm figure that she had prided herself on. In its place lay several components to a failed replacement: a heavy set of breasts that sagged slightly with her age, a rotund stomach that censored her privates when naked and bulged outwards to keep her doughy arms at an angle, and most notably an absolutely enormous rump that had all but wedged her in the snug office chair she had forced herself into. Her short hair, an aged platinum blond, was somewhat unkempt for her weekend regimen of relaxation. Said regime was also reflected in her choice of remaining in her pj's. As she typed, Wanda found that she was striking an extra key once or twice; she dismissed it as a rusty attempt at keyboarding. However it was obvious to everyone else: her fingers were too fat to type regularly. And it was starting to get to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, I wish you wouldn't play such <i>loud</i> games!\" she barked, her impatience in herself and in her appetite finally surfacing in misplaced anger. \"And they're so violent, what daughter plays stuff like this in front of her mother?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs had been her mother's, Michelle's growth was nothing short of exponential. Gone was the thin, waif-like frame she sported before. Gone were the days of fitting into skinny jeans and tight shirts from Hot Topic. Having already gotten used to Cassie's cooking, Michelle had already developed a habit of overindulgence far before everyone else. Acting as an unofficial \"taste tester\" had finally paid its toll on Michelle's skinny shape as it rapidly ballooned outwards. In no time she was sporting heavy lovehandles, chubby cheeks, and a rounded belly; but that was months before. In place of the almost abnormally skinny girl what once had been, a truly fat drink of water sat plopped in her place. Michelle's belly, left free to hang due to her far-too-small shirt (a habit developed out of necessity) was a pale, squishy dome that rose even while she reclined. It divided itself into two distinct rolls that hung heavily over her crotch separating her legs forever. \"Ugh, thanks a lot Mom!\" she bickered with her mother, \"I just got killed by an Overlord, you happy?!\" Michelle was so lazy in fact, that she barely turned her head as she feuded with her mother- instead keeping her relaxed position steady: armed with her controller and both wrists resting on her heavy belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is <i>with</i> all the noise?!\" Bailey shouted as she, too came into the clamor. Unlike the rest of her family, Bailey's unfamiliarity with Cassie kept her on edge and constantly bickering with her sister, thus not eating nearly as much as her overfed and slothly family. While true, she had gained just a little weight, Baily was nowhere near the size of her mother, and <i>far</i> from the size of her fat little sister. However she was still far from her old self. Bailey's old body had slowly inflated outwards with blubber, spreading rather proportionately and evenly as she grew fatter. Now she was officially overweight, though she hated to admit it. She wore her weight well, most of it going to her chest and keeping her busty. Bailey hadn't refused to continue her regular routine though, as such her skin was quite tanned and her hair still very much blond. \"I wake up to Jessie trying to smother me in arm fat-\" yes you pervs, they shared a bed when her friends came over. It's not exactly a big house and there aren't just <i>spare</i> mattresses lying around. Get your mind out of the gutter- \"And all I hear is you three yelling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie's still asleep?\" Wanda said sympathetically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well that's what she gets for staying up with Cassie all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec, I just gave her the pan of cookies and went to bed!\" Cassie refuted in innocence from the kitchen, \"Don't wrap me into this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go wake her up and ask her if she wants breakfast.\" Wanda said sternly, \"It'll be ready in a minute, right Cassie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, call Bella and see if she's gonna be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know she is, girl's never said no to your cooking.\" Bailey said abashedly...</span></div></div>",

She genuinely enjoyed being a stay at home mom, raising kids but the kids had grown up and require an insignificant amount of attention leaving Diane with a void in her life. At first she contemplated having another child but lacked a stable income. Then Diane thought of getting a job to satisfy her boredom. Lucky for her she had a friend Cindy who was working at an office that coincidentally had an opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for the job\" Diane said walking with Cindy to her cubical.  Diane was sporting a business dress with a short skirt exposing her smooth toned legs, and a shirt exhibiting her busty cleavage. \"Don't mention it\" said Cindy leading Diane to her cubical. Cindy was a 165 pound woman in her thirties with long brown hair with a plush cushy butt noticably bouncing in her taut business skirt, with a soft pudgy belly gently spilling over her skirt, and a swollen chest beginning to strain her bra. Diane met Cindy in High school and remained friends since. At first Cindy was very slim possessing a firm butt and a flat stomach. Diane used to spend lots of time together, going for walks, trips to the gym, going out to eat, and other various activities. But once Cindy started her job, she spent less time with her, refraining from walks and finding herself to be too busy and tired to go to the gym, quitting all together. Cindy's diet changed as well no longer having the time to cook she ate fast food for lunch rather than concocting a healthier homemade option. Diane however became a housewife using her energy to cook healthy meals, playing with her kids, and finding time to maintain her girlish figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore reaching the cubical, Cindy showed Diane the lounge room. Diane looked in shock at the lounge room which was totally different that what she had grown accustomed to. The room had multiple vending machines, coffee pots beleaguered by stacks of donut boxes, a fridge filled with microwave dinners, and only a microwave to cook food. This was rather upside down to Diane who had lived in a kitchen with an oven, a fridge filled with various options, counters and tables filled with various fruits. Gazing upon the lounge room Diane could only utter \"Uhh looks nice.\" \"Here help yourself\" Cindy said offering Diane a donut. \"Oh uh no thanks I had a filling breakfast.\" Diane said recounting her toast and orange for breakfast. \"Oh come on I made sure we had extra donuts especially for you\" Cindy said grabbing a jelly filled donut and handing it to Diane. \"Umm...okay\" Diane said begrudgingly accepting the donut while Cindy grabbed one for herself and quickly scarfing it down. By the time Diane finished her donut Cindy had inhaled four. \"Mmm yum Okay Diane lets get you to your cubical.\" Cindy said before bumping into a coworker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Cindy hey girl!\" said a 200 pound black haired woman with a huge belly. \"Oh hey Tiffany hows it going?\" Cindy replied. \"Oh just getting some donuts\" Tiffany said. \"Oh let me introduce you to Diane she's the new girl.\" Cindy said. \"Hello\" Diane introduced herself. \"Nice to meet you, we really should go out to lunch and get to know each other.\" Tiffany suggested. \"Definately we'll all go.\" said Cindy. \"Allright now I'm going to go eat some donuts\" Tiffany said eyeing a tiger claw. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nCindy and Diane reach her cubical, Cindy shows her around and helps Diane set up. Diane got to work sitting in her chair for most of the remaining day.    </span></div></div>",

Diane figured she'd have to make her own supper. Opening the door to the fridge, Diane saw a surplus of fresh fruits and veggies but nothing filling that didn't require laborious effort to make. Settling for expediency , Diane reached for an apple hoping the simple fruit would suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was so unusual to Diane. Before getting a job, Diane had ample time to prepare elaborate meals, both tasty and nutritious, and enjoy them with her family. But now utterly bereft of time, family dinners were unmanageable. To further Diane's dismay was the fact that her family was absent. Diane's husband was always away since his job required immense devotion but now even her kids weren't around preoccupied with their own lives now. Instead of eating at the table with her family, Diane resorted to sitting in her lonesome on the couch, chewing her apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph I'm still hungry. An apple isn't a dinner. But I'm totally too drained to cook.\" Diane moaned sinking into her couch. It was than that Diane recalled the other day's lunch when Cindy had ordered some pizzas to the office. They were tasty though a bit filling for Diane's taste. It was the pizzas that Diane blamed for her new belly flab. Looking at her belly and giving it a pinch, Diane caved in. \"Screw it! I'm too hungry to care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the phone Diane ordered a pizza only to find out that it was buy one get one free. \"Well I guess it'll give me something to eat later given how I never have the time to cook anymore.\" she reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time flat, her pizzas arrived, the aroma tantilized Diane. Opening the box unveiled a pizza smothered in thick cheeses, various meats scattered atop, and other various toppings gracing the dinner. This is what her job turned Diane's dinner into, a greasy, high calorie gorge in front of the tv. To her surprise, Diane had nearly polished off both pizzas. \"Oh my god! Did I really just eat the whole pizza! Jeez I even nearly finished the other one!\" Faced with an empty box and one containing 1 and a half slices, Diane exhaled and collected herself. \"It's okay, it's just this one time. Besides once the weekend comes around I'll have myself a good workout.\" Diane said to herself.</span></div></div>",

Diane wearing a flimsy night gown stared at herself in the mirror while fixing her hair. Diane noticed her arm flab jiggle as she combed her hair before gazing at her expanded breasts which had gone up a few sizes. Taking off her gown to change into her work clothes she noticed her belly was bouncing more than usual and her legs felted thicker. Diane avoided the scale dreading its answer since it read 150 the previous week.  As she began to put on her dress she felt its tightness wrap around her. \"Uhh come on dammit\" Diane said struggling to pull up her skirt which fit her so perfectly a month earlier. Next came the shirt each button putting up a fight, Diane accepting defeat once her huge tits stepped up, creating a huge deep cleavage with boob spilling out of a undersized bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Diane got dressed she immediately left her house to get a breakfast burrito at a fastfood restaurant, no longer having the energy or patience to make a healthy breakfast. Feeling particularly hungry Diane also ordered some fries and a extra large chocolate mocha coffee with extra cream and sugar. Before working Diane hardly ever ate fastfood and wouldn't even dream of eating such a greasy fattening breakfast, but the stress of work was really getting to Diane and left her with little time to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane's life had undergone some changes such as she used to wake up eat some fruit and toast then go for a walk, now she gets up and sits in her car for thirty minutes while eating her breakfast burrito. She used to flurry about the house doing chores and staying active. Now she just sits in a cubical all day snacking onfood from vending machines. Diane no longer went to the gym since work left her feeling fatigued and stressed which drove her to excessive eating. For lunch she used to create healthy meals but now she would go out to some unhealthy restaurant with the girls or just eat fast food or some nutritionally lacking microwave dinner. Evening at home she would eat more and continue her sedentary day. Diane, with her extra income, spent it on desserts and other excessive eating such as going out to eat with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane finally arrived at work after sitting through traffic, walking into the building with her wobbly legs, squishy arms, thundering thighs, quaking belly, and huge bouncing tits waiting to burst out of her weakly buttoned shirt.. Diane now routinely stopped by the lounge to snack on a few donuts despite consuming her greasy breakfast. Of course she wasn't the only one there for several other women met daily in the lounge to talk and eat, all of the fat and growing. \"Uhh I gained ten pounds\" said a woman \"Don't worry its barely noticable\" said another. \"Mmm you've got to try this flavor.\" \"Have you seen Rebecca, I swear she must have gained fifty pounds this year.\" \"Have you tried the new burger joint its so good.\" \"I don't care what my doctor said I feel healthier than ever.\" were some of the things one could hear from the group of feasting women. Two guys stand at the other end of the room drinking coffee. \"Hey is it me or does every woman who works here get fat.\" one man said to the other.  </span></div></div>",

I totally remember when she started, she was so thin, now she looks likes so fat, she must be tipping the scale at 250 by now\u201d the other girl said. <br>\r\n\u201cHey do you know who else is looking pretty fat recently, that newish girl Diane. Dam that girl is starting to seriously pack it on.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo joke. She\u2019s only been here like 4 months and I think she\u2019s putting it on faster than anyone in this entire office.. like ever.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah I totally agree, I mean like every one around here gains weight, take cindy for example she was super thin when she started and know she\u2019s like at total fatty, but Diane she\u2019s pilling em on faster than anyone. \u201c<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, maybe the stress is just to much for her. I heard she\u2019s barely ever worked a day in her life, so maybe this job is just taking its toll on her\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell she deserves it then, never having to have worked before how easy her life must of been. Some of us have worked all our lives, so so should she.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane rolled out of bed and heaved herself up. Scratching her new large guy she lazily walked to the bathroom to get ready for work. Entering the bathroom she yawned and so the scale in the corner. Dreading it she stood on the scale to get it over with. <br>\r\n\u201c213lbs Holy crap\u201d she said in shock. She observed herself in the mirror to see the damage. She had develop a slight double chin on her much rounder  face, her arms were now much flabbier and her boobs also looked much larger. But most of the damage was on the bottom half. Having such a sedentary job, sitting on her arse all day, the lower half of the body had took the biggest hit. Her thighs were now much ticker and had began rubbing when she walked, her tight waist had now greatly expanded and her once firm butt was much larger and jiggle with each step, however were most of the weight had settled was on Diane\u2019s now huge gut that sagged and wobbled in front of her. Diane did not like what she saw, beginning thin and attractive all her life meant this sudden change in here body was a new experience and she didn\u2019t like it. She was constantly running out of breath, her cloths were much tight, moving had become much more of as struggle, she never had any energy and her new diet had mad her very lazy not to mention gassy. Diane hated every minute of it but she had become to lazy and drained to do anything about it and she was to addicted to the fast food and junk food she had been eating. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normally girls would befriend their roomies, however their living arrangements have spurned quite the predicament. Both girls had hailed over their high schools as the most popular girl neither willing to relinquish said title.  Their attempts to assert dominance started simple, walking through doors first as one nudged the other aside, hogging the bathroom, garnering the attention of boys, and even swiping the other's food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both girls yearning to cast a shadow on the other, dares began. Attacking Sami's confidence in her body, Kristen challenged her to wear a particularly skimpy outfit. Sami whole-heartedly accepted and donned the revealing attire, proudly flaunting her glorious figure. Sami in turn tested Kristen's resolve daring that she wear only a bikini for the week. Kristen intrepidly accepted and attended her classes in her vast collection of swim wear. Afterwards Sami suggested the two of them participate in a bikini contest. Unfortunately their determination only intimidated the judges to declare it a draw between the two. The draw only incited more clashes between the competitive girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of now the girls have earned a reputation for being licentious. Both Kristen and Sami are always seen wearing skimpy outfits and pressuring each other to scandalous behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently the girls are in the cafeteria were new additions to the menu have been added. Sami stood in front of the menu giving it a look over \"Eww gross. Look at how unhealthy the new menu is. I mean that burger is massive, who could even eat that.\" Hearing Sami's words prompted Kristen to seize an opportunity to out do her roommate. \"Ah-hem one burger please.\" Kristen requested to the cashier while quickly glancing at Sami to deliver a triumphant sneer. Now realizing the emerging challenge Sami ordered one for herself. \"Oh please like you could finish that.\" Kristen jeered. \"Ha! I only said those things earlier because I was thinking of losers like you. Of course I'll finish this little snack.\" Sami gloated. \"Hmmph!\" both girls gestured as the took a booth. Both sat across from each other, glaring as each aggressively consumed the oversized burger. Sure enough both had finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha I told you I could do it!\" Sami declared wiping the grease from her mouth. \"Pish posh Anyone can eat one. I however am still hungry and shall order another.\" Kristen said gracefully getting up and sauntering to the cashier. \"Oh yeah? Well I'm ordering 2!\" Sami stated. \"Only two I was ordering 3.\"Kristen enlightened. \"Grrrrrrr four than!\" a livid Sami snarled refusing to let Kristen triumph over her. In the end both girls carried five of the colossal burgers back to the booth. Each girl alike trembling before the meal they were about to undergo.</span></div></div>",

After about a year of this she even tried acting again only to fined she was also not very good at that either anymore.

What to order. Well I best make the most of this cause won\u2019t be coming here for while again, to unhealthy. \u201c she thought. <br>\r\nAs she walked to the counter she began to order \u201cI\u2019ll have one large big tasty meal with a large coke and large fries\u201d is that all the grumpy teenager said \u201c well I am treating myself so I\u2019ll also take one triple choc muffin as well as a large Oreo McFlurry\u201d.

I\u2019ve been so caught up in my career problems that I have barely had any time to enjoy myself \u201c she thought to herself as she began ravenously scarfing down the rest of her food. \u201cMaybe I should take a break from my career and just enjoy myself for abit , i mean I can make a comeback whenever I want I\u2019m Selena Gomez I\u2019m amazing.\u201d She thought to herself as she further devoured her meal. \u201cYeah this is a great idea, I can take sometime to enjoy things, like like omg I can\u2019t even remember the last time I had pizza and oh I can totally just relax and have parties at my beach house. Then in all that time I\u2019m sure tons of agencies will be lining up for me to be there client and make a huge comeback. This is a great plan I can do and eat and have fun as much  as I want and then jump straight back in to the famous life when I\u2019m finished on my break.\u201d She thought as she finished her meal. \u201cThis is a great idea as long as I don\u2019t go overboard I should just take some time to relax and indulge myself... what\u2019s the worst that could happen. \u201c....</span></div></div>",

Everyday was a new day of indulgence and parties and Selena was enjoying all off it. However, during all this parting and fun Selena was blissfully unaware of the toll it was having on her body... and it was having a big one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEehhh\u201d Selena moaned as she woke up in the aftermath of last nights part. \u201cWhere am I \u201c she said as sleepily as she began to yawn, a very slight double chin appearing when she did so. \u201cWhere are my pants\u201d muttered lead there in her top and underwear. She stood up and saw her pants on the floor, she walked over to pick em up dodging all the mess and other people all over the floor sleeping. She put on her pants with a slight struggle as she pull them up and left the house to call a taxi. \u201cUhh. These pants are abit tight must be someone else from the party. Oh well\u201d she thought to herself waiting for the taxi with a slight hang over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taxi arrived son later and she jumped in. \u201cFun night\u201d the taxi driver said looking a the slightly chubby brunette. \u201cYe\u201d she replied in a grumpy mood.\u201dwher\u2019em I takin ya love\u201d the taxi driver said. \u201cEhh. Better get some breakfast, McDonald\u2019s please\u201d Selena said groggily. \u201cOkay doki\u201d said the driver  thinking \u201chuh you could do without but hey what do I know\u201d as he set of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver wasn\u2019t wrong though Selena had well... chubbed up. She had gained about 30lb during her 3 months of parting and we\u2019ll it had left its mark. She definitely wasn\u2019t fat and wasn\u2019t chubby either, to sum her up she was thick very thick. Her face and arms had started to round out, her slim legs had purged up and were begining to rub at the top. The tight wast had began to expand and her firm but had a slight wobble to it now. Her once flat toned stomach had started to form a slight pot belly that jiggled as she walked and her boobs had looked to have gone up a cup size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon arrived at McDonald\u2019s and placed her order \u201cI\u2019ll have two big tasty burgers, err two cokes, two McFlurrys a Big Mac and oh yey 20 chicken nuggets all extra large. Thanks\u201d she said to the waiter. Even though Selena said she would go McDonald\u2019s often it had become one of her most frequent places along with Pizza Hut and KFC and as she grew so did her appetite. as she started eating she thought to herself \u201cdam this hangover sucks, I should cut back on the parting and just relax for a bit.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As the 5th month since the end of her career came to an end, her lifestyle had taken another massive change. She had given up on partying all together as she found it to draining and she had become to lazy to dance as it tired her out and instead she found herself lying about in her beach house eating junk food and taking in the sun on her balcony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh this bikini is kinda tight.\u201d She said to herself as she got ready to do some sun bathing. She pulled on the elastic to try and get more comfortable as her bikini was digging in to her much thicker sides and much meatier boobs. Her breast were practically over flowing her bikini top and she had chubby love handles over the edges of her bottoms followed by a small pouch where her gut spilled over the front of her bikini shorts. Gaining over 35lbs in 2 months she was now officially chubby boarder line fat. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which had dramatic effects to her waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena now ate at McDonald\u2019s every day know sometimes even twice if she went for breakfast and dinner, and when she wasn\u2019t eating there, she was eating at some other unhealthy establishments like Pizza Hut or Burger King. As time went by she began ordering larger meals, more food and had even started having delivery as she couldn\u2019t be bothered going out and getting it her self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena was spread outsides, like a small beached whale, on her sun lounger wolfing down her 4th burger of the afternoon. As she finished her burger Selena began to heave herself up to go get changed out of her now extremely tight bikini. After finally standing she began absentmindedly scratching her gut as she walked off thinking <br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap since when was it hard to stand up\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 months of nothing but relaxing and binging and Selena was piling on the weight, not only was she getting fatter but she was getting fatter faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got to her room she switched on her laptop whilst getting change. After a challenging swap of cloths Selena sat on her bed half out of breath and looked at her email. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously still no agencies want me as a client. Dam it\u201d She said as she threw her laptop on the floor. She walked over to pick it up and when she bent down she all of a sudden heard a massive rip. She sprung up quickly, realising she had just tore her pants. After fixing her wardrobe malfunction she hurried to the bathroom and grabbed the scale. <br>\r\n\u201c253lbs. What the hell.\u201d She said as she stepped back in shock. <br>\r\nShe took a look at herself in the mirror, seeing her now much larger figure with its giant bum, large breast and it\u2019s big flabby gut. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fat\u201d she wined as she started poking at herself. <br>\r\n\u201cHow did this happen\u201d she said in shock. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been over 130 before.

I..I\u2019m fine had a pretty good week , new label and every thing being a success\u201d she said regaining her composure. <br>\r\n\u201cHow about you, I was just in the city on tour and thought I\u2019d check in haven\u2019t seen you in a while\u201d Taylor said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Selena burst out in a rant <br>\r\n\u201cDo wanna  know, do you wanna know. My life is pretty much crap at the moment, I haven\u2019t had a hit in over 3 years, No agencies want me as a client, I can\u2019t stop eating, I\u2019m gassy, None of my cloths fit, my social life is on the downfall and to top it of I\u2019m fat.\u201d She said as her anger quickly turn to depression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTay. What am I going to do. What happened to me, at one point I had had millions of fans, I was super hot, my career was amazing and I was as super famous. And now I have no career, no fans, I\u2019m gaining weight like crazy and I\u2019m not even famous anymore\u201d Selena wined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it will be okay I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll bounce back\u201d Taylor said, being a bit overwhelmed by the meltdown she just witness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I\u2019m mean I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get back on top, and don\u2019t worry your not fat you just look a little bloated that\u2019s all.\u201d Taylor said trying to be nice although secretly quite enjoying watching her friend fall apart. <br>\r\nJust the a button on Selena\u2019s tight pants burst off and almost hit Taylor in the head. There was a huge awkward silence as Selena went bright red in embarrassment. After a few seconds Taylor said in shock. \u201cI..I really must be getting back to my tour and don\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure things will work out\u201d she said quickly leaving, not wanting the next button to hit. <br>\r\nAs Taylor left Selena rushed to the kitchen as she almost died of embarrassment, she grab a box of donuts the first thing she saw and started rapidly eating them. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so fat, I almost took Tays eye out with a button\u201d she thought, as she continued  comfort eating out of sheer humiliation. </span></div></div>",

That noblewoman was the Hungarian countess Elizabeth Bathory. Elizabeth was obsessed with being the personification of femininity and desire. She craved smooth unblemished skin, long silky hair, mesmerizing eyes, and mounds of soft supple flesh. Every woman of that era yearned to be fat, and with her affluence, Elizabeth successfully attained a plump physique, one that many sought after. Elizabeth ate extraordinary sumptuous meals, stuffing herself to her stomach's capacity with rich decadent foods. However the fat countess found excessive consumption to be lacking, she needed more and was willing to take drastic measures.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day a disobedient servant girl was executed, leaving a corpse. The girl was rather portly, she did serve an opulent house and therefore had access to high quality nourishments. Elizabeth then got an idea in her head. She had heard myths about bathing in blood to retain youth, but what about fat? The fat of a young maiden surely would have beneficial qualities for a woman seeking eternal obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth undressed her corpulent body, bearing her hefty belly and rolls for her envious servant girls. Elizabeth sat in her large bathtub while the fat of the corpse was sucked out of it. Fat emptied from the deceased girl splatter on Elizabeth who welcomed the thick substance as she rubbed it on her body. From her face to in between her breasts and rolls, down to her buttcrack. Elizabeth delighted in this fat bath, reveling in elation even going so far as sipping the fat. \"How exquisite this young girl's fat feels so tantalizing. Why I bet I could even ...SIIIPP. MMM! How delicious! This is absolutely magnificent.\" Elizabeth declared as she continued sipping the simmering fat.  Upon finishing the bath, Elizabeth looked younger and fatter. Due to its success, Elizabeth would only dive deeper into her primal urges and obsession with obesity.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or was it the fact that she ran away with other peoples money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnway, another hole had formed in her bank account as well.

Only to pausing to take a large swig of milk that compliments the sweet treats taste.

It all came flooding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Azismiss forced down the more bloated her stomach felt. The blissful feeling of such as hedonistic display made her crave more and more. She became greedier, eating at a faster pace and chugging down more milk. The painful strain on her stomach only made her want more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally came down to the last one finally being eaten. The feast ended with the boxes being emptied except for stray flakes of sugary crust and the gallon of milk all empty.
