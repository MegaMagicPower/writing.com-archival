Thus marks the start of your days as an adventurer, or perhaps something much more sinister. However, before you can begin your quest, you must first decide... who's story will you follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are three different adventurers to choose from: a native of Morrowind (Elder Scrolls III), a native of Cyrodiil (Elder Scrolls IV), or a native of Skyrim (Elder Scrolls V). All three of them have different options for journeys to go on, as well as different fates: terrifying dungeons and hungry predators of all kinds await them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, instead, you can play as a Daedra. Natives of oblivion, the Daedra have potential to cause all kinds of havoc in Oblivion or the overworld. Of course, there are numerous to choose from, each with their own characteristics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you can choose from some other options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without further ado, who's journey will you follow today?</span></div></div>",

A young dark elf girl belonging to House Redoran but of Ashlander descent, Avoni was a freelance adventurer in a time and place where adventuring had never been more profitable: with the Tribunal temple struggling to maintain control over the Ghostfence, the capital at Mournhold struggling with internal affairs, and the joke of an Imperial Legion weaker than ever, it seemed that there was nothing standing in the way of the average adventurer who wanted to make a name for their self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was nothing to stop the various beasts and monsters that made Morrowind infamous from roaming about and causing problems for these would-be adventurers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoni was only one of these would-be adventurers. With typical grey skin, Avoni's round red eyes poked out from behind her dark bangs, more often than not covered by the hood of a robe which also completely masked her small, petite figure. Her fighting style was closest to that of a \"nightblade\", which meant that she used stealth tactics to get around, supported heavily by an arsenal of magic. It was a class commonly associated with rogues and thieves, which suited Avoni well... although she wasn't quite a thief, she wasn't exactly the most experienced adventurer, either, which led to her running away a lot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is a new day, and a new adventure. What is Avoni doing today?</span></div></div>",

Although more of her raids ended in failure than not (and by \"failure\", meaning barely escaping with her life), the dunmer was no stranger to the solo dungeon raid, and knew that one sometimes had to travel a significant distance to find the best loot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, taking a break from Guild work (which was pretty sparse for someone of her low rank anyway), the adventurer made her way to Dagon Fel by boat, and from there, by foot. It was quite a trek, but she had managed to arrive just before sunset at her destination.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avoni gave a sigh as she approached the door of her next dungeon: a tomb with the family name \"Senim\" engraved in Daedric characters on its entrance. Ancestral tombs were an integral part of Dunmer culture, and were located all over the island continent. Her own namesake, Indalen, even had one, nestled between the steep hills that surrounded the Imperial town Caldera - although, with her current lifestyle, the young Dunmer silently worried if she would actually be interred there, instead of in a ditch by some bandit camp or in the intestines of some hungry monster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoni exhaled another breath as she examined the entrance of the crypt. Tombs like these were all generally built in the same style - they had modest doors, downward passageways, and some winding halls and rooms of various sizes, full of burial urns filled with ashes and other valuable trinkets buried with their former owners. However, other than that, there was no telling who else would be inside - sometimes, Avoni got lucky, and the tombs were either empty or full of some restless undead. Other times, she was not as much, and ran into bandits or necromancer or vampires, or, worst of all, Daedra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the nightblade wouldn't know what approach to take in this dungeon until she got a glimpse of her enemy. For that reason, she usually preferred to sneak in. However, if the enemy within were truly powerful and noticed her before she noticed it, she would be in big trouble, especially if she were alone...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avoni sighed as she approached the door, deciding not to summon one of her ancestors for help. She was much better at stealth than she was at combat, the latter being her only option if she used a summoned being's help. Besides, the only ghost she could ever seem to summon was that of her ancestor Lilethys, who had been getting very impatient with her lately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, she decided, it wasn't worth it. Casting only a quick detect life spell to help her out, the Dunmer girl approached the door alone and gives it a tug, feeling it pull open with a heavy creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinching at the noise, Avoni crept into the tomb and pulled the door shut behind her, crouching down and assuming her sneaking form in the dark, barely-lit hallway. All at once, the musty, damp air of the familial resting place filled her lungs. Although the characteristic thick air of these tombs once made Avoni cough, years of dungeon crawling had so accustomed her to such things that she barely noticed it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, coughing was absolutely out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeping down the stairs, Avoni hugged close to the wall as her little feet slowly carried her downward, making no audible sounds as she descended. The air slowly began to cool as her altitude decreased, slowly traveling down the narrow stairwell towards the tight turn in the corridor up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the bottom of the stairs, Avoni stopped for a moment. In front of her was sharp turn, beyond the corner of which she couldn't see. Judging by feeling her detect life spell was giving her, Avoni could tell that there was a small chamber just around the bend, with something standing there, unmoving. However, she couldn't tell what it was. Clutching her dagger in hand, and preparing herself for a sneak attack, Avoni slowly leaned in to the corner and peeked...</span></div></div>",

Standing at eight feet tall, the massive, bipedal reptilian creature was strapped with muscle and covered in dull scales. Huge yellowed teeth poked out of its massive, alligator-like jaws, and its eyes shifted back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither the powerful creature had sensed her before she had seen it, or it had just so happened to be looking her way when she poked around the corner, but the creature had noticed her. This was, of course, very bad for Avoni, whose eyes widened when she saw the monster's eyes narrow, as it began to walk toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly powering up a spell, Avoni fired at the Daedra who, due to its size, took the blast head on. The Daedroth recovered quickly enough, however, and charged at Avoni, letting out a roar. The dunmer girl dodged its attacks and pulled out her dagger, just quick enough to escape its clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even though the Daedroth was hulking enough to hit once, it was far from slow. Before Avoni could regain her stance, the creature fired off a magical attack, hitting her and sending her flying. Avoni yelped as she flew backwards and hit the wall, having forgotten about the magical capabilities all Daedra had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering with pain, Avoni swung her dagger at the advancing beast, only to have it swipe the weapon out of her hand with one powerful claw. A moment later, the Dunmer's entire world was upside down as the Daedroth grabbed her and hoisted her up by her legs. Avoni screamed as she wiggled about, helpless in the creature's grip as it sniffed her, mouth watering...</span></div></div>",

There weren't many advantages to summoning an ancestor ghost - they couldn't do much besides fight and occasionally provide guidance, and the summons didn't last long. Still, they were great to use in a pinch, and didn't require a share of the loot - a factor that made them very attractive options to adventurers like herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light surrounds Avoni as she waves her hand, magicka flowing from her fingertips as she invokes her greater power, forming little clouds of light and a whoosh of magical sound. Moments later, the light clears, revealing a ghostly, translucent Dunmer female. She glowed a slight greenish color, and her legs seemed to be absent in favor of a ghostly tendril, allowing her to hover just above the ground. Her torso was scantily clad but nonetheless athletic looking, and her young-looking face did nothing to betray the history or age of the long-dead woman, aside from her antiquated hairstyle and chitin piercings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avoni!\" The ghost yelled, frowning as she turned to the wide-eyed Dunmer girl. \"What are you doing?! I was enjoying a peaceful rest. Why did you summon me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... s-sorry, Lilethys...\" Avoni stammered, apologetically. \"But I'm going into this dungeon and I need help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help? Come on...\" the ghost named Lilethys whined. \"You always summon me for the most ridiculous things. I will not help you rob another tomb of somebody's ancestors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Avoni cried, instantly becoming distraught. \"Come on... please? It's not OUR ancestors... who cares about these guys! Besides... aren't you supposed to, you know... protect me and stuff? If I go in all alone, I might get...eaten up or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoni shuffles in place as she looks up at her ancestor's ghost, pleading with wide-eyes for her help.</span></div></div>",

Though dimly lit, Avoni is able to make her way down several already looted corridors without trouble.  A number of scarab corpses, already stripped of their inner workings, are testament to the previous adventurers' visit.  A few footprints mark the floor, but their tracks are filled with dust, nobody has visited this place in quite a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Reaching a fork in the tunnel system, Avoni turns left, only to find that pathway blocked by a pile of rubble and fallen metal pipes and beams.  With a shrug, she turns back to the right and continues deeper into the clanking cave.  Ahead there is a large square room, lit dimly(but more brightly than the preceding corridors) by a pit of exposed magma.  A rusted Dwemer workbench stands against a wall, upon it Avoni can see several objects.  Moving closer one is definitely a Dwemer puzzle cube, an interesting nick-knack but worthless in terms of resale value.  On the other end of the bench is a small pile of cut gemstones, rubies, emeralds and even a diamond glitter in the red firelight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Avoni steps up to the bench she feels something on her left boot.  Looking down she sees a puddle of glowing green ectoplasm.  With a disgusted shake she manages to get most of the slime off her boot, but can't help but notice there are several more puddles on the floor around the bench.  Looking at the piled gems, they too appear to have had a handful of the glop poured on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Which item does Avoni grab first?</span></div></div>",

Twisting her head around, Avoni sees a Dwemer spirit, hovering directly behind her!  As it moves to grasp her other arm, Avoni spins in place, facing her attacker.  With only one arm free, she pushes against the spectral being, but feels her hand sinking into the ghost's incorporeal torso like it was thick mud.  Panicking, Avoni yanks her hand back while trying to quickly decide what to do as the spectre looms closer, almost in her face now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Avoni do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Quickly Avoni yanks out her trusty steel weapon.  With a determined slash she cuts the Dwemer ghost across the chest, just below where it connects to its head!  Ectoplasm leaks out, spilling down the entity's torso.  For a moment, the grip on her arm slackens and the ghost seems to deflate, pausing in mid-air.  But in the next instant the bleeding slime is absorbed and the cut disappears.  The loosened grip tightens once more and the ghost advances again.  The attack was useless!  Why had she tried to attack a ghost without a silver weapon?  Cursing, Avoni moved to channel a fireball, but it was now too late.  The Dwemer grasped her free hand and hovered its face above her own.  \"Mine.\"  It spoke, in a determined and triumphant tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressed up against the workbench and unable to move, Avoni wriggled in place as the Dwemer ghost opened its maw wide and slid down over her head.  The room, which had been a dark shade of red, shifted to a sickly green.  Avoni could see through the ectoplasmic 'flesh' of her attacker, but only in the direction her face was pointed, Avoni was stiffly held in place by the being's pseudo muscles.  It felt like she was being consumed by a giant spoiled fortify fatigue potion, a nauseating stench and disgusting cloying assaulted her sense.  The slimy throat slid over her shoulders, binding her arms to her sides.  As more of her slid inside the ghost's malleable body, she was bowed forward, almost at a right angle at her hips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ghost struggled to pull more of the lithe Dunmer woman inside itself, Avoni was lifted an inch off the metal flooring and held hovering in the air.  In the next movement, she was pushed and pulled forward, spinning and tumbling around the axis of her hips.  With physics as her enemy, Avoni was crumpled mercilessly into the stomach of the creature, unable to brace herself against the sticky, glutinous skin.  Upside down now Avoni felt her torso and legs pressing down on her as they were shoved into the cramped but elastic stomach. Sensing victory, the Dwemer took a few last swallows, forcing her bare, smooth, dark-skinned legs down into the belly with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a contented burp, the Dwemer ghost patted its now round belly, gazing fondly at the Dunmer maiden floating helplessly within.  \"Mine.\"  It said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pressed at the yielding but unbreakable walls of slime, Avoni could feel her bare skin and her clothing begin to break down.  It wasn't the bite of acid, but just an unmaking of her body and organic items.  Lifting a hand in front of her face, she watched as it turned to goop, fingers turning translucent then losing cohesion, sloughing off herself and congealing in a growing puddle around her.  She could feel it all over, not pain, just the loss of extremities.  She couldn't wiggle her toes anymore, because they did not exist.  Her legs and arms followed and she became a torso and head hanging in a bolus of green ectoplasm, her own green ectoplasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the ooze creep between her pursed lips and fill her mouth.  Moments later, she lost consciousness as her unique form collapsed.  Where minutes before a daring Dunmer adventurer had stood, now only a sack of bubbling green goo hung in space.  Sensing his meal was finished processing, the ghost released its bowels, such as they were.  A pile of Avoni ectoplasm plummeted the four feet to the floor, splattering on contact.  A small ring of alteration magic, four weak potion bottles and her steel dagger clattered among the remains.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating closer to the floor, the Dwemer swept the dagger and potions into the magma pit, before lifting the small ring with its ghostly hands.  \"Mine.\"  It spoke again, pleased.  Placing the shiny, though sticky, ring next to the piled jewels on the bench; the ghost faded from sight, happily haunting its cache of treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was left of Avoni quietly dribbled into the cracks in the floor, before settling in place, surrounded by the puddled remains of the many other hapless adventurers too stupid to use magic or silver weapons against ghosts.</span></div></div>",

Now able to concentrate completely on casting, Avoni casts another fire sphere and then another.  The plasma balls impact on the Dwemer ghost, ripping it to pieces, shreds of ectoplasm falling to the floor.  Taking a deep breath, Avoni collects herself, grateful to have survived an encounter she was not prepared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming so close to being beaten in her first fight, Avoni decided discretion was the better part of valor.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though the Vvardenfell Guild of Mages was a much more westernized institution compared to the majority of the land's other factions, it was still a powerful organization, with branches in several major cities across the island. Of these, the Ald-Ruhn branch was probably the most opulent and large, not because it was particularly better than any of the others, but moreso just because of its location - the building was simply one of many spacious accommodations in the seat of House Redoran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a budding magic user, Avoni was excited to be a part of the Guild, simply because of the opportunity it offered her. Although she was merely an associate, the lowest rank possible, she was still able to use some of the Guild's services, although, like everybody else, she hoped to increase her rank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the Guild in the early morning, Avoni quickly sought out the local head of the Guild - a Breton woman named Edwinna Elbert - and, finding her organizing old books about the Dwemer, managed to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... good morning, Miss Elbert...\" the elf began, shuffling in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want? I'm kind of... oh\" Edwinna began, cutting herself off when she saw the young elf's face. \"I'm sorry, what was your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avoni, Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right... I promised you a job, didn't I?\" Edwinna sighed, and began to think while Avoni waited, a smile on her face. \"Uhh... Okay, I've got it.\"</span></div></div>",

It's your capital after all, seat of the King among other things.\" Elbert started, speaking a little arrogantly as she did so \"I've heard tell of an intriguing fellow in the city who has started work on a Robot Arena as it's called. In truth it's basically just salvaged and no doubt hastily put together Dwemer technology, but I know of very few people who can work such things. Therefore I want you....Avoni, to find him and pen notes. See what he's done, see what you can learn and report back to me. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dunmer girl suffice to say wasn't perhaps as ecstatic as she was walking in. She expected a bit more exciting work, perhaps field experience in learning and casting better magic! Being nothing more than an informant or akin to a journalist wasn't really engaging work and she thought Edwinna could have just got somebody outside of the Guild to do it. On the other hand she was of the lowest rank so doing lowly work was something to be expected, and getting in the good graces of a high ranking member would surely benefit in the long-term!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully Edwinna just wanted the girl out of her hair so she could continue with her work. She already knew everything she needed about the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some hastily given instructions and a dismissive wave, Avoni was sent on her way to Ebonheart. Ebonheart was a predominantly Imperial settlement on Vvardenfell and it showed in the architecture. For all intents and purposes, she could have fooled herself into thinking she was in the Imperial heartland rather than on the frontier! Especially with the multitude of foreign faces around. But she had a job to do and there wasn't much to sight-see anyways! As travel between Vvardenfell and the Mainland was forbidden under conventional means due to the quarantine, she had to see a Mages Guild associate named Asciene Rane who provided teleportation. After a brief exchange and a flash of light, Avoni found herself in entirely different surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one?\" a gruff voiced sounded behind the young Elven girl, making her turn around in shock to find a heavily armoured man stood before her. His armour was red and shiny, clearly well kept and clean with a V-slit view in the helm and a chainmail skirt around the bottom of the breastplate. \"You look confused, don't you know where you are? This is the Royal Palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah the Palace, so this is Mournhold?\" Avoni stammered in reply, looking around at her surroundings. She seemed to be in an atrium of sorts and the walls and decorations did seem very regal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so. I guess I should be the first to greet you. Welcome to Mournhold, city of light, city of magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to many house guards and certainly Ordinators of Vvardenfell, the guard seemed to be relatively amiable and friendly, even providing instructions on places to visit. Mournhold is a large city and easy to get lost in he said, and like any large city it had its places to visit...and places to avoid. Finding the robot arena wouldn't be easy but maybe information could be gathered while exploring. Mournhold is also known as Almalexia, and is the seat of the Goddess of the same name. A visit to her temple could be worthwhile! On the other hand it's been awhile since flexing those muscles, and the sewers are renown for being vast and full of treasure the deeper you go. The city guard may pay for clearing them out too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices...choices...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm baby food, instead...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the cliff racer chick waddles to the side of the nest and leans back, resting its bloated stomach as it churns and gurgles away.

As she slowly melts away inside of the baby cliff racer, Avoni's last thoughts are to her failed mission, remembering the stack of potions she was supposed to deliver. Having spilled them all in the mother cliff racer's belly, all traces of them are long gone - either pumping through her intestines or long since washed out into her bladder. As for Avoni, all traces of her are soon to be gone as well, a fact she recognizes with sickening dread as she slowly loses consciousness. Soon, all that will be left of the Dunmer girl would be found corroded away in a pile of cliff racer poop - and a bit of her lost power pumping through its veins.</span></div></div>",

I wasn't always a bandit for one. I was born near the border between Morrowind and the region of Argonia. Don't remember my parents that well, because early in my childhood I was smuggled across the border; and I'm sure you're aware of what tends to happen to Argonians in Morrowind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't exactly hard to guess, the Morrowind aristocracy had been practicing slavery for centuries and there was always a market for fresh Argonians as new slaves. The practice had been slowly dying out as of late, but the scars were still fresh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcid Rain continued after a moment. \"After around... I dunno, a decade or so, I managed to dive into a river when my master wasn't looking. I drifted with the flow for... a long time, and eventually I bumped into a group of a few other run-aways. Mostly we just go around making trouble for Dark Elves like yourself, and freeing slaves if we get the chance. Of course, we do a good amount of more classical banditry as you noticed.\" She sighs a bit. \"It's a dangerous life though. I'm the only one left of the original group, and there aren't any who really care about my ideals left among us; which is why I don't really care about these louts much.\" She smacks her gut for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoni isn't really sure what all to think about this. On the one hand, Acid Rain had every right to be angry at Morrowind for what they did for her, but even then, it was pretty clear that this path wasn't the right one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was born far-away, as well...\" the Dunmer trailed off, before sighing. As her nerves started to calm, she continued the story, her voice taking on a more solemn and retrospective tone: \"Well, actually, that's not really true. I was born in an Ashlander Camp. My mother was an Urshilaku Ashlander. Her name was Brevosi... and, well, I never knew my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoni sighed. Although the story of her childhood wasn't one of particular emotional baggage, she in general found it hard to open up about her past, a story that she was now telling only in fear that it might somehow save her life. \"You see,\" she continued, \"Life in the Ashlander camp was tough, especially for my single mother. Mother never spoke of other family, so if I had any, I wouldn't know about it. To this day, all I have is my family name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... what a tragic story...\" Acid-Rain cooed, tracing a few fingers over her quietly rumbling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this was all when I was very young, so...\" Avoni cleared her throat, and continued. \"Anyway, I barely remember the Urshilaku at all, because my mother left for Ald-Ruhn at a young age to try and find work with the Redoran. When she couldn't get any, she left... but left me behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor elf...\" the Argonian chimed in, again. \"So, what led you to becoming an adventurer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Avoni continued, \"The Redoran took me in, as an orphan. Looking back, I was pretty lucky that I wasn't just left out to starve, even if they only did it out of a sense of duty. When I became old enough, I started working for them, and then the Mages' Guild, as well. So, that's how I became a rogue... er, an Adventurer, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an exceptional story, even for one as young as you!\" Acid-Rain began again, \"Truly, you and I are the same kind of free spirit, unbound to any such Earthly responsibility.\" As the Argonian talked, a smile spread across her face as she reached down to rub her still-bloated but much smaller stomach. \"Alright then, thank you for sharing that with me, Avoni.

I'd even give you the honor of having a more... enjoyable end than most of my meals get; if you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoni blushed slightly, the expression Acid-Rain was giving her was a mixture of hunger and seemingly arousal, giving her a feeling that the bandit wasn't kidding about the \"enjoyment\" part.

If you look you're going to run, the boys will shoot you dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours of awkward introductions and some unwanted flirting, Avoni found herself back inside Acid-Rain's tent, the Argonian having removed most of her armor and weaponry for the night. \"Ah, I see introductions went alright.

Licking the saliva away from her teeth, Acid-Rain grinned, and continued, \"time for my <i>meal</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracing a clawed finger around her green stomach scales, the hungry Argonian walked over to Avoni and yanked her away from her bandit comrades. Weakened and petrified, Avoni stood frozen with fear as Acid-Rain towered over her. \"Mmm...\" the Argonian cooed, rubbing a hand on her toned, scaly belly, which gave its own little rumble. \"Let's get its clothes off, quickly!\" Avoni yelped and struggled as the other two Argonians rushed her, yanking her cloak off and pulling it aside without a single tear. They pulled her leather bra off with a quick tug, the helpless Dunmer giving a whine as her breasts fell free. Finally, the two more powerful bandits lifted her up and pulled off her panties, leaving Avoni stark naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the nude Dunmer in her arms, Acid-Rain licked her lips at the touch of Avoni's bare skin. \"Ohh, they always look so tasty when they're peeled...\" she murred, before lifting Avoni up so that the two were eye-to-eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!\" Avoni whimpered, her eyes wide as she struggled to break free of Acid-Rain's grip. \"D-Don't eat me, please! I'll... I'll do anything for you, please!\" the Dunmer stammered, her eyes wide with fear as she looked into the Argonian's face. \"I'm not food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, but it is just food to me, now...\" the Argonian giggled, dragging her tongue across her scaly lips. \"And besides, anything is food once it's churning away inside of one's stomach. Ahh~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Acid-Rain opened her mouth wide, giving Avoni a view into her fleshy maw, dripping with saliva and lined with sharp teeth. Avoni's scream was cut short as, another moment later, she was forced headfirst into that hungry mouth and sloppily devoured whole by the hungry, voracious Argonian. The other bandits watched on as Acid-Rain forced down her meal, chomping down on her flailing, naked body and throwing her head back to let the meal slide back into her throat.<br>\r\n<b><i><br>\r\n*CHOMP* *GLUUUURK* *GUUUULLLP*</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other bandits watched as Avoni's flailing limbs disappeared past Acid-Rain's salivating jaws, and as a large, squirming bulge slowly began to descend from her throat and down into her body. The others watched as the massive bulge that was Acid-Rain's living, breathing prey slowly slid down her throat and into her body, coming to rest in her lower gut as it distended her belly with its squirming form. With one last *gulp,* Acid-Rain swallowed the last of the Dunmer's naked body down her throat, and felt it land with a satisfying plop inside of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh~\" *BRAAAAAP!* \"...mmm, what a satisfying meal...\" the Argonian commented between belches, giving her distended, squirming lower belly a slap, her living meal trapped inside, at the mercy of her belly and its digestive processes...</span></div></div>",

The fleshy stomach walls ground against her ever so gently, coating her nude body in a mixture of viscous fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Avoni began, \"E-Excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" Acid-Rain quickly replied. \"One's food isn't supposed to talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Avoni quickly shut up.

A million thoughts flooded her at once as she tried to grasp her situation. Currently, she knew she was being sent on a mission to infiltrate some necromancers in a cave, to gain information on their numbers and report back to the Mages' Guild without being caught. It must have been a bit above her level, however, because the last thing she remembered was being hit by a powerful damage fatigue spell, causing her to pass out on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, awakening, she found herself deep in the caves, in a round chamber, naked and tied to an altar, her arms and legs bound and her mouth gagged. All around her, torches burned, and a gang of a dozen hooded figures stood in a circle with her in the center - the necromancers, she presumed. Beginning to panic, the nude Dunmer girl began to struggle as she tried to yell out, but her words could only come out in a muffled \"mmmmf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her eyes shot forward as one of the figures approached her - a tall Altmer woman with pronounced features. Unlike the others, she wore nothing but a cape and what appeared to be a black thong, baring her round, full breasts in full view, and leaving little of her curvaceous thighs to the imagination. Although she appeared to be rather young, Avoni deduced that this was probably the necromancers' leader. Then, she spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... what a ripe, young specimen...\" the necromancer woman cooed in a deep, sultry voice. \"My name is Mirie, not that that matters to you, Dunmer. The guild sent you here, alone? How foolish of them... I don't know what they were expecting, but you're ours now...\" she trailed off, giving a chuckle and causing Avoni's eyes to widen with fear. \"...Or, should I say, <i>mine</i> now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Altmer woman reached forward and squeezed Avoni's bare body with her warm fingers, causing the bound girl to yelp in surprise. Then, she reached down and cupped her petite tits, squeezing them before pinching her dark, pert nipples. Tracing her hand down the helpless Dunmer's body as she began to sweat, she cupped it against her inner thigh, reaching around to squeeze her ass before sliding it up her slit, pulling back slowly as Avoni winced and shut her eyes tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you will do quite nicely...\" Mirie continued, grinning devilishly.</span></div></div>",

Outside, a purple light is clearly visible emanating from inside of the necromancer's throat even as she snaps her mouth shut, tilting her head upward and tracing her fingers slowly down her throat, between her breasts and cupping her belly, the purple light spreading out to fill her torso, still dimly visible from through the skin of her flat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... I love this technique...\" the Altmer cooed, rubbing her hands against her bared breasts and belly as she feels the disembodied soul of Avoni settle in her stomach. \"I just soul trapped you while leaving your body intact... and, instead of a soul gem, I absorbed your power directly into my body.\" The Altmer necromancer began to laugh, cupping her belly as Avoni's lifeless zombie body lay bound on the table. \"You may have the sensation of being devoured alive, but don't worry... that sensation is only temporary, until I absorb you into me completely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the Altmer's gurgling stomach, Avoni has the sensation of being curled up inside of the fleshy sack as her soul stews inside. \"Wh-What's happening to me?\" she cried out, only to find that instead of audible words, her speech only came out as echoing thoughts.</span></div></div>",

Massive portals to \"The Deadlands\", a fiery, hellish plane of Oblivion controlled by the Daedra Lord Mehrunes Dagon, are open all around the countryside, allowing demons to seemingly just walk right into broad daylight and cause trouble for the good people of the empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the Khajiit Skasha was just one of many who found their lives all but unaffected by the so-called \"crisis\". In no quick hurry to join the Imperial Legion to fight off the advancing Daedra, Skasha instead competed in the Imperial City Arena for fun and money when she had free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, first and foremost, Skasha was a Dark Brotherhood assassin - a member of the secret society dedicated to the worship of Sithis, the primordial god of chaos and death. Serving the society as a mid-ranking member, Skasha carries out assassinations with her own particular style: After defeating enemies through a combination of stealth and skill with daggers and thrown weapons, the Khajiit has the power to, if she so chooses to, devour them whole and absorb their power - an arcane combination of necromancy and mysticism that she obtained while studying the dark arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkasha is a Khajiit with the power to swallow whole and digest people up to the same size as her. However, this power is useless on the various demons of the world who eclipse her in size, and, should she become careless, she could just as easily become a meal for something much scarier than her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is another day for an assassin in Cyrodiil. What is Skasha doing today?</span></div></div>",

Only, for her, her hunger was much deeper, and filling her stomach just felt that much greater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the ecstatic feeling, eating and digesting prey allowed Skasha to absorb their powers and add to her own.

Please don't eat me...\" Little bulges continued to appear on the stomach in response, as the girl continued to push outward from inside of Skasha's stomach, unable to accept her new role as the Khajiit's food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkasha rolls her eyes as she pats her furry belly, feeling it squeeze and knead on her prey, filling the Khajiit with a sadistic satisfaction. \"But girl, I already ate you.

It wasn't just because of her position as an hot-headed Stormcloak, nor was it solely due to her skill with a broadsword and a set of armor, a skill that made her fearsome in her own right. It wasn't even her appearance as a slim but toned, fair-skinned nord with naturally straight blonde hair, piercing blue eyes, buxom chest, and a tight, round ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough all of these things certainly made Lorana a very popular person, there was one other thing: Lorana was the illegitimate daughter of a Greybeard monk, a fact that was a poorly-kept secret among her friends and comrades at Windhelm. Although the need for secrecy kept her from visiting her father very often, the old monk couldn't stop himself from teaching her a thing or two every time she made the pilgrimage to see him, just for the sake of wanting to keep his only daughter safe and properly equipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of this relationship, Lorana was not only a nord warrior, a beauty, and a force to be reckoned with, but she could also - to some extent - use dragon shouts to aid her in battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, what is the nord girl doing today?</span></div></div>",

Her father had a peculiar way of contacting his daughter: instead of the tremendous, rumbling summons that greybeards typically used, echoing across the lands for all to hear (or, Talos forbid, writing an actual letter), Lorana's dad could whisper a single word into someone's ear from miles away, simply provided he knew where they were. It was a magnificent trick, and one that even put the hard-headed Nord girl in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, once again, Lorana found herself making the pilgrimage up the seven thousand steps to High Hrothgar. It was a trip she had made a few times before, and had gotten quite good at. So, she arrived atop Throat of the World without much effort just on the edge of Twilight, as the snow began to fall once again. Coming up on the Greybeard's monastery, she did not stop to offer tributes as most pilgrims did, but rather marched right up the steps towards an old, hooded figure, who stood waiting for her. \"Hey, Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lorana...\" the old man grumbled, quickly embracing his daughter before continuing, \"Quickly, hurry inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ ~ ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the dark halls of High Hrothgar, Lorana and her father - the old Greybeard named Valund - sat talking, catching up on past events since her last visit the previous year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very happy to see you well, Lorana...\" Valund continued, \"and I know the Civil War has escalated, and the Dovah have become more aggressive...

Anybody around knew better than to steal from the Dragonborn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a wonderful horse, with glowing white hair and main, as well as strong enough to fend off a bear. No one else had managed to tame the mare until Lorana had forced her to submit after twelve straight hours of bucking, and she remains the only person able to ride her. Mil seemed a loyal horse, as she never ran away when Lorana stepped off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finds Wilhelm, the local innkeeper, feeding Mil her feed and petting her head. A thought comes through her mind to try the shout now and scare him...but he always takes such good care of her horse she decides against it. Lorana walks up to the Mil's other side and stroke her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Wilhelm! Any problems you need help with?\" she asks with a dazzling smile. He couldn't help but smile back before preparing the saddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Jarl has placed a bounty on a local giant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BORING!\" she yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unusual, you usually love killing giants.\" He finished securing the saddle and a second later Lorana was up on top and ready to go. She tossed a few coins to the innkeeper and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I've found something much more interesting for now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why hunt giants when everything can be giant!</i> She thought. With that, she had Mil sprint out of the town towards the distant woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of riding, Lorana had found a decent location. Even she realized that trying to shrink among people would be dangerous. Her amazing power and accomplishments had earned her a good number of enemies and rivals. It would be best to test it out in the wilderness, where only weak animals could attack. She was confident that she could use her strength to kill them even at an inch tall. Or Mil could protect her and help her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what was it her father told her about the shout? Something about how long she would remain tiny. Well, it didn't really matter.

From what she remembered, by saying only two of the words she shouldn't be stuck like this forever.

She moved away from her worldly possessions and trekked deeper into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalked through the shrubbery proved to be a bit difficult however. Being an inch in height made her unable to go over the plants, and directly in line with their roots. She didn't mind though. It was beautiful inside the green life. Everything that had seemed so insignificant to her before had become greater than herself. She could see the veins in all the leaves. She could see every ridge on the outside of a plants bark. She could see the roaring campfire in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, campfire? Walking closer, she could clearly make out a campsite in a nearby clearing.<i> Funny, I didn't notice that before...</i> she thought. She ran up to get a closer look. There was only a single tent, leading her to believe that it was a solo camp. However, upon closer inspection she found two bedrolls next to each other along with two satchels. It was a pair, likely romantically together based on the ruffled form of the bedrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana walked up to a discarded boot and compared herself to it. It was much larger than herself, but it also seemed much bigger than an average boot. Not liking the smell seeping from the cloth shoe, she starts to walk away for something else to catch her interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>SWISH!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly doing a back roll, an arrow made of pure ebony landed directly where she was standing. Her battle mentality took over and she quickly sprinted in zigzags away from the archer. The arrows continued to rain down upon her, every second another one landed where she had previously been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit, it must have been a master. Just as she approached the bushes, another arrow landed directly in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?! Another one?!\" she exclaimed. In a flash, a hail of arrows made a perfect circle around her. Hearing the sound of a bow being pulled back, Lorana realized this could be the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold fire! Hold fire, love!\" a feminine voice rang out. Looking over Lorana witnessed a Redguard woman jump out of a nearby tree and land perfectly silent on the ground. The giant woman was upon Lorana in an instant with only a few large strides. Her dark hair cascaded down her back and her golden brown eyes gazed with a concerned look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it's a tiny person, not a mouse...\" she said, clearly shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, even better\" said a deeper, yet still feminine voice.

The low shrubbery became large thickets. As the ground came closer and closer she began to notice that her clothes and equipment wasn't shrinking with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, she was standing on a pile of leather armor. Her broadsword lay harmlessly in its sheathe behind her. The naked girl was a little relieved she had shrunk out here so that no one could see her bare form. That was only for her future partner eyes. Not realizing the danger she had just placed herself in, Lorana was awestruck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing! Everything seems so large!\" she exclaimed. She stepped out of her pile and placed her bare feet on the dirt below. She was so small that even the grass was her height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she heard it. A small growl from the bushes. Her warrior's instincts took over and she dove back into her clothes. Looking back she was shocked to see that a enormous skeever had just lunged at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal skeever is fairly common in Skyrim. The giant rat creatures were about the size of dogs. A large group of them could be dangerous, but a lone skeever is hardly worth an arrow. Lorana had recently tested her abilities by seeing how many punches it would take to kill one. THe answer was one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that she was tiny, she felt more scared of this beast than the first time she fought a dragon. The beast locked eyes with her again and lunged towards her hiding place! Lorana panicked and tried shielding herself with her arms and closing her eyes. She felt an impact...and then nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes to see a long pink tongue, black gums, and a gaping throat. Above her she saw yellow teeth had punctured her armor, but the rat's weak jaws couldn't bend the leather! Her bravado began to resurface as she stood and walked over to the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Serves you right you disease ridden rodent!\" she exclaimed. \"Do you believe you could make a meal out of me?! Watch, I'll even help you!\" She boldly stepped forward, placing her bare feet directly onto the skeever's tongue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm muscle felt oddly pleasant against her skin, far nicer than any bedroll she had spent a night on. However it was rather difficult to keep her balance on the shifting floor. The smell inside was pretty terrible, but she quickly adjusted. The skeever was making some hissing noises, it was likely trying to get loose to swallow her. A lot more saliva was being produced around her, the beast clearly enjoying her flavor. She rubbed her feet across the tongue, teasing the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few more steps forward, she came before the gaping hole of the throat. Gazing down the esophagus, light poured in to give her a partial view of the fleshy tunnel. The end of her vision was a bend leading to its stomach. For a second, an odd sense of longing came over Lorana. She wanted to go down this beast's throat, into its belly. Would she survive inside? Or would she end up as nutrition for some low level rodent? But her mind brushed it off as curiosity and she continued her torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I bet you would love for me to go down there, huh? To slide down your throat and become just another piece of meat? Well guess what? I've eaten plenty of skeevers in my travels, and I've killed them with just THIS!\" She cocked back her arm and threw her fist into the soft flesh in the back of the throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana had expected the skeever to at least yelp in pain. Instead, it felt a chance and raised its tongue, trying to swallow her! As she fell towards the tube, Lorana finally realized how dangerous being tiny was. Allowing her instincts to take over again, she swung her body around and latched onto a jagged tooth as the rest of her body fell into the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the throat muscles gripped her legs and pulled like a group of horses were tied to them. She tightened her grip and pulled as hard as she could just to keep from being pulled down. Looking out, she saw that the skeever almost had its teeth out of her armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. All of her adventures would come to an end inside a skeever of all things. Once it was free, it would easily swallow her. Also, however strong she was at normal size at an inch tall her limit was keeping the throat muscles at bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! She was not going to die in some rat! Her ancestors would laugh at her centuries! She would never enter Sovengarde! Taking a deep breath, she shouted in the ancient dragon tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WULD, NAH, KEST!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the whirlwind sprint shot her forward back into her armor. Her heart was racing at an incredible rate. Her confidence nearly got her killed! Just because she could kill animals at her normal height doesn't mean that she could while shrunk. If she had a sword at her size, it would be different. But unarmed, she could do nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she began regain her calm, she heard the sound of teeth pulling out. Looking back, the skeever was pissed. Her little tease had only made it hungrier. It began to squirm its way into the armor towards Lorana!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to her feet, she sprints out of the sleeve and back into the open. As the rodent struggles to escape, she sprints towards the sound of a stream. Since Mil wasn't around to kill the skeever, she must have went to get a drink. If she could make it to her, no other predator could come after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pushes her way through some shrubbery, she hears the rat breaking free and coming after her. Gathering up all her strength, Lorana sprints as hard as she can before bursting out and hitting the water. The small stream from earlier was gone, replaced with a rushing river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the important part. The important part was that she couldn't stop herself from running directly into...</span></div></div>",

Pain washed over her front as she fell back onto her butt and stared up at the monolith before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking far into the sky, she could make out the outline of her trusted horse, Mil! Taking a breath of relief, she wrapped her arms around her hoof tightly out of the sheer joy of being free from the monstrous skeever. Giving her a good squeeze, she realized that the mare still had no idea she was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few steps back she realized that she was just below the horse's ass, her shiny tail swishing lazily above her. Also her belly was heavily swelled and shifting. A roar from the inside deduced that she had recently consumed an entire bear! That was new...Moving back over to the hoof, she began to pound on it and yell at her animal companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mil! Look down here girl! It's me!\" she hollered. Her ears perked up and she lifted her mouth out of the water to look for the voice of her master. After a few more seconds of pounding, she looked down to find her tiny master lightly tapping her hoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana waved her arms while smiling at her companion for taking notice of her. But something was off. The look passing through her eyes wasn't the usual look of respect. She appeared confused at why a tiny insect looked and sounded like her master. A quick lick across her equestrian lips made Lorana shiver again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she doesn't recognize her? Or worse, that she does recognize her but simply doesn't care. While she had conquered the horse into submission and made her a trusted steed. But she had never shown the rebellious animal weakness before. The only reason she was able to ride her was simply because she had proven to be the more powerful one. Even when she slept Mil had been tied up out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Lorana was vulnerable, would the carnivorous equestrian consume her like she did the bear? Or would she hold loyalty to her kind master? Neither question was answered at the moment due to a familiar hissing coming from the bushes behind Lorana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nord jumped back into the water while Mil turned to face the intruder. Soon enough, the gray rat comes into view. Saliva was coming out of its snout as it stared at the pair. Mil let out a warning snort while stepping forward. However, the skeever would not back down as it focused on the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust by seeing them stand off Lorana was scared stiff. This was a fight well above her weight class. Both of these giants began to circle each other, trying to get the other to back off. She sat back and watched morbidly as a one-sided fight broke out in front of her. The two predators lunged and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The skeever that had nearly consumed Lorana was the first giant to attack. The huge rat opened its mouth and lunged straight for Mil's head. The shrunken nord gasped as she saw the familiar space inside of its maw. However, the battle was already decided the moment it leaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMil simply opened her mouth as the skeever flew towards her. The terrified rodent could do nothing as it harmlessly flew into her maw. After a quick swallow, the monster that had nearly ended the small warrior's life wiggled down the horse's throat to join the bear inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bulging belly squirmed for a few seconds as the sound of another fight broke out within. A small roar anounced the winner. Apparently the bear inside had also eaten the skeever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the distraction out of the way, Mil turned her attention back to her tiny master at her hooves. Lorana was cowering as the large eyes of her war horse fixed on her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was terrified. Mil was a force to be reckoned with to normal people. At the perspective of an insect, she was more powerful than a god. After witnessing her completely defeat the last threat on her life like it was a mere nuisance, she could do nothing but tremble as her stead stepped towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white equestrian lowered her head down to make eye contact with the tiny blonde. The large, dark spheres held a look that could only be described as annoyed. Her nostrils blew warm air, ruffling her hair, as they smelled her. She had already registered that her rider had somehow become bite-sized and had found her way to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next caused Lorana to shiver in fright. Her intelligent horse parted her lips and quickly scooped her former master into her mouth! Lorana was quickly surrounded in a familiar warm, wet environment. Once Mil had her within her powerful jaws, she stood to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana began to struggle inside of Mil's mouth. She had witnessed the darkness spread over the mouth as the pearly teeth closed before her. The horse's mouth was much softer than the skeever's, her body sinking into the squishy tongue. The heat was also much greater without fresh air circling through, also causing the smell of saliva to be more intense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the back of the throat, she could hear the bear's cries of anger. If Mil decided to swallow, then she would likely be swallowed by the bear as well. Then the skeever. Eaten three times over...such a horrible fate. Her struggling proved fruitless against the soft flesh around her, so she stopped trying. Trying to regain her composure, Lorana decides to try one last effort to save her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mil...Mil it's me, Lorana. Please don't eat me, girl...I've always been so kind to you. I took care of you, kept you fed, and always exercised you. I thought I had been a good master. So please...for the sake of everything we've been through don't swallow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the war horse understood everything, she ignored it. She was incredibly annoyed at her master for putting herself in such great danger again. Her words made no effect on her as she began to do what she had planned on doing since she first discovered the tiny nord. Mil began to...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for her however, her distraction proved the perfect opportunity for a third predator to throw its hat into the ring, Lorana realizing her mistake a moment too late as gaint paws pressed down on her back, pinning her in place.  Lorana shifted uncomfortably as a terribly loud snuffling sound came from directly behind her, craning to spot the beast that had so easily defeated her, only to see a squirrel perched over her body.  While the squirrel investigated its catch, the Skeever was crying its last, however, and the loud reminder of the risk it was in prompted the creature to scoop its prey up and run off to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lorana, the experience was miserable.  In seconds she was scooped off the ground and unceremoniously dumped into the squirrel's mouth, where she found herself shoved into a cheek to be saved for later.  The rocking motion of the squirrel running and climbing soon became almost hypnotic, and, in the cramped and hot space of its mouth, Lorana was finding it hard to stay awake, never mind fight back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as she hit the water, Lorana was taken by the current. Something so weak wouldn't have effected her, even at a mere inch in height. But the exhaustion from consecutively using two shouts, keeping herself from being swallowed, and running for her life left her exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt normal size, this stream would have been knee deep, maybe waist deep in the middle. Unable to fight it, all she could do was float and let the current take her gently down. The freezing cold water was actually relaxing upon her nord skin. She was praying to all nine divines individually to bless her with a miracle. Hearing a familiar hiss, she prayed harder. The skeever was almost upon her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished her prayer to Mara, she was given an answer. She felt her head bump into something soft and she opened her eyes. In an instant she could believe that Dibella herself was before her. A beautiful nord woman was rising high into sky, her head blocking the sun. The only thing on her body was an amulet of Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had pale skin, a lean and muscular form, and long red hair. A few freckles could be seen around her nose. Unlike Lorana, her skin was clear of any unsightly scars. Her breasts were incredibly large, to the point that she must have her armor custom made. After a few more moments of staring, she realized that she had bumped into this woman's thigh. And that she was staring back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what do we have here?\" she asked with a voice as soothing as honeyed milk. A large, soft hand came underneath her and carried her into the sky in front of her face. Her bright green eyes stared at her softly and expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-help me...\" she managed to squeak out. Not just from the exhaustion, she was awestruck. It might have been due to her small perspective, but she really gave off the impression of a goddess. <i>I really need to remember to make a huge donation to Mara the next time I'm in Riften</i> she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you? With what?\" as she said this, a loud hiss was heard as the skeever leaped out of the bushes towards the hand Lorana was on! In an instant, the stranger's eyes shifted from kind and soft to hard and ruthless. With her free hand, she grabbed the rodent by the neck and plunged it under the water. She held it under until the bubbles stopped coming to the surface and the struggles had ceased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threat to Lorana's life was killed that easily. The woman continued to throw the corpse to shore and turned her attention back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that the help you needed?\" Lorana could only nod. This was the first time she was ever awestruck. She had encountered many attractive men and women in her travels, but she was always the one that overwhelmed the other person. However, this seemed to be a woman after her own heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, normally I would kill someone trying to peek on me during my bathing. But seeing as how that skeever was after you, I'll let it go.\" She gave a dazzling smile and reached a finger tip towards Lorana. \"I'm Alda Iron-Hide.\" Lorana shook the finger and began to introduce herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlda was listening intently to Lorana speak. So she was the dragonborn... She explained her situation about learning the new shout and carelessly using it without any precautions. While Alda was listening, she was also eyeing up the tiny nord. She appeared to be only a few years younger than herself, and was stunning. The blonde was clearly looking at her too. She had spent years wearing the amulet trying to find someone suitable. Perhaps given time, they could become close enough to make it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good hour of talking, they both felt a mutual attraction to each other. They were both warriors, they were both fearless, and they both loved a good mead. Alda was in the area for business reasons with a merchant that Lorana was friends with. While nords were resistant to the cold, an hour in a running stream had left them cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe its time for me to get moving again, little one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand...but would you mind if I went with you? I don't know how to return to my original size, and I could use some company until I find my friends.\" Alda smiled at the suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a deal my little dear. Although I practically wish you would stay this size, you're just too adorable!\"  Lorana blushed as Alda carried her out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gently placed on a nearby tree stump as she saw the giant woman reach her hanging armor. However, Lorana gasped in surprise as she saw that Alda wore the armor of a...</span></div></div>",

The place was busy as usual, with male and female soldiers bustling about, performing their duties. Running into one of the larger tents, Lorana giggled mischievously to herself as she spied the unsuspecting soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh... this is going to be great!\" She laughed to herself, before hiding behind the tent. Then, when certain that nobody else could see her, she whispered: \"Mal, kopraan... filok!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lorana's entire world collapsed as she shrunk, a gust of wind rushing by as the sensation of falling filled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she regained her senses, Lorana was shocked by a number of sudden realizations. <i>Oh my god... I'm so small!</i> she shouted in her head. The shout had worked! Lorana put her hands up to her face in utter disbelief - she was now a mere inch tall. <i>Wait... was I supposed to use all three words?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last creeping thought was interrupted as Lorana realized that she was naked. Staring down at her own nude body in more disbelief, Lorana realized that she was standing in a pile of her clothes. Goosebumps instantly sprang up all over her body as the chilly air washed over her, her entire body uncovered. Hugging her breasts tight to her chest and feeling her nipples harden, Lorana quickly crept into the warmth of the tent behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as tiny Lorana entered the tent, she instantly realized how vulnerable she was. Hiding behind the leg of a table, the Nord took a moment to assess the situation. <i>Crap...</i> she thought to herself, <i>I should have thought this through better... What am I gonna do now?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While still worried, Lorana got some naughty thoughts. At her small size, she could spy on anyone! Also it could also come in handy on scaring some of her friends...or rivals. A list of people came to mind instantly on who she could use this on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, there was her close friend Natlia. She was there with Lorana during the attack on Helgen and they managed to escape together. She was a head taller than Lorana with a similar build. Her long brown hair complimented her green eyes. Despite her warrior constitution, she was incredibly shy and meek. A complete sheep in wolf's clothing. She was an adept archer, but her true skill was found wielding just a sword. A shield only served to slow her swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying jokes on her was common between the two. Natlia always had to check her bedroll for insects or tear apart her meals to check for taurus eggs. While she maintained a good sense of humor, there have been times in the past where Lorana took it too far and they would argue for a while. She tried to get revenge every now and then, but her jokes were always terrible. Lorana was usually the one left laughing no mattter who pulled the prank. Finding her friend at an inch tall would scare her so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother option is a bit more risky. A new recruit, Lema, had arrived just a month before and instantly rubbed Lorana the wrong way. The young milk-drinker was nothing but spoiled. Her first day, the other blonde had walked right up to Lorana and demanded that she become her Housecarl. She descended from a noble house, and had only joined the army because her family would have cut her off otherwise. Hearing of Lorana's bravery and battle prowess, the thought to make her a personal bodyguard was instant. Admittedly, it had been a decent offer, but the nord warrior wouldn't have it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter declaring that she would one day have her, Lema began to frequently harass her whenever they were at the same camp. She loved to issue challenges with the bet being that Lorana would serve her if she lost. Every time she won, she only got a few coins. It was incredibly insulting. There must be another reason why she wanted Lorana so badly. At her last defeat she had run away crying. At this small size, she could spy on her and possibly find a weakness to exploit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pondering these options, the owner of the tent returned. Safely out of sight behind a chair leg, she gasped as a Goddess like being pushed her way into the tent. It was Captain Myr Back-Breaker, renowned for her skills with a hammer. Myr was an older woman, possibly a decade older than Lorana. Her short blond hair fit perfectly with her challenging brown eyes. While she was more mature, she was still quite a beauty. She had sworn to never settle down until the Stormcloaks won and Ulfric was High King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back to the present, the Captain took a knee and examined Lorana's armor on the floor. She pulled a glove off her hand and felt along it.<br>\r\n\"I swear to Talos if I find another naked soldier in my bed, I'll crush your grapes under my boot!\" she yelled out. Lorana quivered as she saw the woman pull her blanket off to an empty bed. Seemingly satisfied, she kicked the loose armor out of her tent and mumbled about how she hated jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came next dropped Lorana's knees turn to jelly and her jaw drop. The stone hard captain started off by simply taking off her boots and outer armor. But after placing it on the nearby mannequin, she began to remove all her clothing. The tiny nord watched as her superior officer peeled off her leggings and underclothes. Once she was completely nude, she blew out her candles letting darkness come over them.  The sound of rubbing cloth signaled that she was going to sleep. Lorana struggled to get the image of her nude superior's body out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she realized another choice was laid out before her. Instead of trekking out into the cold to find someone else's tent, she could just stay inside here. She could just climb Myr's bed and have 'fun.' However, if she got caught there would be a chance less than zero that she would ever be heard from again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As strong as her lust was, even the thick headed nord could tell that it would be suicide to sneak into the same bed as her Captain. Natlia could be a good option though. It would be too easy to scare her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out! Out of my way! I heard Lorana was back, where is she! Anyone who hides her from me will stew in my gut for a week!\" a familiar voice called out. With a heavy sigh, she realized the Lema had caught wind that she was back. The stubborn brat would be looking for her, it would be pointless to go to see her friend. Natlia couldn't keep a secret if her life was at stake, and having Lema find her shrunken wasn't on her agenda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the entrance to the tent suddenly flew open when another enormous being strode inside. The familiar sight of the blonde mage filled her entire vision. She was wearing the standard Stormcloak mage cloak (in appearance only though, she had it enchanted to the max) and leather boots. The cloth was baggy against her skinny frame. Unlike most nords, she had chosen the path of the arcane compared to the art of combat. A solid gold circlet embroidered with emeralds helped amplify her healing magic, the only school she is amazing in. Her brown eyes looked around the Captain's room with a condescending air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?!\" she cried out before ripping the blanket off the bed. It would be far too gruesome to go into details, but the summary includes all the furniture inside the tent breaking as Lema ran around to avoid the angry force of nature. When the table that Lorana was hiding behind was broken, she decided the best thing to do was latch onto the brim of the fur boot. Lema fled from the berserk warrior through the snow and into her own tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were out of the cold, Lorana dropped off her ride and quickly hid behind a chair. Lema was the only one in camp with a nicer tent than the commanding officer. It was the size of conference tent and filled with luscious accessories. Every seat had a cushion soft enough to be considered a cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking milk-drinker...\" she muttered, a bit of jealousy mixing in. She watched as the spoiled sorceress sat in front of a table, catching her breath. In the center sat a piece of paper and an inkwell with the pen in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps this was for the best, I would have made a fool of myself if I forgot the letter...again...\" she muttered under her breath. Lorana gave a sigh of annoyance listening to the giantess. Another letter of challenge. It was incredibly annoying that the brat kept handing those out instead of just saying what was on her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the first time they had met. During a particularly warm day, she had been reading a book outside instead of huddling inside a tent for warmth. Right as she was reached the climax, Lema blocked her sunlight. When she glanced back up, the nord had her chest puffed out while pointing at Lorana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Dragonborn! Become mine!\" she exclaimed. After a through beat down, she explained to Lorana that she wanted her as a Housecarl so that she could be shielded during her time in the service. The following day the first challenge was given to her for archery. The warrior easily won. Come to think of it...this would be the 20th challenge in the span of only a month! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted as the mage shot out of her chair and gave her cheeks a light pat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I forgot the envelope! I swore to Talos that this would be my last letter to her. If it's going to be my last, then it has to be perfect!\" she thought out loud. She ran back outside, likely in search of an envelope. Curiosity began to sink in as Lorana gazed back towards the letter. The final challenge? she thought. I wonder why she decided to stop...and what would the final challenge be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the danger left...Lorana scurries out of her hiding place towards the table. Due to her tiny stature, the table top appeared to be miles high while in actuality it would have only reached her waist. Getting up that high should be impossible...if not for a certain shout that carries her with the speed of a tempest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WULD, NAH, KEST!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, she was launched into the air. However, perhaps using all three words was overkill as she went an entire foot higher than the table. Letting out a high pitched scream she fell directly onto the wooden surface. The impact hurt worse than the time she tried jumping off a ledge to get off a mountain faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of recovery, she looked over to the letter sitting nearby. Wondering its contents, she walked over and began to read.<br>\r\nSuch fancy handwriting, as usual...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few sentences in proved it to be a...</span></div></div>",

Normally, running into her like this would be grounds for argument or banter of some kind. However, in this vulnerable state, the tiny Nord instantly realized that things would be very, very bad if she were seen.

Ahaha...\" standing up fully, Merta brought Lorana incredibly close to her face, before giggling uncontrollably. Taking a deep breath, she continued: \"Dabbling around with crazy magic again, I see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Lorana yelled, now incredibly frustrated. \"Just let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no no no...\" Merta giggled again, her wide eyes fixated on her tiny rival. \"I am going to take <i>full advantage</i> of this...\"</span></div></div>",

Once again, Lorana barely dodges out of the way, just managing to escape the spoon before it lifts up and takes her with it.

Lorana's own eyes travel down Merta's face to her pursed lips, trembling slightly as her massive tongue snakes out, giving them a lick and causing them to shine with saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merta... p-please...\" Lorana trembles, her eyes locked on those pursed lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Lorana... or, should I say, soup...\" Merta giggled, her lips parting to reveal her massive white teeth. \"Time to get rid of you for good.

At once, she gags at the foul thickness of the air, before realizing with a sickening horror that she's inside of Merta's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Talos...\" Lorana begins, her voice quivering as she panics, her eyes wide with fear. \"I'm...

The giant woman played with her tiny prey for a few moments, savoring her taste. It wasn't very good, considering how sweaty and otherwise unwashed Lorana typically was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Merta's tongue violently snapped to the left, sending Lorana flying. She landed halfway on one of the giant molars, leaving her arm stranded on that pearly white with a bit of chewed potato. Before she could even pull it back Merta's jaw slams up, crushing her appendage utterly. It pops like a grape, exploding into bits of meat and blood. It mixes with an also crushed potato, becoming an indiscriminate combination of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana looks on, her terror overwhelming whatever pain was surging through her body. The sight of her arm being chew to bits freezes her with indecision, allowing Merta's tongue to strike again. It struck her back, knocking the rest of her onto the strained molar. Like before it slams upwards, crushing Lorana's head and upper body. A few more chews later and Lorana, like her arm before her, is reduced to a mushy pile of meat, potato, and leek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerta reaches into her pocket and pulls out a small, personal sized mirror. She lifts it up to her open mouth and uses the reflection to gaze inside. Towards the back she spots it: a brown, indistinct ball of mush that a few moments ago was Lorana. She's been reduced to nothing more than a paste-like mixture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith smug satisfaction, Merta swallows the remains, sending it down for her stomach to deal with. The rest of her soup follows, filling her up. What's left of Lorana is, over the next few hours, further digested by her stomach acids, becoming nothing more than energy for her giant rival. Merta sleeps comfortably that night with a full belly and full knowledge that she has finally won. </span></div></div>",

His tall, muscular form and sandy blond hair gave that much away. He was clad in nothing but a loin-cloth, typical of those soldiers on leave.

As his cock snaked up her torso she could only hope that her melons would provide too big a meal for the thing to take her down. As they reached her breasts, they...</span></div></div>",

From there there was nothing left to stop her demise; her shoulders, neck, and finally head were engulfed without resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness overcame Lorana as she began her journey down the soldier's shaft. It was pitch black, devilishly hot, smelled strongly of semen and gurgled like a staving animal. The muscles inside pinched and squeezed her as she traversed the vertical passage.

The squeezing got worse and worse, to the point that she was certain that she would be crushed before she was suffocated. To Lorana's surprise, neither fate befell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she felt the pressure let off of her feet. Her entire body was gradually brought into a more open, more round chamber. She fell into it with a splash, landing in a thick, creamy liquid. Though she couldn't see it in the darkness, she could confirm through smell and the inadvertent taste of a bit that had splashed into her mouth that it was semen. She was in his testicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She could hear him moan in ecstasy through the meaty walls of his cock, no doubt due to the sick pleasure she was causing. So intense was the sensation that the man didn't even take time to stroke his own cock. All he did was continue to huff her tunic, oblivious to the world around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana, meanwhile, had noticed something far worse than suffocating or being crushed was about to happen to her. Her legs, tongue, and other body parts that had been exposed to his semen were beginning to tingle and sting. The pain only intensified as she realized she was being digested! Not into a nutritious sludge, as might happen in the stomach, but into semen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to her fate, Lorana didn't try to fight it. She didn't try to crawl out the way she came. Instead, injured and unwillingly to fight back, the nordic beauty lowered her entire body into the semen soup. She allowed herself to be broken down and converted into the man's love juices. It's what she deserved for failing her father. She was a fool and deserved a fool's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the body to painlessly melt her into the soldier's semen. She was converted utterly, indistinguishable from the bit that had been there before she arrived. There was nothing left of the being known as Lorana, just reproductive fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the outside, the soldier had reached his climax. Unable to hold back anymore, he pulled the tunic from his face and shoved it to his exploding crotch. What seemed to be an extremely large amount of semen, nearly a liter's worth exploded onto the piece of clothing. It was utterly drenched in his semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted by the events, the man didn't even acknowledge the girl's disappearance. Instead, he tossed his head back and went to sleep. When he woke up hours later, he still didn't give it much thought. His cock and balls felt empty and, not knowing that he had converted her into cum, assumed she had escape somehow. All that remained was her tunic, which he used for the next few weeks as a masturbation aid. Only once it lost it scent did he toss it out, finally putting behind him the Lorana incident.</span></div></div>",

Prior to the present moment, tensions between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloak Rebellion had reached a boiling point, leading Whiterun's Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater, to finally break his neutrality and let Legion troops garrison the city in response to a perceived Stormcloak threat. That threat became reality a short time later, when Stromcloak troops assaulted the city in a full-on attack. Now, the first few lines of Stormcloak troops had successfully broken through the perimeter, and the reinforcements - Lorana included - were joining in the fighting, which had broken out in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana and the rest of her squad charged into the city, where fighting between Stormcloaks and Imperials had broken out in the streets. All around, the crash of swords and armor could be heard along with the cries of a fierce battle. Though most civilians had evacuated, some Battle-Borns and Grey-Manes had joined in the fight as well, despite the danger. Magic flew threw the air as soldiers charged at each other in the streets, some with round, distended guts - the sign of having felled an opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, many soldiers on both sides found themselves using vore fighting tactics to their advantage, and the weaker soldiers quickly found themselves in the churning stomachs of stronger ones. For some soldiers, victory meant not only surviving, but also a full belly. For others, losing meant not only death, but digesting whole and alive inside the belly of the other side's soldiers, aiding the war effort of the opposite side by becoming fat or muscle for an enemy soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was all in the long-term. In the short term, soldiers like Lorana were just trying to get their own kills while avoiding the hungry lips of other soldiers who might best them or catch them by surprise. All of this was running through Lorana's mind as she ran through the chaos, sword held high, searching for an enemy to fight, when...</span></div></div>",

Given the bold and dangerous mission of investigating a series of disappearances in the area, she was buzzing with expectation. Slaying countless monsters made her a bit bored of routine hunting requests and protection missions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she heard the rumor of people vanishing around Falkreath, she had taken it upon herself to discover why. Of course there was no way she could do it on her own though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you slow down?!\" a whine said from behind. \"It's unnatural to be so energetic after 10 miles...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, Lorana gazed upon her sweaty companion. She was short for a nord, barely reaching Lorana's shoulder. Her short, black hair clung to her tan face in wet clumps. Equipped with only cloth armor for agility, her undergarments could be made out due to the sweat soaking through. Not that she had much to show off anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana turned back and embraced her dear friend. \"Oh c'mon Bryn, it isn't that bad. Weren't you the one that insisted on coming with me? I recall someone declaring that she'd make me cry with how quick they could solve the mystery..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryn struggled against the oppressive grip before she finally freed her head from Lorana's soft breasts and took a deep breath. Her brown eyes looked up annoyed, but the blush across her face seemed to give away her true feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did say that...but I at least expected us to take some horses!\" Lorana finally released her crushing hug and simply picked up her featherweight companion by her arms, triggering a yelp from the rogue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no fun! Plus we need to be stealthy. All the horses hooves would have given us away instantly...\" Bryn wasn't so much listening however, as she was trying to break free of the embarrassing position. She hated when Lorana carried her like a child. It was a mix of embarrassment and it triggered memories from there first meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a young thief, Bryn had mistaken Lorana as an easy mark with a fat coin purse. The second her hand had touched the pouch the warrior picked her up and dragged her to her room at the local inn. What followed was ingrained deeply on her mind. The larger nord had quickly stripped her and began to stuff her into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small woman proved easy prey as her weak struggles only served to send her down to her stomach more easily. Bryn had expected to never awaken, but was surprised to wake up with the predatory woman holding her tightly as they slept in the same bed. Lorana had demanded to know why Bryn had become a thief. She was touched by the story of how she was raised an orphan after the death of her parents. She had ran away at a young age and learned from the beggars how to get by. Her home was a shack under a bridge<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman then extended an offer she couldn't refuse. In return for giving up the life of a thief and joining her party when she needed, she would allow her to stay in her home and keep her fed and healthy. Ever since that day Bryn traveled with Lorana as much as she would allow. But whenever Lorana held her like this...she couldn't help but worry that she would make another trip into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana was having a hard time suppressing the urge to eat her friend. Seeing her cutely struggle in her strong arms only reminded her of how she was such good prey. She would never dream about digesting her of course. They were far too close for that. But she could always swallow her down, keep her safe inside her belly, and then let her out later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought was enticing...but they had a mission to do. Fun could come later. Placing Bryn back down, she turned back around and started walking forward again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've wasted enough time. Time to kill some mysteries!\" she exclaimed. Bryn mumbled something about being unfair and followed closely behind. After a few more minutes however, the rogue ran in front and stopped her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. There's something approaching us.\" Lorana instinctively reached for the hilt to her current sword, Soulrender. Bryn gripped her daggers and crouched behind a nearby rock, ready to ambush. The duo remained tense as they heard the sound of footsteps coming around the bend in the road. Unknown to them, they were about to come face to face with the perpetrator of the vanishing citizens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the corner came...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the sound of steps became louder, it became even more clear that they were equestrian. Around the corner came two horses pulling a dark green wagon with yellow trimming. Holding the reins was someone in a black cloak. The side displayed a sign saying \"Miracle Solutions\" in bold print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Traveler!\" said the hooded figure. Removing the hood revealed the figure to be a female high elf. She quickly stopped her carriage and jumped off. Lorana kept her hand on her hilt as the mystery woman approached her. Her cloak still covered her body, a weapon could still be hidden. Of course Bryn was still in position, ready to strike the unsuspecting woman should she try anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt, come no further! State your business with me or be on your way!\" she demanded. The woman took a step back, a look of shock flashing across her face. She recovered quickly, however, and gave a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies traveler! I had forgotten about the recent incidents in this area\" she said sincerely. She parted her cloak to display casual clothes and an iron dagger in its sheathe. \"My name is Nirva, a humble merchant. I merely wish to see if you were interested in browsing my wares.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana glanced at her hidden friend to see what she thought. Bryn had placed her daggers back but remained hidden. <i>Stay cautious</i> was what she was saying. Removing her hand from Soulrender she approached the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you sell?\" she asked. Nirva seemed to light up with excitement as she opened her wagon to display multiple vials filled with a blue fluid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I sell a miracle potion made from my own recipe. I'll explain, but how much do you know about Alchemy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well here are the basics. My elixir increases metabolism in order to burn fat easier! But that's not all! By increasing your metabolism you could also grow muscle quicker! This amazing potion will make you sexier and stonger in a short amount of time for only the low price of 15 coins!\" She really had her pitch down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana was never good at hiding her excitement. She had already snatched a vial out of the elf's hand and replaced it with the money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to try this out! Thank you so much, ma'am! If this is really as good as you say it is, I'll be sure to stock up if we meet again!\" But with that, her eyes got a dangerous glint. \"However, if this turns out to just be a hoax I will find you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nirva quickly got in her seat and took off down the road. Judging her reaction, she was either a coward or a liar. Either way, Lorana would need to test this potion out on someone who has a resistance to poison. Speaking of which, Bryn left her cover and rejoined her leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't tell me you bought another weird potion! That last one made you sick for an entire week!\" she complained. A cold shiver ran down her spine when she saw the look on the warrior's face. \"Don't you dare-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't finish her statement as Lorana swiftly grabbed her close friend once more. In one motion she squished the girl's face until her mouth opened, popped open the lid, and tossed the vial directly down her throat! Bryn coughed at the rough object going down her throat and glared at her smiling companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for! It'll take me a week to digest that glass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop whining. I just wanted to see if what she said was true, or if she was the one causing the dissapearances. If she's selling poison and calling it a elixir, she could earn a fortune and have no one to say she's a fake. You have an immunity to most poisons, so you'll be fine if it really is toxic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only immune to toxins that I've ingested <b>before</b>! If she's using a new kind, I could still die!\" she explained. Suddenly, the tiny nord gripped her stomach tightly at the vial's contact. Something was wrong. A cold sweat came over her as the effects began to kick in. Lorana was instantly by her side and was attempting to help. She presented healing potions and antidotes, but this was no poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNirva smiled wickedly as she drove away. Another fool had purchased her product. All the money she made by selling her vials was nothing compared to what she got looting the bodies after. The recent string of disappearances were caused by the effect of her miracle maker. She had called it that because it was a miracle she had survived after trying it the first time. The potion wasn't focused on the metabolism at all. In fact, the true effect is to make the consumer... </span></div></div>",

She was the one who forced her to take the unknown concoction, now she was forced to watch helplessly as Bryn moaned and clutched her stomach. She could feel her body heat increasing slightly, as if she had gotten a fever. Her face was flushed as their gazes met. Despite the situation, Lorana couldn't help but notice how cute she looked like this...and how nice she smelled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryn had never felt anything like this before in her life. She had taken poisons in the past simply because there was no other nutrition around besides them. But this wasn't quite pain. The potion inside of her felt hot, making her body feel just as hot. Lorana looked deeply concerned as she held her frail body close. She met her gaze for a few moments...before her eyes fell upon her lips. A feeling of longing came over her as she gazed upon the rosy entrance to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her years of fearing being eaten seemed to fade away as she imagined herself as Lorana's meal. She closely remembered the feeling of her hot mouth, the tight throat, and the somewhat filled stomach. It had the grounds for nightmares, but now she could only wish to experience it again. Hearing a loud gurgle, she looked at her friend's covered stomach. She gently stroked it with her fingers, wanting to return. She was beginning to burn up even more, she needed to be inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...eat me! Eat me Lorana! I...I need to be inside you!\" she begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young rogue's bright red face was so close...and she was smelling amazing! Lorana had felt the urge to eat her follower multiple times, sometimes even allowing herself a lick or two. But this time...she was actually begging for it! Every nerve in her body was screaming at her to gulp down her friend. Her body wanted to swallow Bryn down, never to be seen again. Her tongue crept out of her mouth and gave her cheek a quick lick. She was delicious! Far more tasty than she was before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she did something that neither one expected. She stood up and placed Bryn down on the ground. Giving off the brightest smile she could, she said \"no. I'm not going to eat you. Whatever that potion was, it's making you want to be eaten. Not to mention even more 'prey like' than usual. I'll be back soon.\" She then took off down the road towards the wagon Nirva was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Altmer woman sat calmly inside her wagon, a glass of wine to her lips. She estimated an hour would be enough time for some other traveler or animal to devour that nord woman. She was lucky that her master had been away when she had originally tested her potion. While trying to create a superior regeneration potion, she instead made her miracle maker. It acted as an aphrodisiac, making anyone who drank it to want to be eaten. Side effects include emitting pheromones that predators love, tasting better, and loss of strength. The effects lessen in a few hours, but take a week to fully disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on her door startled her quite a bit. Her smile returned at the thought of another traveler wanting to buy her products. Or if the woman from earlier merely wanted Nirva to be her predator. It had happened many times in the past, and she loved the experience of willing prey. Quickly opening the door, the last thing she saw was a salivating maw leading to a pulsating throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Later that night...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Innkeeper! One room and two servings of venison please! Also, at least four cups of mead to start with!\" A few hours after eating the shady merchant, Bryn's demands to be eaten heavily went down. While she admitted to still feel the urge, she stopped trying to crawl down Lorana's throat. While it was cute at first, she had been growing tired of actively stopping her. With Nirva fully digested, they decided to head into the nearest inn and take a carriage to the Jarl in the morning. Lorana had to carry her on her back until they reached it though. The potion made her far too weak to walk the miles to get there. Tonight, they would enjoy themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeeper was a pretty woman, long dark hair and blue eyes. Her eyes had been planted on Bryn since the moment they walked in, the same as everyone else inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A room and two meals, huh? Add the mead and that'll put you at fifty coins...but I could be persuaded into trading it for that girl you're with instead.\" Lorana responded by tossing a small coin purse on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine! I recently found plenty of money...\" she said. Nirva did indeed have a few hundred gold coins on her body alone, plus all the ones stored inside the wagon. \"You can keep the change if you promise to put a guard on my friend here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two spent the next few hours drinking and relishing their victory. Lorana was enjoying herself greatly in the warm environment, but Bryn wasn't so jovial. Every time Lorana took a bite of food, her eyes lit up with excitement and stared. Each drink she took Bryn watched her throat move with envy. She enjoyed spending time with her leader, but she couldn't shake the lingering effects of the potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana noticed it, but was a bit too drunk and was enjoying the attention. At one point, she opened her mouth to give her friend a good look inside her mouth. She always loved teasing Bryn, but this was too good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their bellies were filled, they returned to their room passed their new Brenton guard. After changing into their night clothes they both went to the bed. It had been commonplace for them to share a bed. Bryn would rather have them keep the money they would have used for another room, and Lorana just wanted to cuddle. It was so normal between the two, even at home Bryn never slept in her own bed. It's already become nearly impossible for her to sleep without the feel of huge breasts poking into her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the covers, Bryn was completely aware of all contact they were making. The soft breasts against her neck, the arm around her chest, the leg wrapped around her waist. She could feel every breath Lorana took, every beat of her heart, and especially every rumble in her stomach. Bryn turned herself the other direction, allowing her face to push against Lorana's chest. Something she rarely did out of fear of suffocation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey...are you still awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I don't fall asleep until you do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you eat me?\" Lorana shifted so that she could look her companion in the eye. Even in the dark, she could feel her unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean all the time. When we first met, I was just a criminal you caught. You could have eaten me on the spot with no consequences. Or anytime we adventure together. Just starting out, there were nights when we went hungry because we ran out of food. You could have used me as a food source. Then there's today. I...I was <b>begging </b>you to eat me. I <b>still </b>want you to eat me because of that potion you made me drink. It was obvious that you wanted to as well...all of those times. I know you're predatory, and I see the way you look at me. So why am I still here and alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I suppose you have a point. I do consider swallowing you at times, but never permanently. I've considered swallowing you and spitting you back up like the first time. The first time, I just wanted to teach you a lesson. You were too young for me to kill. As for today...I really did want to eat you. But I don't want to lose you. After all, I love my little Bryn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I love you too Lorana...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look each other in the eyes for a few moments before they...</span></div></div>",

Panting with exhaustion, the Nord girl struggles to pull herself to her feet, taking a moment to catch her breath and assess the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around her, the scene is utter chaos. What turned into a small party - her party - fighting a dragon quickly turned into a disaster. The dragon, covered in red plated scales and breathing massive balls of fire, turned out to be way tougher than they thought, as made evident by her party's current state. Of the original seven members, three of them were nowhere to be found. Two of them were lying on the ground, either knocked out or dead. There was herself, and that just left Aeta...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread seized Lorana's chest as she instantly worried for the safety of the female Nord warrior Aeta, one of her closest friends. Rushing out of the snow, she ran over to take a stance next to the dragon, and found it poised over her friend Aeta, who was disarmed and cowering to the side, her eyes wide with fear. Aeta screamed as the dragon gave a mighty roar, saliva flying from its mouth in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the dragon pounced on her helpless friend, instinct seized Lorana, who stepped forward and let out a mighty shout of her own. Though all she could muster was a single \"FUS!\", the rush of unrelenting force was enough to catch the dragon off guard, who turned to Lorana in anger. Firing another fireball right at her, Lorana only barely managed to dodge, this time flying face first into the ground. Struggling to pull herself up, Lorana turned back to the dragon, expecting it to be right on top of her. Instead, the scene was even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana turned just in time to see her friend for one last moment, her screams echoing in her ears, just before the dragon's salivating jaws chomp down on her. Lorana watches with horror as the dragon lifts its mighty head up into the air, its jaws pointed skyward, and gives a powerful swallow. The horrified Nord can practically hear a <i>gluuurk</i> as a large bulge descends from its chin and slowly slides down its long throat, her friend's squirming clearly visible through the flesh of its neck as her friend slips down the dragon's esophagus. Then, just like that, the bulge disappears as it slips into its tan underbelly, all trace of her friend completely gone from the world, presumably in the dragon's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana turns away, on the verge of vomiting. The realization slowly creeps through her that the other party members didn't flee - they were all eaten alive by the dragon, and were probably thrashing around inside of its stomach at that moment, completely helpless and doomed. Lorana had never lost a fight against a dragon before, so she was totally unprepared for this outcome. However, at that moment, she knew that her friends were doomed unless she saved them, and quick. The dragon seems to have lost sight of her, but if she wasn't careful, she'd be the next one sliding down into its belly...</span></div></div>",

With her chest heaving, the terrified Nord - the lone remainder of her group, she presumed the only one not either dead or churning inside of the dragon's belly - kept an eye on the dragon as she hid, knowing that she stood no chance fighting the dragon at this point, and that the only way to save her friends would be through guile. Taking absolute care not to alert the dragon to her presence, Lorana watched as the tremendous, red-scaled beast slowly circled, looking for survivors. Down below, its somewhat bloated tan underbelly seemed to emanate a low rumbling, as if to tease Lorana with her friends' fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with seeing no survivors, the dragon took to flight, flapping its massive wings as it lifted into the air, its belly swaying beneath. Watching the dragon ascend, Lorana quickly jumped out of her hiding space and began to run after it, following it with her eyes as the beast flew away. Almost instantly, Lorana realized the futility of her attempt - the dragon could fly much faster than she could run, and it was already flying out of her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No...</i> Lorana thought to herself, chest heaving as she stormed up the mountainside, trying desperately not to lose sight of the dragon above the treetops. <i>I can't let it get away. I have to save Aeta, and the others. I have to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lorana felt a faint glimmer of hope as the dragon - now at the very edge of her sight, only the smallest glimpse of it visible through the mountain treetops - slowly descend, and land in a clearing farther up the mountain. Determined to save her friends, Lorana marched onward, fueled by adrenaline, her legs burning as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seemed to Lorana like an eternity later, the exhausted Nord girl finally came upon the dragon's clearing.

The sunlight glinted off of its crimson scales, and its tan underbelly seemed to slowly rise and fall with its breathing. Lower down, its belly was bared to her in full view, sagging somewhat and slightly bloated - bloated with the squirming bodies of her friends, tucked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana slowly crept over to the sleeping beast, taking care not to accidentally wake it. As she got closer to the dragon's massive belly, its bodily noises slowly filled her ears, the gurgling, groaning churns of its stomach becoming louder and more audible with each step closer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*gluuuurgle* *gerrrn* *glorp*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana took a deep breath, and steeled herself, Lorana ran over to the side of the dragon's sagging stomach and kneeled down, her face inches away from its lower belly. Then, the Nord noticed something that made her sick: in addition to the belly's slow, rhythmic rise and fall, little, almost invisible lumps were appearing on the outside of its belly. What made it even worse was that Lorana suddenly heard the unmistakable voice of her friend, on the other side of what must have been a foot of solid flesh and organ:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-help... m-me...\" <i><b>*GLUUUURK*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana jumped back as the dragon's stomach suddenly lurched, her friend's voice going silent a moment later. Lorana gagged, keeling over as the sick realization slowly filled her that her friends were slowly being digested alive by the dragon's stomach, like little lumps of food. Even worse, the dragon was doing it completely absentmindedly, dozing off as if it were sleeping off a big meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana began to panic. Her friends were at the mercy of the beast's churning belly, and she had to do something to save them. Ideas quickly flooded Lorana's mind...</span></div></div>",

Trying to cut open its belly would be effective, but after that fight she wasn't sure that her sword would be enough to pierce through the hard scales. It would be even worse for her if she woke up the beast without getting her friends out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder came over her as she realized what she needed to do to make it vomit. She remembered the time she was drunk and tried to eat the bone of a chicken leg, only to have it hit her uvula and causing her to vomit. Saadia gave her an earful after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorana quietly snuck up to the dragon's head and saw that its mouth was open. Hot air carrying the scent of spittle and death blew back her hair in strong gusts. Its mouth was shining in the daylight, all the saliva showcasing the mouth's features. The large tongue and gums were pitch black, the same color as the gaping hole in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing her fear, Lorana got on her hands and knees and began to crawl inside of this beast's mouth. The instant she passed through its jaws the air became hot and humid. She didn't even know if a dragon has a uvula, or a gag reflex, but this was her best shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the dragons tongue shifted. While it was resting on its side, the dragon had kept its slick muscle on its lower jaw. But as she entered it fell directly on top of her. The sudden weight caused her to fall on her face with the tongue resting on top of her. She held her breath as the heat from the soft member spread through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sleeping, it was clearly enjoying her flavor. The tongue sprang to life, forcefully licking her back to the ground. Lorana choked back her whimpers even as it licked her rump. A quick lick to the side rolled her onto her back as it began to focus on licking her front. Her body had become completely soaked in saliva and even the brave nord warrior let out a whimper as the muscle gave several licks to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's tongue then wrapped around her and squeezed tightly before lifting her up. Fear shot through her veins as she was sure the monster had woken up. Instead, it brought its tongue back to its original resting place while closing its jaws to savor its treat. Darkness filled the maw as the sharp fangs came together, blocking out the sun. That could be the last time she saw the sun. After a few more minutes of licking and suckling, the tongue relaxed and Lorana fell onto a hard floor of teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush was over her face as she realized that despite the fear, the massage given from the tongue had felt amazing. Returning to the task at hand, she resumed her crawling towards the throat. She moved even slower than before out of fear of falling in without seeing it. Holding a hand out in front of her, she reached for where the uvula should be. Crawling ever slowly, her palm pressed against a wall of warm flesh as she realizes she just hit...</span></div></div>",

These creatures can come in all sorts of different shapes and forms, serving various masters but usually spelling trouble for mortals in some way or another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose your Daedra!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Dremora - Dremora are humanoid Daedra often skilled with weapon and armor use or with magical abilities that resemble demonic warriors or knights. They most commonly serve Mehrunes Dagon, and have darkened, ashy features with horns and other such characteristics, complete with deep, harsh voices and violent, aggressive tendencies. They are commonly found in Daedric ruins and the plains of Oblivion, especially inhabiting towers.<br>\r\n(Reference picture: <u><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.uesp.net/w/images/a/ac/SR-npc-Dremora_03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.uesp.net/w/images/a/ac/SR-npc...</a></u> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Winged Twilight - A demonic, batlike creature resembling a harpy that is usually associated with Azura. Winged Twilights are always female, and boast powerful magical resistances as well as abilities of their own. Most commonly found in Morrowind, Winged Twilights are most often spotted in Daedric ruins but can also be seen in simple ancestral tombs, hunting for unsuspecting prey...<br>\r\n(Reference picture: <u><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.uesp.net/w/images/8/8d/MW-creature-Winged_Twilight.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.uesp.net/w/images/8/8d/MW-cre...</a></u> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Daedroth - A humongous form of lesser Daedra resembling a muscled, anthropomorphic crocodile or reptile of some sort. Contrary to other types of daedra, Daedroth are more beastlike and savage, sacrificing weapon skill for sheer size and brute strength. Usually androgynous or genderfluid, Daedroth are among the most commonly found types of Daedra in the plains of Oblivion, and are associated with Mehrunes Dagon or Molag Bal.<br>\r\n(Reference picture: <u><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.uesp.net/w/images/f/fc/ON-creature-Daedroth.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.uesp.net/w/images/f/fc/ON-cre...</a></u> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Spider Daedra - Dridders with a humanoid upper torso and an arachnid lower half. Spider Daedra are most commonly associated with Mephala and, similar to the Winged Twilight, are most commonly found as females.

Although technically genderfluid, many of them take on specific masculine or feminine forms (despite the term \"prince\") and can choose to interact with mortals as such. Wielding incredible power and influence, the 16 or so Daedric Princes are often worshipped by inhabitants of Tamriel as an older, more pagan religion. Some of the most famous Daedric Princes are credited with creating entire races of people or are associated with the appearance of some of the most powerful artifacts known to man, so it comes as no surprise that their powers are all but omnipotent...</span></div></div>",

Though tombs were often guarded by the undead, some, such as this one on the southern tip of Tel Branora's island in Morrowind, had its own Daedra inhabitants instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant of Azura like all other Winged Twilights, Zeneva was just as beautiful and dangerous as her scaly counterparts, although perhaps even more predatory. Zeneva rouses herself awake as her mind wanders to the events of the tomb's last intrusion: a lone Dunmer girl, creeping around, looking for her share of grave-robbing plunder. Unluckily for her, however, Zeneva tolerated no such plundering at her tomb, and made quick work of the intruder: first, by disarming her, second, by eating her whole and alive, and third, by dozing off with a squirming, screaming belly full of fresh dark elf meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwakening from that nap, Zeneva found all but every trace of evidence of the would-be thief's existence in the world gone. What was before a bulging, squirming gut was now nothing more than a small pudge on the Winged Twilight's otherwise toned belly. Feeling her massive, bared breasts sway as she stands up to her full height, the winged predator begins making a mental note of the new, raw power she feels flowing through her veins, before being interrupted by a heavy pressure in her lower abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to some dusty, otherwise empty corner of the tomb's dark halls, Zeneva squats down and makes quick work of relieving herself, culminating her last prey's entire life in the form of a steaming pile complete with corroded chunks of bone. Heading out of the otherwise unused chamber, Zeneva begins to prowl her musty halls once again, wondering how to spend the next few hours...</span></div></div>",

Because they were so common and usually unguarded from the outside, ancestral tombs like this one were made very easy targets for adventurers, being something of a low-level dungeon. However, the proud Winged Twilight was certainly not going to allow such an easy plundering of her dungeon - not without a fight, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the steady stream of would-be adventurers and thieves made for an exciting guard duty.
