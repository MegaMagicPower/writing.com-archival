Now there is something there and it is the last thing you would think would go there a bakery. The sign says \u2018Lidort\u2019s Bakery: Baked goods that will transform your life!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the large window in front of the store and you see the large display with the slanted shelves in front, showing off all the delicious baked goods which just make your mouth water. You stare at the cinnamon pastries and the raisin bread along with all the huge chocolate chip cookies which are just too much to bear. No, you just HAVE TO go inside now.  You just have to buy something in the store because it just seems like a crime to walk past the store without trying something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push the door open and walk in and right away you are greeted by a nice, friendly man behind the counter who smiles as you stare at the large board hanging from the wall which lists all the items and all the prices. All the prices are affordable so that won\u2019t be an issue. So what will you order? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(But first who are you?)</span></div></div>",
