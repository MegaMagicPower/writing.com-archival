Why must beautiful people such as thee have to do what dirty kettles should do?!\" Grunty put a spell on the liquid inside the caldron and it turns orange. A straw, that looks more like see through garden hose appears. Grunty handed Tooty the hose and smirked. \"Start drinking Blubber Bear.\" Tooty looked at the hose then at the Bubbling orange liquid. \"I'm not thirsty...\" \"i didn't asked if you were thirsty or not! i said drink the liquid!\" Tooty took  a few small sips before giving a yuck face. If you were paying attention, you would think that her face became a little greener. \"It tastes nasty...\" Grunty nodded her head. \"What did you think it would taste like? Ice cream and sugar plums?!\"</span></div></div>",

Because i can either use you at Witchyworld or keep you as personal stress toy! (if you chose this later on, it only counts as lesbian if they try to have sexual intercourse and/or kissing.) Grunty put a spell on the liquid and seem to have a mind as it own as it shot out of the pot and...went for Tooty's mouth! Tooty started to expand, mainly her belly. The green blob began to expand, getting bigger and bigger... Her old pants, which survived her first expansion from the transformation, ripped, revealing some pink underwear. When Tooty finished the liquid with a loud \"Slurp!\" she fell backwards. She had nearly doubled her size. \"ooooh... my tummy hurts\" Tooty groaned in a slight pain. Grunty managed to jump on Tooty's belly, being young once more, she had a lot more energy. Tooty looked up and saw the thin, witch grin down at her. \"Please.... turn me back to the way i was....\" Grunty just laughed. \"Not in your life time you will! I have Big plans for you! Ehehehe!!\" Grunty jumped off, wondering whether to give Mr. Patch an Early Birthday Present, or keep Tooty for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunty rubbed her chin.  \"Hm... this is a hard decision... i choose...\"</span></div></div>",

Grunty laughed and with a wave of her hand, made it so that her pants had grown back to fit her larger gut. Grunty, personally rolled Tooty down to Witchy World. \"Where are you taking me?!\" Cried Tooty, practically scared out of her wits looking around at what she was seeing. \"Oh nothing special...\" Grunty began with a smile. \"Just a giant dinosaur that might have some fun with you....ehehehe!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grunty pushed the Fat green bear into the big blue tent with White stripes, She stationed Tooty so she wasn't on her feet, but wasn't exactly sitting down, so she couldn't roll away or anything. \"Oh Mr. Patch... early birthday present for you my deary!\" With that, Grunty skipped out of the Tent as Tooty wobbled in fear. \"Oh no!\" she thought, \"What is he going to do with me!\" Just then, Mr. Patch walked in as his usual size (When Banjo and Kazooie first met him). Tooty was almost the size of his leg. \"Oh my! oh my! A pretty young girl for Mr. Patch?\" Mr. Patch began to say with a grin. \"This is quite a surprise! What a Happy Birthday this will be for me!\" He looked at Tooty. \"Well, they never make girls my size... never did... So i'll just inflate you!\" He let out a laugh that almost could've shook the tent. Tooty was frightened. \"Please Mr. Patch, i want to go home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Patch grinned. \"But little girl, this is your home! Now let me think of the most enjoyable way to inflate you... your the right sized girl for me, so i don't have to feed you any of the Witchy World food...\" Tooty looked at the inflated dinosaur, she could see he was originally green with a yellow belly, but now had a few patches over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So i have decided to inflate you by...\" Tooty snapped out of her inspecting trance and gazed at the dinosaur. </span></div></div>",

But something was different... he was blowing air into her! Tooty began to feel herself the best she can, and she was inflating! Not just in size, but... in height?! She looked at Mr. Patch, who was clearly enjoying the kiss. Tooty was sort of liking it... but couldn't decide whether she liked it or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like 2 hours, Tooty felt herself touch the ground, but now she was almost up to his neck! Mr. Patch chuckled. \"I need a break... your almost ready, so, do you like your new form?\" Tooty looked herself over... Her belly was still fat, but she gotten taller... and a bit wider in other areas, including her butt! (Mr. Patch couldn't help himself!)

It was not a particularly remarkable day in any capacity, and in all likelihood would not be. Gruntilda had been defeated at least two times before over, and last time over four years ago. The mountain had been quiet and peaceful ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight crept into the window of Banjo and Kazooie's small cottage, awakening the red bregull. She knew that could only mean one thing: it was the crack of noon and time to get up to a big day of doing absolutely nothing. And why not? The duo had succeeded before and since then had not been doing much of anything. Already their days were filled mainly with eating and playing video games, and neither saw much problem with that. Kazooie greeted the day by flickering her eyes groggily and focusing into the noon light. She laid lazily in her backpack suspended on a rack beside Banjo's bed and reached over to tear another day off a calendar before finding it was just out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMildly irritated, Kazooie pecked Banjo's head to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Butterbear, it's almost 2 and I'm hungry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanjo got up soon after with relative slowness. \"Alright, Iets just eat some leftovers\" he said, getting a large pizza box stored in a cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And flip that calendar, I can't reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did so, turning it to the day's date: April 14th, 2005. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanjo then hefted Kazooie from the rack and placed her beside him at the sink to wash up for the morning while their pizza warmed in the oven. Kazooie waited for her turn at the sink, her eyes wandering in the meantime. She noticed a seven year old picture of the two of them hanging on a nearby wall, with Banjo looking trim and muscular back in those days. Turning to him now, it was obvious his trim figure had melted away from endless honey and pizza to a figure with a prominent potbelly, and probably a good third more poundage than his prime. It was a fact Kazooie liked to make fun of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Banjo had finished washing up, he let Kazooie begin in turn while he checked on the food. The red bird cleaned herself thoroughly; it would get quite humid when you mainly hang around in a backpack. Now was about time to have a bit of a stretch, she thought, leaving the well-worn pack and washing her feet in the water. Her eyes caught her reflection in the pool and glanced back at the years-old picture. She herself...</span></div></div>",

Her titanic belly was packed with pizzas, sodas, cookies, fried chicken (odd that she was a cannibal), candy, more pizza, donuts, fries, hot dogs, more pizza, hamburgers, cupcakes, popcorn, chips, yet more pizza, ice cream, chocolate, waffles, and even more pizza. With her huge soft jiggly love handles, and at least 10 chins, not to mention her incredible rump, it was impressive Banjo could even budge her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh,\" Said Banjo, still wary. \"You may have gotten a...little pudge, but hey! At least you're nowhere <i>near</i> my size!\" Said Banjo as he rubbed his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! At least you know that much, you grizzly blob!\" It had worked. Kazooie had stopped thinking her own fat, once she was distracted. \"Anyway, I'm feeling pretty peckish. Maybe put in a second pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sure thing Kazooie.\" Said Banjo as he reached back into the cooler, and took out another box, happy that he'd managed to keep Kazooie from getting mad at him.</span></div></div>",

And to polish it off, seven buckets of fried chicken, forty hot dogs, twenty three burgers, and fourteen collective gallons of various kinds of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Now he and Kazooie were sitting on their beanbag chair outside, relaxing and being generally lazy. Except, where Kazooie would usually be playing video games, she had spent the past three minutes waiting for the food she ordered on the phone. ...And she had spent the past eight minutes before that ordering food on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Her enormous, distended gut touched the ground, and was spilling over the tight blue backpack banjo wore, filled to the brim with her titanic lower half. Two giant, soft, rotund, jiggly buttocks the size of medicine balls were crammed in, stretching the fabric and constantly pressing against Banjo's back. <br>\r\nBeneath her absurdly bloated belly were her legs, oh her legs. How could I describe those legs, the thighs must have weighed forty pounds each at least, and they were massively swollen, the perfect support for her incredible ass. Below them were her incredible calves, weighing fifteen pounds each or more. Even her feet had gained a lair of fat, weighing over two pounds each, with her long toes swollen to the size of hot dogs. All that incredible mass packed into that tight, stretched backpack. Her unbelievable stomach couldn't fit in there, so it was pouring over the edge and touching the ground. Going up, her wings were pumped up with fat, and somewhat difficult for her to move. Her breast was shockingly huge, coated in a thick layer of blubber. Going around her torso, the seventeen oversized rolls of back fat she had could be used as a pillow when Banjo sat down with her. And leading up to her head was a massively thick neck, fifteen or sixteen chins, and on her face were two large, plump cheeks, that served as a lovely frame for her hungry, eager mouth, always open to food of any sort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kazooie?\" said Banjo, weighing in at 297 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" replied Kazooie, who had grown a bit from the big breakfast, weighing in at a healthy 316 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That food you ordered was for both of us, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Haaaahaha!\" Kazooie's laughter sent ripples through her blubbery self, and her whole body shook like a jello cake. \"You really are a glutton! Trying to get some of my meal. We each order our own, separate lunches, remember? That's how it's always been. Fatso!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Sorry. I guess I was just being greedy.\" Banjo said reluctantly. \"...Hey Kazooie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now, you oBEARse thing you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just jealous because even though we eat the same stuff, you're in better shape then me...also nice pun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! It's a gift of mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect health or a really good sense of humor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both!\" said Kazooie, laughing, which jiggled her enormous body even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And people say <b>I'm</b> the dumb one</i> Banjo thought, as he felt Kazooie's gigantic, soft, blob like form pressed against his, shaking, rippling, and jiggling immensely.      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Kazooie grabbed another box of donuts, pulled it open, poured the contents into her eager maw, then threw away the box carelessly. To wash it down, she grabbed a gallon of chocolate milk, and guzzled it all down, tossing the empty container aside. Still thirsty, she popped open a liter of soda, drank it all, then with a belch threw the bottle away too. She then decided she wanted the taste of chocolate milk back in her mouth, so she had another gallon or two. Thinking she could go for a little meat, she reached into a bag, and pulled out a bunch of thick, greasy, warm, calorie-packed cheeseburgers, stuffing as many as she could fit in her beak at once. After that, she took a quadruple decker cake, and shoved her fat, greedy, fat, hungry, fat, fat, FAT face into it, all the way up to the second of her twenty three chins, and getting frosting all over her beachball sized cheeks. After finishing the whole thing in a minute or two, and licking off all the icing she could, she took a extra large pizza with every topping available, dumped a bucket of fried chicken onto it, dipped it in a tub of bacon grease, and took a massive bite. In three more, she'd finished it, and washed it down by drinking the tub of grease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She ate so ravenously, that it sent jiggles and ripples all throughout her unbelievable body. A thick lair of soft flab surrounded every inch of her rotund self, from her head, almost buried between her huge cheeks and sinking into her thick neck, to her feet, which had only avoided being swallowed by her incredibly swollen legs because they were also having a percentage of the fat settling on them, and had swollen enough to poke out of the spreading masses that were her legs. Her impossible stomach, which seemed filled to maximum capacity (though she kept filling it more and more and more) consisted of a huge globe of flesh with a roll of developed fat over it. It was gradually swelling bigger and bigger with every piece of food she greedily scarfed down. Resting comfortably atop her gut, were the two enormous jiggling spheres of her breasts. On her back were at least fifteen thick rolls of back fat that almost covered up her tail. Also, her ass had grown to an obscene size, each soft, plush, rippling cheek was almost the size of her gut. Well, not quite, but still pretty darn big and impressive. It had long since burst out of Banjo's backpack, and was showing no signs of shrinking as she continued to engorge herself on the calorie laden feast she'd ordered, her steadily increasing weight being a staggering 437 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Speaking of Banjo, by this point he had finished three pizzas and two liters of soda. He weighed 298 pounds, and had gotten tired of feeling Kazooie's jiggling, ever expanding body press into his back, so he'd gotten up and decided to go for a walk. After about five steps, bringing him three feet away from his original spot, he was panting, out of breath, and sat down. It occurred to him just how out of shape he really was. Sitting on the ground, he leaned forward, and felt his huge gut squish, preventing him from leaning forward all the way. As if it were some massive pillow (not nearly as massive as Kazooie's, however), he slowly...slowly...drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Humba is best known as the Shaman who was able to change Banjo and Kazooie into many things. She sat there bored out of her mind. The isle o' bags is safe from any evil and Gruntilda is dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mary Canary flew into her Teepee with a message tucked into her wing. Mary dropped it into her lap and left. Humba opened the note and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Humba Wumba the Shaman, Banjo and Kazooie have gone on a years vacation and I the Jinjo king have decided to make you acting Hero until they return. Signed King Jinjo.\" Humba was certainly surprised by the news.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many thoughts filled her head. \"Am I ready to go on a whole adventure? Will I have to transform myself to different objects to solve puzzles? Who will be the villain? What lands do I have to visit and how many jiggies do I have to collect?\" she thought and thought until she thought it was time to take action. Humba put on her outfit from Nuts &amp; Bolts.

Leading to Jinjo village. \"Something weird is going on in the white Jinjo house!\" cried Tooty running back home. Humba could see the other Jinjo's surrounding the house at a distance.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness you're here Humba!\" said a red Jinjo. \u00a0 \"What is problem with village?\" asked Humba. \"The white Jinjo started acting very weird after it ate a bad burger this morning! And now....just go look!\" it said pointing to the white Jinjo house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumba was also curious about what was going on. But she was also scared. But there was no room or time to be scared now. Humba had to be a Hero. Humba opened the door only to bed met by a repulsive odor. She covered her nose with her shirt and walked in. And Humba couldn't believe her eyes. The white Jinjo was a massive pile of stinky, slimy, greasy, sweaty, fat. It belched and did other things as it shoved piles of food into it's mouth.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't weight less than 400 pounds and such for a little creature that's alot. Thought Humba. Suddenly the white Jinjo lays eyes on Humba. She became stunned and couldn't move. Although she became curious. With the long cheese stick she found on the floes she picked it up and jabbed the Jinjo's massive gut. This was followed by loud rumbling noises. \"Hello *beeeeeeelllllch* Humba.\" the Jinjo belched right into Humba's face and she breathed some in. After the first belch was released the Jinjo keep belching and it looked like it was getting smaller.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Humba's surprise the Jinjo reverted to it's normal size. \"I guess I was just Hungry.\" it said with a blush. Humba laughed it took the Jinjo outside to show everyone I was better. The whole village celebrated and cheered. Humba wiped the grease from her face that the Jinjo belched onto her.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
