            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late afternoon and the sun could been seen setting. It is during this time we set our eyes on a new cast of characters as they are walking home from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been so glad to hear the school bell before\" sighed Tom Wilson as he walked down thew city sidewalk with his friends and sister. Tom was the son of Nate Wilson, a CEO of one of the larger companies in town. He attended middle school with his friends, Adam Hartford and Ashley Ryan. His younger sister, Sara, rounded out the young group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you man. I can only hear Mrs. Thomas go on and on about algebraic equations. Makes me gag thinking about it\" said Adam, before he strutted around, trying to imitate their math teacher. Adam's imitations always drew laughs from eveyone, and this one didn't dissappoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always, your impressions are top notch\" noted Ashley. Ashley was the daughter of Nate's close friend, Brandon Ryan. She and Tom had known eachother since they were 3 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that guys! Looks like there's a new store here!\" shouted Sara, pointing towards the shops on the side of the road. Their neighborhood wasn't too far from here, hence why they walked to and back fron school. Anyway, they did notice that a new store had opened in place of the unoccupied space that had been there for months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess someone finally bought the place\" remarked Adam. After taking a closer look, they noticed the name of the shop. It was called \"Pandora's Box\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice name, if not a bit foreboding\" said Ashley, after taking a good look. The shop had a friendly look to it, but there was something in the air that made the teens a bit more than apprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what are you scared of? Probably just chose that name to make it sound cool. Let's check it out\" said Adam, not wasting another second before running to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so impatient at times. To think he actually tries to make people think he's a jock\" remarked Tom. At that, he heard giggling behind him. He turned to see Ashlet covering her mouth, ill hiding her amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk about impatience\" giggled Ashley, barely concealing her laughter. Tom huffed and continued to go join Adam. Ashley and Sara joined behind them. Adam opened the door and allowed the group to enter the shop. It looked fairly normal, not much different from most shops. It was certainly kid friendly by the looks of it, as there were toys in places and other such objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, interesting place but not much for us\" said Adam, possibly referring that kids their age didn't really need such things. Tom was about to agree when an older man walked out from behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello children. So glad to have our first customers here\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're your first?\" asked Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We opened shop just a few hours ago. Of course, word hasn't gotton out far yet, so I'm glad that we get to see customers on our first day\" grinned the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Although, we're mostly just looking around. We really wouldn't know what to buy\" said Sara. The old man's eyes glimmered slightly as they caught sight of Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there boy\" said the man, gesturing to Tom. \"What's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom Wilson\" replied Tom, not quite sure what the man was getting at. The man grinned at the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Nate Wilson's boy?\" he asked, causing Tom to wince slightly at how the man knew his dad's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've known your father for some time. As he told you much of his life?\" asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much. He's only talked about how his teenage years were a huge ruckus, especially when he turned 15. He would never really elaborate on it, only that he was happy when things settled down eventually\" said Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Honestly, I bet he wishes for some of that excitement to come back. You wish for it as well, correct?\" asked the man. Tom raised an eyebrow. What was this man getting at? Did he know more than he was letting on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. Life does get a bit boring at times\" said Tom. The man grinned to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, how about I offer you this? A special treat for being the first customer\" said the man. He kneeled down and grabbed something from underneath the counter. Before he could explain, Adam spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally, I don't have much interest in this. I'm out of here. Let's go you guys\" said Adam. Sara turned to join him, but Ashley insisted on staying with Tom. Adam grinned to himself. Ashley always wanted an excuse to be with Tom. With that in mind, Adam and Sara left, leaving the two to deal with the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Tom. What the man pulled out seemed to be some kind of case, a box if you will. Tom didn't really know what was inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something special in this case. Something that isn't seen often. I can promise you that your lives will take completely different turns if you embrace what's in here\" said the man. Both Tom and Ashley raised eyebrows at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Tom, a bit interested but still skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and for being our first customer, I'm offering it free of charge. Just think of it as a gift for the good times I had with your parents\" said the man. Tom was more skeptical now, as the man seemed to know his mother, Kate, as well. Just who was this man? Then again, the item was free and Tom figured he could bring it back if it didn't work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir\" said Tom, embracing the item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. I can assure you that you won't be dissappointed\" said the man. Tom and Ashley said good byes before getting themselves out of the shop as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had no idea as to what they just brought into their lives.</span></div></div>",

Adam had already gotton home right now, and the remaining group was now at their houses, which were next door to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows. Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow, ok?\" said Ashley, flashing her million-watt smile at Tom. His heart almost literally melted at her smile, and it took a small nudge from Sara to snap him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, sure\" stuttered Tom a bit. Ashley giggled and ran up the pathway to her house, entering it rather quickly. Sara then turned her attention to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it hard, huh? You really got to stop acting like an idiot when she does that\" said Sara. She didn't know much more about romance than Tom, but even she could do better than what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know\" replied Tom, as even he knew of his problems with love. Anyway, the two of them walked over to their house and entered it, leaving their shoes and such in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading to my room right now\" said Sara, letting Tom know where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead\" replied Tom. After Sara ran off, Tom looked to his box that he got. He gently opened it, as it was easy to open. Inside, he was surprised to see what was in it. It appeared to be a small jar of what appeared to be candies of some sort. There looked to be about 30 of them, and they were in many different colors. Tom assumed that to be perhaps different tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was a free gift after all\" said Tom. He was quite underwhelmed with what he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens after that?</span></div></div>",

Tom was average in the things he did. Football was too dangerous and he was too short for basketball. He played a little soccer on weekends and he struggled with baseball. So, looking more athletic would be a big plus for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he took one of the candies out of the jar and put it in his mouth. As he let it bounce around his mouth and let it roll around his tongue, he pondered what to wish for. Yes, a little more muscle would be great. But how much? He had to be specific. Thirty pounds? Forty? Fifty? He decided on the average of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I gained another forty pounds of muscle right now!\" Tom said to himself, as he stood in his room, with a candy in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he stated his wish, or the magic from the candy started to take affect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom felt his calves expand slightly, ballooning outward until they were sticking out from his legs like softballs! They were rock-hard, and covered with thick veins! His quadriceps above his knees grew thicker, wider and deeper as well, forcing the boy to spread out his legs more. Thick veins covered them as well as layers of muscle surfaced over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis abdominal muscles became more developed as they changed into rows and columns resembling tiles on a kitchen floor or washboard abs. His pectorals ballooned from his chest, sticking out like two mighty spheres of muscle, widening his shoulders and thickening his arms into big pythons of power and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, his biceps, triceps and lats widened and inflated, filling out and completing the muscles on his upper body as well. This gave him a V-taper, with his body above his abdominal muscles being much wider than below his abdominal muscles. His neck was much wider as well, along with thicker and wider deltoids and traps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growth spurt ended, Tom turned and walked into the bathroom where he examined his new figure in the mirror. He was amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had gained 40 pounds of muscle!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If Tom hated anything more than his plain-Jane name, it was '<i>debility</i>' when it came to sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone he knew was practically best friends with a certain sport.  Adam - his best man, was a hardcore rugger that literally trained 24-7; Sara - his prissy younger sis, with those hidden biceps of hers could beat him hands down in an arm wrestle (which was quite... embarrassing); and Ashley, the only girl he actually cared to impress, was an over-the-top obsessive gymnast with eyes only for Olympic youtube clips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd him.  At least he <i>hoped</i> so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he diverted his attention back at the so-called 'magical' sweet dissolving rapidly in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he knew - knew what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish that I had legs that could take me up to speeds greater than that of Usain Bolt.  I also wish-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet which he was pretty sure was at least larger than his thumb a second ago vaporised into nothingness in his mouth upon the completion of his first wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.  Tom felt sort of cheated, he had to admit.  In movies, let-downs happened zero percent of the time.  The main character would usually experience a tingling sensation, or chills sprinting up his spine... and all the other characteristical nonsense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOMMY-BOY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom inwardly cringed.  The name 'Tom' suddenly seemed rather appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOMMY-BOY!  GET YOUR <i>WHIPPED</i> ASS DOWN HERE RIGHTTT NOW~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sighed, lazily crawling to his feet.  This was unbelievable, but he was actually going to heed his younger sis's command.  After all, <i>'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'</i>, or was it?  Tom couldn't be bothered to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOMMMMY-BUOOOO-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, you retard!\" He hollered back, thoroughly pissed off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door jumped open there and then without any warning.  His sister's eager face shot through the gap like a bullet, her eyes positively <i>shining</i>.  My god, they were positively <i>radiating light</i>, like UV light sort-of bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sara even opened her mouth, Tom knew doomsday was impending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>EUREKA!</i>\" Sara pounded her rock-hard fist merrily against the door, before slamming the poor thing behind her.  \"I GOT IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you,\" Tom deadpanned.  \"But just a heads up, some people don't really give a damn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As angry as a bull,\" Sara noted.  She plopped herself down on <i>his</i> floor <i>without</i> his permission, eyeing him suspiciously.  \"Don't tell me - lemme guess...  Ashley dumped your sorry ass for Mckeller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" He scowled at the disturbing thought.  Not even close.  But explaining that he was disappointed that a bunch of candies hadn't made him as faster than Usain Bolt wouldn't help his reputation either, would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara smiled encouraging, before slapping his thighs painfully.  \"<i>ANY</i>way, I got it.  A masterplan that'd ultimately have you marry Ashley in... uh, ten years time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't 'what' me.\" Sara made air quotes with her fingers.  \"You'll be thanking me when you have three chubby babies with Ash-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Tom winced.  \"Don't go there.  Don't you dare-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-ley.  <i>Three chubby babies with Ashley</i>,\" Sara emphasized, grinning that vile grin of hers.  \"Why?  Don't wanna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Every single brain cell in Tom's head came to a resounding conclusion of '<i>yes</i>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so.\" Sara leaned in closer, dropping her voice to a conspirational whisper.  \"You know the track and field try-outs they're holding next week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's eyebrows knitted into a frown involuntarily.  He could see where this plan was heading.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter it.  <i>KILL</i> Mckeller.  Impress the girl.  Propose.  Have three bab-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY!\" Tom interrupted her.  \"I get the... idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't kidding when he said that he had 'gotten the idea'.  This was like a <i>mating game</i>, like what animals did in order to<i> earn</i> their mate.  The males fought the males, and the manlier one - the one that emerged as victor, got the female without question.  It was easy, it was <i>ingenius</i>.  (Sara didn't need to know that though.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was only one problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he fast enough?  If Mckeller were to beat him hands down in the try-outs, wouldn't the plan <i>backfire</i> on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>P.S: YES, the wish worked by the way.  It'll take effect in the next chapter for those who wish to write it.</b></span></div></div>",

She did wonder though how a barn would help with being an Olympic champion. Sure, she could train and all, but why a ranch? She wasn't that good at riding or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess I'll look around.\" she said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began walking around, still clothed in her usual tank top and shorts and shoes. The plains were pretty clean and full of grass, as one would expect in spring of this time of year. After all, the Summer Olympics were approaching soon in about a month. That being said, she wondered how she could be ready by then if she was going to win there. The candies seemed to work in very strange ways indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, some obstacles.\" she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some obstacles that one would expect horses to jump over. There were also some small posts that probably indicated some kind of track.

There was A LOT of space so she had to start running if she was going to make it there. Running through the plains seemed to feel great for her, especially with the wind flying through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels really nice.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she ran, her dark brown hair began turning darker, becoming more blackish in color and started to become longer as well, flowing around in the wind as she ran towards the little building.

Was she even in the same city as she usually lived in? It was hard to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, she looked around the immediate area, seeing anything a modern house would have, like a TV and a kitchen and all of that stuff. However, the obvious love for horses was there. In particular, many of the pictures seemed to feature the same brown horse. Sara took a close look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that horse is pretty cute. She must be a winner.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking further around, she saw something else. There was even a location she found. It was in Texas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I'm in Texas?!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was much further than she imaged she would go. She was nowhere near her brother or family. Speaking of which, what was Nate up to? Did he know that she was granted her wish? She hoped that he was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I wonder why a ranch of all places.\" she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she said earlier, she wasn't good at riding. More conventional athletics were her strong suit, and she was glad that she seemed to have more energy here then she did back home. In fact, she even looked at her muscles, and they seemed stronger. With a bit of muscle mass too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, those candies really did a number on my physique.\" she smiled, a bit glad at her improved muscles. However, beneath her panties, that tiny patch of brown fur began to grow, starting to cover a significant portion of her butt.

But the changes to her bottom were not finished yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara suddenly felt a jolt surging through her behind. It was certainly a shock.

The feeling was so unreal and so unnatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have a tail? I'm human.\" she tried to assure herself. True enough, she still looked totally average, except for the tail obviously. The black tail flipped back and forth behind her. It was a bit hypnotizing to say the least. It almost even felt natural after a while. However, Sara would have none of that. She immediately tried to find a room that had a mirror, and she thankfully found one room that had a full-length mirror. She ran up to it and turned, seeing the tail coming right out of a hole in her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening!\" she worried to herself. This was crazy. For now, the idea of the candies doing this slipped her mind, as she was a bit panicked to do much else. However, as she looked closer inside the mirror, another thing made her gasp. She pulled her shorts down a tiny bit, and could see brown fur completely covering her butt. It even extended around to her groin area. Her legs were a tiny bit covered but her shorts still covered that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that....horse fur?\" she asked herself in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that problem soon got worse. Sara soon felt a bubbling feeling in her butt, as if something was growing inside it. She turned her butt towards the mirror again, and it took everything she had to not scream. Her butt was expanding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on her butt as it slowly grew beneath her hands. She could hear tearing starting to appear on her shorts and even her panties. She tried to hold her shorts together, but it didn't seem to be much use. Then, she heard another rip, right down the center of her butt. Right after she heard that, she felt her brown butt explode through the shorts, cutting them open completely. She let go and allowed them to fall to the ground. For now, her panties still covered, but just by a thread. However, that soon faltered, as she felt her panties rip down the center as well, causing them to fall down to her feet, exposing her big brown butt, covered in fur and sporting a horse tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out of her tattered clothes and gasped as she looked at her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...don't tell me....I'm becoming a horse.\"</span></div></div>",

She gasped again, in total fear now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, if my hands change, I won't be able to call him!\" she cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she got out of the frame and tried to run though, even with her awkward frame. However, as she looked around for a phone, her fears were being realized. The dark hardened spots were forming on her fingers, and she struggled to keep them outstretched. They were being pulled towards her palm like a fist. With that, she kept looking, trying to find it in the older home. However, as she reached a family room, she looked at her left hand. Slowly, her fingers were pulled together in a fist, unable for her to keep them outstretched. Rapidly, the hard crust covered over her fist, as the dark crush hardened into a particular shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horse hoove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara almost felt on the verge of tears as she saw a phone in sight, but looked at her right hand. Similarly, it was in a fist and hardening, until she now sported a pair of twin horse hooves on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....this can't be happening...I can't believe I'm becoming an animal.\" she cried out. She looked at the phone, unable for her to use because of her hooves. Tom was in control now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom...please use the candies....change me back.\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had realized it. This situation looked very bad right now for her.</span></div></div>",

He has to wish me back, or something!\" Sara said in a panic. She didn't want to be a horse. She wanted to be human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's thoughts were interrupted by another odd sensation.

Just like her hands, her toes were started to fold inward, becoming harder and darker. Unlike her hands, though, her feet were covered by shoes, and as her feet changed, and as her feet grew into much wider hooves, her shoes started to rip apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Come on...\" Sara whispered, trying to fit through the door, and finally she got through, and she was back in the open field. The force at which she escaped the door frame was so great that Sara stumbled onto her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, at the same time she got out of the door, her feet finished up their transformation. Her feet completely folded into dark hard messes of hooves, and her shoes ripped apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looked in horror, as he feet now matched her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to get help.\" Sara said, as she tried to stand up.

Part of her mind was fighting, trying to constantly remind herself that she has started today as a human being, not as a horse.

As he crawled over to them, his ears widened and moved to the top of his head, increasing his ability to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffed around a little around the area with the food, taking in the smell of the room. Even after he finished sniffing, his nose continued to twitch, and change, as it grew smaller and smaller, and pinker and pinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nose twitched even more as he used his tiny little hands to grab one of the seeds, and he started to stuff the seed in his mouth, as his teeth changed, making it easier for him to crunch the seed down. His face also changed, starting to push outwards, changing the entire structure of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom!\" A female voice cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom finished his eating and turned around at the call of his name. As he turned, his golden fur moved over his head, completeing his transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my favorite little guy?\" the voice said. A giant hand appeared outside of the cage, unlocked the cage door, and reached it out to Tom. Tom quickly climbed on to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked up at the owner of the hand, and realized it was his own owner, Ashley. Ashley smiled wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my favorite little hamster?\" Ashley beamed, as she scratched Tom with one of her other fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom excitedly crawled up Ashley's arm, causing Ashley to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you'll always be near me, Tom.\" Ashley laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom agreed.</span></div></div>",

Despite its size, she couldn't see any animals inside. It was totally empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they have a large tank, but no animals. That's weird.\" she said to herself.

In that moment, Brittany started to look at Janice differently. For come reason, Janice felt familiar to her now, as if they were best friends. But Janice was more than a friend. She was a caretaker who feed her and helped her make millions of people happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, why was she thinking these things?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, dad told me to be very careful what I wish for.\" muttered Tom, thinking. \"So I think my first wish should be to understand how the candies work.\" he paused. \"Only which color candy would grant such a wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom studied the candies more carefully and discovered that each color had three shades which could have meant anything from different levels of power to subtle differences in the types of wishes they grant. Frowning, studied the candies more and found tiny lettering on each one. The red candies stated 'hot wish' where the blue candies stated 'cold wish'. Again, they could have meant anything. \"I know better not to jump into anything without knowing what was there.\" he said to himself. \"Only, I have to do something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making a decision, Tom opened the lid and reached in, grabbing a grey candy with the word 'neutral' on it and put it in his mouth before closing the lid. As he chewed, he noticed that it had no real flavor. Only he knew he had to make a wish so, before swallowing it, he stated, \"I wish I knew how these wishing candies worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom felt the candy glide down his throat then turned to the jar to find a large label appear onto it as if it were always there. Taking the jar into his hands, Tom read the label....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the new owner of the candies of change. Unless you freely give this jar away or the entire jar is stolen, they will only grant wishes for you. A candy freely given will grant one a wish however, you must take it from the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Each color represents a different type of wish. Each shade of said color represents different interpretation of that type of wish. There are seven different colors, each with three shades. The grey candies have only one shade, they are for curiosity wishes. The white candies reverse any previous wish. Please read the following directions carefully to avoid accidents as they can either enhance or ruin a person's life.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A WISH BEFORE YOU SWALLOW, THE WISH WILL FALL ONTO YOU!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed candies are 'hot' wishes, meaning anger, enhancement, or mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep read is hot Cinnamon, this grants a wish against one you are angry with. Be warned that revenge is a fool's game. Aim for getting even only or the wish may backfire onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mid red color is sweet cherry, this grants a wish for someone you want to enhance, to make 'hot'. This works for ones property or person. Fair warning! This is a temporary wish unless the person effected truly wants this change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light red color is a red berry, this grants a wish for someone you wish to play a prank on. Be warned, the larger the mischief, the greater the chance the prank will fall back onto you. Do not be overzealous.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom gulped. \"I can see dad having an interesting childhood, playing with these.\" he said. \"I had better read up on all of the candies before I make anymore wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, another knock came to his door, it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, as his hair stopped growing to his mid back, there was not a single hair anywhere else she could see on his body!  Ashley turned back to look Tom in the eye and saw that his face was shifting. His cheek bones rose slightly as his eyes became slightly wider and his nose shrank, giving him a very feminine face. Then his square shoulders began to round out to a more feminine shape as they shrank slightly, looking more and more like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is a nightmare!\"</i> thought Ashley, feeling helpless. <i>\"Why is this happening!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley winced, seeing Tom's hips pull away from the body slightly with a distinctive crunch then watched in horror as a certain bulge in his pants fell completely flat as she heard his belly grumble slightly as if something was shifting inside. Within a minute, Tom was no longer a boy but a girl wearing boys' clothing. He blinked, as if coming out of a trance then screamed as he discovered what had happened to him. \"Ashley!\" 'she' screamed, tearing up. \"What have you done!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I didn't ask for this!?\" stammered Ashley, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These candies grant wishes!\" screamed Tom, crying. \"You just wished I was more like a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned completely white. \"What!?!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did you bring me some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded, thankful that Tom had no hair on his chest and produced the skirt and top combo with the panties and training bra. \"These should fit you.\" <i>\"Lord knows why you would want to wear them.\"</i> \"I'll give you some privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stepped out of the bathroom and sighed. \"I hope he doesn't want to go out anywhere, wearing that.\" she muttered, worried. \"He'd be a laughing stock if he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom, Tom removed his clothing and pulled on the pink butterfly panties. He gave a small grin, feeling them slide on. \"Finally, some 'normal' clothing.\" he whispered. \"The sooner I'm dressed the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No! No!\"</i> Tom screamed inside. <i>\"Wake up, you idiot! You're a boy! Look in the mirror!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of inner Tom must have reached the outside as he looked in the mirror. Only inner Tom screamed seeing his face smooth as glass where there once was the beginnings of facial stubble and shoulder length hair where it was once just barely passed the ears. \"A little make up, maybe.\" he said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\"</i> screamed inner Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom took the bra in hand and put it on with a little effort then slid the skirt on, clipping it closed at the side and zipping it up before slipping on the tube top. With his smooth skin and longish hair, he looked just like a regular girl. \"Much better.\" she said. \"Now, on with my day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Tom's little brother, James, walked into Tom's bedroom. He was a near mirror image of his older brother and often looked up to him. \"Tom?\" he called, looking around. \"Tom, where are you?\" he spotted the jar of candies and smiled. \"Cool, Tom got some treats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Tom usually always shared, James reached in and grabbed a piece of light pink candy. Chewing on it, he made a face. \"Lemonade, just my luck.\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard some giggles and looked out the window to see a group of girls walking passed, talking to each other about hair styles and boyfriends. Still chewing the candy, James shook his head. \"Girls, I really wish I could understand them better.\" he then swallowed the candy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only, to her shock, she saw James standing there, holding his sides, screaming in pain. \"James!\" yelled Ashley, concerned. \"What's wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did not answer, he seemed to be in agony. Ashley winced hearing bones cracking within him as his body slowly shrank several inches, changing to what could only be described as more feminine proportions. The light hair on his legs seemed to retreat into his body, leaving his skin looking silk like smooth, as his hair grew out, kissing his shoulders before  it changed to a lighter brown color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" gasped Ashley. \"James!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me!\" screamed James, through gritted teeth. \"It hurts! It hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crack echoed from James' thigh area, causing him to scream again. Ashley watched in horror as James' small hips pulled outward with a loud cracking sound while a distinct bulge in his shorts fell completely flat as he continued to scream in agony. \"Ashley, <i>please!</i>\" he screamed, begging. \"Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley felt completely helpless, not knowing what was causing this to happen and did the only thing she could think of, pull James into a warm hug as his body continued to change. \"It's almost over, James.\" she whispered, hoping. \"Hang on, buddy. Ride it through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she held him, Ashley felt Jame's stomach and back cave in slightly before becoming firm and felt something growing onto his chest. <i>\"Oh, man...\"</i> she thought. <i>\"He's becoming a she!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames cried out, feeling something shifting in his crotch region while also feeling something trying to break out of his upper chest. \"Ah! Ow! (moan!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo orbs pushed outward, forming the beginnings of a pair of breasts as the pain finally subsided. James stopped screaming but he, or rather, she was still moaning from the experience. \"Don't touch the candy.\" she said, breaking the hug. \"It packs a really mean punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The candy?\" asked Ashley, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the jar and began to read the label that was on it. As she did, all the color drained from her face as she realized what was happening. \"Did you make a wish when you were chewing on that candy?\" she asked, turning to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded. \"Yeah, it was lemonade.\" she replied, making a face. \"It real bitter too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... James, you might want to take a look at yourself.\" said Ashley, wincing. \"I think these candies grant wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" asked James, not yet noticing her new voice. \"What are you talking aou...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in mid sentence as she looked at herself and screamed at the top of her lungs...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nate was running ahead of Tom, to see what had happened as Tom seemed hysterical about Ashley changing into a 'member of the family'. <i>\"I hope she didn't wish to be 'man's best friend'.\"</i> thinking of a dog, Nate thought. <i>\"Those wishes are hard to cancel out, especially if it was a stolen wish.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate had a box of normal colored candies in his hand, hoping to switch the two out then coach Tom in changing everyone back privately.

Only, upon colliding with girl James, the box ripped open, hitting the top of the jar and every last normal candy mixed with the wishing candies! Nate felt sick as he was this happen and turned to girl James, annoyed. \"Do you know what happens to those who try to steal the entire jar of wishing candies... <i>young lady?</i>\" he asked, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl James gulped, shaking her head and Nate sighed. \"Always read the label completely before using anything.\" said Nate, still scolding. \"If you try to steal the entire jar, the last wish you made will lock until the candies are returned. Normally this would not be an issue but we have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Tom, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to have you switch the wishing candies with a box of normal candies so we could avoid any more stolen wishes.\" explained Nate, glaring at his new daughter. \"Only 'Janet' had other plans and tried to run off with them. We collided and the normal candies got mixed in with the wishing ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" asked Janet, nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate sighed again, more to control himself. \"It means that, until we can separate the normal candies from the wishing ones and return the jar back to Tom's room, your stolen wish is locked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet screamed, feeling his legs pulling together and looked to see his pants fusing into a tight skirt which then fluffed out, becoming a denim skirt before the short sleeves of his T-shirt fluffed out then merged with his new skirt  before it turned pink and began to feel softer to Janet's skin. Before long, Janet was wearing a pink princess dress. \"Let's do that now!\" said Janet, desperate. \"I'm sorry!, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\" said Tom, looking at the jar. \"All the candies look the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but they don't <i>feel</i> the same.\" said Nate, still annoyed. \"Remember when I asked you to open the jar for the first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nodded, understanding. \"What can we do, for now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, return the candies to your room.\" said Nate as Tom took back the jar. \"I need to make a phone call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked off to his room.

Tom placed the box on a nearby park bench as the group began conversing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam then moved towards the bench and sat down and started to listen to the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what's in here anyway?\" he wondered to himself. He opened up the box without anyone hearing him. Inside, he was surprised to see a bunch of odd-looking candies inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these? This is all Tom got?\" wondered Adam. Despite this, Adam felt tempted to take one. So, he did just that, taking one of the box's contents for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he had bothered to read the note that was inside the box. He was quite impatient that way. Little did he know what power the little candies possessed. Like they were in the past, these candies could fulfill the wishes of whoever ate them. Of course, Nate and his friends never bothered telling this story to their kids. They didn't need to know and who knows if they would even believe them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not a bad flavor\" he thought contently.

It can be such a beautiful and harmful thing.  But instead of the harm coming from some pent up emotions or hurt feelings, it was going to cause a level of chaos that can only be achieved through magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie, Tom, and Ashley were having a conversation about schoolwork when all of the sudden Cassie stopped mid-sentence and got a dazed look in her eyes.

Inside the lid were big letters that read, \"Wishing Candies,\" along with lots of little print that none bothered to read as they each took a candy and plopped it in their mouths. They each smiled and sighed at the taste as they gazed out across the field at the end of the street. A breeze blew smells of the farm that was just over the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wilson's lived at the edge of the development. Beyond was a great field where they all could play in Mr. McHaper's pasture. He didn't mind as long as they didn't disturb the animals. Everyone was glad that he had refused to sell to the developers and enjoyed having open space in the sea of houses that had grown up over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm. These are good. I wonder why they're called Wishing Candies?\" Adam posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because they're so good that you wish to have another ... and another,\" Tom chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in the farm smell and looking out across the field wistfully, Ashley sighed, \"I wish I had a pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it with girls and ponies?\" Adam said as he rolled his eyes, and Tom looked over at him with a smile ignoring the brief, soft sound behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"POOF !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit making fun, dude,\" Tom told him before turning around. \"It's OK, Ashley, he ...

You probably just upset her, and she just disappeared,\" Tom told him as he looked around the porch. \"I wish I knew where she went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"POOF !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing that the candy was very wet and sticky or it would have rolled down Adam's tongue and out his open mouth. His eyes went big, and the expression of shock stayed plastered on his face for almost a minute before he managed to force his lips together and turn to look at the box of candies. Underneath \"Wishing Candies,\" he read all the fine print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">\"These candies grant wishes when stated aloud with one in the mouth. Yes, they are magical, but they have some limitations. They cannot be used to harm anyone nor create a situation that would upset the balance of nature. Also, these grant wishes, <i>not</i> miracles.

Fortunately, none of Ashley, Tom, or Adam were affected. Ashley was standing in a stall next to a young, little horse gently brushing it. She now had on denim overalls and cowgirl boots. Her hair was pulled back in a pony tail, and she was intent on her work. Tom was perched halfway up the stall's gate so his arms were folded on it, and he was watching Ashley. He now had on jeans and a red plaid cowboy shirt and cowboy boots.  Also, in the stall was a much bigger mare that seemed intent on nuzzling Tom's face no matter how many times he tried to push her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you climb over and brush her. You know how she loves when you do that,\" Ashley said looking at Tom's latest attempt to not get a horse kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying, but she keeps slobbering all over me before I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley just giggles as Tom finally makes it over the gate, \"I'm so glad that grandpa said this pony is mine as long as I take care of him.\" The mare gives Tom a push in the back in the direction of the horse brushes hanging in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Alright. I'm getting the brush,\" Tom calls over his shoulder as he tries to keep ahead of the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really likes you, dude. I bet she's jealous with Ash in there, too,\" comes Adam's voice as he strolls over to the stall still dressed in his school clothes as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom and Ashley both blush while the mare whinnies as Tom starts to brush her and then snorts over the gate at Adam's remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least she likes me. Better not get too close,\" was Tom's reply. That was followed by the mare shaking her head up and down and blowing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that she can understand us,\" Adam said as he waited and watched a few feet from the stall. After a pause he added, \"So I guess this means that these candies really do grant wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" chirps Ashley with a big smile. \"And it's so great that Mr. McHarper is now my grandpa and I can come here, and <i>stay</i> here, any time I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer happy expression clearly indicated how her wish for a pony had come true in a more realistic way in life than just dropping a horse in her lap. Tom's wish had carried him here and made him a part of it rather than just filling his head with the new facts. Of course, Adam's wish was simple and straightforward which is why he was just teleported into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, dude, you do look like the perfect farmer's couple all decked out and happily brushing away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tom and Ashley again blushed brightly, and the mare nodded again making Adam laugh before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we be doing with these?\" Adam asked holding out the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone knew it, the mare reached over the gate and grabbed the box in her teeth. Her action turned herself just enough to knock Tom off balance sending him crashing into Ashley and both of them tumbled into the hay in the corner becoming thoroughly entangled. As they struggled to right themselves and clear the straw from their clothes and hair, the mare placed the box beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's already got this planned out for you two,\" Adam chuckled again as the mare whinnied and nodded causing Tom and Ashley to laugh and blush so much it looked like the hay would catch fire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If it wasn't for what they saw earlier with the woman, they would have been totally shocked. In place of the remaining pony that Ashley had been tending to, was a small girl around 14 years old. She had an average build, and how flowing brown hair that went down to her shoulders. She had a rather beautiful face with some freckles and had piercing green eyes. She was wearing a plain yellow dress with some boots on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, w-what happened?\" asked the girl, seemingly in a daze. Ashley immediately rushed over to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now, let me help\" said Ashley, assuring the girl. Tom came over and helped with the girl's right side, helping her to stand up. Unlike the woman from earlier, this girl didn't seem to have her bearings correct yet, as her legs continued to wobble underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Am I...h-human again?\" asked the girl. Ashley and Tom looked at each other. So this girl used to be human as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are. Don't worry, we'll help out\" said Ashley, as she and Tom helped the girl slowly walk over to a seat. Adam waited in the back, observing the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember your name? I mean, your <b>real</b> name?\" asked Ashley, hoping to learn more about the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Annie. Annie Wilson\" said the girl, able to look up at the group now. Their eyes widened at the name and Adam and Ashlet looked over at Tom. Was there some relation? Tom didn't seem so sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second guys! 'Wilson' is a common last name. That doesn't mean she's related to me\" said Tom. Adam and Ashley looked down, realizing that Tom was right. However, Tom then went into thought. \"However, I do recall dad saying that he had a cousin that went missing long ago. Might not be related though\" said Tom. Annie's eyes widened and she looked at Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad? What's his name?\" asked Annie. Tom looked at her, perplexed at her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate Wilson\" stated Tom. Annie gasped, her right hand covering her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're Nate's son? Have I been gone for really that long?\" stammered Annie, almost sounding hysterical. Ashley came back over and gently patted Annie on the back, giving her reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, just relax. We'll figure this out\" said Ashley. Annie seemingly calmed down after that. She then turned to Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my dad?\" asked Tom. Annie sighed in thought for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That story your dad talked about was correct. That cousin of your dad's that went missing was me\" stated Annie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!!\" yelled Tom, almost making the shed vibrate at the outburst. Adam actually had to cover his ears briefly. Annie didn't seem to mind. Then, Adam walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain yourself\" he stated simply. </span></div></div>",

After about a minute, Annie calmed down enough to talk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should start from the beginning. That isn't the first batch of magic candies that our family has had. Your father, Nate, got a jar of them for his 15th birthday\" said Annie. The group was shocked to hear that this wasn't the first time this had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean dad had these too? Why didn't he tell me?\" asked Tom, getting all confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine he didn't want to worry you. Besides, you probably wouldn't have believed him\" explained Annie, to which Tom actually had to agree to. She then continued, \"Anyway, after he got the candies, he experienced many transformations to himself and others. It got quite chaotic at times. Then, eventually, my family and I visited him. I learned about the candies and we experimented together. Then, we ended up making a wish that gave me witch powers\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was again shocked, and a litle scared, to learn that Annie had witch powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you want witch powers?\" asked Ashley. For the first time in a long while, Annie actually chuckled to herself, confusing the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was to have a little fun. You see, a lot of people found my green eyes to be somewhat....surreal. Infact, they even gave me the nickname \"Little Witch\". I of course didn't have powers at that time but it was a source of amusement for us\" explained Annie, to which Tom and the others nodded in understanding. Tom had to admit her green eyes were rather striking, beautiful even. Then, Annie's tone began to become more somber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that, we had fun with both my powers and the candies, with some of Nate's friends eventually learning about it. However, a certain....incident happened\" said Annie, becoming a little more fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we got to the last couple of candies, we tried to have as much fun with what we had left. However, we ended up using so much magic, me in particular, that things got way out of control. I tried to stop it but I was practically powerless. It took all I had to hold what magic I could within me. If that magic had continued to manifest, it could have reshaped everything in the city, if not most of the surrounding area. Nate had no choice. He had to use the last candy to set everything right. I was basically a living seal to keep the magic at bay for the time being. We knew that the magic had to be vanquished, but we had no idea what would happen to me. Nate didn't want to do it, but I told him it was the only way. So, he wished for all traces of the magic to cease and dissappear. Then, there was a blinding light. I couldn't see anything\" Annie explained, pausing a bit to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, Adam, and Ashley were shocked to hear that such things happened. Who knows if they would have even been born if the magic had lashed out and changed the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened next?\" asked Tom. Annie recovered a bit of her composure and began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the light was blinding me, I somehow felt both calm and wierd. I could feel that the magic had been taken care of, but my body felt alien to me. Like it was no longer human. The next thing I knew, the light died down and I found myself in that very stall\" she said, pointing towards said stall. Tom and the others pretty much made the connection right there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tired to move, but I felt like I couldn't. I couldn't move my fingers or toes and I couldn't stand up. It took one look at myself to realize that, at the expense of destroying the raging magic, I had become a pony. At that moment, I tried to use magic to get myself out. However, I realized that all traces of the candies' magic were gone now. I had no magic, and I believed myself to be stuck as a pony for the rest of my life\" Annie finished, tears flowing down her face again. This time, all three of them came up and comforted her; Tom and Adam patting her on the shoulders with Ashley giving her a gentle hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so tragic. It must have beeen awful for everyone to move on without you\" said Ashley. Annie nodded grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what dad told me, he said that wanted posters were put out for this missing cousin, but nothing ever turned up. Eventually, he said that he believed her to be dead. He even has a small memorial in our backyard. He always takes time to go out and just look at it\" explained Tom. At that, Annie perked up a bit, with a ghost of a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he never forgot me\" said Annie in a bit of a dreamy voice, a hint of red gracing her cheeks. Then, Adam stepped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you endure all those years being a pony? I'm surprised you didn't go insane\" asked Adam. Annie turned her attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My memories of being a pony are a little cloudy at the moment. However, I remember that, not too long after I started living here, that I felt my humanity weaken, like my mind was adjusting to that of a pony. I guess my thoughts became less complex, and I began forgetting about my human life. Maybe that was my body's way of trying to lessen the pain of losing everyone I loved and cared about\" explained Annie. Tom and Adam shuddered at the thought of losing who you once were like that. Then, Ashley brought up another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, why do you look like you're 14 years old? Shouldn't you be as old Nate?\" asked Ashley. Annie shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps your wish restored me back to how I was before my transformation. I'm so grateful to all of you for giving me back my life\" said Annie, a bright smile adorning her face. Tom had to admit she was pretty cute when she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only problem is that who knows how long it'll be before I get my bearing back. I haven't walked on two legs or picked things up in over 2 decades\" Annie laughed sheepishly. The whole group gave a  good laugh at that, happy that the mood was lightening up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was especially glad that they unknowingly saved someone's life.</span></div></div>",

Tom barely had time to react as he suddenly felt larger and was standing on all fours. Dark fur had surrounded his body, with an alien-like feeling coming from a newly formed tail on his rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was too shocked to do anything but stare at the others and look around at his own fury body and tail swishing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom, unfortunately, gulped at his unfortunate wish causing an unfortunate swallow of the remains of the candy in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, on the other hand (or hoof in her case now), was not one to be without words. As she started to voice her disappointment in Tom not being more careful, she found that she no longer had words. Everything she tried to say came out in in whinnies and neighs or snorts and nickers. Finally frustrated, she makes a loud squeal with her mouth shut (horse talk for NOoooooo!), \"EEEE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little pony already with them moved towards Tom and nickered then made a blow sound as if introducing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"> the following is translated from horse talk</span> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the pony said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" nickered Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Little Paint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony then moved to Adam, and they did the same. Finally, he moved to Ashley who, although agitated by the situation, also greeted the pony with a soft blow. The pony then nuzzled against her showing the affection it had for her back when she was human and brushed it, gave it carrot treats, and talked sweetly to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam continued to walk around the stall and testing the gate with his nose. It wouldn't budge, and he became frustrated trying harder as he sometimes neighed and sometimes squealed at the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ashley and Little Paint \"talked\" and touched, Tom remembered how the mare had gotten a candy, and he rustled over to the box pushing it with his nose. He thought that if he could get a candy, he could wish them back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright. Alright. I'm coming,\" came the voice of Mr. McHaper. As he appeared in front of the stall, he shook his head and said, \"Adam, you are always so anxious to get out to the pasture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom looked up in surprise when he heard the voice. They had just turned into ponies, but Mr. McHaper's comment sounds like they have always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It must be part of my wish,</i>\" Tom thought. \"<i>It all must have something to do with finding out who the woman was who changed from being the mare.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tom pondered how this all would answer his question and also how they were going to get back to being human, he took a closer look at his two friends and Little Paint. Everyone looked the same size with the same pony features - head, snout, ears, mane, tail, hooves. If it wasn't that they each had different fur, Tom was sure he would never be able to tell who was who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam had brown fur, mane and tail. There was a white spot on his forehead that almost looked like an \"A.\" Adam was  neighing and looking at Mr. McHaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us out. We're not really ponies. You have to get us out of here,\" Adam was saying, but in horse language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, just settle down, and I'll let you out,\" Mr. McHaper said patting Adam on the \"A\" on his head and opening the gate to the stall. \"Now, you know the way to the pasture, so behave and just go right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam turned to Tom and neighed, \"Now's our chance to escape. Come on.\" Adam's chestnut eyes were big with excitement; and after saying those words, he bolted past Mr. McHaper and trotted out of the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. McHaper laughed as he watched Adam run then looked back into the stall. \"OK, you three. Let's get going,\" he urged the rest of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Paint and Ashley neighed and then followed Adam walking side by side as they nickered to each other like close friends. Little Paint was just that - a pony with big white and brown patches seemingly painted on him. Tom followed Ashley seeing her clearly now. She was a white pony but with golden-blond tail and mane. Having taken a quick glance at what he could see of himself, he knew he was mostly, if not all, black which would match his previous human hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked to the pasture, Tom was so amazed about how being a pony was so natural, how he could walk on all fours and even control his tail in different directions and force even though he had never had one before. He even looked forward to chomping on some of the nice tall grass at the far side of the pasture and racing Adam like they use to do but as galloping ponies across the open field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wait!</i>\" he suddenly thought and stopped. \"<i>I'm thinking like a horse, too, and it feels right. I hope we don't start believing that we are.</i>\" Then Tom got very scared. His pony eyes got big as baseballs as he spun around and saw Mr. McHaper close the pasture gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The candies!</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A wave of understanding then rolled over his entire body, giving him the ability to see how cute ponies are. He smiled at the thought. He now knew that puppies and kittens were cute, but ponies were even more so because they were bigger but still only the size of  a child. They were small like a child. So similar were children and ponies that having one became the highest priority. It would be absolute happiness to have one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this happened, Adam's body shrank down from its normal size down to about Ashley's waist. His hair flowed down to his shoulders in a straight fashion and his body became as delicate as a little girl. In addition, his clothes adjusted to him, becoming a yellow shirt and skirt with white flats. Ashley and Tom watched in amazement and slight enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a pony,\" flew from Adam's mouth in a pitch much higher than usual. That was because Adam had completely changed physically, now being a ten year old girl with all the likes and dreams of a typical girl that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want a pony, you will have to take care of it,\" Ashley teased Adam. \"You'll have to brush it and feed it and clean out its stall and ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew! That's gross. I'm not cleaning up any horse poop,\" Adam replied making both Tom and Ashley laugh. \"Two can play this game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a mint, Adam said, \"I wish ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

OK,\" Tom interrupted chuckling. \"Just remember the time that the goats ate the ribbon off your pigtail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley cringed as she got wide-eyed. \"That was so scary at first. Everyone was laughing at me, and those were new ribbons I had just bought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's eyes started to water, and Tom came over and put his arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there. It's alright. You're not hurt, and I'll buy you a new ribbon,\" he consoled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Ashley looked up into Tom's eyes.

Finally their clothes became very tight seeming to merge with their skin, and their faces stretched just before landing softly and again seeing their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Ashley saw a small grassy area with a single shade tree and surrounded by a white picket fence with a bucket of water in one corner.

Every move she made and everything she did or thought, like walking and grabbing the carrot then chomping it down, came naturally. She wasn't concerned about not wearing clothes or being able to sit on furniture. Her dusty blond fur and tail was perfect in her mind, and the pasture felt like home with everything she needed. It had a kitchen with a bucket of water and grass to snack on, ground made a good cushion or bed, and even doing her business in a far corner where others could see didn't bother her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing she felt was that she was young again like a six or seven years old full of energy and wanting to run and play in the pasture and nibble some delicious green grass. Even sticking her nose in the bucket to drink the warm water was all she wanted for refreshment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom also felt completely like the little goat he transformed into covered in dark brown fur. He looked around at children moving on the paths outside his fence and tried to catch their attention in hope of getting another snack. That carrot was so good, but it just whetted his appetite. Maybe the parents would buy their son or daughter some of the oats from the feeding dispenser, and they would hold it in their hand so he could munch them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, none of the humans wandering around were interested. They were all headed towards the big barn where there was to be an animal show-and-tell. Tom and Ashley knew this because they had heard the PA announcement just before Adam left. Actually, that's where Adam was heading. They both wondered if someday they would be old enough to be part of the show. For now, though, they were left to entertain themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Tom bleated as he felt something nip his left hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're it!\" Ashley baa'd then took off running across the pasture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to follow Tom replied, \"I'll get you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a marvelous afternoon with the sun playing peak-a-boob behind scattered clouds and a slight breeze that kept them cool as they romped, rolled, and snacked in the pasture. After the show, several children did buy some oats, and both got quite full by closing time. After a drink to wash it all down they trotted up a hill and lay in the grass watching the sun turn orange as it drifted into the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clouds turned red overhead until the dark blue of the night sky washed that away letting those tiny, glistening dots of light shine through it. Everything was perfect. Neither Tom nor Ashley had thought about Adam or the candies since the show. They had too much fun being baby goats. They were happy and tired now from their exciting day and ignored the older goats bleating to them to come to the pasture gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To-ahahahahah-m! A-a-a-a-a-a-a-shle-e-e-e-e-e-e!\" the does and billies called, but our two transformed kids had fallen asleep on the side of the hill never hearing their cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly, Mr. McHaper wandered out into the pasture and picked up the two sleeping kids. With one under each arm, he carried them back to the barn and put them into their stall for the night. They only awoke briefly, but drifted right back into dreams of carrot flavored candies that would change them into stars of the petting zoo once they wished it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He munched some straw from the floor even though it tasted like ..., well straw, not that it bothered him as a goat, but he really wanted some oats or a juicy carrot. So he chewed just a little to stem his appetite. Then he looked over at Ashley still dozing and pushed his snout to rouse her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was still dreaming of standing by the fence with Tom watching their own youngens scurry around the field. She had had this dream lots of times due to her crush on Tom, but this time she and Tom weren't leaning on the fence rail nor were they following the antics of a little boy and girl. They were happy goats watching their kids playing just like she and Tom did the day before. She felt so good as Tom's nose nuzzled her. Then she felt a nip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" she bleated and sprung to her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to wake up sleepy head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the dim light, she frowned at Tom and baa'd, \"It's still early. We won't be let out for a while yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Maybe not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom winked at her then walked slowly to the gate trying not to be obvious. Looking around he lay his head sideways with one ear down and pushed it between the gate's slats. Ashley was shocked and almost cried out but thought better of it. She trotted closer and heard a sound of wood clacking and rubbing together before Tom pulled his head back leaving the gate just a little bit ajar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" she whispered coming closer to see for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom stepped aside with a mischievous goatly grin and let her look at the gate. She inspected it looking up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" she bbleated like before and jumps against the gate pushing it open and stumbling out to the center of the barn. All the does and billies looked at her as Tom followed her out then turned and pushed the gate shut letting the latch fall back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! We're not suppose to be out,\" she cried looking around frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on, Ash,\" Tom baa'd back. Then he nodded his head for her to follow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a family of a sow and five little piglets nursing away. Tom felt his own tummy rumble wishing he could have some nice warm milk, too, and he pushed against the gate trying to get it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha snorted deeply, \"Oin't you goina be troub-b-b-ble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom jumped back at the harsh sound deciding maybe her could find something to eat where there wasn't such a large, unfriendly momma. So he wandered over to where Ashley was standing. It was a tall gate and different than the others with a chain over the posts high above his head. The aroma from inside was making him salivate. There were sweet oats and carrots inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom put his front hooves up the gate, but he could not come close to the latch or the chain, and he couldn't get his head through any of the slats even from the side of an open stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll have to wait for someone bigger to get us some food,\" Ashley sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom just looked around and trotted over to the big barn doors where a slit let in a beam of the rising sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can get out to the pasture and have some nice, sweet grass,\" he said to Ashley as he pushed against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be-e-e-e-e-etter not,\" bleated one of the doe goats that Tom thought might be Ashley's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and looked back at Ashley motioning her over with his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come and help.

The smell of the oats and carrots as well as the slurping piglets was too much for her little goat brain. If she could get grass quickly, it would be great. So she trotted over to the big barn doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting their snouts to the door, they pushed. The door shook and rattled but didn't move. Tom pushed even harder, but his hooves slid behind and out from under him sending him to the floor in a four-legged split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went down, Ashley stopped and stared for a couple moments before bursting into bleating laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah ah ha ha ha ah ha ha ah ha,\" she chuckled at the look of the tiny goat stretched out like a stuffed rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom pouted, \"Not funny,\" as he scrambled to get his hooves to stop sliding on the slick wood floor. Finally he was back upright, and Ashley stopped with only a silly grin on her baby goat lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try the other door,\" Tom suggested tilting his head for Ashley to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Tom made sure his tiny hooves were braced against the edge between the barn floor planks and instructed Ashley to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready,\" Tom baa'd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom then made three sharp bleats. \"One, Two, THREE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that both pushed as hard as they could, and the door opened just a bit more, but that was all. Tom stared angrily at the door and paced in a circle frustrated. Then he trotted back and set himself to ram his head into the door like any stubborn goat until Ashley stepped in front of the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, ... I think ...\" she baa'd, \"That it's enough,\" and she started to push her head through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, they were still young kids; and as a tiny goat, she was able to squeeze through. Tom immediately put his head through then struggled and grunted before finding he was now stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley almost laughed again but decided best to just help her good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twist your shoulders so one goes through first,\" she offered in a couple baa's and bleats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom did as he was told, and soon both of them were standing in the low rays of the morning sun gazing out to the white fence around the pasture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley suddenly took off at full gallop baaing back, \"Race ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was caught off guard shaking himself from his narrow escape between the doors, but he immediately turned round and shot after her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two little goats - barely the size of a Jack Russell dog - wandered along between the fence and the lane leading from the barn to the main road. They tried the very few clumps of grass that were very short by a couple of the fence posts, but it was not very tasty. Soon they were at the end of he lane where the fence made a left hand turn running beside a small ditch that separated it from the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I don't know, Tom. Maybe we should go back,\" Ashley baa'd with a trembling tone as she looked at the wide macadam stretch as if seeing it for the first time. \"I don't think we should go too far. It's s-scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom too felt shivers no longer recognizing the road for what it was. His little goat brain had forgotten most of what he knew as a human kid. He was thinking like an animal, a hungry baby animal. He stood there looking down the road one way and then the other trying to decide what to do. His tummy again rumbled its emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's good grass on the other side,\" he mumbled looking over the dark floor that ran forever in both directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard a loud noise, then a very large dark cloud came growling right towards and then past them with a thunderous sound. The two kids were frozen in their tracks mesmerized by the giant machine that rolled by, and their hearts were racing even after it passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT-T-T-Tom, l-l-let's go back,\" Ashley called so softly Tom almost didn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was scared but also curious as to what the giant thing was that rolled down the long floor. He thought about chasing after it to find out, but it was already out of sight. Maybe he could wait for another one and see if he could stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAHAHHHHHHM!\" Ashley bleated as loud as she could as she saw he wasn't following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom turned and looked at her, shrugged and started back bouncing in a few quick leaps to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that someone has something for us to eat when we get back,\" he baa'd as his stomach twisted and gurgled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they heard that sound again causing Tom to stop, turn and stare. This time the big shiny machine slowed and turned into the lane heading right for them. However, just before it reached them, it stopped and stared at them with big white glassy eyes and a large mouth with funny looking teeth. It continued to purr but much quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few moments, a leg opened up to one side, and a little girl came walking around from behind it. She was carrying two carrots and a small box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley could smell the sweet vegetable but didn't move. She had never taken a carrot from anyone that wasn't on the other side of a fence. In her little mind, she knew that she shouldn't, but her tummy was grumbling to her very loud. Tom's tummy was also talking to him, and he thought the girl looked familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the girl from yesterday that gave us a carrot then went to the show in the barn,\" Tom baa'd to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's no fence between us.

Their little hearts were beating furiously both from the exertion as well as from fear. They were scared, very scared, of a human even if she was just a little girl and had carrots. Plus there was that big, angry looking machine that might roar to life and try to gobble them up even though it was setting still and purring like a friendly kitty, but they knew cats have claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shot right into the barn not noticing that the doors were now wide open. Tom slid across the floor boards forgetting how slippery they were. Ashley saw what happened ahead of her and slowed before entering the barn trotting quickly and carefully after Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chickens began cackling hysterically as he slid through them like a bowling ball. Spinning like a top lying on his belly with legs splayed, he watched the barn go by him one wall at a time as if in slow motion. There was the rest of the goats in their stall, then the black-and-white cow in hers, the sow and piglets, the horses, the stall with the carrots and oats, and finally the legs of a big human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where he came to a stop with his head squarely in between two big boots. He was too exhausted and frightened to even move and just lay there staring at a bale of hay in front of the large post holding up the loft. Sparkles, the cat, was sitting on the bale holding her front paw up to clean it. She gave Tom a calm sideways glance then shook her head in disbelief before going back to her grooming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. McHaper looked down at the new arrival holding a bag of oats he was getting ready to empty into the feeding pans. Tom's snout now looked like a third boot. He blinked and felt relieved that he was safe. Mr. McHaper was almost as shocked as Tom to find the little goat's head poking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there you are,\" Mr. McHaper chuckled bending over and sharing an upside down view of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baaaaaaaaa <i>(me too)</i>,\" called Ashley from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where you two got off to. Last night you were so tired, I didn't think you'd be up early nor how ingenious you might be able to get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they heard the rumbling of the big machine approach and then go silent followed by a loud bang of metal then another. Tom scurried to his feet his heart still pounding and afraid of the sounds. He managed to stay behind Mr. McHaper as he turned round. Ashley joined Tom, both now peering out from around Mr. McHaper's legs as the little girl appeared in the doorway and then a large strange man stepped up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin'. You two, up early,\" Mr. McHaper called to them. \"How's it been going, ...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Might as well see what's in this box\" replied Tom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nod from Ashley, Tom gently opened up the box, as it was made to be opened easily. What was inside confused both of them. It was a clear jar was appeared to be some sort of candies. They were a variety of different colors, which Tom assumed to be different tastes and such. Tom was confused as to how this jar was so important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's a new product? It was a free gift after all, so it wouldn't be too grand\" said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right\" replied Tom. He should have known that a free giveaway wouldn't be something eye-opening. If Tom had to guess, there were probably about 30 candies in the jar. Then, after looking inside, Ashley found a little note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, perhaps this can explain things\" said Ashley, picking up the note and reading it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" asked Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It talks about how these candies contain special powers that reveal themselves when they are eaten by someone. It also says to be very careful about how one phrases what they say when they eat these candies\" said Ashley. Tom had no idea what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck does that mean?\" asked Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine it means these candies grant wishes or something like that to anyone who eats one of them. I think that's what it means anyway\" said Ashley, not 100% sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just great. Anything else?\" asked Tom, a little irritated at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another bit that says that some wishes may take longer than others and some might not be reversable for a certain amount of time\" said Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're supposed to believe we just got a jar of magic candies? Get real\" said Tom, hardly in the mood right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Tom. It doesn't really matter anyway. It was a free gift and we can still eat them, regardless of the magic part\" reasoned Ashley. Tom saw her point and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true\" he complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I try one?\" asked Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead\" said Tom, not really caring. Ashley opened the lid and took out one of the treats. She gently placed it in her mouth, smiling a bit as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, they're pretty tasty\" said Ashley, enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, what happens?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Here is the long-awaited sequel to Candies of Change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been 23 years since the events of the first story. Before, Nate and his friends and family discovered the wishing candies and went through many odd experiences at the expense of the powerful magic. Eventually, the candies ran out, and most of their effects wore off, leaving everyone where they were before it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and his family and friends have grown up since the time when he recieved a jar of candies for his 15th birthday. Now, since when they used up the candies, no one but him and some others remember that events happened with the candies. They had figured that the event was fully behind them, until they reappear in Nate's family once again in the hands of his oldest son, Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs many of you might be aware, the first Candies of Change focused heavily on TG-based wishes. Well, this time, I hope and encourage you to expand on this and use different wishes. Let's expand on the possibilities of what can happen to the character beyond what the first Candies did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep it PG-13! <br>\r\n2. You can have sex, but not descriptive and try not to have too much.<br>\r\n3. Keep language PG-13 and also keep it tame (like not cursing every sentence). For this story only, I am going to allow it to be 18+ rated. However, that does not permit you to go crazy and create disturbing scenes. Keep it as tame as possible.<br>\r\n4. Keep the story going and no killing the characters.<br>\r\n5. Try to make it a good length if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the charcters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Tom Wilson: Nate's 14-year old son. Very much like his father, doesn't talk alot, but very nice overall. Looks similar to Nate with his short brown hair but he has his mother's green eyes.<br>\r\n2. Sara Wilson: 13 years old and Tom's younger sister. A bit girly but a sports fanatic. Plays volleyball for her school. Keeps her dark hair really short and has her father's blue eyes.<br>\r\n3. James Wilson: 9 years old and the youngest sibling. A bit hyper and not into girls yet, like any boy his age.<br>\r\n4. Adam Hartford: 15 years old and Tom's best friend. Tries to be the \"jock\" type but can't deny that he's a good person.<br>\r\n5. Brittany Hartford: 16 years old and Adam's older sister. Long dark brown hair with green eyes. A cheerleader and can be super preppy as well as a super downer. Has a very sweet smile.<br>\r\n5. Jenna Wilson: Nicole's 2-year old daughter. Inherited her mother's bright blue eyes and brown hair. Recently learned how to talk and nevers stops showing it. Has a smile that can disarm anyone. Loves to spend time with Tom.<br>\r\n6. Ashley Ryan: 13-years old and Brandon's daughter. A bit tomboyish and has known Tom since they were 3 years old. She's in love with Tom but is too shy to say it, despite Tom sharing her feelings. A huge sports fan who is also into video games (but not obsessive). She has brown hair that goes a bit past her shoulders and A-cup breasts, as she's just beginning puberty. She's the captain of her school's gymnastics team and wants to be in the Olympics one day.<br>\r\n7. Cassie Duddly: A 15-year old girl who was born one day after Adam. An incredibly nice girl who loves music. She can sing very well and plays the guitar and violin. She and Adam met in 4th grade and have been friend ever since. Adam sports a huge crush on her. Quite beautiful for her age, like a cheerleader. Mid-height with brunette hair with brown eyes. Wants to be a singer in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning characters from the first Candies of Change:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Nate Wilson: 38 years old and Kate's husband. Happily married after the events of the first Candies and has become the CEO of a large company. Still quite fit for his age.<br>\r\n2. Kate Wilson: 38 years old. Formerly Kate Smith and now Nate's wife. Now a well-known travel agent. Quite protective of her kids. She has retained some of her tomboyish side from her teenage years, much to Nate's delight and amusement. Looks pretty good for her age, although having a few kids had led her to gain a tiny bit of weight. Still has dark hair and an average height.<br>\r\n3. Nicole Wilson: 28 years old. Nate's younger sister. Manager of a store in the city and recently divorced from her husband, due to his drinking and smoking habits. Still childish at times but has become a very lovely lady. Currently takes care of her 2-year old daughter, born after the divorce. <br>\r\n4. Erin Lowell: 36 years old. Has become a software engineer.<br>\r\n5. Trevor Wilson: 30 years old. Has become a high school math teacher, which is ironic given that he used to hate it. Quite mature since his childhood days but still likes to hang loose when he's got the chance.<br>\r\n6. Brandon Ryan: 36 years old. Has maintained a close friendship with Nate and has married. Works as an executive at a law firm. His wife is Stacy, who is very sweet if not a little naggy at times.</td>",
