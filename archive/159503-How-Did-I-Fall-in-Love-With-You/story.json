Hannah would talk to him about her friend problems, her problems with guys, and Luis would talk to her about her girl problems, and things about his buds. They felt so comfortable talking about anything, except for the feeling that they were getting when they were around each other...alone.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheir feelings became aware when they were in their junior year of high school. He had noticed her curvey figure, her breasts, her full, thick brunette hair, for what seemed like the first time. Her happy, sweet attitude to go with it. She had noticed his cute dimples, his deep brown eyes that show out from his deep black hair, and smooth deep tan skin. His toned, muscular skin, and the way he cared about her when she needed his input. These were the things they seemed not to have noticed before, but it was like a curtain had been closed before their eyes, and now they had opened, revealing everything they had to show each other.</span></div></div>",

Are you still going to Brenda's Diner with me?\" She asked, as she placed her purse strap around her.

She has these long hours, and she hardly gets much sleep,\" Hannah said as she opened her bedroom door. \"Oh,\" Luis walked over, and sat on her bed. \"Be careful, about your sweat alright?\" Hannah said with a laugh. He laughed. \"Don't worry. I wouldn't <i>think</i> about putting sweat on your sheets!\" He said with a laugh. \"Good. I'm going to go take a shower real quick. You can watch t.v. if you want, or stay up here,\" Hannah said as she walked over to where her private bathroom was. \"You know, you're lucky to have your own bathroom,\" Luis said. \"Yeah well, sometimes it isn't always my private bathroom, when Josh comes in here. That lil snot,\" Hannah said with an annoyed expression on her face. Josh was Hannah's eleven year old brother. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis stood up, and looked over at her cheerleading pictures. Hannah had become captain of the squad, and he knew she deserved it. She had been cheerleading since he could remember. That's what she had always wanted to be. His gaze shifted from her cheerleading pictures, to pictures of her and him, and just of her, and just of him. Some were even of her and her previous boyfriend. <i>They had been going out for such a long time.</i> He thought to himself, as he kept staring at that particular photo. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen he saw the photo's of them when they were young, he relized she was a cutey, even back then. He found some of her cheerleading trophies, and a track and field award, when she was in the ninth grade. She had quit track and field after that. He didn't know why, he never even thought of asking her either.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen she came out of the shower, she had a towel wrapped around her. He couldn't help but stare. \"What are you looking at?\" She asked kiddingly. Was she flirting with him? He wondered. Yeah right, she's your best friend, not your girlfriend. \"Uh-nothing. You just surprised me. That's all,\" He covered. \"Oh. Well, I'll be a few minutes. I just have to get dressed, do my hair and teeth. You want to shower? I still have some of your clothes over here,\" She said holding the clothes she had picked up, close to her. He thought about it for a moment. \"Sure. Why not. Don't want to have to make two trips,\"\r<br>\nHe said finally. \"Alright. I'll make it quick okay?\" She said, and headed back into the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah sat on the bed and began to brush her hair.  She could still smell his sweat from when he had just been sitting there only a few moments before.  Oddly enough, it did not smell like sweat usually smelled.  It was a sweet smell, she thought.  Hannah laughed at her silliness and continued to brush her hair.\r<br>\nShe heard the shower turn on and the sound of the water beating against the tub out her into a trance and she began to daydream.  She remembered how it was when they were young.  Their mothers used to always tease them and tell them that they were going to be homecoming and Prom King and Queen one day because they make such a good couple.  Of course when they were young, they thought that dating boys and girls let alone eachother was absolutely gross.\r<br>\nNow Hannah wondered why she could not be feeling the same way that she used to.  It would probably hurt his feelings if she called him a doody head now, but it would probably be mush easier to hate him than to be falling in love with him.\r<br>\nWait a minute.\r<br>\nDid she just tell herself that she was falling in love with Luis?  Her best friend?  Some one who is like a brother to her now? \r<br>\nYou know that you think of himas much more than a brother,  voice in her head was telling her.\r<br>\n\"No I do not!!\" she said out loud.\"\r<br>\n\"Okay okay so I'll get them myself..\" Luis had come out of the bathroom apperantly while she had been arguing with herself.  He was standing in the door way with her too small bathrobe on.  He was doing his best to cover himself but there was not enough material on the robe to stretch over his broad shoulders.  She did not dare look down to see what else it did not cover.\r<br>\n\"Luis you scared me! \" she said getting up off of the bed.  \"What did you say?\"\r<br>\n\"I asked if you would get my clothes for me since I would not have to come out here in this barely there robe.  But since you are not shy then I guess I'm not either.\"  \r<br>\nLuis had a devilish grin on his face as he let the bathrobe fall open and all of his manly body stood bare and wet before Hannah.\r<br>\n\"Luis, what are you doing?\"she shrieked turning red.  \r<br>\nThen as she looked down to where she was standing, she noticed that the towel that she once had wrapped around her had fallen to the floor when Luis had startled her.\r<br>\nSHe quickly grabbed up the towel and wrapped it around her as Luis noticed her shame, grabbed his clothes and went back into the bathroom.\r<br>\nNever before had she been so embarrassed before. The most Luis let alone any boy had ever saw of her body was what was left revealed in a bathing suit.  And then she even wore a see through cover up over that.\r<br>\nHannah quickly put on her clothes and tried to put on her makeup but was still shaking too much to do so.  She just sat on the bed and waited for Luis to come out.  They had to talk about what had just happened.</span></div></div>",

He did, and shut the bathroom door. She opened her door, and her father, stood there with a smile. \"What did you say?\" She asked. She tried to sound casual. \"When are you and Luis leaving?\" He repeated. \"Oh, when Luis get's done getting dressed, and well...after I get dressed,\" She said blushing a little. \"Oh, I see. Well, I have to go pick up your brother from soccer practice. If you're not here when I get back, then I love you, and I'll see you when you get back,\" He said, giving a kiss on her head.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">-  -  -  -  -</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis sat on the toilet, with his pants on, and holding his shirt. He couldn't believe what had just happened in her room! He had seen her with no clothes. She had such a figure! He had felt so embarrassed afterward. He hurried, and put on his shirt, and took a comb from her drawer, and quickly combed his hair.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Can I come out yet?\" He said finally, after waiting ten minutes. \"Yeah. I'm ready,\" She said. He opened the door, and saw that she was wearing light blue flares, and a light sweater. Looking very suitable for the coming winter weather. \"Well, you're quick,\" He said. She smiled and grabbed a jacket. \"You probably won't need one,\" He said. \"Oh, okay. Don't forget to get your stuff,\" She said, her voice sounded kinda shaky. Was it what had happened?\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey walked down the stairs, and they walked across the street, and a couple of houses down, and over to his beaten Chevy. She got into the passenger side of the car, and Luis put his jacket, and football gear into the trunk. Then climbed into the car, and revved the engine. \"Ready?\" He said. \"More ready than I'll ever be,\" She replied. She put on her seatbelt, and he put the car into reverse, as he pulled out of his driveway.</span></div></div>",

I think this is the deadest friday I've seen in awhile,\" Hannah said, unbuckling her seatbelt, and opening the door. \"Yeah, I know,\" He said opening his door, and getting out. For some reason, he had an urge to open her door, but didn't because of two reasons, one, she had already opened hers, and two, it would've felt a little akward to do so. He shut his door, and followed Hannah into the diner.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThere wasn't any booths by the window open, so they found one in the back. She took a menu, and opened it. \"Have any ideas of what you're going to get?\" He asked. She wasn't very sociable this evening. He figured it was what had happened in her room. Was she beginning to feel weird around him? He hoped not. She was his best friend, and even though his friends said that she would be a hell of a better girlfriend than a best friend. He knew they were wrong. She had been there for him, when he had broken his arm back two years ago. He had been there for her, when she broke her leg when she had tripped over her brother Josh's toy. They had been there more times for each other, than any other best friend couple that <i>he</i> knew of.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Uh...I think I'm going to have a cheeseburger, french fries, and a chocolate shake,\" She replied, with a sigh at the end. \"What's wrong Hannah?\" He said finally, feeling a pressure inside of him, lessen, until it was gone. She looked at him, her large blue eyes, staring at him. \"What do you mean?\" She said finally. \"Well, you haven't said more than like ten words since after we kissed in your room,\" He said. \"Well, that wasn't exactly how I wanted to spend having a kiss. I mean, we just got done accidentally showing our selves in the nude,\" She replied. She ran her hand through her hair, something she did when she was nervous. She never bit her nails, or itched herself, it was always running her hand through her hair. He didn't know why, but maybe it was a way of her way of not showing she was nervous, even though she was. \"I'm sorry, I just...I don't know. It felt weird for me too, you know,\" He said, hoping that would make her feel a little bit better.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Can we forget it? I don't like arguing with you,\" She said. When she was done, a waiter came over, and took their order. They thanked him, and he tried to find something else to talk about. \"When is your next practice?\" He asked. \"Tomorrow. We have a game Monday. Who is it against? The Falcons?\" She asked. She folded her hands and placed them on the table. \"No, it's against the Warriors,\" He replied. \"Oh. We'll kick their asses. They are the only team that hasn't won a game, and there are like only four games left,\" She said with a smile when she was talking about kicking their asses. It was rare to hear her swear. Maybe him, when he was around his buds, but when he was just him and around Hannah, he didn't. It was even a shock when she said 'asses'. \"Yeah. They haven't won a championship since like 92, and that was because the Falcons had just lost their coach, and their minds were on other things,\" He said. \"I'll be right back. I have to go use the little girl's room,\" She said, excusing herself from the table, and walking across the floor, to the otherside of the room, where the restrooms were located.</span></div></div>",

I guess there has to be one day, where you can bulge on food,\" She replied with a smile. He liked it when she smiled, it made her look ten times prettier than she was, if that was even possible.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe left a tip for the waitress, and then went and paid for the dinner. \"Thanks for paying for it. That was very nice of you,\" She said, as they left the diner. \"Oh, you're so welcome. The gentlemen always has to pay for the sweet lady,\" He said with a smile as he got into the car. Hannah quickly following. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe ice cream shop was two blocks from Brenda's diner. There was only two other people at the window, when they pulled in. \"What kind do you want?\" He asked. \"I'll have some strawberry swirl, in a cone,\" She replied. \"Cool, be right back,\" He said, getting out of the car, and running up to a window, that had just opened. \"How can I help you?\" said a woman. \"Uh, yeah. I'd like to have a medium strawberry swirl cone, and a butter scotch cone please,\" Luis said, looking back at Hannah, who was looking of at the last of the sun, which had set behind the large hill off in the distance. The gentle wind blew some of her hair back, making her look..almost angelic. \"Sir? Would you still like your cones?\" asked the woman. He looked back around, and saw that the woman was holding the cones, and his had begun to melt. \"Uh, yeah,\" Luis said, taking them. \"That'll be three dollars for both of them,\" The woman replied. He handed her a five, and received the two dollars back. He wrapped some napkins around the cones, so if they melted, they'd get into the napkin, instead of on their hands.</span></div></div>",

Nervous, Luis leaned over and offered Hannah his hand.  She took it.  They came to a clearing in the woods and stopped, gazing into each other's eyes.

Luis was at a loss of words.  Now he was even more distracted!  I know this sounds completely dumb, but he just now realized how beautiful a girl's body is...a woman's body is.  Hannah looked into his eyes, while flaunting her chest.  \"Kiss me, Luis.\"  She walked towards him again and started to kiss him.  He held her face while he kissed her back.  His hands went down her arms and down to her waist.  Her boobs were pushing up against his chest which made him extremely horny.  He held her waist and drifted his hands up her butt, up her back, up through her hair, down her neck, down her breasts, and back down to her waist.  He was uncertain of doing this but realized that she was feeling just as horny.  He stopped and took off his shirt.  She felt his strong abs and his strong arms.  She took his arms and wrapped them around herself.  He could feel her body heat against his.  They started to kiss again.  Inbetween kisses, she said, \"Oh, Luis...I love you...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis replied, \"I love you, too...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed upset, \"No, Luis, I really do love you...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luis, make love to me...\"  This completely caught off guard.  As he kissed her, he thought of how this might be his first time.  Everyone thought he'd done it before but he hadn't.  Then, he began to think about if she was a virgin or not.  It made him sick to think of another guy putting their hands on her.  It made him so mad.  He closed his eyes now and, uncontrolably, pictured another guy sleeping with her.  It disgusted him but he couldn't get it out of his head.  It looked so real...  He got so angry that he lost his judgement.  He opened his eyes, but instead of seeing Hannah kissing him, he saw the guy from his mental picture laughing at him and talking trash about Hannah.  That did it!</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure if it was because he had kissed his best friend, and he had felt that the bond they had as friends, thickened and strengthened as boyfriend/girlfriend. He knew the passion they had created was strong, and the wax creating this candle was thick and tall. There was no way that this candle would ever wear away. He hoped it wouldn't.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStripped down to his boxers, he pulled the wrinkled sheets of his bed away from where he had left them that morning, and climbed into bed. His bedroom window was open, and he could feel the gentle breeze. He smiled, and he felt his eye lids getting heavier, and finding it harder to keep them open.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>A field of daisies and wild flowers lay to the north, south, east and west. He looked all around, and noticed that there was a tree every few thousand yards or so. The sun was intense as his eyes, and the sky was as clear as crystal. He rubbed his eyes, and noticed that Hannah was a few yards away. He smiled, and called her name. She looked in his direction, and laughed. She called his name, and smiled. She came running through the daisies and the wild flowers, and just as she was about to trip, Luis caught her in his arms. He helped her up, and for awhile they looked into each other's eyes. \"We are going to be together forever, you know that?\" She said in a husky, sexy, female voice he didn't know she had. It seemed to turn him on all the more. \"We are forever soulmates Hannah.\" He said with the same tone of affection she had given him. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe seemed to have fallen asleep, and when he awoke, she was lying next to him in a bed, and she awoke, and she hurried out of bed. She looked older, and she was naked! She put on a robe, and hurried out the door. She grumbled something, but he didn't hear. There was one window on their room, and a cold draft was flowing through. He got out of bed, and went to the window. The cold air seemed to awaken him, and his senses. \"Well, if you wanted some action, why didn't you just ask?\" He turned to find her in her robe, with the tie undone, and she's hanging there in the breeze, he looked down, and noticed he obviously wasn't sixteen anymore, and he was just as much hanging in the breeze as her. He didn't feel any uncomfortable thoughts. He smiled slyly, and he walked to her, taking her in his arms, taking her to their bed...</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis woke up, with a warm sweat. Heat was pouring from the window. He went and put his window fan in, and turned it on high. He couldn't believe the dream he had. Would they be together forever? he thought worridly. He tried to forget the dream, or more like a fantasy, but he found it hard. He just took a shower, and got dressed. He was deciding whether or not to tell Hannah. If he did, he might just as well leave out the end of his dream. He didn't want to make it out to her as he was a pervert. That was the last thing he wanted her to think of him as.</span></div></div>",

She looked up to say something like \"Lets get back, it is getting dark.\"<br>\r\nBut before she knew Luis took his jacket off and offered it to her. <br>\r\nShe took the jacket without delay and wrapped it around herself. <br>\r\n\"I wanted to tell you something Hannah.

But that did not take long as she quickly took them away as soon as the swords of his looks ripped her heat to pieces.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she said shyly, \"what is it?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess I'll have to look at it,\" She said taking a menu, and glancing through it. \"Are you alright?\" He asked calmly. Why was he acting as though nothing happened? She wondered. Is he acting like it's my fault? Was it my fault? \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" She replied. </span></div></div>",

Her pale hand would slip into mine and we could talk about how we felt, how I had pictured it for the last year; but somehow, with the door between us it all seemed so much more complex than I had imagined it to be. She was lost in a state of confusing that I had caused the moment my lips touched hers. I wanted to apologise, to go back to what was if that was what would make her happy, innocent, perfect again.

Finally, smelling fumes and coming to a halt against a huge tree on the edge of a ditch, with her on the safe side, he ordered her out.\r<br>\n\"Get out, Hannah. Run as fast as you can away from here. Now.\"\r<br>\nShe got out of the car and screamed to see it fall into the ditch. She felt planted in one place as Luis and his car flew down towards the earth.\r<br>\nHe fought to stay put and unhurt, but landed on the roof of the car and had to fight to escape, dislocating his shoulder in the process. Finally he was out, pulled neck, dislocated shoulder, and all. He ran as fast as he could out of the car from there, and felt Hannah grasp his good hand. Onyl seconds after they turned a corner, a huge explosion occured.\r<br>\nDrenched in rain and in great pain, Luis was led to shelter by Hannah. He smiled at her, and she smiled back. They were safe.</span></div></div>",

Robert stood, helpless, until he got an idea. He ran across the street and down, and soon was out of sight. But suddenly he returned with two men they knew.

When he caught himself the third time, he shook his dark hair out of his eyes, narrowing them to slits.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Get it together, man.\" He muttered to himself in irritation.  \"I mean, you know what this girl looked like in diapers, for Christ's sake.  What's the big deal?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA horn blasted abruptly, and bringing his attention back to the road, he slammed on the breaks just before fully running a red light. He put the car into reverse, backing up to the designated line of the intersection.  He sat there for a moment, breathing hard, watching the traffic speed by, the interior lit with the red hue of the stoplight.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So busy talking to yourself, you're gonna get yourself killed.\"  He sighed in disgust, waiting for the beating of his heart to slow down.  The light switched to green, and he carefully drove the next few blocks to the Diner.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nPulling in, he glanced around the parking lot, his eyes searching for Hannah's car.  It didn't appear as though she had arrived yet. <i>Just as well, </i>he thought, <i>Clear your mind so you can actually hold a decent, normal conversation.</i>  He shook his head one last time, took a breath, and stepped out of the car, locking it.  Donning his usual confident strut, he strode to the door, and walked inside.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nScanning the vinyl booths, double checking to make sure she hadn't arrived, he slid into booth number eleven, their table.  The waitress appeared promptly, placing the plastic coated menu before him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"How's it goin'?\"  she asked, her gum popping loudly, one hand resting on her slim hip. \r<br>\n \r<br>\n\"Pretty good, pretty good.  How 'bout you, Cat?\"\r<br>\n \r<br>\n\"Ah, same shit, different day, ya know what I mean?\"  Cat winked, tossing her blonde ponytail over her shoulder.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah,\" he laughed.  \"I do.  I'm waiting for someone, could I just get a Coke for now?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sure thing.\"  she leaned forward a bit.  She smelled of cheap perfume and french fries.  \"Say, ya gotta date?\"  She whispered in a conspiring tone.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No,\" he laughed again, this time a bit nervously, and glanced around the diner.  She spoke softly, but it didn't diminish the feeling he suddenly had of being in a spotlight.  \"No,\" he said again, \"I'm meeting Hannah.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh right.  Hannah.\"  Leaning back, Cat surveyed his face, her blue eyes searching.  \"Your <i>friend</i> Hannah.\"  She nodded, smiling slightly.  \"By the look on your face, hon, I think I better be gettin' you that Coke.\"  She winked again before sauntering off.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis gave a sigh of relief.  First his mother, and now this.  As if he weren't nervous enoug- no!  he wasn't <i>nervous!</i>  He wiped his sweaty palms down his thighs.  <i>Maybe I'm coming down with something.</i> \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe propped his elbows up on the table, steepling his fingers under his chin.  <i>You've got to figure this out.</i>  A voice in his mind insisted.  <i>Figure what out?  There's nothing to figure out!  Hannah is my best friend!  No teenage hormones are going to ruin that friendship for me!   </i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>Is it really only hormones?</i>  The voice persisted.  <i>What if this is the love of your life?  Why can't you get her out of your head?</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>Why can't I get this voice out of my head!</i>He shouted back at it.  <i>The love of my life?  I'm only sixteen!  Give me a break!  The fact of the matter is this, Hannah is my best friend.  I would die if I lost her.  I am not going to risk that.  For anything.  No way.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We're just friends!\"  He shouted.  Abruptly the room went quiet, silent but for the sound of the Musak playing softly.  He looked around, and sunk deeper into the booth.  Across the room, Cat caught his eye, and jerked her head to the side, in gesture toward the door right behind him.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn a slow deliberate movement, he turned.  Hannah was standing there, having just walked in.  He wasn't sure, who could read a womans face, <i>when haven't you been able to read Hannah's face?, </i> the voice in his head asked sardonically; but he thought he caught a hurt expression crossing it, before it smoothed out.  She finished the short walk to the table, sliding in across from him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You know, talking to yourself is said to be a sign of impending mental collapse.\"  She grinned.  Was it his imagination, or did that smile seem a bit tight?  He waited for her to ask who he was \"just friends with.\"  His hands broke out into another sweat.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's what they say.\"  He answered, after a long moment.  He almost breathed an audible sound of relief, when Cat approached, placing his soda before him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey sweetie.\"  She smiled at Hannah.  \"What can I getcha to drink?\"  Hannah's eyes rested on his face for a moment, penetrating, before she turned to the waitress. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll just have Coke too.  Actually, a vanilla Coke.  Thanks.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Comin' right up.\"  Cat stood for one extended moment, looking between the two of them, before her grin widened, and she walked away, glancing once behind her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe looked at Hannah.  Opened his mouth.  Closed it.  <i>What the hell is your problem, man?</i>  Opened it again.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So...\"  he said, and grinned at her, as the same syllable drifted from her mouth simultaneously.  Her beautiful mouth.  She giggled.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Jinx!  This Cokes' on you!\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Guess you got me...\"  he replied.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n  Silence.  <i>Isn't it funny how two seconds can seem like an eternity sometimes?</i> he thought.  <i>You've got to get past this attraction,  or your going to lose her as friend anyway.  She doesn't want to hang out with a bore.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJust then, he saw her glance past him.  \"What's up?\"  he asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The gang's just showed up.\"  she responded, looking back to him, her blue eyes deep and mesmerizing.  For a moment, he thought he saw the same look on her face as when she walked in, the hurt, combined with a certain questioning....\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTurning slightly, he saw a group of their friends from school crowding into a table, laughing.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Do you think we should join them?\"  He asked slowly, watching her face carefully.</span></div></div>",

Despite the fact that so much of their lives had been spent together, he still feels the need to be with her more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But I don't want to be just Hannah's friend anymore when I'm with her. I want to kiss her whenever I want to, and hug her, and mean everything to her, because she would be everything to me.</i> He can't remember when he started to feel that way about her- but even six months ago, before Hannah and Lucas had broken up, even the sight of their hands intertwined irked him slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts up the car. He would rather finish that English essay waiting at home than go to Ashley's, but he knew Hannah might be waiting for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car moves forward, pulling onto the busy road. Ashley's house is only five or six minutes away by car. Luis can see Lucas's truck two cars ahead. <i>Is that Hannah?</i> It is. Hannah's sitting in the back seat, her glossy dark hair visible. Luis strains to see her, removing his hands from the wheel for a moment to stand up to see over the car in front. A blonde head is sitting beside her.. close to her, very close. They turn to the side. Someone else must be driving his truck, because Lucas and Hannah are kissing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis feels a stab of envy. Even from here he can see her hands running through his hair. Obnoxious music blasts out of the open windows. She pulls away from Lucas for a moment, but her hands are still firmly wrapped around his neck. She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Luis presses down hard on the car horn, suddenly furious. <i>Surely she knows how I feel? I mean, she knows me so well.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis strong urge to punch Lucas had now only increased. <i>He'll probably throw Hannah away like a broken toy when he meets all the other girls.</i> he thinks, irritated, and still not fully concentrating on the road as Lucas and Hannah's embrace resumes. Then they disappear from view. Luis quickly unbelts himself, desperate to know what he's doing to her. He can only imagine Lucas's kisses dotting Hannah's slim porcelain neck, removing her mother's antique cross necklace, unbuttoning her pure white blouse, moving his kisses further down her body, unzipping her jeans as she is forced to listen to the crude music blasting into her ears, and his grubby fingers running through her silky lily-scented locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis feels slightly surprised at himself for feeling so much fury. The realisation that this feeling is out of character doesn't cause the anger to ebb away. He speeds up, pressing hard on the acceleration pedal. There is one traffic light before the turn into Ashley's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt comes sooner than expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas's truck is about to halt. Hannah and Lucas are looking out the window at Luis. Staring. Confused. The car in front is about to stop, just short of the truck, but Luis's car moves forward, shoving into the back of the car in front- and moving it quickly forward into Lucas's truck. It happens in an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream. Luis feels himself being flung forward, but all he can think about is Hannah. Is she okay? Sobbing. The driver in front of him is fine- he gets out of his car to inspect the damage. Luis feels paralysed. A woman with a briefcase is calling someone. The man looks into Luis's car, asks him if he's okay. Luis nods, burying his aching head in his hands. They feel wet, and when he pulls them away they are stained with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wants to go to the truck- so badly. But he fears that Hannah won't be there to hug him and tell him she's okay and that it will be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat she might be dead.</span></div></div>",

She jumped at the chance to ride with him.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe halts at a traffic light as his phone begins to bleep- a text. He grabs it from where it sits on the passenger seat and flips it open, silently hoping for Hannah's name to be on the screen, but its not from her. He frowns. The name 'SCARLET' is on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlet Holmwood?\" he murmurs, pressing a button to view the text. He hasn't heard from Scarlet in over a year and a half. Just like Hannah, he had grown up with Scarlet. She had moved a few towns away, started a new school, got a new life and he and Hannah quickly fell out of touch with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text reads;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Luis? have nt hrd from u in so long, i miss u. please say ur still around! i couldn't find ur online profiles. listen i've moved bac 2 town, it's a long story but i want to speak to u and hann. scarl. xxx'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis abandonsthe phone to continue driving. It's odd that she had moved back- when she had started her new school, she had raved about her new friends and teachers and house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulls up in front of the house, he picks up his phone again and quickly texts back, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'nice to hear from you, it's been so long, where do you want to meet?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luis?\" the voice is familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis glanced outside- his mother stands there, next to someone else. He opens the door and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luis, it's Scarlet. It's been so long! She wants to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl stands beside Luis's mother. She is small and slim, wrapped up in jeans, boots, a colourful scarf and coat. Her dark auburn hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, blowing slightly in the breeze. She looks just the same- button nose, big green eyes framed by thick lashes and pink lips. The only differences are that she is slightly taller and a shiny silver stud is on her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlet.\" Luis breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luis!\" she laughs as his mother steps inside.

It's called simply, 'Coffee' and it's a small cosy place smelling of freshly brewed coffee, with squishy cream and chocolate brown beanbags, armchairs and sofas. Vibrant artwork decorates the walls. It's one of Hannah and Luis's haunts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, Scarlet tells Luis about her life since moving away- she lived in a four bedroom house with her mom, older sister Rachael, younger brother James and labrador Eddie. It was situated beside a field of horses and five minutes away from a busy town and school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounded perfect.\" Scarlet sighs, as Luis pushes open the door to the cafe. \"But it wasn't. That's why I'm back, we're moving into an old house on the edge of town. It's a bit tight as I have to share with Rachael, but I'm just happy to be away from there.\" she shudders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet sits on an armchair next to the window as a light rain starts to fall, requesting a hot chocolate and oatmeal cookie. Luis goes to order- behind the counter is Hailey, Hannah's sister, older by a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Luis.\" she says. \"Thought you were going to be with Hannah today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was.\" Luis says, stating his order. \"But she went to a party and I just wasn't in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet hears. \"Hey, a party? You just told me she was at Ashley's. We should go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you.. Scarlet?\" Hailey peers out from behind the coffee counter. \"I remember you. It's Hailey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet smiles, \"I remember you, too. It's so weird to see everyone again- I feel like I'm slotting right back in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Hailey places a hot coffee, steamy hot chocolate and a crumbly oatmeal cookie on the table and leaves to clean up the back. That is when Scarlet starts explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis sips his coffee while Scarlet stirs the pink marshmallow around in her chocolaty drink. \"Those friends I told you about. They weren't as amazing as I made them out to be.\" she admits. \"See, the first one I met was Charlie- he was such a sweetheart.\" She turns to look outside at the downpour. \"Smart, cute, funny. What more could I have asked for? He wasn't all I thought he was, though. He introduced me to his best friends- Georgia,\" she spat, \"a back-stabbing bitch. Elysia,\" she growled, \"the perfect pretty one. Malcolm,\" she hissed, \"the arrogant handsome guy. They all seemed like people I could be best friends with. But they turned on me. In days I got a text telling me to watch my back. The next morning at school someone tripped me up, and that evening Georgia sent me to the wrong class. That night, Malcolm made up a rumour that I slept with some guy I'd never even met.\" she takes a chunk from her cookie. \"But it got worse. The day after, Elysia invited me to her birthday party. I was flattered, but nervous. I got all dressed up and ready but guess what? She gave me the wrong time so when I arrived they could pelt me with water balloons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Luis sighs, sympathetic. \"Sorry, Scarlet. Why didn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to look pathetic.\" she replies. \"That wasn't how bad it got though. A week later, a week full of taunts and whispering and being tripped up, Charlie called. He asked me to meet him after school with his other friends. I don't know why I thought it would be fine, but I agreed.\" she sips her hot chocolate, and Luis notices her tear-filled emerald eyes. \"I.. I..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Luis asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was raped.\" Scarlet whispers. \"They beat me, and I was raped.\" tears slide down her cheeks. \"and they did it the week after that, and every week until I started getting a lift home. For so long I had to endure threatening texts, set-ups. I dreaded school. I tried to end it once.\" Scarlet is crying into her hot chocolate now. \"I needed to leave. I'll never go back, I'll never go back!\" she buries her head in her hands, and Luis goes to the other side and sits on the side of the armchair to comfort her. He holds her hand and puts his arm around her shoulder as she blubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for not being there for you, Scarlet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" she sniffs, \"you didn't know.\" as Luis's phone rings. He glances down- Hannah. </span></div></div>",

Where is she? Okay, okay we'll be there. He's here now.' Hailey ran back to the table, her short, ebony pixie bob bouncing, the blue of her eyes stinging with panic. 'We've got to go. Like now. Scar, I'll drop you off at home. Come on.' Hailey was eighteen, always straight talking, effective and trustworthy with secrets but this left a sick feeling in Luis' throat. What had happened that Hannah had called him for and he had mindlessly ignored it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green Mercedes four by four loomed above them. <br>\r\n'Don't leave me Luis.' Scarlet whispered in the car but it didn't even enter his mind, Hailey dropped her at hers.<br>\r\n'You can stay at mine tonight Scar. Mum will cook you something. Use my TV. See you when I get back, sorry.' Hailey's eyes were already back on the road, her whole body shaking like a leaf. The crimson coat she was wearing brought out the black of her hair.<br>\r\n'What's happened?' <br>\r\n'Epilepsy.' That was all Hailey had to say and his mind was racing. Hannah hadn't had a fit since the ninth grade, hence quitting track.<br>\r\n'What triggered it?' <br>\r\n'Apparently Max was spiking drinks.'<br>\r\n'He spiked hers?' <br>\r\n'I believe so,' She whispered turning into the parking lot of the hospital. 'Apparently Hannah wanted Luke to take her home when you didn't turn up and he wouldn't so she was trying to phone you. I hear they had a bit of a spat over the fact you two like each other?

'Where can we find Hannah Denny?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who already had the answer ready from Rose's desperate request, replied.

They moved through the corridors, slipping past busy nurses and doctors.

It wasn't a good combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are.' Rose and Hailey's brisk walk slowed as they reached it. The last door. They grasped each other's hands. Just as a feeling of being left out set in, Rose held out hers. The worry on their faces made Luis feel even more anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were murmurs coming from inside the door. Rose stepped inside first, followed by Hailey. Luis trailed behind, eyes searching the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she was. Hannah lay, looking as fragile as a doll, on the bed. Her hair was spread out on the pillow, her skin pasty. A bandage was wrapped around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a plastic blue chair, Lucas sat, cradling her hand. Hannah's friends Megan and Elle hung back, rapidly texting and whispering, glancing from Hannah to their phone's screen. They acknowledged Rose, Hailey and Luis's entrance with a nod and a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas looked coldly at Luis, and nodded briefly to Hailey and Rose.

Not just like her, but love her. Whenever something happened, Hannah was never to blame.\" she smiles. \"So, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis looks down at his feet, surprised by Scarlet's forwardness. \"I.. I..\" he glances up, ready to admit it. Scarlet is  closer now, standing right in front of him, and a second later her lips are brushing his- softly, but then she kisses him harder. Without thinking, Luis complies. His hand touches her chest, and he can faintly hear her heartbeat as her soft lips move against his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, all he can think about is Scarlet-  but then Hannah barges into his thoughts. He thinks about how many times he thought, 'I love her.' <i>I do love her.</i> he thinks, as Scarlet hands touch his chest. As soon as this thought formed, he pushes Scarlet away, holding onto only her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do love her. I love Hannah.\" he sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet's eyes meet his, confused. Then she takes a step back, pushing his hands against his chest. \"Oh. I guess you do. Maybe I didn't want to hear it. When you kissed me back, I figured I'd imagined your feelings for her.\" she runs a hand through her hair, pink creeping into her cheeks. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat second, Luis's phone starts to ring. He glances down. \"It's Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it.\" whispers Scarlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis flips his phone open and moves a few steps away to answer the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hannah, what's up?\" he sighs.<br>\r\n\"Luis, where are you?\" Hannah cries. \"I haven't seen you since.. since.. whatever. I really need to talk to you, did you even come to Ashley's?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I.. I went home. What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"I want to tell you in person, meet at the park?\"<br>\r\nLuis glances to Scarlet. Would Hannah really want to tell Scarlet whatever had happened? It must be serious- Hannah doesn't usually cry about anything, and Scarlet hasn't been a part of their lives in nearly eighteen months.</span></div></div>",

I must be mistaken.' She turned her heard to the sky, this was Scarlet's way, she couldn't be vulnerable, she couldn't be soft, she feared it too much.

Luis whispered, stepping closer to her, trying to push past her guards. His pale fingers began playing with the deep purple silk hanging loosely from her shoulder.<br>\r\n'Don't do what Luis?' Scarlet smirked painfully, her pink lips pouting and shuddering as the only protection from tears. Pushing his hands away Scarlet stepped backwards towards the shadow of a wooded area. 'Don't do what Luis? Don't do what?' He heard her final sweet, broken, invested whisper. She may have invested her love in him but she had been gone and his love was stitched, embedded and bewitched by Hannah and her innocent smile. He loved saving her.

He couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched the movie, and in one of the most romantic scenes, Hannah looked up a Luis's face. \"One of my favorite parts,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is she thinking what I hope she's thinking?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis looked into her ocean eyes, and she didn't turn away.

But he knew that if things progressed, what would happen if they broke up?  Would she get fed up with him? They've been friends this long. Won't dating screw it up? On the other hand dating her would have so many benefits. He decided he would not choose right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just enjoy the moment,' he thought. 'If it doesn't work, it won't work.

She had met him after football practice to confirm their rendezvous later at her house before the big shindig at a fellow classmates home. He had been drenced in sweat and kind of smelled but in his teen angst period of rebellion versus conformity he was as close to James Dean or Marlon Brando as they come. He had incredible eyes that gleamed with raw anticipation and childish delight. She was spell bound in his presence. He was beautiful. \r<br>\nShe hoped her giddiness on the football field hadn't followed her home. He was coming over in half an hour. \r<br>\nIt was just a dinner but she was going with him.

They all wanted to go out with him too like she did. The only prolem she had was that she wasn't really an option. She was his friend and no matter how close they were it didn't qualify as dating. This little soiree at their friends house was the perfect opportunity to impress him with her femine attributes. She had become quite the young lady but resorted to wearing baggy t-shirts and jeans as a means of hiding her ever blossoming figure.

Their lips met in a long kiss and as they pulled away, Luis leaned on her shoulder and whispered, \"I love you.\"<br>\r\nHannah looked at him and all of a sudden didn't feel nervous anymore. She knew what to say, because she knew exactly how she felt.<br>\r\n\"I love you too,\" she said. \"I'd like to take our relationship a little further.\"</span></div></div>",

Hannah slips her hands into his underwear and he kisses her harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis unclips Hannah's bra and it falls onto the bed. She shoves him back onto the feather soft pillow and he falls back with a soft thud. It feels like she has been waiting a lifetime to be this close to him. Luis's hands caress her breasts as they lock lips, the same ecstatic feeling running through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah pulls back, legs locked around his waist, and slowly pulls back the brim of his underwear. Luis laughs, \"Hannah, come on.\" He wonders why it feels so right- this is Hannah, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins, and after a moment, pulls the underwear down. She and Luis look at eachother for a moment, slightly awkward and tense. Then Hannah steps off the bed and slips her own underwear off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah..\" Luis murmurs, eyes resting on her waist. His eyes follow as she lays down on the bed beside him. For a moment, they are quiet, before Luis mutters, \"Protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah pulls two condoms out of her bedside, drawer and they awkwardly insert them. \"I can't believe we're about to do this..\" Hannah sighs. \"Maybe we shouldn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can continue, Luis grabs Hannah and she giggles as he tickles her relentlessly. She throws back her head. \"Luis, that's not how you do it!\" she jokes between laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis feels his hands moving downwards to Hannah's waist. Her giggles quieten. He strokes her thighs, steadily moving up towards her midriff- deliberately avoiding the area Hannah most wants him to touch. She begins to moan softly. Luis's heart starts to beat faster, amazed at how good it feels to make Hannah make that sound. His hands caresss Hannah's entire lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you so badly-\" Hannah whispers, and her words are interrupted by a moan as Luis fondles her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah glances up, disappointed, as Luis stops. \"Luis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh.\" Luis pushes her back against the bed, heart thudding even faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Hannah's noisy moans can be heard from outside the house. Luis pulls in and out, quickly, heart set on pleasuring Hannah. They are both breathing hard and fast. The sensation never gets old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Luis.\" Hannah breathes loudly. \"So much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis collapses beside her. Hannah takes his hand and squeezes it. \"I love you too.\" he whispers. He turns and pulls her back to him.

That horror movie that I can't wait to see,\" She suggested. \"We'll have to see, we have a game tomorrow,\" She raised her eye brows. \"Oh, that's right. We'll, when ever, I want to see that movie,\" \"What is it called?\" He asked. \"A Night in Rutford Inn. It looks really scary. Something I have to check out. Hopefully, it isn't cheesy, then it would've been a waste of money,\" She replied. \"Well, I better get inside. I don't want my parents to wake up,\" She said, ready to enter to the house. \"Hannah?\" He asked. She turned around. \"What?\" Without any warning, he took her face in his hands, and pulled her close. His lips touching hers. She put her arms around his neck, and she reinforced the kiss.

I know that sounds kinda weird, but this past year, we haven't really had any time where we can just talk, talk like we used to,\" Hannah added. Maria nodded, totally agreeing.

She rubbed her arms with her hands, annoyed by the less than perfect weather and began dialing again: 6-2--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" Joseph said, making her jump.  Him and the like walked up to her, from around the corner of the diner. \"I knew it couldn't be true...\" Joseph and the rest of his posse laughed like robots.  It was rather odd seeing them out of uniform; she was used to seeing them in jerseys.  She was already ticked off by the him enough for the day, and being angry at mother nature also didn't do much to calm her nerves.  So it was no surprise when her short fuse fizzled at the sight of him made her bicuspids tingle with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Eugene?\" She asked, emphasising his last name, which he despised to be called.  His eyes flashed, then softened and narrowed. <br>\r\n\"Hey, it's all good,\" He said.  \"I would want my girl to be able to stand up for herself.  No damsel in distress for this stud.\" Honestly, that jerk was too cocky for his own good.  Her fuse filled shorted as she clenched her teeth in an effort not to make his nose bleed. \"You've got brains, legs, talent, and you know what I think about your bod'\" Her was whispering to her ear, now.  This sent a shiver down her revolted spine. \"Are you cold?\" The clod asked. \"I can fix that...\" He put his arms around her and and pressed his lips to hers.  That's when the dynamite exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" She screamed.  She fought him off, hitting him in the face -- a good one that was going to leave a mark, might I add.  His head snapped back, before coming back angrily.  She kneed him in the groin, giving herself time to call on her cellphone.  By now, she had forgotten the others were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah dialed the number of the first person that came to her mind --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just looked so perfect...\" Hannah and Luis stared uncomfortably at each other as the waitress rambled on and on about how perfect they were together, and finally Luis spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're ready to order,\" he said, interrupting the waitress mid-sentence. She apologized and took their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take a double cheeseburger with extra pickles, with a medium Coke, and she'll have a cheeseburger, plain, with a small Diet Coke...\" he said instinctively, as they both knew the order by heart. \"We'll also take a large fry, to share.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitresses smiled as she jotted down the order, then turned and left.

The world focused on the number emblazoned on his jersey.  42.  A voice in the back of her mind whispered \"did you just call him -your- Luis?\"  42.  Hannah shook her head again.  Well yes.  Her friend.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe waited outside the locker room for him afterward.  In the middle of a conversation with Jimmy, one of the waterboys, she caught a whiff of something clean and damp.  Then Luis caught her around the waist and spun her.  \"How 'bout that, eh, hon?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah smiled and swatted Luis's arm. \"Yeah, you gave 'em heck.  Now let me loose and let's go eat.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe set her on her feet, but didn't let her go.  The waterboy--what was his name again?--had walked off to talk to one of the cheerleaders, she noticed.  Which left her mostly alone with Luis...who still wouldn't let her go...the air got a little thicker.  \"What if I don't want to let you loose?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah's pulse tripped.  There were worse proposals... \"Then you can just carry me to the car.  Either way, come on.\" She tapped halfheartedly at his arm as she hazarded a glance into those cocoa eyes.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe turned her to face him...\"Yeah...I'm hungry.\"  The look in his eyes was...positively smoldering.  Hannah half hoped he'd move and half hoped he'd kiss her.  Kiss her?  What?  Luis-who-she'd-known-forever kiss her?  Still, those eyes...\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah realised she'd stopped breathing when a voice behind her made her gasp.  It was Mick, a runningback.  \"Great game, Lou!\" he said, pounding Luis's shoulder.  Luis shifted his grip on Hannah to free a hand and return the hardy salute.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You too, Mick.  You too.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey watched Mick leave, a bright redhead on his arm.  Then Luis shook his head and gave Hannah a one-armed hug that tucked her under his shoulder.  \"So.  On your tab or mine?\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThere.  That was normal.  \"I think it's your turn, sport,\" Hannah answered as they walked out to his car.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n************************\r<br>\nThey sat in their usual corner booth at Brenda's and had their usual post-game dinner:  Five chicken strips for him, and double-large chili cheese fries for her.  As always, they ate each other's food as much as they ate their own.  As always, they finished half of eachother's sentences.  It was easy.  It was companionable.  It would've been just like sixth grade if she could look at him and not remember the look in his eyes just an hour or two earlier...\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA chili bean dropped off her fry as she thought about it; his warm voice--baritone, her year in chorus told her--startled her out of reverie.  \"You know, those are usually better when you eat them instead of wear them.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe looked down at the bean on her jeans, blushed, speared it with her fork and popped it into her mouth.  \"Denim's better than salt,\" she said sheepishly.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Umm hmm.\" he replied, one eyebrow up.  \"Sure.\"  They grinned at eachother across the table, and she wondered what he was thinking. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm thinking it's about time we head out.  Your mom'll skin me if I get you home late again.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I wouldn't worry about it,\" Hannah said, pushing out of her seat. \"I think she likes you more than she likes me anyway.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's just 'cause I'm cu-u-u-u-te.\" Luis teased as he cleaned their table.  \"Come on.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe snuck glances at him all the way home.  Yeah.  He was cute.  Good thing he was just her best friend; otherwise she'd be as stupid over him as any other girl with eyes should be...  \r<br>\n****************\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen they got to her house, Luis walked her to the door.  \"You know, doll, you don't have to do this,\" she'd said a few weeks ago.  \r<br>\n\"Yeah I do,\" he'd answered. \"What if the porch monsters got you?\"  \r<br>\n\"That's what the light's for.  To keep them away.\"\r<br>\n  \"Or to let them see you better.  Nah, I'd better walk you up.\"\r<br>\n  She hadn't complained since then.  Tonight, her mother had forgotten the porch light.  \"Uh oh,\" Luis said in his ooga-booga-boo voice.  \"Looks like they finally got the light.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Good thing I've got you to save me from them, then,\" Hannah answered, feeling strangely flirty.  He was her best friend; what was the harm?  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah,\" he replied.  \"Good thing...\" She could see his half-wild grin in the darkness and felt her pulse start tripping again.  \"Now who's going to save you from me?\"  His voice was just light enough, she could take his comment for teasing...but there was something rough around the edges... \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I didn't know I needed saving.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe didn't say anything right then, only pulled her into their usual goodbye hug.  She heard him say something, but her ears were muffled in his chest and hand.  Then she felt him shake his head, and he let her go.  It wasn't till she was mostly asleep that her mind decoded what her ears had half-heard:\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You're right.  So who's going to save me from you?\"</span></div></div>",

She was sure he was noticing the same subtle innuendos they had been tossing around for the last few weeks.  What had he meant by asking her that strange question, \"Who will save me from you\"?  Why had he even asked it?  \r<br>\n    \"Arrg! This is just too much for me to have to unravel tonight,  I must get some sleep!\", she had said to herself.  She rolled over and pulled the bed covers over her head.  Sleep finally came, but would only last three short hours, during which time she would dream of Luis.\r<br>\n    Hannah woke smiling the next morning and, not knowing why, jumped out of her bed and raced to find something cheerful to wear for the day.  One glance at the clock told her she was going to run out of steam before the day was over, but she shrugged it off.  For the moment, she was energized and couldn't wait to get to the school.  \r<br>\n    It wasn't until she was brushing her teeth that she remembered part of her dream of the night before.  It was just a flash of Luis, but he was smiling like she had never seen him smile before.  He was saying something to her, yet his mouth uttered nothing.  It was more like his eyes were talking and she couldn't quite read what they were saying.  Frustrated, she tried harder to remember more of the dream.  \r<br>\n    They were walking in an immense field of long grass and wildflowers, laughing and teasing each other as they always had.  She looked around and realized that Luis was no longer beside her.  He had dropped down into the tall grass and was laying on his back with his hands under his head.  As she went back to see what he was doing, she realized he was just lying there smiling.  She snickered and asked, \"Is this going to become a habit with you Luis?\"  Luis had just continued to smile at the sky with a look of dreamy realization spread across his face.  \"It just might be Hannah.  It seems you have an effect on me that I think I am only just beginning to understand.\"</span></div></div>",

But she didn't have time to figure it out now. She had to get ready for school.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe day went by quickly, but Hannah didn't seem to have gotten much out of any of her classes. She spent the whole day daydreaming about Luis. At lunch she had seem him talking and flirting with one of the popular girls. She had cringed with envy, and then she asked herself why she was so jealous? But when he had looked over at her and winked, she turned around and hurried to her locker.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThat evening, Hannah was sitting on her bed doing her homework when the phone rang.\r<br>\n\"Hello?\"\r<br>\n\"Hannah...?\"\r<br>\n\"Yea. Hey Luis! What's up?\" she felt overjoyed just hearing his voice.\r<br>\n\"I uhh... need to talk to you.\"\r<br>\n\"Oh yea? About what?\" she wondered.\r<br>\n\"I don't even know how to begin. It's like.. we've been friends forever, ya know?\"\r<br>\n\"Yea, sure... since we were toddlers.\"\r<br>\n\"Well... I don't know how to explain this, or how to even start but...\" his sentence trailed off.\r<br>\n\"But what?\"\r<br>\n\"I think I'm falling in love with you.\" Time froze, and neither one of them spoke. Hannah didn't know what to say. For a moment she thought she was dreaming but she pinched herself to assure herself that she wasn't.\r<br>\n\"Hannah? Are you still there?\"\r<br>\n\"Yea, I'm here,\" she said, barely whispering.\r<br>\n\"I, uhh.. didn't mean to freak you out. But I've been having these feelings for weeks now and I've been dieing to tell you. I just didn't know how. You are so beautiful, so sweet, so smart, and so wonderful. You are perfect for me in everyway. A few minutes ago I was lying on my bed thinking about you, and I couldn't take it anymore. I had to tell you. I know you probably don't feel the same way about me but...\"\r<br>\n\"Luis. Stop talking,\" Hannah said.\r<br>\n\"I'm sorry.\"\r<br>\n\"Don't be sorry. I just wanted to tell you what I was feeling too.\"\r<br>\n\"Really?\"\r<br>\n\"Yes. Luis... I've been thinking about this for a few days now, you're all I can think about. I love you in more ways that I ever knew possible and you make me feel complete. I have no secrets from you and I've never felt this way about anyone before.\"\r<br>\n\"What are you saying?\"\r<br>\n\"Let me finish. Luis, what I'm afraid of is that we would something that would be wonderful.\"\r<br>\n\"I don't see what's so horrible about that.\"\r<br>\n\"What if we broke up? Things would just get so wierd.

Half sweet, half hot.  Heck, all sweet and all hot.  Here he was trying to sound like a character in a romance novel with his blush causing static on the phone.  How could she resist him?

Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you think I'm lecturing you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--but all this worrying,\" the dog undeterredly pressed, \"is leading you to nowhere, save loneliness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time this dream had recurred was a month ago.  Same endless rows of empty fishtanks, same fog, same floor making that same hollow noise with every step, like a gourd hitting cement.  The only things missing were--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah!  We, too, think that you should stop worrying about nothing and take a real chance for once in your life!\"  Sang Jeb Bush and Newt Gingrich, swaying in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that; everything WAS here: including the chorus of naked, singing republicans.  Hannah made a mental note to figure out what it was she was eating before bed-- this had to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying,\" the dog continued, sniffing at a particularly hairy leg belonging to Bob Dole, \"matters of the heart are matters for the heart to decide.

Forget I said anything.  JUST STOP USING YOUR BRAIN, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the chorus of naked republicans piped in with an eighties song Hannah had heard on the radio.  She only remembered part of the lyrics, but she'd gotten the jist of it:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nListen to your heart<br>\r\nAnd it do do do do<br>\r\nListen to your heart<br>\r\nAnd you'll doo do do do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if nobody answers,<br>\r\nYou'll never know!<br>\r\nListen to your heart<br>\r\nAnd it comes do doo<br>\r\n...............................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah awoke in a sweat.

We won't grow up, never ever. No one can tell me what to do. I will only listen to you.\" It was short, the rhymes weren't the best, whenever we sang it it was our goal sing off-key, but no one ever heard it besides us. i laughed and threw my head back. Then began singing as loudly as I could without alerting my parents down-stairs. We chanted it lots of times, laughing still. He twirled me around on his finger then reeled me back in like a fish. Then I caught his eyes. He was happy and beaming. I'd never seem him laugh so hard. Then he saw me looking. Our voices faded softly and we leaned towards each other slowly. Our noses touched gently and our lips followed suit. We felt behind us for the bed and we sat there for what felt like forever, kissing. Then finally he pulled away gently. His hands framed my face with such compassion and love that it was hard to believe it was Luis. He stared into my eyes and whispered to me calmly. \"It's twelve thirty.\" I giggled gaily and whispered back \"We missed lunch.\" Despite my sarcastic remark he got up and walked backwards, still staring into my eyes. \"I will see you tomorrow, girly.\" \"Night boy.\" I waved and made the I-love-you sign with my right hand. He backed out the window slowly and disappeared from sight into the immense darkness. I sighed and fell backwards onto the bed and into a deep restful sleep.</span></div></div>",

Hannah could feel a blush creeping up her face, but she smiled back at Maria.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey, Mama, did I hear Hannah down there?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"<i>Si, querido.</i>  She's been waiting.\" Maria teased.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Okay, give me a minute.\"  Luis's footsteps hammered the floor above; a minute later, he came downstairs.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah turned to greet him, but the words froze in her throat.  Loose jeans hung just right at his waist.  A black muscle shirt was belted into those jeans and covered with a red rayon overshirt.  Good clothes, but Luis always had priceless taste.  What struck Hannah speechless was...well, she couldn't put her finger on it.  His aura, maybe.  Why hadn't she ever noticed how...<i>male</i> Luis looked with wet hair?  Why hadn't she ever noticed the gold sparks in his coffee-brown eyes?  Why had she never noticed his cologne, his own scent?  She shook her head and smiled.  \"Get a grip,\" she thought, \"He's still Luis.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey,\" was what she actually said.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter a moment of silence ...Oh please let him be thinking the same sort of thing I just was, Hannah prayed... Luis smiled back.  \"Hey.  Ready to go?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis nodded, then turned to hug his mother.  \"<i> Hasta luego, mama.</i> I'll be back late tonight.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Before midnight.\" Maria said, fingercombing her son's hair.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Before midnight.  <i>Te amo, mama.  Buenos noches.</i>\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"<i>Te amo, querido.</i>  Be good.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis bent to kiss his mother's cheek, then offered his arm to Hannah.  Together they walked out to his car.  \"I figured we'd ride in style,\" he said, grinning and gesturing at the beat up Volkswagon.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah laughed and patted the SuperBeetle's hood affectionately.  \"You be nice to the love bug.  It's been nice to you.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis arched an eyebrow at her and smiled. She read his look and gave him her best Bruce Lee face.  \"Not what I meant.  Be nice to me, too.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe grinned.  \"I promise not to hate you because you're beautiful.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey got into the car and set out for downtown.  \"So what are we going to see?\" Hannah asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis shrugged.  \"I don't know.  The multiplex has a fistful of new releases going, so I figured we'd hash it out when we got there.  What're you in the mood for?\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah replied somewhat ambiguously, not really wanting to commit to anything for fear of giving Luis a negative impression of her.  It's not like they hadn't known each other all their lives, nor was it exactly that she thought that he would think badly of her for her choice of movies- they had argued about that countless times before.  It was just that she felt rather awkward in a new situation.  She was conscious of all the things that she had never bothered to consider when being out with Luis before, like Food-in-Teeth or Possible-Embarrassing-Substance-on-Pants Syndrome. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen they arrived at the movie theater, they had seen nearly all of the movies playing, though not necessarily together.  They finally agreed on the only movie neither of them had seen, which, incidentally, turned out to be Luis's idea of a chick flick.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'd better not see anyone I know here!\" Luis teased Hannah.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Whatever!\" Hannah laughed, and tagged Luis on the arm.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis bought the tickets and offered to buy Hannah some refreshments, but not wanting to risk bad breath or looking like a pig, and other assorted embarrassments associated with eating, Hannah thanked him anyway, but answered to the negative.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLuis picked out seats in the very back row of the theater, and as they sat waiting for the movie to begin, they laughed nervously about the fact that no one else appeared to be seeing the same movie that they were.  Eventually what appeared to be two middle-aged women sat themselves in the middle of the theater.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Darn, now I can't kiss you loud,\" Luis joked, winking at Hannah.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah just blushed in return, and looked away, not realizing how appealing she was making herself to the guy whose gaze she had previously never been afraid to meet.  She couldn't believe how nervous she was!  Luis appeared to be completely at ease, but Hannah wasn't sure, and didn't know that she wanted to ask, for fear of what he might say. So instead, they sat quietly through the previews until the movie started. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nNeither Hannah nor Luis touched the other during the entire first half of the movie, though neither could say that they didn't want to.  Both stared straight ahead, and didn't move except for the occasional crossing or uncrossing of the legs.  However, being something of a chick flick, the movie began to lean toward the sad side, a very endearing main character's death looming in the near future, and Hannah began to edge a little closer to Luis, who instinctively put his arm around her and pulled her close.  They sat that way through the rest of the movie, and when the credits started to role, Luis gently kissed Hannah's forhead and stood up, taking her hand.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was dark when they came out of the theater, and they walked hand in hand out to the old Lovebug, where he opened the door for her and then closed it behind her.  When he got in the car, she smiled shyly at him, but was more silent than she had ever been at any point in her friendship with Luis.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So, you hungry?\"  Luis asked, with a smile.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um, not really,\" replied Hannah, smiling back at him, \"You?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Maybe we'll get something later,\" he told her, \"But first, there's something I want to show you.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What is it?\" asked Hannah.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You'll see,\" Luis replied mysteriously.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah prances up the stairs to her bedroom, plopping down onto her bed, running a hand along the silky purple cover. She was in deep thought about what Luis had mumbled before he left. She tried convincing herself that she had carelessly imagine what he had said, or had misheard him, but it was all clear what he said: <i>I love you</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, did she love him back? She had stumbled for words, that were in her mind, ready to say, but she couldn't bring herself to say them. Was that out of the embarrassment they had both encountered, or did she truly not mean it? Did she love her best buddy, Luis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah sighed, shook her head, and decided she hadn't time for deep thinking -- the inner-debate would have to wait. She checked her watch for the time -- 6:15! She had only an hour and fifteen minutes to get ready! Hannah sprang up from her purple bed-covers, and rushed to her dresser to pick out an outfit. What to wear, what to wear... the same old inner monologue idea that every girl gets when prepping for... well, anything. She eventually decided on a navy blue tank top, with a bright yellow, starred baggy over-shirt to wear over it. Without the tank top, it would hardly cover her cleavage and mid-section. She carefully picked a purple pair of skinny jeans to go along with it, green socks, and red Converse shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dressing into the outfit, she checked her watch again -- 6:45! It had taken her 30 minutes to choose and put on a pair of clothing? This was slightly longer a time than usual, but she justified it with the fact that she was going to a club of sorts, with tons of people to impress. After looking in a full-body mirror, she decided the outfit was wonderful. But the problem? Her messy, straight, auburn hair. A slight panic overcame her. She knew she could fix it to look perfect, but -- did it look that messy when she and Luis exchanged goodbyes? Or had it gotten messy from prancing upstairs and slamming down on the bed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter, she decided, and headed off to the bathroom that she had the luxury of being located in her bedroom. Sometimes Hannah felt so lucky to have the things she did: Her own bedroom, her own bathroom... Luis. She tried to shake the thought from her head and grabbed her curling iron. It was time to get funky! Ten minutes later, her hair was sectioned into tight auburn spirals that looks full and shiny. She clapped and cheered at her success. Hannah returned to the full-body mirror to check herself out. Perfect, she decided, but she needed some makeup. Not too much, but maybe a little eyeliner, mascara, and eyeshadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully picked out the best shade of purple and applied it lightly to her eyelids. After applying the shadow, she took the eyeliner pencil and neatly drew a thin black line on the edge of her upper eyelids. After applying the necessary amount of mascara, she checked the mirror once more,  then the time -- 7:05! She silently applauded herself for finishing her hair and her makeup faster than her clothing. A few moments later, she heard a knock at the door downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped down the stairs and to the front door. Of course, it was Luis --  who was jaw-dropped, looking her up and down, from her curled hair and makeup, to the red shoes over the green socks on her feet. Stunned, he said \"You look... amazing.\" And Hannah could say the same about Luis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a multi-colored long-sleeved shirt on, unbuttoned, and black dress pants, complimented with black dress shoes. His hair was green down with hair gel, and curled at the tip of his black hair. His brown eyes sparkled as he marveled at Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's something we can agree with each other on. Now why don't we head on out?\" They walked out the door, and Hannah closed it behind her, locking it with a key that she placed in her back pocket. \"Let's go.\" She said. The two teenagers then disco-danced all the way to the car, laughing and giggling along the way.<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the disco, there were a ton of teenagers, ages 13-17, disco-dancing to songs like \"Burn Baby Burn\" and \"Stayin' Alive\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a glance to one another, they decided to dance with each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I have this dance?\"  Luis asked in his best fake British accent, slowly extending his hand to Hannah, who agreed and took it. Inevitably, a slow song started playing -- You Don't Have to Say You Love Me by Dusty Springfield. They blushed and took each others hand, swaying to the music, Luis twirling Hannah around and around. Hannah giggled as he did, and dizzily stumbled into his arms, blushing as she stared up into his deep brown eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hi, Mr. Donovan.  May I speak with Maggie, please?  ...  Thank you.\"  In her life, Hannah had had two better-than-best friends.  One, obviously, was Luis.  The other was Magdalena Donovan. She and Maggie had hooked up when Hannah was a freshman.  Maggie, a sophomore, had just moved to town and had a couple of classes with Hannah.  They learned the ropes of the new high school together, watched eachother's backs back when both of them were not-so-popular.  Made for a tight bond.  As Hannah waited on the line, she realised how little she'd been talking to Maggie since Luis joined the football team.  She wondered if Mags would even talk to her now...  Then there was music on the other end of the line and Maggie's rough voice yelling to her dad that she had it.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey, you got me.  Who is it?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hi, Maggie.  It's Hannah.  How's it going?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Woah!  Drops of Jupiter indeed!  So, did you fall from a shooting star or what, boo?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt took a second for Hannah to translate the question out of Mag's inimitable slang.  \"Not fallen yet, but in the process.  That's half the trouble.\"  It was funny: In all of Hannah's memories, the things Maggie said sounded normal.  Was this what she'd sounded like her freshman year?  No wonder no one understood her...\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Should've known that's why you'd call.\"  Maggie snorted a little bitterly and then coughed.  \"Hang on.\"  The music--some unknown jazz/rock group that Maggie had taken as her personal cause, unless Hannah missed her guess--dropped a few notches and changed songs.  \"So,\" Maggie said when she picked the phone back up, \"What's your trouble?\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Look, I'm sorry if I've been out of touch the past few.  It's just been... hectic.\"  This wasn't as easy as Hannah'd thought it would be.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMaggie's hissed laughter crackled over the phone line.  \"No worries, boo.  It's all good.  You lose track of time with the flock, but those who watch against wolves do know the hour.  So straight, what's up?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You remember Luis?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA slightly derisive \"MMM Hmm.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well...things are changing with me and him, and I don't know if they should or what to do or anything.\"  Hannah proceeded to fill Maggie in on the events of the past few weeks, especially last night and \"Who'll save me from you?\".  By the end of it, the music had stopped entirely and Hannah could sense Maggie actually considering her trouble.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So, long story straight, your long-standing brother-in-arms now wants to be the long-standing brother with charms, non?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oui.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And you, though you would not be averse to the proposition, don't want to lose your closest ever friend.  So you're scared.  Have I got it so far?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMaggie took a long breath, and Hannah wondered what kind of incense her amiga was burning tonight.  \"It's sandalwood,\" Maggie answered, and Hannah wondered if she'd asked the question out loud.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"A'ight.  Look, boo, the best I've got is that you've got to listen to your heart...and listen to his, if you two are that tight.  If you want to pursue something a little...more...and he does, too, then do.  You got an itch, go scratch.  Take some time, sound him out, and then step to the real.  You might be good for him.  Cool?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah smiled at the phone.  \"Yeah.  Cool.  Hey, Mags?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yo?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Thank you.  I mean, I know I haven't been all that great to you lately, and it's really big of you to help me out like this.  Especially since I know you don't dig Luis too much.  Thanks.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No prob, boo.  I've always got your back.  All you got to do is ask.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey sat in silence a while, listening to the new album Maggie'd put on.  The guy was playing guitar like no one Hannah'd ever heard.  \"I can't be her angel now,\" he sang, \"You know it's not my place to hold her down. And it's hard for me to take a stand, but I would take her any way I can...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I've got to go, babe.\" Hannah said to Maggie.  \"Got to call somebody, even some things out.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah.  You stay in touch, eh, boo?  Miss you.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll stay in touch.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Call me if he needs his six kicked.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah laughed.  \"Only after I've already done it!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"'S my girl.  Be good.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Or at least good at it.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHannah hung up the phone with the song going through her head.  She leaned back against the wall and sighed.  \"This shouldn't be this hard...\" she murmured to no one as she closed her eyes...\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n~~side note: lyrics (c) John Mayer, 1999~~</span></div></div>",

'Think,' Hannah tried to tell her brain. 'Think of an excuse.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..
