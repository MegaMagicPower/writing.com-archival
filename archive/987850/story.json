You aren't sure how you ended up there anymore, or even where it was, but you remember walking through the door and being assaulted by rock music. Everything gets a little blurry after that, but you clearly remember grabbing a cup and going over to a keg set up in the corner and pouring yourself a beer. Beyond that first sip of beer there is nothing except a cute face wreathed in blonde hair. You still have no idea who she was though, and now you wake up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell the here isn't that bad. The bad part is the fact that when you wake up you're standing at only about an inch tall. Worse still a birthmark on the inside of your arm that was just a white splotch on your skin, is now a bright red, rash-like splotch, though it doesn't itch. All of that you could live with. Hell the shrinking could even be fun. But there is one part of your current situation you just cannot accept at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frilly, pink underwear. How you came to be wearing it is a mystery to you, as the rest of your clothes are still the exact same ones you had on the night before. All except for that pair of panties. Even the beer stain on the shirt is there. Why your clothes shrank with you, you have no idea, but you really wish that whoever did this to you had at least given you a decent pair of briefs. It's just plain mean to shove a college guy into woman's underwear after knocking him out. Then you go and shrink him, and then leave him somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo begins your quest. To find out who that girl was, and what made you shrink. Your only clues on this quest are the strange discoloration of a birthmark, and of course the pink, frilly panties. Just so mean. So where does your adventure begin?</span></div></div>",

Around you is the waste and decay left after any normal college party. Normally you would just walk away, and hope no one remembered that you were ever there. Of course this time that wasn't really an option as you were sitting in the middle of the floor with the mess towering over you like the Alps. The remains of food and drink surround you, and you can't help but feel intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it isn't really that bad. Obviously whoever lived in this house wasn't awake yet, or you'd hear some kind of booming footsteps, or the thundering voices of titans. As it was everything was calm and still as the first rays of the sun made their slow way over the wooden floor to where you had been passed out. How you'd ended up in the middle of the mess was yet one more of the mysteries you were going to have to try and solve as you attempted to get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollecting yourself you prepare for the long march over the blasted plain of discarded plates, overturned cups, and various other refuse. Over one particularly high mound of burger wrappers you are pretty sure you can see the keg you had a beer from last night, just before everything goes blank. Last night it had seemed that the small metal drum was far to small to quench the thirsts of all the partygoers, but this morning it looks like a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there's a simple reason for that, but you try to ignore it. Thinking about your current size just makes it harder to keep going, as you can see left over bits of food that are bigger than you, and that thought doesn't sit well in your stomach. Looking over the mounds of garbage you spot some other interesting landmarks, including a table, the front door, and of course the stairs to the upstairs, from which there emanates the sound of at least three different sets of snores. Looking around you can't find anything else interesting, so looks like you've got four possible destinations, though you could try to think of others. Where are you headed?</span></div></div>",

As you stand there thinking of how to climb to it,out of the corner of your eye you see something move. You turn your head and see something large and white sticking out from behind the even larger sofa. You couldn't quite make out what it was exactlly. You begin to slowly move torward it. The closer you got the bigger it got.It moved again.You stopped and realized that the big white thing was a sock and in that sock was a foot which meant that you could get some help from whom ever it belonged to.You hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to it but kept some distance between you and the massive thing that towered a good twenty feet above you.You walked around the right side of it carefully looking for the other one but you saw that it was tucked under the other leg. Now you had to see who it belonged to and unfortunately their back was turned to you so you had to walk all the way around to see the face. You slowly crept around the giant form not wanting to wake it till you were sure you would be safe.Just as you were about to come face to face with the sleeping giant you were distracted by the thunderous footsteps that were heading your way.Quickly you make a dash for under the sofa,and just in time to,because where you were standing just a second ago a huge barefoot came crashing down causing the floor beneath you to rumble. from your point of view you couldn't see the face of the giant but from the red painted toe nails on the huge foot that stood before you, you were sure it was a female.You hoped anyway,cuase then again you woke up in pink frilly panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charles wake up!\" you heard a voice boom above you a female voice \"come on we got to clean this place up before my folks get home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles! you think to yourself the sleeping giant was one of your best friends who would certainly help you.You watch as a foot falls from out of nowhere and land on your friends back, then begins to shake him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on get up!\" the giant girl says while she rocks him back and forth with the foot. But who is this girl you ask yourself. You poke your head out far enough to take a look up at her and are stunned to see it was.....</span></div></div>",

The trek is far from easy, though luckily whoever owns the house either fumigates regularly, or at least keeps the seals on the house tight, as despite the garbage, most of which consists of uneaten food and refuse of that sort, there are no bugs. This journey, hard as it is, would likely be even worse for you if you were to face off against a colony of ants or worse yet, a spider of some sort, anything of that genus likely as not to devour you, or drain your innards, neither of which really appeals to your sense of self preservation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk is slow going as you marvel at the stuff around you, all of it so common that were you at your normal size you likely wouldn't have bothered with it. After all it's not your home, which is likely the train of thought that led to this mess in the first place, most of the stuff being things that would have been easily placed into a garbage bag, one of which you can see against the back wall behind the table, though it was probable none of the partygoers, yourself included, notice it during the festivities, the thing hanging limp and empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away from that though. Moaning over the facts of your situation don't change them, and you really need to reach the door before someone in this house wakes up. You don't trust any of them not to have been involved with your current condition, and you can only guess as to why that is. There are some real sickos in the world. Perhaps one of them wanted to play a game with a tiny human. You'd seen pictures online of people doing some pretty creepy things with people who were in a situation very similar to your's. Women rubbing tiny humans against their slits, sucking them into their pussies, or others putting them on food stuffs, like pizza or burgers, and then proceeding to devour them whole and alive, not a fate you particularly relish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting one foot in front of the other, you find your destination getting closer, though you are forced to backtrack more than once to get around a big gulp cup, or some discarded hamburger wrapper or the like. You even got stuck to a piece of pizza once, but were able to pry yourself off it using a piece of pepperoni, covering yourself with the smell of meat. Still, you finally reach your goal, and are happy, yet disturbed at the same time, to find that you have an easy way out, something you hadn't considered when you realized the house had to be shut up tight for there not to be bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour way out happened to be a doggie door, sealed with a bit of weather resistant foam at the side, and with some resin on it that smelled of poison to drive bugs away, though it was just a smell, rather than an actual poison, one of those new items on the market that were pet safe, yet kept them flea free. Of course, you are now faced with a new choice. The fact that the doggie door is open, and you haven't heard any sounds of a dog inside means it's likely the animal is outside. If you go out in your current state...well it's not like a dog to pass up a free treat. Of course, remaining inside might be just as bad if the people inside really had something to do with what happened to you. After a time you come to your decision, and act on it.</span></div></div>",

So you decide to risk becoming a tasty treat, and with a gulp you head outside through the doggy door. Once outside you look around and seeing no sign of the dog let out a sigh of relieve. However, you decide it would best to get out of the open, and so you start to make your way to the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about halfway to the grass when a large booming sound made you stop in your tracks. Then a large shadow loomed over you, and a shiver ran down your spine. Slowly turning around you look up to see a large chocolate lab staring down at you. This must be the owner's dog you realize. Frightened you slowly try to back away, but the lab brings its nose so close to you that you are knocked flat on your bum. The dog then proceeds to start sniffing you. You hope against hope that the lab will lose interest in you, but then you remember, with a shudder, that you covered yourself in the smell of meat when you pried yourself off that slice of pizza with a piece of pepperoni. You no doubt smell like food to this dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nice doggy. Please don't eat me,\" you say, \"Good doggy. Go away please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the dog doesn't listen to you. The lab proceeds to bring its tongue out and lick you, effectively covering you in saliva. Your eyes then widen in terror as you see the lab lick its lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab opens its mouth and brings its tongue out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNOOOO!\" you scream as you're lapped up into its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the lab's mouth you become soaked in even more saliva and get blasted by its warm smelly breath. Then the lab proceeds to lick you against its palette and rolling you around on its tongue as it tastes you some more. You realize that the pepperoni must have also made you tastier as well as the lab continues to taste you. The lab savors your wonderfully delicious meaty flavor for several minutes. Eventually, the tongue settles down and you scream in terror as it starts pushing you towards the back of the throat. The lab tilts its head back and with a loud gulp swallows you whole. You now find yourself slowly travelling down the slimy and fleshy tunnel that is none other than the esophagus. As the rippling muscles slowly massage you down towards the stomach you become covered in mucus and even more saliva. You're filled with terror as the gurgles of the stomach become louder and louder, as if calling to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your journey comes to an end as you bump into ring of flesh that opens up and allows you to fall into the stomach. You fall for a few seconds and land with a splash in nothing else but digestive juices. They waste no time in starting to digest you. You cry out in pain as you're slowly digested alive. Eventually you began to pass out from the pain. Your last thought before you pass out to never awaken again is about how you knew that going outside would result in you becoming a dog's tasty treat.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I opt for the stairs, at least I know someone is up there, maybe even my friend Charlie. He was at the party, I vaguely remember. In fact, he is the one who brought the keg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie showed up at our doorstep a week before the semester started, looking for a room to rent. My parents had extra rooms and always thought it was a good idea to have roomies. Charlie was OK, but just a slight bit off kilter. No one knows where he came from. He walked in the first day with some rambling bit about Volkswagen busses and free camping. Anyway, right now, Charlie was my best bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staircase looms in the distance like a mountain range in the mist. How in the hell am I going to get all the way over there? The floor is littered with things too nasty to mention and I'd rather not think about their origins. It had been a kegger after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and set off for the stairs. I sidestep an overturned plastic cup that started out the evening as a drink glass and ended up as an ashtray. Wow, now that is gross. The liquid dumped out is nicotine-brown, probably the way my teeth will look in couple of years if i don't quit. The smell is overwhelming and I almost lose it. Just what I want to do, contribute to the mess on the floor. I've got to keep it together and get up those stairs. If I don't get a move on people are going to start stirring and I am going to get squashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am going to need a plan to get up those stairs. The first one is twice as tall as I am. I grab an empty cigarette pack and start pulling. This will work great to stand on, but I don't know if I will be able to pull it up to the next step. I grab the top of the pack and pull with everything I have--which isn't much; I'm hanging like a wrinkled curtain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finally get the pack over to the stairs, I hear a strange noise. I jump up on the pack and grab the edge of the next step. The step is warn and smooth and I don't know if I will be able to grip it hard enough to pull myself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise is closer, and rhythmic. It sounds like someone rolling their fingernails on a table in boredom. Tic, tic, tic....tic, tic, tic. I stop trying to pull and turn just in time to see the little dog. Georgie. It looks as if he survived the party and was on his way upstairs. As he neared the first step he stopped and sniffed. Now how this dog smelled me with all of the spilled beer and stale cigarette reek is beyond me, but smell me he did. Thank God this was a small dog, otherwise I think he would have sucked me right up into one of his nostrils, shook his head and sneezed me out like so much snot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Georgie must have remembered me from last night and decided I was familiar. He was nice enough not to breathe, eat, or squash me and started on his merry way up the stairs. I realized this was my chance; this was the only way I was going to get up those stairs before I died of old age. I lunged forward and grabbed a chunk of Georgie's hair and hung on. Georgie stopped and turned slamming my head into the wall. I gripped with all my might, my vision wavering with nausea and dog hair. Georgie gave a little shake and I almost lost my grip. Finally I guess he decided I was along for the ride and he hopped to the next step sending me swinging over his back where I tightened my grip and held on for dear life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, how many guys dream of sneaking into the sorority house on their campus, and here you are, sitting in the center of the hallway, with the rooms of the various girls laid out before you like a buffet. Whatever the circumstances this is an opportunity that most men would give their right testy for, and you get it for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, okay, the panties are a bit of a downer, but even they can't really damped you mood. The shrinking you can live with that for a little while at least. After all you can see under the doors of several of the girls, and you can't help but think that maybe you could stay like this for a while.  Though you are going to try and get back to normal. After a little bit of fun. Okay maybe a few hours of fun. Looking down the hall you can see there is plenty of fun to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to your right is a door marked with a large pink heart. Obviously Melissa's room, as she's the only girl you know who would go for a decoration that tacky. Just to the right of her door is one marked with a large keep out sign. Candy's room, defiantly, as the door, like the girl within, is painted so as to be black as night. Next is Anna's room, which you've been to only once, as she prefers to spend the night at you house, and just down the hall from her door is Lora's room, marked simply because it was the only undecorated door in the entire hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond those four you can see at least half a dozen other rooms, which, as stated before, are all marked in some unique way. Looking down the hall you can feel a tightness in you pants, and are surprised that the panties, which you've decided not to remove until you find some replacement undies, stretch to fit, something a woman's underwear doesn't do. Or maybe it does, you've never worn panties before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head clear of such thoughts you look down the hall again to see the rays of dawn peeking from underneath the portals. Obviously you've been out most of the night, and in a few minutes the girls will start waking up. Before that happens you decide you want to be in one of heir rooms, if for no other reason then to get out of the high traffic hallway, which will soon be full of mammoth feet. Who's door do you head for.</span></div></div>",

At one point you even become stuck as the carpet, which you had been pushing apart as you crawl through it, suddenly becomes harder, refusing to yield to the strength of your micro sized body. Luckily with a bit of effort you are able to push your way through the region and at last emerge on the other side of the door, and into the confines of Anna's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you've been in the room before, so you think you would know your way around, but standing on the floor, barely an inch tall, you can't help but feel overwhelmed by the perspective of everything. The dresser, sitting on one side of the room, had always seemed small to you, now towered above you like some monolith of an ancient civilization. So huge that you nearly fell on your ass as you tried to lean your head far enough back to see the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the feeling of being dwarfed by the furniture you turn toward your real reason for being in the room. In a distant corner, well distant to you anyway, of the great cavern that is Anna's room slumbers the goddess herself, her breathe coming in low, almost hypnotic, gasps that you can't say you haven't heard before, though their tone is a bit lower than it was, probably due to your diminished stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling yourself and pulling up your pants in a manner you remember seeing in some of those old cartoons and movies you start to make your way across the vast field of carpet towards the giantess who should be almost six inches shorter than you, though in the current circumstances she appears several hundred feet taller than you. Oddly you remember commenting last night at the party that you liked tall women, though if this was somebody's way of giving you your wish you wish they'd take it back, or at least give you some guys underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek across the room proves faster than you would have expected, calling to mind the fact that in proportion everything you do at this size, from jumping, to breathing, to even eating, should be occurring at a higher rate. For a moment after reaching the edge of Anna's bed you try and see if you can notice a difference in your breathing at least, but several attempts to hold you breath or take deep gasps prove either that it hasn't changed, or that you are incapable of perceiving the alteration if there is one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course getting to the bed of Anna is only the first part of your problem, as getting into that bed had always proved a problem at regular size, and certainly posed a conundrum at this height. Luckily before you are two ways to ascend the height of the mesa, and approach the goddess that lay atop. One is the bed sheet, which hangs just low enough for you to get to, while the other is in true storybook fashion, as one of Anna's hairs touches the ground nearby, looking like a fiery red tendril snaking its way into the heavens. Which do you climb?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately she doesn't even seem to notice your minuscule addition to the weight of her hair, and continues to sleep high above you, her breathing becoming less regular as you listen to it, indicating that she will soon awaken unto the world, and hopefully to your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no recourse left you take the hair in both hands and being to climb, making sure that it wraps around one of your legs as you do so. This technique, a remnant of your three weeks in boot camp, insures that you won't fall to your death if something were to cause you to lose your grip for some reason. Of course the downside to that is that if you do fall it is highly probable that you will pull your leg out of its socket, causing an injury that would more than likely prove fatal in your current circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring that thought you make your way upward into the dizzying heights of your girlfriend's bed, something you'd been trying to do since you two had started your relationship. Having her come to your bed, which had happened, was one thing, but going to her's was something else entirely, and you'd been dropping hints for the last several weeks about this, most ignored or outright denied by Anna, who \u2018liked her privacy' as she called it. If only she knew how much you were violating her privacy this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese images, pleasant in their own way, are shaken from your mind when something occurs that you hadn't expect. Anna rolls over. This motion, minuscule to the young woman herself, propels you upward at a dizzying speed. Upon reaching the top of the bed you are quick to let go of the strand which afford you your ascent just as it gets tangled up in a mess of Anna's hair as she rolls back over, turning onto her back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the side you are lad you chose the hair over the bed sheet as the spot where you would have been is crushed by her tremendous back. Thanking your stars regarding the previous choice you are now faced with another. Over to one side of you lies Anna's body, specifically those two round hills on her chest, and the pleasure they would bring. Of course getting noticed might be better at this point, and thus Anna's face would probably be the better place to set off towards.

After all you might never get another chance like this again in your entire life, as Anna or any other girl you know would be more than slightly concerned for your safety, and their privacy, if you tried something like this with their knowing. Without any other thought in hand you make your way towards Anna' chest, and the delight of those two huge mounds that adorned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily there was just enough of a gap between her bed covers and he body to let you pass between the two, and into that tent like area that existed right next to her flesh. For a moment you just stand next to her body, touching it and feeling the warmth that flows through it. Listening you can hear the deep rumble of her breath, the beating of her heart, and from farther away the low gurgling sound that can only be her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to ignore that last one you make your way down Anna's body, careful to listen for the slightest rustle, as she might at any moment turn over again and crush you without knowing it. Luckily her sleep seemed more restive now, and you make it to the area right next to breasts. Her nightgown collar, low cut like all her shirts, affords you the perfect rope to climb up and onto her chest, and slowly bring into view those parts of Anna which most men would die to touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing across her firm yet soft flesh you literally slam into one of the things, and somewhere far below you can hear the sound of her giggling at your touch. The noise, which you would expect to be near deafening at your size, is much more subdued, and even slightly calming as you listen to it through the velvet like skin of her chest ornaments. The ground beneath you rises and falls to the rhythm of her breathing, which seems to almost perfectly coincide with the beating of her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving around and keeping your hand on the hill you make your way around it, slowly getting in-between in and its twin. Looking at the two mounds you are dumbstruck, with nothing to say, though plenty you'd like to do, as evidenced by the front of you pants. Before you can though, something unexpected happens, and you are thrown forward, colliding with Anna's bra as she suddenly sits up, and let's out a huge yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANNA!!!\" you shout as you fall, but the giantess on whom you are now hanging doesn't hear you, her ears deafened by the act of yawning. Before she finishes though the wind is knocked from you as you impact her bra, hard, and your cry ends with a series of ragged gasps. Trying to catch your breathe you are hurtling upward as Anna rises to begin her day, the sun just barely showing through the window.

A fact you remember from her stays in you own home during which she was up with the sun, something neither you, nor any of the people you lived with, did on a regular basis. The good thing was unlike most morning people, rather than starting her day off with a shower to revitalize and awaken her after a good night's sleep, which would have likely sent you to a watery grave, Anna instead began with the most important meal of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer footfalls, huge concussions to you, are probably inaudible to the other girls who were still asleep in their rooms, and were unlikely to awaken for an hour at least. This resulted in an almost silent house, a good thing for a mini-man who wanted to be noticed, as there was little to drown out the sound of your voice. Unfortunately your position in Anna's bra forced you to be more focused on keeping from falling to a very painful death, so much so that you can't waste the breath it would take to shout at Anna, and hopefully get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try twice to kick at her breast, knowing that she is quite sensitive there, but the way you are hanging onto Anna's bra puts those lovely, fleshy bulbs just out of range, and when you try to get closer you are nearly knocked off your perch. After regaining you composure and your stability you at last decide that the best thing to do is probably to wait until Anna has at last sat down to enjoy her breakfast, then get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily her dorm is only a single story and the kitchen isn't too far from Anna's room, a fact she said influenced her choice of rooms earlier in the year, being one of those people who liked to eat alone and at some of the most unusual times. Her belly growling far below you and her tongue licking those luscious red lips of her's she makes her way to the fridge. Looking in she sees a few options for a tasty breakfast and closes the door, and cuts off the cold air which nearly froze you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the cabinet, she gets out a skillet and sets it on the stove, pushing one of the knobs inward and turning it till a light came on indicating that the stove top was now on and getting hot. Satisfied with this she then makes her way back over to the fridge and grabs a gray tub you can see says butter on the side, laying it next to the stove.

You are just able to save yourself thought, turning in mid air to wrap your arms around the bra again. Now hanging from the outside you can't deny that any drop would be fatal as Anna's body, which might have caught you had you fallen while on the inside, was not going to be able to do it anymore, and the floor below looked harder than stone and easily able to reduce you to paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you wish you could wave your arms or shout at the titaness who has yet to even acknowledge her tiny passenger. This fact is in part probably due to the party the previous night, which you remember she was at too, and the fact that she hadn't eaten yet. Once she'd had breakfast Anna would come awake fully and then you would easily be able to get her attention. All you had to do was hang on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time Anna set her tub of various things on the counter beside the butter and proceeded to open the butter and with draw a knife from one of the nearby drawers. Looking over your shoulder you watch in amazement as the Ziggurat sized knife moves over you vision, and a plain of white, surrounded by a brown wall was withdrawn from the tub. It took you a minute to figure out that the plain was a slice of bread, over which Anna was now spreading butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that piece is covered Anna sets it un-buttered side down on the counter and quickly withdraws another from within the tub. She repeats he process of the first, making sure she creates a nice even coat of butter on the bread before flipping it over and placing it so that she creates a butter sandwich out of the two slices of bread. After this she walks over to the stove and holds her hand over the skillet she'd gotten out and set up before. Obviously satisfied with the temperature she walks over to the slices of bread again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reaches into the bin, but before she can withdraw anything you feel her breathe catch in her chest, and a deep sound comes from somewhere in her core. This is promptly followed by another deep breath, with an even deeper accompanying sound, and Anna, in an age old gesture brings her hand up to her nose, and you realize that she's about to sneeze, as she begins to make the ah-ing sound people make just before doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna wait!\" you yell as best you can, waving one hand up at her. As before she continues to be unaware of you, and with one last deep inhalation she let's off a huge sneeze, and sends a spray of stuff out of her mouth, and much more importantly, dislodges you from your position on her bra, flying forward. You are spun around many times in the air, nearly losing your lunch as the scene flies by, but this impromptu flight ends moments later as you land safely...</span></div></div>",

Rolling over instead you look up to see Anna rubbing her nose, muttering something about dust in the old dorm, before reaching over into the bin and withdrawing what looks to you like a pink semicircle with darker pink streaks running through it and a ragged edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna then look right at you, her face gracing you as she stares down at the slices of bread she'd prepared. Elation filling your mind you wave up at her, trying to catch your breath so you can shout, but unfortunately for you, you notice that her eyes are still watery from the sneeze moments ago, and she really can't see anything at the moment. Not noticing that small bug on the bread she drops the pink sheet on top of you, pinning you to the bread under its wet, slimy folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick lick of the covering tells you that you are in deep trouble, as the pink sheet is in fact a slice of ham, and it is joined a moment later by something atop it, which you know because of the added weight to the one that was already pinning you down. It doesn't take you more than a second to realize that Anna is making a grilled ham and cheese sandwich for breakfast, something she did many of the times she was over at your house, though never with you as part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANNA! WAIT! I'M IN HERE!!!\" you shout as loud as you can, but the only answer you receive is the motion of her picking up the bread upon which you lay. Knowing you have a single small chance at escape you have a quick choice to make. When she drops the slice of bread into the pan it will allow you to move, and hopefully get out from inside the sandwich. Since you seemed to be about center when you'd landed you realize that can either roll to one side, or try to move backward or forward. Either might lead to freedom. So which is it you pick?</span></div></div>",

You are right at freedom, breathing in that sweet fresh air, when suddenly you impact the ground, and you are nearly crushed as the ham and cheese fall atop you like some death shroud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you hold onto the hope that maybe Anna sees the small bump in her meal, but you are quickly dissuaded of this when a new, heavier weight slams atop you, indicating that Anna has just dropped the second slice of bread on top of the first, completing her sandwich, and sealing your doom. You feel like crying as you are able to stare out of the sandwich at the edge of the skillet. You were literally right on the brink of freedom, but now you are doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis assertion is confirmed seconds later as the pressure atop you increases almost a hundred fold, indicating that Anna is pressing down on the sandwich with a spatula, trying to get it to cook faster. All around you the sound of sizzling can be heard, and as you stare at it the edge of the bread upon which you are laying looks to be browning nicely, and you wonder if Anna with give you a bite of her delicious smelling breakfast. It takes you a second to remember where you are, and how depressing those two thoughts are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, you find that though you are hot, you are not being cooked like you would expect. Even as you watch the edge of the sandwich you can see the cheese is already melting, dripping over the ham, yet you find you are barely sweating at all. When Anna pulls the sandwich up off the skillet for a moment you can almost make out an odd ringing sound from somewhere nearby, though it is thrown from your thoughts as you are slammed back down into the frying pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she thinks her breakfast is ready Anna at last slides it off the skillet onto a waiting plate. Looking down at it she sees an odd bump at the edge, which she flattens out as best she can with her spatula before depositing the cooking tool and pan into the nearby sink. Licking her lips, a sound which is audible to you inside the sandwich, she walks the plate over to the table and sets it down. As she sits down herself though a new gurgling sound, other than that of her stomach, echos from inside her body, and she rises once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay right there, I've gotta take care of some business before with previous tenets before you can move in,\" she says to her sandwich. You remember her doing this before at other meals, talking to her food, and so doesn't find any odder than usual, though now, being part of her meal, you find that it is just a little bit cruel. Time passes slowly as you lay stomach down inside the sandwich, and it seems like an eternity before a series of booms approaches, and then you are suddenly jerked up skyward to stare into the face of...</span></div></div>",

DON'T EAT ME!!!\" you cry out as loud as you are able, before your world is cast into darkness again. However, rather than being moved around and jostled some more everything seems frozen now, and you think that maybe, just maybe, Anna heard your desperate cry for help. Your illusions at rescue are further heightened as light again enters her mouth and you are moved about, but when you find yourself shoved up against her cheek and now laying on your side you know she was just getting what she thought was a bite of sandwich out of her way so she could talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BABY? WAS THAT YOU?\" she asks softly, so as not to wake anyone else, but inside her mouth her voice is all around you, and you wish you could cover your ears, but the pressure of her cheek pins you in the position you are in. You can't even squirm to get her attention, and every time you try to cry out to her that you're in her mouth her saliva goes into your's, causing you to choke. Then the whole world around you shifts upward, and you know she's gotten up from her seat to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BABY? WHERE ARE YOU?\" she asks again, and the world around you continues to duck, weave, and bob as she moves about. Through her mouth you can't hear very well, but you can just make out the sound of opening cabinets, and sliding window shades as she searches the entire room for where you could be hiding. At one point you can even feel the chill in the air as she opens the fridge, as she'd somehow thought to look in there for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her move through the house, and realize that she's sitting back down as light again floods her mouth, and you are flipped over again, this time landing on your back, and staring outward at the world beyond her tooth filled maw.

It actually seems to you that it is resisting more than it should, and you hope that maybe Anna bit off a little more than she could swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you know that's impossible. Anna was part of a sorority who's test was that famous goldfish swallow thing, and Anna had set the current standing record for not only swallowing three at once, but also for doing more than fifty in a single sitting.

You try to laugh at the absurdity of it, especially when you remember asking Anna once if she would ever try and swallow you. The whole thing had been a joke, after seeing her do her thing. You hadn't actually ever wanted t do this, and yet you felt yourself getting hard as you thought about the situation, and you had to admit, this was what amounted to the ultimate deep throating experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything around you goes dark, as the light from above becomes cut off by Anna's constricting throat. Now you really are caught. Anna can't get you out, and the whole world is cut off by her body.

All she thinks is that she was hearing things, and you're as good as digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of ringing surrounds you again, and you feel the slimy sliding around you stop.

The instant it touches your skin you can feel the tingling take over, and you search about desperately for something to get you out of the acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the only things in sight of you are the pieces of bread which are slowly sinking as they suck up the acid like sponges, the pieces of ham and cheese which are stuck together and somehow remaining afloat despite the roughness of the waters, and the wall, which you can see even in the dim light is moving in and out, causing the roughness you feel.

That fact alone would have altered your plans, as it proved to be one of the defining moments of your entire adventure, if not your entire life, though you didn't know it until it was over. This fact, this little tidbit of information, was that while you were swimming inside Anna's stomach, she had continued her meal, and just as you got near the raft of meat and cheese, you heard a squelching sound from above, and looked upward just in time to see the ring of flesh that served as an entrance to the stomach pucker open, another bite of your girlfriend's breakfast coming down, and falling as it did, the ball of mushed up bread, meat, and cheese fell right on top of you, carrying you down into the gurgling depths of the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pounded at it of course, as your eyes and ears started to burn because the acid was getting into them, and you actually felt the hairs all over your body, and those inside your ears too, melt into strings of proteins that would later be absorbed into her body. You weren't about to let her stomach take the rest of you that easily, but as you pounded and smashed your fists against the ball of mush that held you, you melt your lungs begin to burn. At first you thought it was the lack of air, but when one of your fists was pushed back into you by the mush, you found you could touch your own ribs, and crying softly to yourself you let go and stopped fighting, knowing that even if you got back to the surface now, you would never survive. Going still you closed your eyes, and drifted into slumber, allowing the stomach to do its work in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later Anna was sitting on the toilet reading a magazine, wondering for the seventh time today where you could be. She'd called your parents, and they too were getting worried about you, neither of them having heard from you since last night, when she had talked you into going to the party with her. She wasn't completely sure what happened after that, but then again, neither was anyone else. Everyone's memory of the party was fuzzy, and she was going to get to the bottom of it. Grunting in effort she pushed out the last of her waste and then stood up to wipe herself, before pressing the handle to flush it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwirling around the load was sucked into the pipes, the motion of it rocking about as it flowed downward, finally spilling into the sewer, and getting caught in what looked like a glowing sheet of light, cursing again as another load came down a figure sat up as most of the waste passed through, but then shouted in excitement as the sheet of light changed from the blue of its capture mode, to the red of having caught something. Reaching into the glowing sheet the figure drew their hands through it, pulling at the light, and finally retrieving a small bit of pink cloth with frilly edging. Sighing the figure shook their head as they pulled out a cellphone from a pocket of their jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Agent X3A. I've got the artifact, but the subject is not with them. Considering the retrieval method, I believe it is safe to assume that the subject is dead,\" it said, and a small garbled voice on the other side of the transmission spoke to it in a dialect that didn't sound like it could come from a human mouth, though the figure nodded at it as if it understood whatever the person on the other side was saying just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. I'll return with the artifact right away,\" it said, hanging up and quickly walking away, muttering something that sounded like a prayer for your passing.</span></div></div>",

You know that you are in the woods, probably less than a mile from the campus, but beyond that you can't tell where you are thanks to the fact that the trees look like titanic pillars that are keeping the sky aloft. You toy with the idea of climbing one, but decide to give up after failing to climb a root that looked to have more than enough handholds, but quickly proved that too much of anything is bad, and the rough surface was just as hard to climb as a smooth wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling disheartened by both your situation, and the fact that you are wearing such a demeaning attire, you sit in the dirt and begin tossing random pebbles at the nearby trees. Why you did this you had no idea, but it made you feel better to lash out at something, even if it was just an innocent plant. You weren't gonna give up yet though. You were still a human, a member of a species that conquered a world, and went from fire to rockets in nothing flat on the evolutionary time scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing back to normal wasn't going to be easy, but then again few things in life are. You're just gonna have to figure out what the hell happened, and then beat the living crap out of whoever it was who did this to you until they turn you back. With that happy thought in mind you begin your trek through the woods, walking around the root that had taken up a lot of your view, and out into the wide world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice when you get around the root, is that whoever it was who dumped you was really lazy, as you were less than a yard from the foot path that ran through the woods.

Gripped in his left hand is a whicker basket, or at least you think it's a whicker basket. At your size it's hard to tell. You don't recognize the man, though his brown beard and thinning hairline seem familiar to you. Right behind him comes what you guess to be his wife. She, like her husband, is a titan of monolithic proportions. She towers high above you, pushing branches out of her face that are at least as thick as you are tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer you know, you think. Her face is hard to see from an inch high perspective off the dirt path, but the brown-black hair, and the way she's swinging her hands makes you at least eighty percent positive that she is none other than Mrs. Amos, the English literature professor at the college you go to. That would make her husband Mr. Amos, one of the youngest who sits on the board of trustees. Considering that their still supposed to have a seven year age with Mr. Amos being the older, he looks pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the two adults come what you have to assume are their children, though from your view all the people look a lot alike as you focus mainly on the size rather than on the faces. Right behind her parents, and holding her mother's hand is a little girl, probably no more than eight or nine, possibly even younger than that thanks to the age warping effects your perspective is having on the people you are looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the group of three children is a boy who looks to be about thirteen. Again the age is not really that easy to identify from on the ground, but you are pretty sure the kid is thirteen from the way he's looking around. He has the bored with life, yet still interested in the world look that only new teens can really master. His eyes are darting every which way, for a moment passing over you as you hop up and down, but then moving on to something else that catches his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing up the rear is a girl who is sixteen. This time you are certain, but only because you met Angela when you took Mrs. Amos' class last semester. The girl seems more apathetic to the world now than she did then, and that is quite a feat considering the girl appeared to be a statue during that day in class when her mom had to pick her up thanks to a bomb threat at the local high school. She's not even looking down, and as she passes you stop shouting and jumping, as it seems a waste of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking after the family of titans you are faced with a choice. Follow them and hope to get some attention, or go back down the path which they were walking, as it obviously leads back to civilization, and hopefully someone who can get you big again.

If you'd thought about it earlier you could have jumped onto a shoe, or at least tried to anyway. As it stands right now they are almost a mile away, and getting farther every second. At your size you could never even keep pace with their monumental strides, let alone trying to go faster than them so you can catch up. Looking around you have to think fast or you might never catch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour desperate search reveals only one method of catching up to the Amos family, though you'd rather have found nothing considering what it is. Laying just a few inches away from you is a rock. Now this isn't anything out of the ordinary considering you're in the woods, but trapped under that rock is a leaf, which is attached to a branch. Looking at it you can't see how the rock trapped the leaf like it did, as the rock is several dozen times your size, but you can't argue that it's convenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning over to the leaf you give it a quick inspection, and realize right off the bat that you could get it to work. The leaf's edge is trapped under a rock, but it looks like the force of the branch trying to get back to normal has been slowly tearing at it, and now a small rip in one side is almost ready to snap the whole leaf in two. Climbing on to it you find that the leaf is just about your size, a lucky break for you as you grab the end of the leaf near the branch and lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the catapult ready you look towards your target, and find that you have an almost perfect shot for getting to them, and without really considering what you're doing you kick as hard as you can at the rock behind you. A loud ripping sound splits the air, and the leaf at last breaks in two, and the branch, with you on it, leaps back to its normal angle. As you expected you are launched into the air, screaming as you fly towards the titanic forms of your would-be saviors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flight, as ill planed and conceived as it is, is right on target and you pass right next to Mrs. Amos' ear. Your scream of terror causes her to turn back, but unfortunately she does it in the opposite direction, and so just misses seeing you fly ahead of her, right into the side of the picnic basket Mr. Amos is holding. Slamming into the whicker thing with a load of force you expect to be turned to some kind of messy goo, but somehow you survive, and are forced to scramble for a hand hold and then hold on for your life as the basket does a one-eighty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, hon?\" asks Mr. Amos, turning back to face his wife who is looking back into the woods. The man is oblivious to the small bit of weight you add to his burden. Considering the size difference you had expected his voice to be booming and thunderous, but really it just sounds like a radio with the bass turned all the way up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought I heard something, but I don't see anything...\" she says, trailing off as she peers deeper into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably just a bug, mom. I swear. We could have done this whole family bonding thing back at home. Why'd you and dad have to drag us off into these stupid bug infested woods?\" says Angela tersely to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on Angy. It's really cool out her. I mean did you see that weird looking bug a minute ago,\" says her brother, pointing back along the path, to about where you were standing a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't, Dennis, and I don' want to you little brat,\" she tells her brother venomously, before storming up the path ahead of her family, brushing the picnic basket, and causing her father to turn it, putting you on the front instead of the backside which faces his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are again forced to grip the basket as hard as you can as the father quickly raises and lowers it, probably in a simple shrugging gesture. To you though it feels like an elevator suddenly going up and then going down, but after a second a gentle swaying motion ensues, and you get to look forward. Right ahead now walks Angela, but beyond her is a clearing in the woods that is obviously the destination of the family. As you break through the trees you see...</span></div></div>",

Relieved that your roller coaster ride is over you let go of the wicker basket and fall to the table below. You take a moment to look around, but before you can even begin to get your bearings the table below you suddenly jumps. Dennis has hopped onto the other end of the table, causing your end to rise enough to fling the picnic basket into the air almost an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately your tiny body is much lighter than the basket, and so is thrown high into the air. As you arc into the sky high above you hear a slight ringing noise, which you can't identify, though if you had to make a wild guess you would say that it was coming from inside your pants. You don't have very long to think about it before your arc reaches its highest point, and you stop for a moment before plummeting to the ground below. Where do you land?</span></div></div>",

Considering your only about and inch tall the landing should hurt. Hell, hurt nothing it should kill you. Even a foot drop should be enough to turn you into a little smear, and you are more than a little sure that your flight was higher than a foot. Probably something like three or four. Yet you land on the grill with a dull, clink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang for a moment over the bar of the grill, your armpits hooked over the bar and holding you over the bottom of the fire pit. Looking over at the table you can only guess that some random act of fate stopped you from getting your arms ripped off and then breaking every bone in your body as you slam into the metal bottom of the grill. As it is you are mystified by what just happened. You are so mystified in fact that you don't hear any booming, and your first warning that something is up is when a shadow falls over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you have some hope that one of the family saw your little flight and is coming to investigate, but that illusion is quickly dispersed as you look up to find Mr. Amos standing over you, a bag of charcoal in hand, and unfortunately for you, his head turned towards his family though what he's saying you can't hear. You don't understand why, but then you don't get that much time to care as the ground under you suddenly begins to move and rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grinding sound the rust covered hinges give to Mr. Amos, and the grill pops up, but thanks to the way your holding on you don't go flying, and instead just slide down the length of the iron rod, until you slam into the wall. Looking over towards the titanic form of Mr. Amos affords a view of coal being dumped into a grill, and then the hiss and smell of lighter fluid as he crushes the can between his hands. As if that weren't enough to knock you out the man quickly strikes a match and tosses it among the black boulders. Setting them ablaze in crimson glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to claw your way up onto the bar, and thus away from the flames, only seems to draw the fast rising pillars towards you, and soon your entire world is blackened by the smoke coming off of the coal. Unable to see you are taken completely by surprise when the world slams down again, and you are sent up on a short hop, before coming down on some grainy, gravely red surface that smells strangely of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you more than a hundredth of a second to realize that you are on a hamburger patty sitting on a grill. It takes you even less time to realize that the shadow above you , with holes of light shining through it, is a spatula. Again you hear a slight ringing sound, though this time you ignore it for the more \u2018pressing' matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mr. Amos! Don't! I'm down here!!!\" you cry out towards the giant wielding the metal tool, but over the hiss and roar of the flames, and the chatter of his own family, Mr. Amos doesn't hear your pathetic squeak. With a crushing force the spatula pushes you into the hard, yet somehow malleable surface below you.

Thinking about it you can't even begin to guess how a frozen piece of meat was still soft enough to push you into it, but you don't really care either, as how you got in is much less important that how you get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you try and rip yourself free of the patty, but find that it is like a roach trap. It let you in easy enough, but it has a death grip that won't let you go without one hell of a fight. Still for your life you are very prepared to put up such a fight and begin to pull at your legs and arms, trying to burst out of prison you find yourself in. You don't know how long this goes on, but you begin to feel more than a little warm after awhile, and then a shadow passes over you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you are afraid it might be Mr. Amos moving to press on the burger again, but you find out in a second that it is much worse than that, as the spatula moves under the burger, and then with a speed you can't believe you fly in the air again, and then slam down onto the grill with so much force that your afraid you might really rip out of your bonds, and fall right into the blazing inferno that is raging below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, or unluckily as the case may be, your prison stays solid, and you look down onto the flames for a second before one leaps to try and burn your face off. This time you are defiantly lucky, as somewhere above you Mr. Amos pushes the burger, and your face, instead of staring over the open pit of flames, is now staring at the hot iron of the grill. Gazing upon it you can't help but feel that you should be hotter than you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are sweating quite a bit. It feels like whole buckets of the salty stuff have poured from your skin, yet you really can't feel a burn on your body, while all around you the once red burger is slowly turning a nice black, and smelling quite good. It takes you a minute to realize what your last thought was, and then begin shouting again at the giant wielding the spatula. As before he doesn't hear you, and continues to converse with his family, but over the roar of the flames you can't make out what he's saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning at all your view of the dull iron bar is replaced by a slick and sheen silvery kind of metal. The spatula then lifts up towards you, and you can actually see your own reflection in it as the world seems to move like a rocket straight up, and then suddenly dips back down. Hoping for something to get you out of this mess, you are disappointed when the spatula pulls back, and reveals that you are now sitting face down inside a burger.

Right in front of your face there's a bottom burger bun, and you're somewhere in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you've already put my burger on the bun? Hehe you know I like to assemble it by my own honey.\" You heard Mrs. Amos saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt movement upwards as the patty with you was lifted from the bun and put down again on the plate, this time you were facing up as she flipped the burger by mistake. You saw her gigantic face looking straight at you with hungry smile. Your own face appeared burned a little and blended well with the patty texture, so there was no chance that she will see you. Also, by now you've realized that any shouting won't make any difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!! Please don't eat me!! Please! I don't want to be your food!\" you wanted to scream but there was no point. Mrs. Amos saw only a delicious burger in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered the ingredients and started assembling the hamburger to her liking. First, she spread some mayo on the bottom bun. Then added some lettuce and tomato slices on top of that. She grabbed the patty, this time keeping you face up and put it on the tomato slices. <br>\r\nThe next thing you saw was her hands around a red bottle with open white cap right above you. She gave a squeeze and squirted ketchup all over the patty and on you. Some got in your eyes and inside your mouth. you blinked few times to clear your eyes just in time t see a slice of cheese covering you. The cheese blocked all your vision and now all you could see was ketchup and a yellow screen. You felt some mor pressure and guessed she added some pickles or something, but you couldn\u2019t tell for sure. At last she put on the top bun and gave a press that squashed you a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s it, this is how I'm gonna end, as some burger add in being eaten by one of my teachers\" you bitterly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while you heard the noises around you, the family members chatting, some commented that their burger is good, some just talk on this and that. They were living their lives, having a good time and a delicious meal while your life were about to end soon, maybe chewed inside her mouth, maybe swallowed whole and digesting alive in her stomach. <br>\r\nYour one and only consolation was that Mrs. Amos is the one who will eat you, she was good looking for her age, and good looking in general. You preferred that if it must come to that, and in the situation you found yourself in, out of the five people present she was the least worst the be eaten by. Much better option than her husband or boy or her bratty daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly out of the blue, while you drenched in the thoughts about the last moments of your life, you felt her hands grabbing the burger and bringing it close to her mouth. you wish that you could see something but you were stuck in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a great squeezing pressure and you assumed she took a bite somewhere below your legs. She hasn't got to you yet.<br>\r\n\"MMMMmmmm.. this is amazing!\" You heard her saying while chewing a mouthful of the burger.  <br>\r\nYou wondered what will happen next as she\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew that for some reason, while shrunk like this you were more durable than you should. Alas, there must be a limit to how much you can endure, and you were about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next bite you felt something hard brushing off your foot. Her teeth just touched your foot but haven't bitten it off yet. Your foot could be seen new inside the patty, you felt the cool fresh air on it.<br>\r\n\"Maybe she'll see it and realize there's something extra in the burger, maybe I'll be saved!\"<br>\r\nYou hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two more bites somewhere in the burger that were near you but didn't touch you. Your heart was pounding fast as you braced for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great pressure is applied on your entire body, squeezing the meat's juices and the ketchup into you. The teeth came from above and below at the same time right on your crotch and ass, catting you in half in a swift motion. The pain was immense and you screamed in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Amos continued to chew her last bite. \"HMMMMmmmm.. WOW! That burger is amazing! Honey, did you put something special inside?\" she asked her husband. <br>\r\n\"Well you know, just my love.\"<br>\r\n\"Hehe, this is absolutely delicious!\" Mrs. Amos replied, talking with her mouth full of hamburger and you lower body half. <br>\r\nYou were agonizing. Sitting stuck in there, missing half of your body. You lost it in favor of some extra good taste for your beautiful teacher. While you were in pain, crying knowing that you are not going to recover from this, she was in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wondered what will come next, and if she will look inside her burger to see something strange, the great bite pressure came again. The pressure point was near your head ad this time her teeth cut right on top of it, sliding on the cap.  The rest of the burger was moved back and you inside that bite stayed inside her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her mouth was hot and damp. The smells were terrible. You could smell her breath, and the strong food taste. It was like being inside a bubble made of burp. The sugary coke that she sipped between bites made the smells and stickiness even worse. She pressed the bite with her tongue, savoring the taste, and spread it to the sides so the teeth could start their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire world started to spin, twist, and sloshed around. Your senses were overwhelmed by biting pressure, strong smells of burger, ketchup, and burp, and tastes. The entire mush mixed with her saliva, coating your entire upper body, forcing itself inside your mouth, nose, and ears. <br>\r\nYou felt her tongue sloshing you around, drowning you with saliva and chewed mush. At one point you were laying face on it and Mrs. Amos just enjoyed your taste. <br>\r\n\"MMMM.. MMMM.. YUMMY!!\" her voice boomed, almost causing your ears to explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCranck! One of your hand just got bitten off. \"At least I'm not dying for nothing, at least I'm providing her with nutrients and my great taste\" you thought. <br>\r\nThe other arm soon followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were lost between the chewed mush of meat, ketchup, tomatoes and the rest of the burger, and her saliva, the strong stinky smells, her soft wet tongue, all inside her warm mouth.<br>\r\nYou almost haven't noticed that your head came laying on a hard surface. You have just come to a realization of what's coming when her upper teeth came down on your face, crushing your nose inside first then continue flattening your head to add it to the rest of the mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Amos savored the taste of you chewed body and hamburger before swallowing. Your remains arrived at her stomach second later, landing at the pool of digesting acids, chewed food and coke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never found out why you have been shrunk, and couldn't get back to normal size, but you did find out that you are very tasty on a burger. At least your death was somewhat meaningful, you could have just get being stepped on by mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You still can't see anything, because your face is pressed into the bun under you. Despite not seeing anything, you knew you were doomed as the boy prepared his hamburger. You heard the bottles squirting there contents onto the meat. Some ketchup even seeped down onto you, and made it harder to breathe.After the boy had put on all his condiments, he took the top of the bun, and pressed it onto the hamburger. You were being crushed between a hamburger patty, and bread, not something you ever thought would happen to you! This thought stopped suddenly though, as you heard a deep gurguling.

Opened wide you stare into that cavern of doom as little pillars of saliva flow from the top to the bottom, or the bottom to the top depending on which pillar you're looking at. In between the boys teeth you can see bits of his previous bite, and in the dark recesses of the cave you can just make out the wall that is his throat as it seems to gape open in anticipation of the arrival of more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy obliges his throat, shoving the burger, you included, into his maw. Instantly you are hit by the change in atmosphere as his hot breath covers you, causing you to sweat again almost as badly as you had when you were being cooked. The saliva tendrils look like cables to you as the hamburger is shoved against them and you foolishly hope they might in some way stop the boy from getting his meal all the way into his mouth, but the rope like spittle breaks easily as the burger presses deeper into the darkness, and you are looking right down that abyss here you can just make out the sounds of sloshing water, or rather acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last thought is punctuated as the boy lets out a small belch, probably totally unknowingly, but that little rise of air from his stomach is nearly enough to turn your's as the smell of partially digested meat, grains, and various plants comes to meet you nose. You used to clean the litter box at your house, so you know what stink is when you smell, and this is worse than all the cat litter boxes in the world put together, and you wonder if the boy would notice if you vomited into his throat right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it matters as from somewhere behind you, you hear a sound like something you'd expect at an auto junkyard from a car crush. Doesn't take a genius to figure out that the boy is finally tearing into his latest bite of burger, and if he finishes you are going to be inside his mouth when he begins that first important step on the digestive process known as \u2018chewing your food'.

This means your only recourse is to extract yourself from this situation and hope that somehow you are able to avoid not only getting ground into a mushy paste but that you are also able to get out of the boy's mouth before he swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first problem seems the worst as you push against your beefy prison with your arms, which you realize might send you plummeting into the vortex of the boy's throat. Luckily for you the boy's previous bite had sifted the hamburger patty, of which you were a part, around, causing several chunks that once held you to fall away easily. With grunts of effort, and a bit of kicking with your legs, you are able to create a kind of hole in the patty, allowing you to begin pulling yourself out of the burger so you can effect your escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your doing this, though, Dennis, the boy who is at this time attempting to add you to his diet, is not sleeping. His slicing teeth are at last able to tear off a bit of his burger, and he closes his mouth completely, savoring for a moment the taste of real flame burnt meat. His savoring is a problem for you as he uses his tongue to shift the bite around, nearly causing you to fall straight down into his stomach, but with a monumental feat of strength you hold, and realize that if you but wait a moment you can ride his bite t the front of his mouth, away from his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course if you do ride this bite of burger you might end up atop one of his molars, with little hope of extracting yourself before he brings the top set down. Since neither of these two scenarios is appealing to you, you stop to think for a second, and figure that you have a sixty-six percent chance of getting chewed if you stay where you are. On the other hand there is a one hundred percent chance of getting swallowed if you let go, but in getting swallowed there is a fifty-seven percent chance you might cause the young Amos boy to choke. Looking around you know you have only a moment to decide, before Dennis takes it out of you hands.</span></div></div>",

After all you are an inch tall, and you know people have choked on things as small as a pea before. If you can just get your arms and legs out you should be able to cause enough of a block to get the boy to start coughing to dislodge you, hopefully spitting you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hastily thought out plan is put into action just in time as Dennis' tongue moves the burger you were sitting on forward in his mouth and begins chewing it into mush. Your last view of it in the oddly bright mouth of the boy is as the part you were actually gripping but a second ago being crushed between the back most pair of white rocks, leaving little doubt that you would have been reduced to a bloody heap had you remained on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later you fall into the boy's oddly roomy esophagus. For a moment you are afraid you over estimated your size, and that you might just be able to fall straight into the boy's stomach, but luckily his throat senses you just in time as one of your shoes brushes against it, and it catches you in its tight grip. In fact he grip is so tight that your arms and legs, which you had been holding as far out as possible, were painfully forced back toward you body, and you hear an odd buzzing sound that you think might be caused by the pain, though you could swear you've heard it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother instant passes and the throat walls begin to drag you down, forcing you to admit that even though you are an inch tall the boy might be able to still swallow you whole. You know you fell quite a ways down, and that you will reach his stomach, and death, in only seconds if nothing happens. Luckily for you something does happen as the esophagus suddenly comes to the spot where it meets the lungs and it finds it can't expand enough to allow your passage, causing Dennis to start coughing and choking, and you feel yourself rising with each earth shaking concussion, moving once more toward his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dennis, are you okay?\" comes Mrs. Amos' voice, oddly distorted as it translates down the boy's throat. Looking up you can see straight to the top of his throat, and the light streaming in indicates that his mouth his open, and empty now, as he continues to cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, do you need a little help?\" asks Mr. Amos, who, unknown to you, walks up behind his son.

A brief, frozen moment passes as you feel the whole world tilt, indicating that you were inside his neck, as Dennis tosses his head back and gives a powerful swallow, sending you back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n::GULP!:: The sound comes from all around you like the death knelling of a church bell in one of those old World War II documentaries. This time nothing stops you as you slide down deeper into Dennis, and you wish you could scream out, but the pressure of the walls around you is just great enough to keep you from taking any more than a swallow breath as you pass down into the center of the body of the teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your descent is stopped as you feel your feet stand atop some firm bit of floor, which you quickly identify as the muscular ring that controls passage into the stomach. For a moment you have a hope that maybe you are still too big for it, but this is proven in correct as it slowly sucks in your feet, causing you to feel like your body is in a vice.  Then you find yourself kicking as your feet emerge into an open chamber and you are having your ribs broken by the pressure of ring as it squeeze your torso through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last only your head remains, and you look up the fleshy tube of Dennis' throat one last time as it constricts, blocking off the outside world, and trapping you inside this hellish cavern of flesh. With a popping sound your head makes it's way through the ring and into the chamber below. For a brief instant you are in freefall, before impacting into a pasty goo that is mixed up with a liquid that you can see bubbling and frothing everywhere it has touched something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole process of getting down Dennis' throat probably took only a few seconds, though to you it was an eternity, and as you sit on the pile of mush and goo the whole cavern, or rather stomach though you refuse to think of it in that term, shifts to one side as Dennis leans forward, breathing heavily. All around you the walls move in and out to the rhythm of the howling winds which you can hear above, and you impact the wall of the stomach as you slide over the rough textured, yet slick stomach floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Dennis completely now you can hear the beating of his heart as well as his breathing, and somewhere outside you can hear other sounds, probably the voices of his family asking if he's alright, but over the workings of his body you can't make out anything of their muffled speech. You think you hear Angela say the word dork, but that might just be you hearing things, and at last your prison rights itself up as Dennis returns to his sitting position, and in a moment he will probably also return to his meal, which has already got his stomach churning, creating pools of acid which will eventually consume you if you don't do something, fast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today isn\u2019t a very good day for you. First, you got shrunk to the height of an inch by some magical hijinks and woke up in a middle of the forest, wearing a girl\u2019s underwear. Then you nearly become tiny BBQ on a griller with some burger patty. Next, you got eaten by your teacher\u2019s son. You choked him, and he swallowed you (with the help of a few mighty pats on the back). And now you are in his stomach, being more miserable than ever before. The pink, velvety and incredibly wrinkly organ is as big as a large cavern. There is no way to reach the pyloric sphincter, and acid is being sprayed in the air like a mad scientist\u2019s garden sprinkler. Clouds of smelly, greenish fumes from the digestion of Dennis\u2019s food fill the air, giving you a hard time to breathe and a plenty of coughing and gagging. You choke him with yourself, so he chokes you with deadly acid mist. Neat. And it\u2019s hot. The crazy Finnish sauna kind of hot. All the heat generated from his working body, the enzyme breaking down pieces of his delicious burger, and the acid burning on your skin is driving you mad. Dennis\u2019s stomach recovered quite fast from the shock of being nearly choked to death and is now kicking its gear in digesting the teen\u2019s meal. You can barely stand at all. Every time you managed to get on your legs, his belly churns violently, knocking you down and shaking everything up like a giant mixer of death. Dennis doesn\u2019t stop at the burger. He keeps eating and drinking, shoving more and more food into his black hole of a mouth and rain apocalypse onto the poor tiny little human inside his belly. Teenagers. Their growing body consumes more food than a hungry dinosaur. From the top of the gigantic organic cave you are in, boulders of chew-up burger buns and patty descend from the sky. They don\u2019t hit too hard, but they struck the murky surface strong enough to make you lose your balance even more. And to make the matter worse, every now and then, he burps. And every time he burps, his stomach turns into a battlefield that has just been struck by an A-bomb, minus the flaming light that melts your eyes. His burps melt your eardrums instead. The shockwaves generate from those burps shook the stomach so much that you swear a tsunami of melting food was formed inside his belly. If there is any place that can be called hell, it is the stomach, and we are should be thankful that we can\u2019t get into this hell, as we carry it inside our body every day. Well, not much for the poor unfortunate 2-inch-tall soul who got imprisoned in it. Stricken by fear, paranoia, and largely anger, you punch the boy\u2019s stomach repeatedly. Indigestion can be a bitch to handle, and if you can\u2019t choke him to cough you out, you would annoy his stomach until he vomits. Not a great plan. Punching the stomach is basically the same as punching a block of fleshy jelly filled with acid. After a while, everything you achieve is a pair of acid-burnt hands, two painful wrists, and more anger. But at least the boy gets some slight irritation in his belly, so yay? It made a few grunts in disbelief, surprise at the piece of food fighting back for its survival. Then the grunts just getting smaller and smaller, like the stomach having realised how insignificant you are, and just laugh it off. Apparently, the stomach\u2019s ways of handling rebellious food (if food can ever rebel) is more acid and more shakes, and the rebellion will be thwarted soon. The more you punch, the more intense the stomach churns, and the more acid it spills. Indeed, after exactly 56 punches and a series of screams, mumbles and so much profanity that would cause a heart attack to a nun, you gave up. Everything you do is just useless against Dennis. The best thing you made is making his stomach itch a little bit before it went full-gear into digestion and burnt your hands, gave you a concussion and probably a shattered ego. You are 3-inch-tall. You are being melted by the stomach acid of a boy who, besides being your teacher\u2019s son, is basically just a stranger to you. What have you done to ever suffer such cruelty! Depressed and exhausted, you sit into a corner of his stomach, patiently wait for acid to melt you to human slushy and be released from this hellhole. At least his heartbeats sound a little bit more comfortable now. But there is an itching feeling inside you, disrupting your thought. In fact, it has been itching you since you were inside his throat, but you were to focus on choking the boy to notice it. \u201cMeh! It probably just the acid eating me inside\u2026\u201d you boringly said.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nWait!<br>\r\nWAIT!<br>\r\n\u201cWeren\u2019t I suppose to be \u2026, like an inch tall at most?\u201d you said before suddenly realise some very, very weird is happening to your tiny body. \u201cI\u2026am\u2026growing! Wait I am growing! I AM GROWING! WHAT THE HELL! I AM GROWING\u201d you scream in joy. You stand up, and it is true that you are growing. 15 minutes ago, you could barely hold your head above the swamp of melting burger. Now the murky liquid is at most the height of a normal kiddie pool. You have been growing since the time you got eaten. That\u2019s why you can even punch the stomach\u2019s wall like you would normally punch something, rather than making weak weightless punches like in the pool. The sheer shock and blunt trauma the organ gave you, along with your struggle to stay alive has clouded your senses and perception. And the only thing that alerts you is the itches that you have been feeling lately. You are now three times taller than before, and clearly, whatever magical hijinks or science mumbo-jumbo that shrank you is now wearing off, slowly. And that is a good news. If you can just grow big enough, you can actually make him throw up his meal and release you from this torturous hell of a stomach. Or you can just crawl out of his throat, giving him a little bit discomfort with an addition of mental shocks. Worst case scenario, you burst out from his belly in his sleep like those fricking Xenomorph (replace the chestburster with a fully-grown man and you will have this scene). A little bit too bloody, and traumatizing, but hey, you survive! Having done fantasizing about your escape, your confidence grows, and you stand up again, in the middle of the chaotic belly, punching even harder than before. Your escape is inevitable. You will survive, and the will of a man full of confidence and hope will not be thwarted by some random brat\u2019s hungry tummy (at least for now).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His dad took care of it, and the young boy took the pleasure to relieve himself by eating another bunch of burgers. His belly, however, didn\u2019t seem to approve his tremendous appetite. Ever since Dennis finished his meal, there\u2019s been a weird feeling inside his stomach. At first, it felt like a tiny itch, which by itself, wasn\u2019t much of a problem. But then that itchy feeling is replaced with a feeling of\u2026bloat. Like his stomach is actually bloating. He first thought it was because he eats too much, like 5 burgers or so. But it just keeps getting worse. Whatever is inside his belly right now, be it food or some weird alien parasites it is growing. And it is angry at being eaten. That makes him uncomfortable, and also nauseous. Hiding behind the family van, Dennis rolls up his shirt, exposing his white, smooth belly, now swollen and aching as if he has eaten a pack of tennis balls. He can hear the digestive organ groans in discomfort, singing that whale mating song that would embarrass him in front of his class. The 13-year-old feels like he could throw up at any moment. That would ruin this picnic, and his clothes, and also his self-esteem (for some reasons) and Dennis doesn\u2019t like that. He gently rubs his bloated belly, trying to ease his obviously overworking tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhen are you gonna name that baby in your belly?\u201d said his sister Angela as she suddenly pokes her head from behind the boy, greatly surprises him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaahh! Goddamnit Angela! I told you I don\u2019t like being scared like that!\u201d Dennis yells at his older sis, clearly show his annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like that! Also, language! Anyway, what are you doing sneaking here? How long have you been admiring that fat belly of yours? Or\u2026. OMG have you been mastu\u2026\u201d she smugly said, before breaking into a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! Shut up, Angela!\u201d Dennis\u2019s face grows red as he yells at her, interrupting the older teen before she can finish her sentence. \u201cIt just\u2026.my belly has been acting very weird!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you do look like mom when she was pregnant, so probably because you eat too much?\u201d Angela laughs, obviously enjoy messing with her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope! It feels \u2026funny! The bad kind of funny. Like something is growing inside my belly! And that thing isn\u2019t happy at all! I\u2019ve been eating like that since forever, and not one time it feels like this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maaaaaaaybe because you eat like\u202675% of our picnic lunch this time! Relax you doofus! It just some common nausea! Your belly is just stressing over your meal. Give it, like, an hour and you will be fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I probably just overthinking.\u201d The boy sighs, still feeling aching in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, you need to eat less, idiot, unless you want to impress girls with your pot belly! Chicks don\u2019t dig that, and I\u2019m sure Mia in Math class won\u2019t dig that either!\u201d said Angela, before sprinting away from Dennis like a wind, laughing her ass off from her dweeb of a brother\u2019s embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how did you..? Hey! HEY! YOU HAVE BEEN SNEAKING IN MY ROOM!\u201d Dennis screams, before standing up to chase after her sister, his face now as red as a ripened tomato. \u201cShe probably right! Maybe I\u2019ve just overthought!\u201d the teen thinks. Dennis nearly scared his parents to death by his choking, and the young teen definitely doesn\u2019t want to ruin one of the rare days when they are all free from work and school to be together (despite it being very, very boring). The boy decides to put that problem aside. He has a bigger one to solve. Nothing on this world, even the threat of having an angry creature with a temper rampaging your guts, could surpass the utter shame of having your secret crush expose to your own parents, especially when the culprit is no one else but your own asshole sister, and the 13-year-old boy knows that too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is just a minor inconvenience compared to that. The enraged alien in his stomach, or whatever it is, can wait. His stomach will handle this just fine.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the source of his inconvenience a.k.a you are enjoying wrecking chaos to the boy\u2019s poor organ. You have grown to nearly 5 inches, 5 times taller than you first were and you fit perfectly inside his belly like a baby in a mother\u2019s womb all warm and comfy (<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">that came out weirder than I expected</span>). The stomach seems tired. It has produced less acid than before. Its movement now isn\u2019t as weird and chaotic, but rather slow and somewhat calm. The disgusting sea of rotting burgers is nothing more than a bathtub of disgustingly warm and comfortable soup of, well, more rotting burgers (that still smells like your grandpa\u2019s bathroom). Those are good signs. Maybe he is giving up. If he is giving up, he will have to throw you out sooner or late. And you will be free of this mess for good. You grin like a child on Christmas morning and continue your so-called \u201cdance of freedom\u201d. It just a mixture of random kicks, punches and weird octopus-styled flopping. The current size of you limited your movement quite a bit. But clearly, your \u201cwhatever\u201d dance is working. Gurgles after gurgles, it is obvious that the stomach is tired of your game. His breathing becomes somewhat harder, and his heart is beating fast. The stomach content is moving again. You can feel it. This is it. This is your moment of glory. Your freedom is closer than ever before. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna throw up! Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight\u2026\u2026..NOW!\u201d you said, expecting he to vomit you out.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nNothing happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...How\u2019bout now!\u201d you try again, creating more motions than before, motivating yourself that it will work this next try.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nStill, nothing happens. \u201cWhat is happening? Why doesn\u2019t he throw up?\u201d you try again. And again. And again. Nothing happens. Whatever you are doing, it doesn\u2019t work anymore. But how? How can someone\u2019s stomach handle a living creature thrashing like that without even vomit? Normal people would have, but why doesn\u2019t Dennis? But that isn\u2019t the only problem. It\u2019s been 30 minutes. You have not felt any difference in your size. Before, it took you like 20 minutes to grow. And it is obvious that you were still growing in the last 15 minutes. But you size doesn\u2019t change. Not even a single millimetres or millimeters, or whatever words Miss Amos and the Brits would use. Then, like a great tsunami slamming into a beach full of hope and happiness, reality hit you in the face. Hard.<br>\r\nYou are no longer growing. This is the maximum size you can ever reach. Exactly 5 inches. No more. No less. And no magical growing potion will change that. No magical hijinks, nor science mumbo jumbos, no deus ex machina is gonna help you now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulation! <br>\r\nYou, my friend, are FUCKED!<br>\r\n(Yay?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(First time writing vore in which the prey isn't smaller than 1cm!

After giving me so much hope of being free, why would you stop GROWING?!?!?\u201d you cried, flailing your limbs around even more wildly. But nothing happens. A while later, Dennis\u2019s heart calms down, as he has given up chasing his jerk of a sister. Soon after, the stomach resumes its task, as if it has realised that your \u201cacting-like-an-octopus\u201d shenanigan has failed horribly. You are now no more than a nutritious piece of food in its grasp, and nothing would stop the organic red room of death from consuming you. Your face is now as pale as the winter snow of Alaska. Fear and anxiety flood your minuscule brain. Your plan was working PERFECTLY. But at the very moment where it would be a total success, the growing failed you. \u201cWHY CAN\u2019T YOU EVEN RESIST A FUCKING HUMAN THRASHING INSIDE YOUR BELLY?!?!? WHY WON\u201dT YOU JUST RELEASE ME FROM THIS TORMENTED WORLD ALREADY!!!!\u201d you scream at the top of your lungs, and surrender, hearing nothing in return but the disgusting gurgle of the churning stomach, the harmonious, but disturbing sound of his heart and lungs working together, and the muffled laughter of the Amos outside. Soon, energy drains from your body. You have consumed too much of your energy for you escape operation, too confident that such an impossible task can be successful. Now, you are left with a tired body and a broken mind depleted of hope. While they were having fun outside, you stuck here, barely movable, as acid rains from above and once again sprinkle on your aching flesh. It burns like hell. Blood spills out from your wound, dyeing the murky swamp with so much redness it kinda makes the digested burger to blend into the colour of the stomach walls. You want to scream, but have no energy left to even let out a whimper. More and more acid rain down, burning away your skin and scorching away your beautiful brown hair. After merely 5 minutes, you bear no difference from a 3rd-degree burn victim. At least you bleed less than before, because the acid burn has seal away some exposed blood vessels. The stomach shrinks down a bit, enveloping you with its wrinkly walls. But for some reason, you find it somewhat comfortable. Dennis\u2019s flesh is warm, as if it was offering a final comfort for its victim before sending them to their inevitable demise. It reminds you of your mom, and the way she would embrace you in her arms and sing you to sleep when you were just a young boy. You close your eyes. The air has gone pale, filled with the nasty smell of rotting food and vomit. Breathing becomes such a hardship. Your respiratory system collapses, and your heart weakens. Consciousness leaves your mind, as you black out from the pain and the lack of breathable air. Your body, mangled by the raining stomach juice, sink down below the murky surface of the digested burger. Acid floods into every open cavity of your body, melting your organs away. You die, painfully, but peacefully, in the warm enfold of the 13-year-old\u2019s tummy, lull into an eternal sleep by the boy\u2019s organic symphony of heartbeats, breaths and gurgles. The stomach makes quick work of you, despite your considerable size, and in half an hour, nothing of you is left, beside a puddle of sludgy pungent nutrition soup, which will soon to be forgotten, just like your insignificant existent.</span></div></div>",

They gather around the campfire Mr Amos made a while ago, roasting some fishes they caught in a lake nearby. Dennis, being such a voracious eater, chomps down his fish like a hungry lion tearing his prey apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful honey! Watch out for fishbone! We don\u2019t want you to get choked again, Dennis.\u201d Said Mrs Amos, worrying that her son may get himself into trouble with his meal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d Dennis said, his voice full of optimism, then continue to munch his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s your baby now?\u201d Angela teases, clearly interest in her brother\u2019s potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting better, I guess. My tummy has been quite calm this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal is finished, Mr Amos takes out the bag of marshmallow, and the family grills them together, telling each other funny stories and things that interest them in school or at work. While Dennis is having such fun with his family, things are a little bit different inside the teenager\u2019s body. The burger soup, having been thoroughly digested, is now drained into his duodenum \u2013 the first section of his small intestine \u2013 to make ways for his dinner of grilled fish and marshmallow. The stomach, expanded from the huge dinner, groans and gurgles, as chunks of chewed up fishes and charred marshmallow fall through the lower oesophageal sphincter into the lake of bubbling stomach juice, filling the stomach like a balloon of flesh, creating a bump on the boy\u2019s smooth, white belly. It walls shake and churn, as the organ begins its chore again. Inside the duodenum, your essence, mixed with his chyme, slowly make ways further into his coiled gut thanks to his intestine\u2019s peristaltic waves. Bile and other enzymes are released into the warm mush, neutralising the strong HCl of the stomach, and breaking his food even further. After a while, you arrive at his jejunum and officially enter the domain of the small intestine. Covering every centimetre of the wall are the villi, millions and millions of them. They mindlessly sway around in the murky swamp of digested food, fetching and absorbing every usable piece. You leftover, largely made of fat, protein and other nutrients, are soon to be absorbed. From the villi, you are moved into the tiny blood vessel inside the wall of his gut, and along with the blood, are transported across his belly, and arrive at Dennis\u2019s loud heart. The heart\u2019s valves open like a white curtain of flesh, sucking you into the boy\u2019s very core, from which your essence, along with all the nutrient from his humongous lunch are spread through his body in the highway of blood into his other organs. A part of you become the fuel for his activity, forming a teeny tiny layer of fat on his engorged belly. Some ironically end up as a fuel for is stomach cells. Your melted protein is now merged with his growing muscles, and your bones are now his, too. Your DNA is broken down and become a part of his DNA, imprinted inside his billions and billions of sperm stored in the boy\u2019s juvenile testicles, squirming anxiously and waiting to be released by the young teen. Of course, it would be foolish to say that Dennis uses everything of you. A part of your body, are useless, which is partially absorbed into his intestine, too. But they won\u2019t arrive at his heart, but rather his kidney, where such part will be filtered again carefully and dumped into his bladder, stretched from the unusable liquid content. Like the sperm inside his balls, the urine is too waiting for the boy to release them. The other leftover part of you continue their journey along the other useless part of his meals in an 8-hour journey into the seemingly unending depth, at which the Amos has already come back home, and Dennis has long begun his journey into the dreamscape inside his young brain. Finally, the mushy content is flushed into the large intestine, where their journey would finally come to an end after another 1 or 2 hours. The colon drains the water from the remnant of the meals, as the bacteria hiding inside the organ brew the thing into faecal matter. What once was a delicious burger BBQ party are now reduced into logs of brown-coloured shit. When the first golden ray of sunlight arrives at Dennis\u2019s sleepy, dreamy eyes through the windows of his room, all that is left of you have been squeezed into his rectum, just above his tight anus. But only after 20 more minutes, when his family has all wake up and prepare to come back home does the 13-year-old awakes from his dream. Moss green clouds of fart fill all the gaps between the poop logs, building up the pressure inside Dennis\u2019s ass. They smell of rotting, fermented food, with a faint hint of a long-forgotten soul of a lonely human who is struck with the curse of bad luck and end up digested inside the boy\u2019s cavernous tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis wakes up. He was having such a good dream, where he became a powerful sorcerer and conquered the heart of the world, and also his crush Mia, without the obstruction of his annoying sister, who he defeated in a fancy duel of magic and calling each other \u201cdweeb\u201d continuously. But just as he about to kiss Mia, the sun decided to take him away from his beautiful dream with its golden beam of sunlight that irritated his eyes and forced him to wake up. The boy sighs and makes a big yawn as he stretches his still-sleepy arms. His morning wood is making a tent in his thin cotton pyjama pants, a sign that he has entered puberty, and his reproductive system is growing healthily. Dennis, of course, doesn\u2019t enjoy this activity much. It makes him (and every other people in the house) feel embarrassed walking around with a tent poking from his crotch. Luckily, today is Saturday. His parents usually stay in the living room to enjoy their favourite shows, and Angela has a date with his boyfriend, a guy from the baseball team with a weird interest in Dennis, which he found quite disturbing. Ensuring that no one is around to see his Pinocchio crotch, the young teen snatches his clothes and rushes to the bathroom at the end of the corridor. His lower abdomen grumbles in dismay, as the pressure from both the full bladder and the rectum are bothering his belly. Dennis takes off his pyjamas and sits on the white porcelain toilet. The yesterday meal takes quite a toll on his organs. His penis, now flaccid and shrunk down, twitches as nearly a litter of urine flood from the bladder through his urethra and into the toilet. The pubescent then groans tiredly, as logs and logs of shit leave his pinkish gapping anus and descent into the cold water below. He rips out a loud fart of such intensity that he swears his butt cheek has shaken from the massive smelly shockwave. He shouldn\u2019t have eaten that much at the picnic yesterday, and the copious amount of cola he drank last night only worsen his pooping experience. Mom\u2019s burger was the best, and the picnic was a clear evidence for her cooking talent. After fifteen minute of furious grunting and farting uncontrollably, Dennis takes a long sheet of paper, prepares to wipe as the last log of poop, containing your body\u2019s leftover down the bowl. Having wiped his ass butthole clean, the boy stands up, closes the lid and flushes the remnant of his gigantic meal down the drain, sending everything left of you into the unknown darkness of the sewer. As Dennis is taking shower, the thought of being kissed by Mia still haunts him. His young, hairless penis rises again, and Dennis takes the opportunity to relieve himself before his dream finally fades away forever. He peeled the tight young foreskin down, revealing his bulbous, pinkish dickhead and strokes it slowly, using the water as the lub. The teen is still trying to get used to this new feeling of puberty, which he considered to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of this stage of life. His young body twitches and shivers, as the transparent precum leaks out of his erecting penis. Soon, the feeling of cum rushing through his prostate make Dennis reach his climax, and white, slightly clear strands of semen explode from his head and splatter the ceramic tiles of the floor. His breaths are heavy, and his heart beats fast. The boy\u2019s cheeks are as red as strawberries. It takes him another minute to calm himself from the wonderful experience and probably a little bit of guilt. He feels like he has done something that he shouldn\u2019t have. His body is still practising with all the new stuff of puberty, and sometimes, mistakes are made (which isn\u2019t really the case in this fapping session). Having calmed down, he aims the spraying water down his penis to wash the cum residue away, along with the accumulated smegma, and to the floor so that they will be washed into the drain. He is just 13, so using water would be enough to wash away his thin, watery semen. After all is done, he dries himself, dons his underwear and clothes, then rushes away to his room, enjoy his day-off with countless fun that you, an unfortunate soul of a deceased idiot forever doomed in the pitch-black oblivion of the sewer below, will never be able to enjoy ever again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It may be messier, but it would be quicker than being dissolved by acid.  Lets hope you can avoid both though.  You are moving toward the front of Dennis' mouth according to plan.  But, like all plans, something unexpected happened to mess things up.  A movement of the tongue pushed you against the roof of Dennis' mouth.  It was uncomfortable for you and, without thinking, you push against the slimy roof above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chewing stops.  Chewed up bits of hamburger are shifted around until Dennis' tongue is touching you.  Without warning, Dennis sucks in a breath and you are launched out of his mouth like a missile.  You hit the ground with what should be lethal force.  Instead of dying you are just disoriented and a little bruised.  Dennis is above you, spitting and rubbing his mouth with a napkin. \"Aw...gross, Dad!  Are you paying attention to what your cooking?  There was a bug or something in my burger.  I think I'm going to be sick,\" Dennis yells to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDennis then moves to step on where you landed.  At your inch tall height you should have been big enough for him to determine that you were human.  Unfortunately, you are covered in chewed up hamburger and look nothing like a human.  It seemed like it was all over for you when the sneakered foot stepped on you.  You are amazed that it hurts.  It should not hurt because, by all rights, you should be dead.  The shoe moves like it is trying to grind you into paste but you are just rolled around by the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the weight of the shoe is lifted you can hear the family having an animated conversation.  You really cannot make out what they are saying, you are so dazed that if this where a cartoon little stars would be circling your head.  The only thing you are sure of is that Dennis' sister is laughing at him.  When you are in a condition to think you decide it would be a good idea to get someones attention when things calm down.  But who should you go to, one of the children or the adults?  It would probably be a good idea to avoid that moody teenager, no telling what she might do to someone when she knew she could get away with it.</span></div></div>",

The rays of the sun are just beginning to shine through your window, which now looks like a huge glass wall. Then again it really is a huge glass wall to someone your size, you think as you begin to look around your room from the floor. How the hell someone got you into your room is just plain mystifying, but you can't help but feel reassured by the familiar surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view from about an inch off the floor of your room is not what one would call awe inspiring, though it certainly was breath taking. That of course being so for the simple reason that a pair of week old underpants are still sitting in the corner by your desk. You had planned on taking those to the laundry room today, but seeing as how you could now fit a hundred times over into them, you doubt that's going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the underwear, nothing in the room really catches you eye, except of course, for the door. The door which leads out into the rest of the house, and to people who you've lived with for a while now. At least one of them should be willing to help you, though before they can you have to get their attention. Not one to wait around you rush towards the monolithic gate, and are both relieved, and somehow depressed to find that you can slip right under the door, you don't even have to duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of you room, everything is still dark. Not a big surprise there as most of the people you live with think you get up at an ungodly hour. That hour being noon or earlier. With the sun just breaking the horizon you doubt anyone, not your parents, Charlie, or any of the others who live in you parent's house, will be stirring just yet, so you are faced with a tough choice as you stare down the hall. Do you...</span></div></div>",

At your size you doubt anyone would be able to hear you.  That means if you tried to wake someone up they would probably roll over on you.  The thought of trying to get the attention of someone that is awake and walking around makes you cringe.  There are just too many situations that you could imagine yourself getting stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember that there are normally a few materials sitting around on the dinning room table.  You might be able to arrange a few of them into an arrow pointing to you if there are enough light things available.  That is, if you can climb to the top of the table.  You will cross that bridge when you get to it.  It will be enough of a problem just getting to the table and you will just have to hope that answers to your problems appear as you go along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you should have a few hours before anyone gets up.  This would be a lot more difficult with a bunch of people walking around.  The trip to the dining room should only take about an hour or two.  That should give you a two hour gap between getting into the dining room and when people start waking up.  Two hours should be more than enough time to figure out how to climb a table and make some sort of message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting out, you had a great deal of confidence that you could accomplish your task.  As you travel down the hall that sense of confidence begins to fade.  A brisk morning walk is not what the doctor called for after a night of drinking and partying.  The pounding in your head is telling you that you need to sit down and take it easy for a few minutes.  It is not a good sign that you need to take a break when you have not even made it half way to your destination, but you are going to have to do just that if you do not want to puke up whatever might be in your stomach at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest against the side of a wall while holding your head in your hands.  Then you say what many other people have said after a night of drinking and having to deal with the hangover in the morning, \u201cI\u2019ll never do that again and this time, I mean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to get up and continue your journey, you hear a door open.  Now that is highly unusual.  Nobody else that lives in this house should be up until the crack of noon, at the earliest.  The room that the person is about to emerge from does look like one of the guest rooms.  Somebody else might have stayed at the house overnight.  Come to think of it, that is the room that your girlfriend sleeps in when she stays here.  You wonder if she slept over last night.  It could still be someone else though.  It is not like Anna has exclusive rights to the room.  Either way, things are about to get complicated by having someone what is a giant compared to you walking around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are an inch tall.  That is not microscopic.  It might just be possible to get the person\u2019s attention if you moved around enough.  You doubt you could yell loud enough to get his or her attention and it would be a gamble.  It might be a good idea to just continue with your original task for now.</span></div></div>",

You seriously think about trying to get her attention up until the point where notice she really is stumbling.  She looks kind of disheveled and she is holding her head in much the same way a person with a hangover would.  You doubt she even notices she is only wearing a sock on one foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna is not in any condition to notice an inch tall man standing on the ground.  It would be best to avoid her for now.  You just make sure you stay against the wall as she staggers by and says, \u201cI\u2019ll never do that again, well, at least for another month or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she disappears down the hall at a speed that you cannot help but envy.  This leaves you alone in the hallway once more.  You cannot say you are unhappy about that.  It would have been nice to get some help from somebody, but the chances are you would have just been stepped on with Anna around in the condition she is in.  All you can do is continue on your task for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do make it to the dining room, eventually.  It took that hangover a little while longer than you would have liked to start wearing off.  That meant you had to take a lot more breaks than you should have while making your way down the hallway and to the dining room.  It is just a good thing your room was on the same floor as the dining room because if you had to come down the stairs you would not have made it before everyone else started waking up.  You are already an hour behind schedule as is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining room table is in sight and all you have to do is figure out a way to get up the table.  There is no table cloth that you can climb, no animal that could help you out like in \u201cHoney I Shrunk the Kids,\u201d and no materials you could make a glider or some crazy contraption out of like they do in cartoons.  This is a real problem.  Your brain works furiously to find a solution to this problem, but nothing is forthcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is especially frustrating since you can see a bowl full of jelly beans on the table.  They are the size of large rocks to you but you are certain you could lift them and make some sort of message to let others know about your situation.  You are so close to getting help.  If only you could figure out how to get on top of that table you would at least find safety with the residents of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to walk around the table.  There really is no point to it.  You just do not know what else to do.  Maybe you will find out what to do if you look at the table from every angle.  There might be something on the floor that you did not see on the floor from your previous point of view.  It is not like it can hurt to walk around the table.  Besides, if you cannot find anything this is as good a place as any to try to get someone\u2019s attention.  And if they do not notice you, you can always run under the table for safety.</span></div></div>",

It should be easy enough for even you to climb.  The thing is actually close enough to the low table that you might be able to make the jump from the trash basket to the table.  That does not seem ideal since you still have a sizable gap to jump and the fall would be fatal if you missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would also be fatal if someone were to accidentally step on you while you were wandering around on the floor.  Climbing that basket would be the best thing to do for now.  The reeds the basket is made of are the size of logs to you and you would think that would make the basket easy to climb.  That is not the case since the reeds are also very smooth and it feels like you are constantly on the verge of slipping as you climb.  You do manage to make it to the top of the basket after a few minutes of struggling.  Then all you have to do is muster your courage to jump from the basket to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou note that the jump did not seem as long from the ground.  The first time you try to make the jump your legs do not cooperated and you stay right where you are.  You take a few seconds to breath before your next attempt.  When you jump you actually manage to make it across the gap without much trouble.  There is at least a foot between you and the edge of the table.  At least something has been easy enough to do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you head toward the bowl of jellybeans you had spotted earlier.  You climb into the bowl and try lifting one of the jellybeans.  They are heavy, not as heavy as a rock of equal size, but heavy nonetheless.  You start tossing them over the side of the bowl so you do not have to keep climbing into the bowl.  When that is accomplished you finally climb out of the bowl and think about what type of message you should make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no need for a complicated message.  If you arrange the jellybeans in the shape of an arrow, that should be enough.  It would just take too much time and effort to actually spell out a message.  After the first few minutes you start to get tired.  Lifting all these jellybeans is backbreaking work.  You are having trouble lifting the beans by the time you get to the end of the arrow.  The quality of your design suffers as a result, but it still looks like an arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all you have to do is sit down and wait for someone to notice you.  It should not be that long before everyone in the house starts to wake up.  Your girlfriend is up and about as well.

The coffee cup lands on some of the jelly beans that made up your message.  Anna was not expecting the cup to sit at an angle and one of her fingers caught on the edge of the cup as she lifted her hand away.  The contents of the cup spilled.  You were hit by a wall of hot coffee and it washed you over the side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are rollercoaster\u2019s that have more extreme drops than this one, but you always know that you are secured on a rollercoaster.  The shock of getting hit by the burning hot coffee stifled your attempts to scream.  Your heart felt like it was about to burst as you rushed down to the ground.  Then you hit the ground and bounced of the carpet a couple of times.  You were surprised to see that you had survived.  Not only that, it seemed like you would only get a couple of bruises from the landing.  You had no broken bones whatsoever.  It hurt a great deal, but it was still possible to walk away from the landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did just that too.  Anna was cursing to herself for being so clumsy.  Both she and Charlie rushed off to the kitchen to get something to clean the mess up with.  You did not want to be in the area of the mess when they started cleaning up.  They would be in such a rush to keep the stain from getting too bad they might not notice you there.  Besides, you could tell the coffee had stained your clothes brown and you might just look like a bug to people that did not look at you for more than two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like it is time to hide under the couch until they are finished cleaning up.  You might be able to get their attention later, when they are looking down to see how well they have cleaned up the mess.  The sound of Anna and Charlie\u2019s feet can be heard pounding off to the kitchen as you run to hide under the couch.  They return a few seconds later with towels and a couple cans of spot removers.  You observe them as they furiously scrub the carpet.  It takes a few minutes before they are satisfied with their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you see any spot on the carpet,\u201d Anna asked Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything wrong,\u201d Charlie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the moment you think.  They are inspecting the carpet and they should be able to notice you.  You step out from under the couch and start screaming their names.  They seem to notice you but there is a strange look on their faces.  You hope that is just their reaction to them seeing you shrunk.</span></div></div>",

A spider just might be large enough to be a threat to you now.  But, as you look around you do not see any other living thing around you.  Then a shadow surrounds you and you look up just in time to see Charlie\u2019s foot about to slam down on you.  There is just enough time for you to jump out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is strange.  They were looking straight at you and yet they still managed to mistake you for a spider.  You were small, but they should have been able to tell you were human after looking straight at you.  No time to think about that now though.  It looks like Charlie and Anna are going to try their hardest to end your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe safety of the couch is not that far away from you, but Charlie and Anna are going to get a couple of tries at crushing you.  You sprint for the couch while trying to watch out for giant feet.  Anna is the first one to take a shot at you.  Her aim is a little off and you do not even have to try and avoid her foot.  Charlie makes a go at you but Anna\u2019s foot gets in the way and you are safe once more.  It does not look like they are good at coordinating their efforts.  They prove that when they try to step on you at the same time and end up kicking each other as you run under the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey should not bother you now that you are under the couch.  There are not many people that would go through with the effort of killing a spider once it manages to get away.  Now that you have a moment to think you take the time to do so.  It appears that you are not only the size of a bug, you look like one to normal sized people as well.  That means you probably will not be getting any help from anyone anytime soon.  What will you do now though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a few options left available to you.  Some people in this house sleep very late.  If you could get to someone\u2019s room before they woke up you might be able to climb up to their ear and get a chance to talk to them before they get a chance to look at you.  The other thing you could do is try to make your way back to the house were the party was.  There might be clues about what happened to you there.  There were a few problems with both situations.  If you looked like a spider to people it also meant you might not be able to communicate with them as well.  The journey to the house was going to be incredibly dangerous as well.  There were bound to be uncountable dangers on the journey to that house and unless you could manage to catch a ride there it would take a couple of days to get there on foot.</span></div></div>",

She is a fiery red head, with a slightly pale complexion, and lips redder than fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa Abernathy, a cute blonde in Anna's sorority, though certainly not the one from last night. She's the college's blonde superstar, who has that annoying, yet somehow adorable laugh of most \u2018true to their soul' blondes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutumn \u2018Candy' Stephenson, a goth chick, and not someone you'd normally know, but she's in Anna's sorority so you've seen her around. Skin pasty white thanks to no sun, and everything else, from nails, to hair, and even her tongue, dyed black as sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora, you don't know her last name, as she rarely leaves her room in the sorority house. Exactly what she does in there, you have no idea, but you've always kinda thought she might be building a nuke or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie Orman, another guy going to you college, who is about you age, give or take a few months. He has blonde hair, though it's shaved so low he might as well be bald. Other than that he has little to distinguish him from hundreds of similar students, except that he rents the room next to your's in your parent's house.</td>",
