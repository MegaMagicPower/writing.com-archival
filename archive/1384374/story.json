It became more like tar in its viscosity. A figure began to rise out of the water , clothed in black, black trousers, long sleeved shirt that partially covered his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wore a black trenchcoat that fit him well. His face was covered by a metal mask, silver in colour( like one of these maks worn by Japanese samurai). He was of Jakes size but much taller. He stood at around 2m in height. In one hand , he wielded a katana whilst in the other , it was pulsing with dark energies radiating out from his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He spoke in a voice that was slow yet sinsiter. \" Give me the boy, Jasmine. Or esle I will have to resort to less pleasent means of dealing with you.\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  ' Who is he?\" Jake asked, unsure of what was going on except that Jasmine holding him with more force than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Allow me to introduce myself. I am Nostory, Lord of the Daemonic Horde. She has been charged with treason and was convicted to death.\" he said , his voice displaying no emotion, pointing at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Rubbish, he is not what he claims to be.\" says Jasmine. \" One last time, hand over the boy or you will feel pain a thousand times greater than what you have felt in your short time in existence.\" he said, a little angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Come and get him then, demon.\" said Jasmine. \" Its Daemon, you bitch!\" he screamed at her, firing dark energy into the clouds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Do they manage to escape?</span></div></div>",

They wanted to help since he did try to save their live. Problem is they don't even know what to do. He wasn't the same as a normal human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Boy...remote...sleeve...\" Shadow was desperately trying to tell Jak. Jak was able to figure out what he was saying. He searched Shadow's sleeves and found a hidden panel on his right arm. There were many small buttons and a bigger red one higher up. \"...Press...red...\" Shadow was able to mutter out. Jak did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, suddenly a weird thing appeared in the sky above them. It look like a black mechanical manta ray. It slowly descended lower and lower until it touched the ground. It was the size of maybe 5 buses, though it was about a foot tall to Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy...\" Shadow was trying to tell him. \"My Deathray...there's a medical repair pod...inside. Bring me to it.\" He then stared at the 50-foot Jasmine. \"You...focus on shrinking. You have to... *cough* come in, too.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was confused at what he said. Focus on shrinking. She decided to try it and thought about returning to her 4-foot-11 height. Jak watched in amazement as Jasmine shrunk back down from 50-feet to 40, then 30, 20, 10. She ending up back to her original height. She was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak, it work!\" She exclaimed. \"I'm no longer a  giant freak!\" \"Quit wasting time and get in!\" Shadow ordered. Jak picked him up and carried Shadow by his shoulder to his ship.When they all reach it, the wasn't a door to be found. Shadow mutterd the word \"open\" and then and opening appeared, and they walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jak and Jasmine were amazed by the sight of the ship's interior. It was almost like it was a set from Star Wars or something. There was what looked like the cockpit up front, a gallery of computers on the side, a table in the middle and at the back, in the middle of the two doors labeled \"Kitchen\" and \"Engine Room,\" was what looked like a tube labeled \"MRP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the device right there,\" Shadow pointed out, then he used his free arm to take off his helmet. As it hit the floor, Jak and Jasmine were amazed to see that Shadow's face was a 'human' handsome young face. His skin was grayish black, eyes are red, and he was white spiky hair. Minus his skincolor, wings and tail, Shadow was good looking enough to be human. Jasmine face turned red as she couldn't believe that a daemon would look this cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both froze in awe until Shadowed let out a cough, as a blob of blood came from his mouth and hit the floor. Jak rushed him to the MRP as quickly as he could. It took a while but be was able to him in and start the device.</span></div></div>",

Thus, came forth was the great war between Gabriel and her angels, who fought to defend the Humans, and the Daemons led by Lucifer. The war was long and bloody, as there was casualties on both sides. The great war would have been decided by the battle between Gabriel and Lucifer. Gabriel herself fought gracefully and magnificence, but Lucifer was devious, dishonest and a damn-right cheat.

Seth was in his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow, Seth, and Lylithe, another deamon who worked with the two. The trio was a group who did bounties, for currency. They all worked together and were hired for many missions, which varied from recon to combat. Their services were always available and reliable. The relationship between the three were tight-knit and they seemed very inseparable. Nothing seemed to weigh them or their teamwork down. Many would think there was a rivalry between Seth and Shadow over Lylithe, but there was no such thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, the three were sent off to a temple to recover a jewel for Nostory. The reasons for the collection of this item was unknown, but the trio agreed to get this. As they were walking, Seth noticed was his partners were oddly silent, and not as talkative as usual. As they approached the temple, a stone door opened before them, and they entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air felt cool, and there was a dense fog in the air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful guys.\" Shadow warned, \"It seems we will encounter some-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookout!\" Lylithe said, firing a energy blast past Shadow and hitting a stone minion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll handle this guy!\" Seth said, charging at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth crashed into the enemy blasting toward another room. \"You guys go and find the jewel. I'll take care of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow and Lylithe pressed on, going deeper into the temple. Seth remained behind. As they were walking, they noticed that there was a purple glow on the wall, and they assumed that it was the jewel. They both dashed towards the glow and reached a lower level. Lylithe grabbed the jewel and felt a power go through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This power....\" Lylithe said. \"This is the power Nostory was telling me about...it feels good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell us about this!?\" Shadow said. \"You knew!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Lylithe replied. \"I'm going to join forces with Nostory...Deamons are the superior race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do this!\" Shadow said, his dark aura flowing. \"We all have to live in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, out of nowhere Lylithe was transformed into a beast, the jewel's power proving to be too much for her. Shadow charged at his former partner who was now transformed into a monster. Shadow,  dashed toward her, firing a blast at the jewel, which appeared on her chest. Lylithe roared in pain, and Shadow realized that was the spot he had to keep targeting. He saw a broken sword on the ground and decided that was all he needed to help him defeat his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Seth had just finished off the stone beast and rushed as he heard the sounds of the battle below. Seth dashed, but to only see Shadow pulling a blade out of Lylithe, who was almost covered in all scratches and blood. Shadow crushed the jewel and turned to see Seth, who was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow, how could you!?\" Seth said, charging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait-\" Shadow tried to explain, but was attacked by Seth, as he was flanked by a barrage of blasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll kill you!\" Seth cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle raged on, with both Shadow and Seth exchanging heavy blows, as the battle was bloody. Both fought hard but Shadow didn't want to kill his friend. Once Shadow hit Seth with a kick, the enraged Deamon was hanging from a cliff ledge. Shadow tried to save his friend, as Seth didn't have the strength to pull himself up. He let himself fall, vanishing. Both Deamons were heavily wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, Seth joined Nostory, due the the same beliefs and ideals about their races being dominant. Seth brought in heavily, and despite his history with Shadow, he felt that Nostory fit him better as a friend as they wanted to be strong and powerful.</span></div></div>",

Since she had nothing to do, Kate started to clean up and dust around the bridge. Jak went to grab a couple of sodas from Shadow's fridge (some of Shadow's stuff were magically enhanced to function by magic instead of electricity, remember?) for him and Jasmine. As he came back and handed her the pop, he saw that Jasmine hasn't completely returned to her original size. She was about 7 feet tall, her head was close to reaching the ceiling, and she completely dwarfs Jak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Jas, aren't you a little <b>-too- </b>tall?\" Jak asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Well, it's kinda funny,\" Jasmine giggled out. With all my size changing, I, uh, forgot my original height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"You were 4-foot-11.\" Shadowed softly stated. \"Now stop abusing your powers and return to normal.\" Disappointed, Jasmine shrunk back down to her original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Come on. I was just having some fun,\" she spoke. At the meantime, Kate found a pendent while dusting.

Jak and Jasmine instantly bolted to see why she screamed. Looking over her shoulder, they see a picture of three people in it, looking like buddies. They see Shadow in there, a little younger than he is now, and in the middle was what looked like a catgirl, like the kinds Jak and Jasmine would see in Animes. What made Kate scream was the familiar blue face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"No way!!!\" They both were shocked to see Seth in this picture. All three of the Daemons looked like real good friends, with matching uniforms, showing that they seemed to be in the same business.

So he figured that he can't have her, no one can, and he killed her, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"SHUT UP JAK!\" Shadow then burst out of anger. \"Must everything seem like a joke you have to say?\" He them bowed his head again. \"Besides, he would never harm her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"Man, I'm sorry,\" Jak apologized. \"Not trying to joke, but was it Nostory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"He did have some responsibility for this,\" Shadow said, then almost started to cry. \"But the one who was responsible for it, whose hands were stained by her blood, and who Seth hates for killing Lylithe...\" He then broke to tears and collapsed to the floor. \"IT WAS ME!

We were some of the Deamons in the world who were good. We all known each other since we were kids. Causing pranks and cracking jokes were all we did when we were young. We were bounty hunters, who hunted for any thing that would disturb people. Nostory was our best client. He would pay us big money each time we did jobs for him. Until one day, Nostory sent us on a mission in Denzar Woods. It was a violent rainstorm. He wanted us to do something in the woods, but he wouldn't tell us. We three split had up. As I was dashing through the Denzar Woods. I spotted Nostory and Lylithe. I listened in on their talk......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lylithe. You have done well to gain the trust of Seth and Shadow. Just make sure they don't suspect anything. You know you have a power to be unleashed. Once we unlock your power. We shall rule the world.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. Those two think I am really their friend. Ha! Once we are powerful, we will be able to shape our world. With my power and your power we will be unstoppable! I was the granddaughter of Lucfier, the great evil Deamon that lived.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was shocked to hear this. I know I had to do one thing to do. And that was to kill Lylithe. I didn't want to tell Seth. Who knows what they would have done. So I engaged in battle with Lylithe. She was playing innocent, but she told me that Nostory have been planning to make the Deamons a race to rule. Soon after, I killed her. This is when Seth comes in....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shadow! How could YOU!?' Seth was enraged when he saw Lylithe killed by me. I tried to explain, but he was too mad and angry to listen to me. We had gotten into a battle that gotten so servere it become a battle to the death. He seemed to want to kill me. I dodged a charge from him to have hanging from a cliff. Our powers ended up becoming weak enough due to our stamina, so we couldn't fly. I reached out to his hand, but he didn't take it, and he went into the darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what happened.\" Shadow said. \"When I saw him working with Nostory, I knew it was too late to save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak, Jasmine, and Kate were stunned. They were stunned and they were suprised at his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Shadow. That was the past, this is now. I know you wish you can go back and fix things, but you can't. I feel your pain. But we can fix now. We will be able to make sure Nostory doesn't become like Lucfier.\" Jak said. \"That's a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak....\" Shadow said. \"Thanks.... You have been a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't let Nostory get power. We won't.\" Jak said. \"It's on us to stop him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Jak, I can't change the past, but I can make sure the future remains intact!\" Shadow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's rest.\" Kate suggested. \"After today's event's I'm sure we are all exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the crazy day has ended for the Heroes, as they hope to be able to stop Nostory and Seth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that doesn't mean that Villains take a break...</span></div></div>",

She went outside and grew Jak to normal size. Shadow who was in the medical chamber, woke up and stepped out of it, feeling refreshed. Kate was awake and was looking on the radar to see what was going on. Jasmine helped herself to some food, Jak, Shadow, and Kate joined them. It seemed to be a slow, quiet morning. Soon, Jasmine started to feel the effects of the drug. Jasmine's troubles started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Jasmine, why are you growing in the ship?\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not- wait a minute, I am not doing that.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone,\" Shadow quickly realized the danger. \"Drugged you last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine, you should get out the ship.\" Kate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be-\" Jasmine started, but her head hit the celling and she started to expand. She ran out of the ship in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew to an uncontrollable height, and it was massive, and she grew to mega size. Jak just stared. He knew Jasmine wouldn't grow that tall. She can't interact with her friends this way. She was around 1,500 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!\" Jasmine said. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we do?\" Jak said. \"Things might appear super micro sized to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Shadow said. \"We might as well get in the Deathray and fly up to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine started to walk away from the group, her steps making a huge impact on the ground. The heroes started to get in the ship and try and stop her, but Nostory and Seth punched all three heroes to cause a huge knock-back. Shadow had stopped flying through the air and recovered Jak and Kate from the impact. He pressed a button to send the Deathray into orbit until needed. Shadow landed on the ground with both Jak and Kate in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to fight again?\" Kate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Jak, you need to learn how to fight, hate to say it but you're a weak link.\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Jak use this.\" Kate said. She handed him a plasma pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go....\" Jak said, getting the pistol loaded.</span></div></div>",

Kate readied her blade, while Shadow stayed in his regular form. Jak was hiding. He know he couldn't do much, but he was ready take a shot at Seth or Nostory, the one being important was Nostory. He could have just shot away at them, but Kate told him that the pistol had a charge shot and it could severely weaken a Deamon. He had 8 shots at the two Deamons. It held 80 bullets, and since the charge shot needed 10 bullets, he had 8 chances to hold off Nostory and have him retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory and Seth was floating in the air. They were looking down at Kate who was in a stance with her blade, and Shadow who stood tall and looking up at the two Villains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Nostory said. \"Ready for the next fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be too confident,\" Kate said. \"After losing to us at the compound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you had the girl backing you up.\" Nostory said. \"I didn't expect her to try hard as she did. But it seems that she won't be a factor in this battle now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seth....\" Shadow said. \"You won't listen to me about what happened to Lylithe. And now here we are. After 7 years, I expect that you have increased in power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't push it,\" Seth said, smiling. \"I think I'll be able to show you what I had to endure. Lylithe doesn't matter now that's she's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't expect any less out of both you.\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the boy?\" Nostory said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about him,\" Shadow said. \"Let's do this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the battle commenced. Shadow took a jump towards Seth, and started to fight in the air. Kate jumped toward and made a slash attempt toward Nostory, who parried the strike with his own katana. Shadow and Seth were brawling it out. Shadow threw a punch toward Seth, who blocked it, and followed it up with a counter. Shadow blocked it too. Then, he dealt a kick toward Seth, who got hit in the stomach. Seth took the pain, but didn't flench. Meanwhile, Nostory was on the defense, blocking rapid fast strikes from Kate. He was blocking them, but was dealt a fast, swift flying drop kick from Kate. He took damage from this. Jak was charging a shot. He was starting to charge a shot. It took time, but it was ready. He fired a shot toward Nostory, who dodged it. Nostory knew it wasn't from Kate. He assumed that Shadow tried to fire a energy beam toward him. The blast flew in the direction Jasmine was in, who was still looking for her teammates. It hit her, and didn't notice it. It didn't hurt her, due to her huge size. Jak had 7 shots left. The battle passed on for 2 hours, nonstop. Shadow and Seth had pushed each to their limits again. Kate and Nostory dealt each other cuts and bruises the whole time. Jak had one shot left. He missed that others. He knew that this was a vital one now. And Jasmine had felt these shots and turned around, she took small, baby steps toward the battle. Seth had shot a energy wave, and so did Shadow. The two blasts collided and exploded. Seth and Shadow were running on fumes now. The two were on the ground, both bleeding and bruised. Nostory and Kate was still going, but stabbed each other at the same time, cutting a vital wound in each other. The fighters were on the ground and started dragging toward each other's side. Jak knew this was his shot. Nothing could mess this up. As soon he shot the plasma pistol, an impact on the ground hit, due the Jasmine walking around. It messed up the shot. Jak knew he messed up. He screwed up. He ran out, and tried to punch Nostory and a brief white flash was seen in Jak's clinched fist as he charged at the Deamon, but was dealt a small energy blast by Seth, who managed to pull it out of his remaining power. Nostory summoned a portal with his remaining power. Him and Seth vanished in it. Jak ended up like Kate and Shadow. It was matter of time that if they weren't healed or saved, they would die.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shadow had gotten the worst of it. He had another battle to the death with Seth. Shadow was also sick of being injured every day. If he survived, he thought, he would start intense personal training. Kate was also hurt severely. Jak was trying to help his friends in anyway, but being merely human, he knew that a blast of any sort would hurt him a lot. He then also wondered why Seth just didn't kill him right there and then. Was Seth too weak to give him a full power blast? It didn't matter, as Jak was hurt and they all really needed to get healed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak...\" Shadow said, weakly. \"You remember (cough) the sleeve?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Jak said. \"Red button...(cough)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's is it (cough) for?\" Kate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Deathray will (cough) be here shortly....\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Deathray arrived in front of the fallen heroes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to...(cough) get....to the Medical Chambers.\" Shadow said. \"I have about 6.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...(cough)....great.\" Kate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess this is (cough) what death feels like..

They had crawled into the ship. Shadow was glad that he put the medical room near the entrance of the ship. He had pressed a button to have the medical chambers set up. However, the three heroes were starting to pass out. Shadow was the first one to be knocked out. Kate let out a cry for Shadow, but was short and she was KOed. Jak looked around behind him, and his eyes closed slowly. The last thing Jak seen was a giant girl who was starting to bend down........</span></div></div>",

He looked outside. He bumped into a girl, a giant girl at the least. She was laying down, on her stomach, looking at Jak. She had long, black hair, blue eyes, and wore a T-Shirt that covered her chest well. Jak couldn't believe it, as they managed to survive. Jasmine had sat her palm on the ground so that Jak could talk to her. Her giant eyes gazed at Jak, and she leaned her ear so Jak could speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine, you saved us. But how?\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't shrink and I still can not shrink.\" Jasmine said, softly. \"Anyway.

But the kids found out when they came to inquire about the prophecy, as they needed to find you guys. I saw the trouble from the base and quickly made my way here to help Jasmine out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can ask, do you hate me still?\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, No. The rest of the Deamon race, yes.\" Lucius said. \"You have proven your self to be pure of good.

Jak, you are the source that has led me to the real world. Somehow, you dreamed up this mystical world that existed in the real world long ago. The world was separated from your reality. Now, you are the one who was able to give me an idea to get to your world and bring this world to reality again. This would make our worlds one again. So what I am saying is....This is a feeble dream, but soon to become reality. Everything that has happened, people that you met, and dangers you faced, will be real.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was baffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Jak. Now you know why I was after you specifically. Yes, the girl is important, but you're that dreamer who would allow both Angels and Deamons to exist in the real world once more, as my race was banished by Gabriel...but yet, we're still here. And you have given us another chance to do what Deamons should have done. Dominate. I will bring us back on top and you won't be able to stop me...til then Jak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transmission feed ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this.\" Shadow said. \"I know about why we've been banished to this reality...but Kate...if you're human, why aren't you in Jak and Jasmine's world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question...\" Kate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius appeared before them again. \"That's because your not completely human, Kate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" The high angel continued to explain. \"In fact, LOR is full of angels and some human-hybrids. You are one of the few. In fact, your mother was an angel and fought in the great war. She also met your father, who was one of the earliest humans in existence, and that's how you were born. Now to add on, we've been stuck in limbo since Goddess Gabriel sacrificed her life to banish the Deamon race, and the rest of the angels went to this limbo reality to ensure that Deamons would be kept in check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...that explains a lot...\" Jasmine said. \"Isn't tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door closed and Jak was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll speak with you all later.\" Lucius said, again vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak?\" Jasmine went to go look for Jak. </span></div></div>",

I wonder if they did it to wear us down farther after the battle we had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak!\" Jasmine said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" Kate said. \"We saw you come back in, but we meant to ask; where's Jak?\" Kate then sliced a deamon's head off with her Katana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He walked into a swamp, saying that I wasn't real and what I said didn't matter...\" Jasmine then punted a deamon far away as she said that last part. \"And then he wanted to be left alone, and just walked away from me...as if I didn't matter to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must have been really upset. And what's bad is that Nostory could have captured him, which isn't good at all. Lucius even said Jak is important in the scheme of all of this, but he never told why.\" Shadow said shooting a large blast at a group of Deamons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate, they'll never stop!\" Kate said, while quickly slashing through a few deamons and clearing herself some breathing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end this.\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jasmine said. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been working on some moves.\" Shadow said. \"Watch this...and get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Kate said. \"These guys seem like a lot to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me.\" Shadow said his purple aura surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine and Kate got in the Deathray, and took off. They went away from the area. Shadow had encased himself inside a dark purple colored ball. He spun around in it, creating a huge energy radius. The range of the blast was miscalculated by Shadow and Kate had to activate the thrusters to gain some extra speed to get away. The dust settled and there was only a large crater and Shadow was in the middle of all of it. Kate then landed the ship back near Shadow. Her and Jasmine were amazed and stepped out of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have been trying get more powerful.\" Shadow said. \"But I am sure Nostory and Seth come up with some moves like this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time...make sure you get the range right.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to move a little bit..\" Kate said. \"Anyway's let's head out to find Jak.\"</span></div></div>",

Now, Jak... You have been a huge help to us these past few days.\" Nostory said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, do you realize I don't care at this point?\" Jak said. \"You think it matters? This is nothing but a dream, and I'm just waiting when I wake up from this nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you understand Jak? You would have woke up by now if this was an ordinary dream. This is very much real, you're the reason that this is possible! Before then, the angels and deamons we're really fighting for no reason. Although we were banished to this realm stuck in limbo, there was a legend that said; 'The Great War will begin anew, and a dreamer will be the precursor to the chaos.' And guess who that is? You. Jak if it wasn't for you, this chance wouldn't have come. But that's not only it. I also need to you for another purpose...but that will be revealed when the time comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory then waved his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy ball diminished from Jak. He started to make to run toward Nostory. But it was short lived, as Nostory stopped Jak and used telekinesis to stop him and float him in mid-air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously tried to attack me again?\" Nostory laughed. \"The legend did say the dreamer was brave and could possibly pose a challenge; but you're just kidding yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long you are keeping me?\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until your friends get here.\" Nostory said. \"If they take too long. I'll teleport them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nostory!\" Seth said, turning to him wide-eyed. \"They...took out the army, most in one blow. I also felt Shadow's power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostory looked up. \"I sensed it too. His power has grown since our last battle. Seems like he's been training. He may be even stronger than you my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was shocked. \"His power now exceeds my own?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Nostory said. \"I think we should start training as soon as we make our guests depart this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak was sitting in the cell, thinking about of what was to come. He still couldn't get over this reality. He couldn't wait to get out of this cell. He did feel bad about yelling at Jasmine. He refused to believe that all of this was real. But he couldn't help thinking about Jasmine, especially what she said before he left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Those moments were real to me. Regardless of what you think, I actually like you Jak.

I should have just-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Ok, I understand why.\" Jasmine said. \"Me and you being a couple and all this crazyness, it does seem unreal. I forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to have you back. You have been a good friend Jak. I can't leave you behind after all the things we all endured as a team.\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Kate said. \"You are a fun loving guy who enjoys life, someone can make some people's bad day turn into a good one. You know how to cheer someone up. We wouldn't ever forget you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate, I have a deal that you might be interested in.\" said the voice of Nostory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it...?\" Kate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a truce in mind. We agree to stay away from the whole group of L.O.R., and you must do the same. You might ask why I am I giving a truce? Well, the truce is temporary, for about 1 year. I can't tell you why I am doing it for me, but for you guys, you have a year to prepare to go to war again. This both gives us time to make new things, and so on. Do we have a Deal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Kate said, she knew that this would be fine with Lucius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Nostory said. He opened the portal to the real world. \"Jak and Jasmine can only enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" Jak said. \"I guess it's time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Shadow said. \"It's been a blast. Jak, take care of yourself. So, we will meet again. Hopefully, you will learn how to defend yourself one way or another. Jasmine, you have to go into the portal too. Come here so I can say good-bye to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak went up near the portal and waited for Jasmine while she talked with Shadow and Nostory who had walked near them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In about a year's time, we'll be entering the real world.\" Nostory said. \"You'll retain all of your abilities goddess. Thought I'd share that with you.\" Nostory then walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nostory's right. This is indeed real. You have to make Jak aware of that.\" Shadow explained. \"He doesn't seem sure and may wave this all off as a dream. Convince him. You will remember this, I'm sure. You're Goddess Gabriel. The Great War that Lucius described started with Jak and you as well. Good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Jasmine said. \"Bye Shadow.\" She gave the kind deamon a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak just got done talking to Kate about things and saying good-bye. He was ready to go, but he was waiting to say good-bye to the dream Jasmine. Jasmine soon got done talking with Kate and said her good byes. Then Jasmine walked up to Jak. Jak was blushing like he did when he saw in class. Jasmine smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine.\" Jak said. \"Er.....I guess this is the last time I'll see you. It was nice to see you as a giant. I hope I'll dream of you again, but it probably won't be in a giant form. I'll miss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jak.\" Jasmine said, smiling. \"You are a nice guy, you know, and I have to admit, you are cute. And hey, cheer up! Don't be nervous a lot. I know you don't think I'm the real Jasmine, and that's ok. You're brave and kind to others and you know...you just need to be more confident and not so nervous. Come to think of it, have you had your first kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine reached up and pulled Jak down and started to kiss Jak with passion. Jak also started to share the kiss and it was a great feeling. Nostory and Seth slightly rolled their eyes, while Shadow and Kate looked on happily. After the kiss, Jak was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a bad kisser.\" Jasmine said. \"You'll need to get better however. But try that. The real Jasmine possibly will love your amateur kissing too. Let's go in together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak simply smiled, blushing madly and took Jasmine's hand. And as they walked in the portal, Jak heard the sweet voice of Jasmine again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><i><b>\"I'll always protect you Jak.

After arriving, he went ti the lunch room, putting in his ear buds and was listening to music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was checking his email and reading gaming articles online on his laptop, but his vision was obscured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess who?\" a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak smiled, as he'd recognize that voice anywhere. \"Is that you Jasmine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine moved her hands from covering Jak's eyes. \"Hey there.\" Jasmine said, smiling at Jak. \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good.

Would you mind walking around with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak internally, was freaking out. Jasmine had asked him to take a walk with her.... They were nearing the end of the year, so better late than never. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak nodded. \"Let's go.\" Jak packed his things and him and Jasmine headed outside to walk around the school. Jasmine surprisingly hooked his arm around hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nervous...\" Jasmine said. \"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not often that I get to walk around with a pretty girl, but you're the prettiest.\" Jak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so sweet, Jak.\" Jasmine said. \"I'm glad we got closer last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Jak said. \"Last night? We didn't do-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak then stopped and looked at Jasmine closely. \"Wait. So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled. \"So I hear you like giant girls?\" Jak blushed. \"Nah, of course not!\" Jak's face gave it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine pulled Jak to the side, under a tree. \"I said, I'd always protect you, regardless. You're special to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak eyes widened. \"So you were acutally...in that dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded. Jak blinked in bafflement, although it was happiness.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry then...\" Jak said. \"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" Jasmine said. \"I understand that you were angry.\" Jasmine then put her arms around Jak's shoulders. \"So... about us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak looked into Jasmine's blue eyes. \"Us...\" Jak said, almost instinctively holding Jasmine's hips. Jasmine leaned into his face. \"I really like you. I got to see what you're like and learned more about you in a dream than I ever thought possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak nodded, leaning in closer. 'Now or never.' he thought, and he went in for a kiss, closing his eyes. Jasmine widened her eyes, but closed her eyes and embraced Jak close. After a minute or two in heavenly bless, the two separated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was a beaming ray of sunshine. \"Well... Is there anything else you want to add behind that?\" Jasmine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my girlfriend.\" Jak said, almost boldly. \"I like you a lot too, you're so awesome and amazing, I just know this'll work out down the road...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine raised an eyebrow. \"Even though we'll have to fight and possibly save the world from Nostory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak smiled. \"I don't think anyone could say that they saved the world with their boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine giggled. \"You're quite the charmer.\" Jasmine smiled. \"Alright. Let's see how far this'll go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Jasmine walked back inside the school, holding hands, openly. Many of their friends were in shock and later on that day, after school, they spent the rest day at Jasmine's house. Jak would later meet her parents, and they kept their fresh new relationship quiet for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving, Jasmine walked with Jak to the bus stop, where he'd wait for the vehicle to drop him off near his home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you tomorrow.\" Jak said, smiling. \"I had an amazing day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled. \"Here, one more for the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJak and Jasmine again, kissed under the street light. As their eyes were closed, both shsred a vision, Jak being shrunk and kissing the giant Jasmine, which she used her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute the bus driver honked, as he arrived,snapping the couple back into reality. \"Alright you love birds, you getting on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Jasmine.\" Jak said, walking onto the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye my little guy.\" Jasmine said, almost in a soft whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Jak headed home. In a year or less, these two would meet with fate and destiny. That would be addressed later. A relationship full of possibilities was on their minds now...</span></div></div>",
