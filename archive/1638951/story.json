It was Hazel, nice elderly woman that we her friends and occasional visitor knew as the old woman seated in a white rocking chair, looking at the world driving past her in a rush to get nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel had a wit and some manner of looking at a person, her gaze saw down deep into the thoughts and dreams of a person. It would seem odd after visiting with her that as walking home some of what she could dredge up and have one talk to her about was fresh still in the mind. Some said she was a witch, and from one personal experience did witness what she could do if aroused of anger, insulted, showing the power she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriend Josh was the one that comes to mind, his doom became an a warning to four of his friends. The parents referred to us as the \"Dangerous Five.\" As danger and troubles we had as instigated, it was of Josh on that warm summer vacation afternoon when we went walking, came past the stately old home belonging to Hazel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel seemed to be asleep while sitting in her white rocking chair there on her stately front porch. Josh saw his chance to sneak up on elderly Hazel, as the four watched, we stood horrified to see Josh creep past sleeping Hazel and he entering her house. It was five or six very anxious minutes later when Josh appeared again, he exiting the front door of the old house, was carrying a huge crystal carried in one hand and held high so all could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuspecting he would put the crystal back inside where Hazel kept it setting on a white roman column, it in the center of her living room, as if given a place of special prominence. Instead he began to toss the crystal into the air as if it were a football. As all watched him we forgot to pay any attention to Hazel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hazel stood there watching Josh toss as then catch the large crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh,\" Hazel said aloud as brash showing her disdain and anger of what he had as was doing with her most treasured personal treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer calling his name distracted Josh during his tossing and expected catching of the crystal. He stopped, as turned to see there Hazel, was ready to turn and run when she pointing at him said \"Halt all,\" with a commanding tone to her otherwise mild voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Youth is foolish, and for your daring stupid as uncaring act I curse you to know my wrath!\" Hazel said, she showing her rare temper, pointing it toward Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen from seemingly above her house boomed a voice, calling down to Hazel, as asking of her if she wished to hurt or doom Josh for his foolish actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel stood on her porch and gazed her eyes down as into the scared mind of Josh, seeing what his intentions were, she replied, \"Doom him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said she then looked out toward the road and the hedge up front of her house where four friends knelt feeling fear for each the other and for dear friend Josh.</span></div></div>",

The black and ten feet tall whirlwind began to spin out a sound as if it were a roaring tornado. As from inside it Josh screamed several times more, as with each time his voice tone dulled. The whirling column of air dissipated after each cry, seemingly to us that what it was doing to Josh had fulfilled another portion of its dooming duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel meanwhile continued to stand upon her front porch, she reached forth an open right hand and the crystal, it still floating motionless in the air, then moved slowly until Hazel grasped it, holding it tightly with her wrinkled, old fingers. She then turned her back to Josh and his dire peril, as Hazel entered her front door, went to the living room and we saw her replace her treasure back to where it properly belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this happened and we remember it every year as a special remembrance day of when Josh was lost from our group and his parents. The captivating whirlwind slowed as it calmed until it disappeared with a meager poof puff of dust, leaving not trace for us to see what happened to Josh. We waited for longer than an hour before wandering away, scared from what we had witnessed, saddened for whatever became of our friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the fall season when next I happened to be riding my ten speed then along that very rural road. As I thought of Josh and Hazel, who should I meet but her standing beside her roadside mail box, as waiting for me to stop and pay my respects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings there Kevin,\" Hazel said to me, as nice ans with a warmth of being friendly, she could change her attitude quite quickly, as well I had seen her do so when dealing with friend Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have not seen you or your friend for quite a while, is something wrong?\" Hazel said, as her asking and the tone changing she became coy with her questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped and stood astride my bike, looking at Miss Hazel I thought about Josh and before I said to much or too little Hazel said, \"He is here, would you like to come and see him, talk together, he has had a busy time keeping up with his duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave an affirmative nod and steered my bike into her cinder stone driveway, walking it to where I laid it against an ages old Oak tree. As hazel led the way I followed, we walking inside her unused milking barn, through the rear cattle chute door, as then down the ramp to where she stopped, standing beside the four rail high fence to her larger pasture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshua, come to Hazel,\" Hazel called or rather she yelled it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long few minutes passed as I wondered what I would see when from out a tall line of Honeysuckle bushes strode slowly a shaggy black furry Highland bull. As the bull came sauntering toward us I rather expected to see a zombie Josh following along too. As the bull came close to the fence it looked at hazel and as she pointed toward me, the beast cocked his head and let loose a long drawl of a morbid sounding moo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, I give you here Joshua, he being now my herd-sire bull. His foolhardy act of daring doomed him in my eyes, and Baal, my host devil did to Josh this deed. Though he is a bull and acts as does what a bull does when breeding, he knows as remembers his friends. The reason I know he remembers is at night I can hear him whimpering and crying, knowing the shame he feels from being a bovine bull.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow speak Joshua, I grant you an hour of the ability to talk with friend Kevin!\" hazel said, as raising her arms and hands high above her head she gave some sort of blessing upon Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevy, oh god Kevin look what has happened to me, oh how I miss you guys, my mother, even my dad!\" Josh said, as spoke using his bullish big lips, that large tongue, he spoke as fluently to me as I then talked with him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I looked over at then to Hazel and she motioned as if I being a school athlete, could grab at a fencepost and leap over the fence into the pasture to be nearer my friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh ho, but no sooner did I jump that fence and stand as kneel down to be more equal in stance to how Josh stood being then on all fours, and who should fade into view but that devil familiar to Hazel, her friend Baal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god keep him away from me!\" Josh wailed as he wheeled and turning did run away from me, obviously frightened by the presence of Baal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel then laughed and Baal too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaal looking to his witch and friend said, \"They both are in the pasture, are you sure you could not use another bull?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard that and I wanted to run away, but how fast can one run with a devil flying after you? There was no place to go, as I stood there rather expecting of Hazel to agree and doom me as well to being a bull like my friend Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Baal, no I wish no evil for Kevin, he remains for now, while a true friend.\" Hazel said, as Baal groaned, he turning to look at me and with his golden yellow eyes he did stare. His stare is dangerous, I know now as did not understand then what he placed inside of my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel told her devil friend to come along and she walked toward her house as he fluttered a foot off the ground, followed willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevy come, you follow me,\" Josh said as he trotted off into the Honeysuckle thicket he came from a while before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Josh, as pressing past the woody branches of the bushes, as I stepped past them there stood Josh, he surrounded by his herd of fifty or more heifers and more mature cows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got quite a herd,\" I commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixty-nine at present with more on the way,\" Josh replied, he sounding proud of his breeding accomplishments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn him, that devil Baal is more of a monster than even his red skin could suggest. He organized and caused my transformation, but plagued me after I had changed. He set upon me sand fleas, and all sorts of biting bugs. My tail and the flicking of my ears did little to keep his insects away, and not until Hazel heard me bellowing as might a mad insane bull did she come and look as find me being tortured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel put a stop to Baal tormenting me every second of every day and night, he worked at it and me for two weeks. But, since then Hazel is in control and me or I have come to accept what is and that my being human is a part of my past. I am a bull, and my only reason to exist is to breed, mate the cows, as \"Replenishing,\" Hazel says the species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy life is a constant taunted beguiling of me to want as feel a dire horrible need to mate with cows. I wake early in the morning and before I can go for a drink at the trough I feel as sniff the air for the scent of a cow feeling her need. I learned to graze, as eat nearly everything placed close to my mouth. Grazing becomes a mindless act of lips movements and biting, chewing quickly as swallow only to regurgitate the greenery for calm munching of it into a saliva thickened slurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach day is the same as the previous with the exception of the weather. I tell you a bull never gets a bath unless by the grace of God it rains hard and we in the herd are drenched clean. Could you imagine me being what I am now as standing under a hot shower and soaped up, my fur in a lather? Silly a thought, but odd too that after a heavy rain and when again dry my fur fluffs and I like that rare clean feeling.\" Josh said as he wandered his thoughts through his daily life, he seemed content for being a brute black bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All at home are fine, your mom does not cry near as much, though after you disappeared the police looked for you for weeks. Tally, Jan, Bill, and me, we are all OK but miss you being there to make us laugh.\" I said as Josh lowered his head and closed his eyes, acting to what I thought he felt hurt and so alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Josh,\" I said, \"We each live in different worlds, you in yours is mundane but, maybe a fuller life for a fellow. I cannot tell you how much I wished I could corral Jan into a bed and...\" I stopped at hearing me talking about my wild male fantasies to Josh. Reminded by his looking back up at me, he living such a fantasy. Baal had changed Josh and matured him to be equal to the task set by Hazel. Doomed, Josh stood being as feeling what young and old men wish they could do, and do without comments by society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us talk about you, as being a bull is as foreign to my manner of thinking as if in another world!\" I said, and Josh razed his head as looked at me with a cocked head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You trying to play with me Kevy? I told you how I need to live in is a very different lifestyle. It is brutal, my cows are true-born animals, dumber than a box of rocks. Why when we stand together they lift a tail and let go their bowels, spewing manure on any other standing too close. When in winter months Hazel keeps us in the barn and corral where huddled together to keep warm we stand in pools of urine, mire, and stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexual pleasures allotted to me by being the herd bull is about the only source pleasure a bovine animal has to reflect upon and help keep a sense of calm, or sanity. Many a time I thought I should go insane from what I felt of that demanding dire horrible need what engulfs both body and mind into a singular form of lust. What you feel for Jan is as much male lust as it is a sense of want to show her how much you love her. Being a bull has nothing like that loving feeling, it is an instinct without love or any consideration for the female. Brutality rules the mind, body and causes ruination to a human soul, I am worse than doomed, I became damned by being changed into this bestial form.\" Josh saying, and as he finished his commenting about how he felt so dooming damned, he mooed, our time to talk was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and looked away from Josh to see again that Baal had returned to be near as watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshua, it is time you become your truer self, seek then to service pretty Bella!' Baal said, and as much an order to Josh he turned his bulk black shaggy furred bull self and sauntered away swinging his bony heavy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted in the worst way just then to speak my mind at the devil floating there in the air. As I looked at him with my eyes and an expression of personal disdain, he grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool human beware, you are no match equal to my insight and intelligence. Hate me do you for what I did as made for Hazel what she that day had a distinct need. Her aged friend Thomas, he stood for some seventy-three years as her prize bull and herd sire, he died that morning when Josh entered the house and toyed with the crystal. Providential my master said, as thought well of me and my making from Josh a new herd bull to keep Hazel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still would despise me for helping world history adjust, properly!\" Baal said, as he had a plan and if he could nudge his prey to argue, he gained a good reason to do what would reward him in the end.</span></div></div>",
