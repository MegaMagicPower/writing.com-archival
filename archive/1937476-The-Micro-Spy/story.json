Fortunately he had made it above the uvula and was still climbing until he reached her brain.  Now that he was in Sabrina's brain he thought he would let her know so he walked to her left ear and said to her \"Sabrina, you are going to tell me everything you know or I will extract it from your brain, I can connect my gadgets to your body now what info have you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was understandably worried, she never had this kind of problem before.  She didn't want to risk losing all of her treasured memories in an instant, so she willingly complied.  Sabrina said \"Alright I will tell you <i>everything</i>! Let me type it all up onto a document, just leave my body, and I will leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked the spy who was suspicious about her. \"Yes\" said Sabrina with tears in her eyes.  \"Alright now print out that document, and quit crying!\" said the spy to Sabrina.  Sabrina printed the document and as the spy went into her tear duct, she grabbed him and put him in another latte, but this time she took his gadgets away. The spy was mortified and yelled \"You tricked me!!\"  Sabrina said \"No! This is for that stomach-ache I had whilst you were still in there, enjoy your new home!\"  She drank him along with the latte and continued with her work- along with a spy powerless to stop her inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">The End</div></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Agent 42, shrunk down to around 1mm tall, moved slowly and carefully under the cover of Sabrina's arms as she typed away on the computer. The plan was simple, sneak inside her body through the nose, hijack her brain and get as much information from her as possible, the first of which being the method in which she got this disk in the first place. Simple, easy and 100% covert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, that was out of the question now. 42 looked over at the monitor, just a quick glance. He was alarmed to that the young hacker had broken through the fire walls, she was now downloading the Agency files and preparing to upload them to an unknown database. The time for stealth and caution was over, now it was time for reckless force... 42's favorite kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He dived out from under the young woman's arm, the cybernetic mask unfolding from his suit's neckline to cover his face and eyes. As he landed back on his feet directly under Sabrina's nose, 42 turned on his booster pack and rocketed up at her face. Sabrina caught the movement out of the corner of her blank eye and turned to the tiny black speck flying at her. She had only enough time to realize where it was going, a look of dread replacing that sneaky smile from before, as Agent 42 flew up her nose and disappeared inside her own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved quickly, passing through the moist and humid tunnel of Sabrina's left nostril. As soon as the tunnel leveled out, and he was sure he was deep enough inside that she couldn't blow him out, 42 turned off his boosters and ran the rest of the way. The tunnel was pitch black, though he could see where he was going thanks to the map images and the night vision of his own mask. He didn't need it for long as a new light appeared at the end of the tunnel. 42 shot through the end and found himself inside a giant organic chamber illuminated by brilliant arches of multicolored electricity. The blue-light was coming from the giant, pink mound of wrinkled flesh in the center of the large chamber, Sabrina's brain. Wasting no time, Agent 42 loaded up a special probe into his dart gun, took aim at the large, pulsing brain and fired...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina sat in her chair, a bit of panic now setting in. What was that tiny thing that went up her nose? A bug? She'd never seen a bug fly that fast, or had any memory of seeing a flying bug in her room recently. Her recent panic turned to alarm as she saw some of the plans still loaded on her computer... They were plans for private shrinking tech, a number of other devices such as jet packs, weapons, and even prototypes for cerebral technology! <i>What if the thing wasn't a bug? What if it was a machi-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off from her thought as some kind of powerful surge overtook her. It was like her mind was being overwhelmed with energy or something. All of her thoughts went blank, all her own fears forgotten. Indeed, Sabrina remembered nothing from the last 20 minutes as she fell into blackness, a deep sleep taking her. In the outside world, Sabrina's body twitched for a few seconds before sitting upright in her chair, unmoving and silent while looking straight ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was now fully under Agent 42's full control...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The connection was established and Agent 42 had complete control over Sabrina's body. He quickly turned on his wrist computer and linked it with the probe. A live feed of the outside world through Sabrina's eyes popped up on the screen. He was able to see everything she saw, and what he saw alarmed him more. The upload of his company files on her computer was 95% complete, he had to act fast. Wasting no time, he typed in his own commands, and watched as Sabrina's body reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The young girl's hijacked brain forced her arms to grab hold of the computer's Ethernet cable and quickly yang it out, cutting off the internet connection and stop the upload. An error message appeared on the screen, 'Connection Lost. Upload Aborted'. 42 sighed in relief, as he sat down against the pulsing flesh of Sabrina's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It had been too close. How could such a young girl with no hacker record get so close to all of their secrets? Sabrina wasn't even on any of their hacker watch lists, and yet she nearly made their entire organization public, a veritable death sentence for any spy organization. He had to find out and now was as good a time as any. With the probe in her brain, Sabrina would do anything 42 programmed her to do. Run outside naked, curse out a cop, even reveal all her own secrets. Like who helped her, and where she was sending the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 42 stood again, facing the brain as he typed on his wrist computer. He hacked into Sabrina's auditory sections of the brain and her vocal center, allowing him to make her talk and hear it clearly through her ears. He then activated the mic on his computer and began issuing commands by voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sabrina Diamond. You are now under my control and forced to do as I command. That includes answering questions I address to you truthfully and without delay. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sey. I dnatsrednu.\" Sabrina spoke with a monotone voice, the least strange thing about her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 42 just stared at his computer. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I ma ot dnopser yllufhturt dna tuohtiw yaled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tiny man dragged his hand down his face as he began to understand what was wrong. For some reason, Sabrina was answering him as requested but with all her words said backwards. It suddenly crossed his mind that the probe was actually still in the developmental stages and might have a few problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ok,\" he said into the mic again. \"Just hold on a moment and let me fix this up a bit.\" He typed away the keypad, making adjustments here and there. A few time these changes had the odd the side effect of making Sabrina twitch a little as the probe seemed to shock her brain as the commands were entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright.\" 42 said finally. \"Lets try this. Repeat after me: I am Sabrina Diamond and I am under your control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sabrina's response was less than satisfactory. \"Sabrina I and am I Diamond under am control your.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 42's eye twitched. \"Alright, how about this?\" He typed again, this time with a little frustration in his motions. Again Sabrina twitched as he screwed with her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now try again. Tell me your name and age.\" 42 ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Koko ga wo Nani Sakura baka no ebi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was about ready to pull his hair out now. \"Oh come on! You're not even Japanese. I doubt that was even a real sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 42 was really annoyed now. In his frustration, the tiny agent pulled back and slammed his fist into the soft squishy flesh of Sabrina's brain...</span></div></div>",

Realizing that this is likely a trap that other spies have fallen into, you nervously and carefully look around and plan for way out. You know something is not right and you choose to abort the mission for now and come up with a different strategy after you are safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour scanner eventually picks up a small electronic device near the bones. You look into it more closely and realize that this is the data you were seeking. You think in your mind: \"This is too easy, mission accomplished!\". You plug your data recorder into the device to download the secret folder, which only takes a quick second. When you finish copying the files, your heart suddenly drops when you hear a very faint beeping emitting from the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the device was nothing more than a trap with fake data inside. In fact, the device is alerting Lorelei and she is now completely aware that a spy is in her stomach, deliberately trying to spy on her and steal her secrets. Suddenly, you feel her massive body begin to move as you bump against her stomach walls. You hear some noise outside like metal and glass clanking quickly for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hear these strange noises, you are also trying to think of a way to escape from being digested. There are only two ways, through her esophagus or through her small intestine. You realize that escaping through esophagus by making her throw up is futile, as Lorelei now knows you are trying to escape and you'll never make it out that way. At that same moment as you are looking up at her esophagus, thick, gooey pudding immediately pours into her stomach and plops right on top of you. She devours a couple pounds of it very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin making your way to her small intestine, but you are struggling through the thick, goopey pudding. You realize that this is probably why Lorelei chose to eat pudding, to make it very difficult for you to move through. You feel Lorelei begin to walk and suddenly her entire stomach and everything in it tips over. Lorelei is now lying belly-up on her bed, and pounds of heavy pudding in her stomach have sloshed up on top of you. You begin to panic as you hear Lorelei's stomach begin to gurgle and her stomach acid steadily starts flowing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery muscle in your body is sore and completely exhausted from frantically trying to swim through the thick gooey mass towards her small intestine. You can barely move as the pudding begins to digest and the acid begins to surround you, burning you slightly. However, you almost to her small intestine where you can escape her stomach acid and where you can come up with a new plan. Just as you get near safety, Lorelei begins rubbing her stuffed, tanned belly, causing the walls of her stomach to contract and forcing you to sink deeper and away from your exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of breath and completely exhausted, you simply cannot move anymore as your muscles are so sore. Lying where you are in the thick, half-digested mass, Lorelei's stomach acid completely engulfs you and you are quickly digested. You do succeed in making it to her small intestine, but only in a new, digested form, leaving behind your skeleton in her stomach along with the others who also made their fatal mistake. Lorelei puts down her own scanner, which she was using all along to track you in her stomach and prevent you from escaping. Now relaxed knowing that the spy (you) are now digested, she widely stretching out her tanned arms and legs, runs her fingers through her blue hair, shifting her weight and stuffed belly, and comfortably lies down for a nap. When Lorelei wakes up, her belly has returned to it's tanned, athletic figure, and your digested remains have become part of her toned abs around her belly.</span></div></div>",

Watch closely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe projector now turned on, showing the image of a mild aged African-American male with a bald head, beard and an eye patch. M42 recognized him at once. Someone famous in spy circles and feared by all. Director of Shield, Nick Fury. He glanced at Questa who just pointed back to the recording as the image began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. My name is the Director, Nick Fury. If you're watching this, it means my message had made it to the Memphis agency. Here's the situation. I need your best agent for an important mission. One of my men, Agent codenamed Black Widow has been targeted by a splinter group of A.I.M. This group is intent on gaining all access to the sensitive information Widow has been privy to. Their methods are unknown- and despite my better judgment, I cannot lock Widow away somewhere until we solve this, she is my best agent and an active member of the Avengers. So, I came to you, Questa-Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The Memphis agency has attained a good reputation as the best of the best in the spy world. You've been credited with the most successful missions in the last year, although none can claim to have seen you in action yet. I ask that you help with this mission. I request that you send your best agents to watch Widow and keep her safe from any immediate threats. If you wish to take the job I'll consider it a personal favor and we will compensate you later. I'll wait for your response.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nM42 looked to Questa as the recording cut out. \"Are you serious?! You want me to spy on the Black Widow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. If you pull this off, Nick Fury will owe us a favour. Think about what we even could do if we had access to some Shield technology. Plus, this is very important. Black Widow has access to a lots of secret information. Hack into her brain and get it sorted for us so we can have an advantage over others. Anything from inside her can now be a huge asset to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But, what about AIM? It could get very risky if we get involved with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The potential gain outweighs all the risks. You can handle this. I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n M42 just sighed loudly. \"Fine. But I'm picking all the equipment for this one. I want to be ready for this mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Later...</span></div></div>",
