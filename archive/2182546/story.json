As a young child, she almost drowned in the bathtub, giving her a pathological fear of water. Ever since that day, Becca hasn't taken a single bath or shower, earning her the nickname \"The Skunk\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a story about the everyday life of this abnormal girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is primarily a comedy story, so keep it PG-13.<br>\r\nWith that said, toilet humor is permitted and even encouraged.<br>\r\nYou can focus on Becca's friends and family if you want, but don't stray too far from the premise.<br>\r\n</td>",
