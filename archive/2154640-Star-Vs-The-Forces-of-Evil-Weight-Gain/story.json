Star lays on her bed turning her pillow into a green pig and back repeatedly out of boredom until her ears twitch at the Marco's voice. Star excitedly summons her flying Snail spell with her wand at horse-rides it out of her room and down to the front door where she is extremely happy to see Marco. She jumps off the snail and bounces up and down to see what Marco promised will be a pleasant surprise for the pair of them to enjoy when he returns. \"are you readyyyyyy?\" asks Marco holding the surprise behind his back. Slowly Marco's hands come before him to reveal a pink box with huge writing on it say 'ultimate chocolate ice cream cake'. Star's eyes glaze at it, she's never seem or even heard of chocolate, ice cream and cake combined before but it sounded amazing to her. <br>\r\nSuddenly, Angie walks in from the kitchen and her happy smile turns into a smirk of disapproval. Angie storms up to the pair and snatches the cake out of Marco's hands before they could even consider digging in. \"Nuh uh amigos, I told you half and hour ago that horseradish sardine tacos will be ready in not too long so i'm confiscating this until you've finished dinner\" says Angie as she walks off into the kitchen. Both Star and Marco grow an angry expression on their faces and stomp upstairs to Marco's room.<br>\r\nStar lays on her bed as Marco sits against the wall with his stomach grumbling and his hand resting on it. Both of are frustrated that while they are hungry and dinner will be soon, all they can think about is that delicious cake Marco cake home with. \"Man this sucks, all I can think about is taking a slice out of it but I have to wait for gross horseradish sardine sandwiches!\" shouts Marco as he slams his fist on the floor. Star's eyes quickly go from half open and content to excitable and wide, she has an idea. Grabbing her magical scissors, she rips open a portal to another dimension. She grabs Marco by the collar and without taking a breathe screams \"I have a great idea lets this dimension where I know a place where time slows down and there is so many desserts we can eat before needing to come home before your mom's disgusting tacos!\". Just like that, Star dragged Marco through the hole to another dimension.<br>\r\nUpon arrival, all the pair can see is a a yellow trail leading to a mansion that was bright and colourful, what was weird to Marco though is how all the shrubs along the trail had lollipops and chocolate muffins growing instead of flowers. \"Gee I don't know Star, everytime we go to another dimension something goes wrong and i'm worried we won't get home in time for dinner, Mom can get pretty mad if we don't eat her food.\" says Marco as he looks around. His eyes trail towards one of the shrubs that is growing a triple chocolate muffin and while reluctant at first, snatches it off the shrub and takes a bite. marco was in ecstasy, the muffin was like no other muffin he ever tasted on Earth. \"Okay fine, lets stay and eat as many sweets as we can to forget that cake but then we gotta go home okay?2 asks Marco with chocolate smeared all around his face. The door to the mansion opens and a figure walks out, it is..</span></div></div>",

It's 3pm and Marco along with Star already had nachos an hour earlier but both of them have developed a taste for sweets after their meal in the past couple of weeks. Marco hoists himself off of his bed and takes a leisurely walk to the downstairs kitchen where he spots Star rummaging through the cupboards eagerly. Instantly knowing she was on the hunt for a sweet treat like himself he doesn't even bother to ask what she's rummaging for and joins in pursuit. Cupboard after cupboard, the teenage pair find barely anything at all let alone anything to cure their sweet tooth. \"hmm, guess Mom forgot to do the grocery shopping again, all I can find are jars of pickled eggs and minced beef\" says Marco with a slightly depressed tone in his voice. Star looks back at him in sadness but has a great idea... \"Let's got to the bakery down the block\". Marco and Star grin at each other and rush out the front door with excitement over the sweet treats they are about to witness.<br>\r\n\"Noooooo\" cries out Star as she see's the out of business sign on the door. She develops tears growing in her eyes as she realizes how far town is from home and no buses are running due to a strike. Both of them slouch against the door-frame and feel sorry for themselves as their stomachs grumble and sweet tooth go unfulfilled. \"Gee sorry Star, didn't know the bakery was shutting down. Wish we could just teleport ourselves to a bakery as good as this one was.\" says Marco as he looks down to the ground. Suddenly, Star has an idea that will solve their problems and a big grin grows across her face. She pulls out her pair of dimensional scissors and cuts a whole before shoving Marco through it without haste. <br>\r\nOut of thin air the teenage pair appear in-front of a building which looks just like a giant candy cane. Marco looks up at the building trying to understand what it is with a vague expression on his face. Still trying to understand what's going on he asks Star where they are. With a big smile on her face she explains to Marco that they have teleport-ed to a dimension with the best sweets she has ever tasted. Hesitantly, Marco accompanies Star through the bakery doors and is in awe with his jaw dropping seeing all the bright, colorful and tasty sweets. \"Why it's Princess Butterfly so good to see you and you've brought a friend I see\" Says an elderly man with an ankle length bushy beard behind the counter. The pair walk up to the counter and stare at the sweets laying out for show. \"Hey Mr Jongo, can we have 1 of you're gooey chocolate brownies please and put it on the Butterfly castle tab please.\" The old man hands over a large brownie to Star who breaks it in half and breaks on of this pieces into another half. She hands Marco one of the quarters and eats the other quarter herself. Marco looks at the tiny piece he has and glares back in annoyance at Star. \"Hey Star how come you get way more than I do, it's not really fair?\" Star enjoys her Brownie and after a few seconds of approval she informs Marco that the sugar in the sweets here is highly addictive so being new to it could be dangerous so he should only have small amounts. Marco questions her but deals with it anyway. He puts the piece of brownie in his mouth and the taste is like nothing he's ever experienced before. He chews around and swallows when realising he is in ecstasy. \"Holy cow that was amazing, I gotta have more\". Star reminds him the sugar is highly addictive and can make people who aren't used to it act out go crazy. Marco...</span></div></div>",

We have more stock than we can handle\" says Mr Bongo as the teenage pair leave the large bakery door. Marcos eyes grew with excitement upon learning it's all free to him. Star puts her hand on his shoulders and reminds him again of the addictive aspect of Mewni sweets. Marco nods and agrees to only go back with her, however his fingers are crossed behind his back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Star clutched Marco's wrist in an inescapable vice grip before dragging him to the center of the field so that she could gain a vantage point of the illustrated vans parked in a dotted circle around them. Each vehicle bore a collage of mouth watering dishes from the furthest reaches of the kingdom and a sizable open window attracting a queue of patrons eager to try them, and the wide variety was almost more than the young woman could take. Marco, though, once again rolled his eyes at his friend's excitable nature and had the task of deflating her interests, \"You seriously dragged me out of the house on a Saturday just so we could pay way too much for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Marco!\" Star tore her eyes off the numerous offerings to address her friend. \"You always get to choose where we eat, so I think it's high time you try some Mewni food! Think of it as an adventure for your taste buds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Star's defense, Marco would easily admit that he had a fairly limited palette, namely Mexican food or pizza in its numerous forms, and while he cooked a mean plate of nachos, the girl felt a change of pace was much needed, and what better place was there to sample new tastes than Mewni's weekly gathering of food vendors. \"The only way this is an adventure is the risk of salmonella.\" Marco scoffed, giving a much more critical scan of their offerings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar responded with a frustrated purr under her lips before perking back up. \"Ooh! This one looks good! And the line isn't that long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess seized Marco by the wrist once more and lugged him to a group of mewmans and monsters alike waiting in line, his nimble legs barely able to keep up underneath him. As Star promised, the line proceeded at a brisk pace and Marco got a look at their orders as they exited the waiting are in an orderly fashion. Said meal was a simple bowl of noodles in a reddish-orange sauce, clumped together before being carelessly slung into a bowl and much less appealing in person than the flawless strands of noodles lovingly recreated on the side panels of the van. His initial opinion stood, but he felt less inclined to express it now that he was within earshot of the cook. \"Two bowls of your finest Tiefling Noodles, sir!\" Star requested to the cook within the metal shutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe operator of the van, a stocky character from the underworld with a pair of curled horns set aside both sides of his chef's hat, briefly retreated into the mobile kitchen and soon returned with two bowls of the aforementioned dish. \"Marco, pay the good man.\" She ordered in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? But this was...\" Marco quickly sputtered, but the cook's apathetic expression fading into one of slight annoyance got him to reconsider. After all, the meal would put an negligible dent in the $650 check he got in the mail earlier that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Star and Marco returned to the center of the field where a scattering of other patrons stood to sample their wares. Marco took up the spork included with his meal and twirled the noodles around it before bringing the sample to his mouth, though he expected little. 'Food trucks and sporks in a medieval setting? Man, nothing in this world makes sense!' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anachronism soon faded into the background of his mind as his mouth processed the Tiefling Noodles. The sauce struck him first, a thick, savory flavor not unlike marinara but flavored with herbs he couldn't recognize giving it a zest between spicy and tangy. The noodles themselves had a healthy, starchy taste that helped absorb these two flavors and keep them from overpowering his mouth as he continued to eat. And eat he did, guiding the noodles into his mouth with a series of satisfied \"hmms\" and \"mmphs\" that brought a coy smile to her friends mouth as she enjoyed her own cup. \"See, what did I tell ya!\" She gloated, taking a break from her own meal while Marco slurped down the last of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, that was pretty good. Pricey, but yeah, 5 stars, would eat again.\" Marco rambled, wiping his mouth with the cuff of his hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar smiled at Marco's change in disposition while she twirled the last of her noodles around her fork and brought the tense weave to her mouth, ending her meal on a high note. After disposing of the styrofoam bowls (another item whose presence in Mewni bewildered Marco), Star turned to her friend and asked, \"So, what do you want to try next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you want to get more? But we just ate\" Marco responded inquisitively, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah!\" Star answered, failing to see his point. \"I mean, you think I brought you all the way out here just to try one dish? We're in it for the long haul...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco apprehensively gazed out upon the dozen and a half other stations around them. While he enjoyed his first meal, he could feel the carb heavy dish resting in his stomach as Star egged him on and doubted that he had room for more. \"I'm not sure I should...\" he weakly let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you enjoyed the noodles. Who knows what other things you might enjoy?\" Star began, closing in on the young man before she figured out what his problem was. \"Besides, you could use a little more meat on those bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar punctuated her point by driving a finger into the young man's taught bellybutton, which gave Marco a bit of a jolt. He looked down at the site of the assault, and decided that there was nothing to worry about. Wasted food aside, he could stop eating whenever he felt he hit his limit and his active lifestyle of karate practice and adventuring with his friend would help eliminate any extra calories from this one time indulgence. \"Fine, where to next.\" he conceded with a grin, playfully guiding Star's finger away from his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... have you ever tried unicorn dimension canolis?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marco slowly clenched his jaw around the whole wheat bun with a satisfying munch as with teeth sliced through a blood red tomato, crisp lettuce, delectably grilled onions and finally a deep fried cornmeal patty splashed with just the right amount of dressing. According to Star, corn burgers were fairly pedestrian fare in Mewni, but he judged that this would probably be one of the better ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnicorn dimension cannolis seemed like a proper dessert to close out his meal, but at Star's insistence they sampled some Hero Gyros (meat wraps prepared by a proud warrior who left a storied career of adventuring to pursue his love of cooking). Surprisingly, the goat meat dish sat well with Marco, but Star claimed she had had enough eating for the day. Her friend might have agreed with her had they not passed by a modest stand providing corn chips slathered in a cheese-like sauce and several peppers native to Mewni. Marco wasn't about to pass up this spin on his favorite snack, and while he admitted that they beat his nachos, the spices wreaked havoc on his tongue. Thankfully, an ice cream truck ran by the surprisingly approachable frost giants of the far north offered a mewberry sorbet to sooth his mouth. Shortly afterwards, Star noticed a truck from the local MacArthur's chain and insisted that they grab a bite there for old time's sake. Star settled for a side of fries to nibble on while Marco ordered his corn burger out of curiosity if nothing else. The last bit of the sandwich had just passed his lips, and the boy gave a solid belch to announce it. \u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s enough for today\u2026\u201d He groaned as a slight wave of nausea settled in, drawing attention to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as the boy enjoyed sampling the varied flavors the land of Mewni had to offer, it had begun to take a toll on the boy's figure, albeit a temporary one. Below him, the front panel of his hoodie jutted out as his stomach stretched to accommodate all the food stuffs he placed inside it. \"Really? Cause, we haven't even tried Mermaid food. I hear they take a tankard of seawater from their kingdom to keep it fresh.\" Star tempted the bloated boy, but he resisted. \"Come on, you've got room in there for a little more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar sent her hand in to give Marco's belly a good-natured jostle, but the young man seemed even less pleased than the last time. With his last sandwich, he passed the thin line from comfortably full to ready to burst, and the thought of more food suddenly became a fate worse than death.  \"Star, seriously!\" He stated firmly, raising an arm to shield his stomach. \"I'm glad you took me out here today, but I think I've had enough. I mean, I feel like I swallowed a medicine ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl leaned over a bit to inspect the boy's swollen stomach, noting how it began to peak out from under his hoodie and undershirt for just half an inch. \"Nah, you're more at the football stage. Soccer ball, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot concerned with the specifics, Marco turned away from the girl with a flustered sigh. \"Look, we can come back another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine.\u201d Star audibly tsked under her breath, reaching into her satchel and withdrawing her dimensional scissors. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want you getting a tummy ache, now, would we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco ignored Star\u2019s light tease and dragged himself through the portal to his living room. Each step sending a jolt of jabbing pain into his stomach, he awkwardly staggered his way to the couch and slumped onto the center section. Sitting down took some of the strain off, but Marco still had to cope with the sight of his taught bulge dominating his lap, its round shape even more prominent as his body attempted to take a crescent shape on the sofa. \u201cWell, I see someone enjoyed themselves today!\u201d Star chirped, having taken a seat next to the boy, kneeling on the couch cushion and leaning her head in over the boy\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco was feeling too lethargic to be shocked by her intrusion, and could barely muster a response, \u201cYeah, a little too much.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar, in a rare display of courtesy, gave the boy some space as she fell back onto her own cushion on the couch next to him. \u201cPlease, we barely scratched the surface of the food truck scene. We didn\u2019t even get into fusion cuisine, or the secret menus.\u201d Star recounted to herself before giving her friend\u2019s lumpier frame another glance. \u201cStill, I guess it was a good first trip. We need to train that stomach of yours to handle more food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a weak moan, Marco despondently rubbed his belly and shuddered at the thought of what would happen if this did become a regular occurrence for him and Star: his lithe body, toned from an active lifestyle and dedication to the art of karate, marred with a layer of stubborn fat. His optimistic friend had yet to consider the consequences, but he already thought of how Jeremy would mock him at karate lessons as his belly bulged from the confines of his gi, or how his plumped arms and legs would be too cumbersome in a fight against Ludo\u2019s forces as he could only flail about breathlessly the next time they tried to seize the wand. Of course, he had yet to consider the reactions of his peers at Echo Creek High. The nervous teen had always been an easy target of the upper echelons of students and it wouldn\u2019t take much more than him splitting an overly tight pair of pants for \u201cFat Kid\u201d to be added to his reputation. Even worse than that, was the thought of a pair of aquamarine eyes gazing upon his overfed form as he exchanged his daily nod with Jackie Lynn Thomas, and her normally stoic, patronizing smile reeling back in disgust at how much he had let himself go. Marco could only hope that with their busy schedule of adventuring and fighting monsters his flighty friend would forget about their new tradition by this time next week. Deciding to patronize the girl for now, he simply muttered, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco foolishly thought this would end Star\u2019s goading and he would be left to digest his hefty haul in peace, but she continued. \u201cSo what was your favorite part? Come on, gimme your top 3!\u201d Star piped up, propping herself up with her forearms on the cushions of the couch as she leaned in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood was obviously the last thing Marco wanted to think about at the moment, and the very mention sent a brief pang into his overtaxed stomach once again. However, they also stimulated the remnants of the meal on his taste buds and for the briefest moment he relived his opulent feast: the starchy but savory Tiefling Noodles, the subtle spices and juices of the gyros, and homegrown textures and crisp vegetables of the cornburger all came back to him at once and the young man was not one to complain. Strong as the temptation was, though, he quickly shook it off. Until he could do something about the mass currently in his stomach, they would continue to be nothing but memories. \u201cLook, it was all good: the noodles, the cannolis, the ice cream, but I just don\u2019t think this is something we should do too often.\u201d Marco protested, and to emphasize his foreboding words, placed his hand back on the curvature of his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Star finally realized what Marco's objection was, and why something as simple as a weekly outing to grab lunch would cause him such anxiety. \u201cAw, come on, Marco.\u201d Star cooed, eyelids slanting in an inviting fashion as she scooted closer to the boy. \u201cAre you really going to let a few pounds keep you from enjoying yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice hopefully lulling the boy into a sense of ease, Star let her hand slowly slide from its position on the couch and gradually transition to Marco's hoodie. Upon reaching the summit, she copied the gentle caressing motion Marco had been so fond of lately to further relieve the boy's troubled mind, but the bluntness of the gesture had the opposite affect. Namely, it helped Marco finally summoned the energy to abruptly shoot up from his seat, Star leaning out of the way just in time. \"Star, let's just forget about it...\" he blurted out, hoping to distract from the red fluster of his cheeks. \"Look, let's just wait until next weekend, and if we're feeling up to it, we'll go again. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar took a few seconds to recoil from her friend's reaction, but she eventually gave the agreement a firm nod. \"Now, if you excuse me, oof,\" Marco grunted as the weight of his gut caught up to him as he pivoted towards the staircase, \"I've got some digesting to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Marco began the arduous task of waddling up the stairs and to his bedroom where he hoped to be able to recuperate in private. Compared to his brief trek across the living room floor, each step up the incline disrupted the numerous contents of his belly even more, but the realization that he was burning calories helped him power through and get to his bedroom on the top floor while Star idled on the couch below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being alone also allowed him to reach under his belly and delicately unfasten the button of his jeans. The few more inches of space made the remainder of his trek to the bed all the more bearable before he collapsed onto his back with one more moan of relief. \u201cI\u2019ll just, rest for a while, until I don\u2019t feel like my stomach\u2019s going to burst open. Maybe I can do some karate drills later, or some sit-ups\u2026\u201d Marco promised himself his hand once again found his way to his offending belly to massage away a new batch of pangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe performative gesture did little to actually help his discomfort in the past, nor did Star\u2019s earlier breach of personal space help ease him, but this time around, he found himself enjoying it more than he\u2019d like to admit. His hasty retreat from Star earlier and his turbulent march up the stairs had caused the grey t-shirt he wore underneath his hoodie, already a tight fit at his fighting weight to ride up further a few inches, the result being the smooth, red fabric gliding across his tender flesh in a most pleasing fashion. Combined with his stomach beginning to make progress digesting his meal, Marco soon found himself lost in the gentle rubbing motions, now a hypnotic ritual lulling the boy into a lax state.</span></div></div>",
