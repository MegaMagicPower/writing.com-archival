Clara said, surprised. She had been Katy's best friend for the first year during boarding school, but then they'd fallen out and she hadn't seen or head from her since.<br>\r\n'Hi, babe! So, I was in town and I wondered if you wanted to go shopping.'<br>\r\n'Well...' Clara wasn't sure. She had learnt that being bad wouldn't get her anywhere, but had Katy? Was she still up to the same old tricks?<br>\r\n'It'll be fun. A few boys are going to be there.'<br>\r\n    Clara's curiousity got the better of her and she agreed. She'd never had a boyfriend before but she did want one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, I love these earrings, don't you?' Katy asked Clara, holding up some tiny gold hoops. They weren't Clara's style but she smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n    'Why don't you nick them, then?' Katy asked, a daring grin on her face.<br>\r\n    'You what?' Clara hissed 'Are you serious?'<br>\r\n    'Yeah!' Katy said breezily 'I've done it loads of times! It's easy.'<br>\r\n    'But you've got enough money anyway, why don't you just buy them?' Clara asked. Katy's parents were rich and they were always trying to keep her happy with presents and endless amounts of cash.<br>\r\n    'It's no fun buying them.' Katy said 'Are you chicken or something?'<br>\r\n    'Well, no.' Clara said cautiously, even though she was 'It's just wrong though, innit?'<br>\r\n    'What's wrong is you being a total baby!' Katy teased 'Lighten up! Me and the boys don't hang around with wimps, do we?' she looked at 'the boys' for support and they shook their heads mechanically. Right then, it was decided. Clara would have to do it. </span></div></div>",

See, Clara's first cooperating teacher got a split-second job offer in Alaska, and took it.  Now she's stuck with the most absolutely horrendous teacher ever, and just across the hall is Rachel, with an angel to teach with her.  It all came to a head one Wednesday morning.  Mrs. Alvarez, Clara's cooperating teacher, was teaching the first class just to show her how the lesson was done.  Then, without warning, Mrs. Alvarez melted down.  <br>\r\n\"How could you do this to me!  It's not that hard, it's feudalism!  How could hearing the same thing over and over help?!\"  She shouted.<br>\r\n\"But...\" some unlucky kid whispered.<br>\r\n\"Don't interrupt me, don't contradict me!  Ten demerits!\"  Another unlucky kid was waving at little Jimmy at precisely the wrong time.  <br>\r\n\"'Scuse me kids,\" Mrs. Alvarez said brusquely.<br>\r\nShe came in holding the poor unfortunate by the ear.  Dropping him on the linoleum, she proceeded to grill him.  <br>\r\n\"Are you willing to explain why you are in the hall?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get my homework.\"  The kid was slouchy and wouldn't look her in the eye.<br>\r\n\"Don't lie and don't throw attitude.  Ten demerits for attitude, 5 for lying, and 5 for not having a pass.\"<br>\r\n\"But Mr. Connaughton said it was all right!\"<br>\r\n\"That's his problem.  I don't care.\"<br>\r\nThen Clara spoke.  \"Isn't that a little much?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't contradict me either, girl, I've taught for many a year.  He's a bad egg.\"<br>\r\nClara couldn't handle it.  She fled.  Across the hall, where the teacher had a free period and was getting lunch.  She sat at a desk, removed her black glasses and cried.  She mourned the loss of that kid's dignity.  Even she, who nearly failed psychology, knew that the poor kid wasn't throwing attitude, he just didn't stand like a soldier.  A tall, blonde girl who was most likely the student teacher, stumbled in with a towering stack of copied papers.  Clara rushed over to help.  When the other woman could see over the load of paper, she noticed Clara crying.  Clara wiped her eyes and sat down.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I could never be a schoolteacher!\" she wailed. <br>\r\nShe related, as coherently as she could, the awful incident, and the dreams she once harbored of her own business.<br>\r\n\"by the way my name is Clara.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Rachel,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

The problem was, was that Brianna was nowhere to be found. He saw Raven hanging on some other guy. He wanted to go up to Raven but he also wanted to find his sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brianna! Brianna!\" he called. No answer. He went closer to the water and dipped in his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked across the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was Brianna--floating. Half of her body was covered, half of it wasn't. Her head was face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brianna! Oh my God!\" Kalib screeched. How long had she been like that?</span></div></div>",

It had been a particularly hot day, so Kalib decided he would take a shower before heading home. He did not mind the shared showers, they were clean and guys had seen each other nude changing out in the locker room. He got in and began showering.

It just wasn't FAIR!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Monday at school when the first actual fight broke out. Allan Marshall, an eleven year old (very popular) boy practically worshipped by the rest of the children, had been begging James for a card trade. The trend that month was cricket cards, something James had a lot of. On his weekly cricket outings with Jack he was supplied with new packs from the Junior Coach, and so had over two thousand in his collection.<br>\r\n\"I've got cards!\" Kalib offered Allan brightly, proffering his only set. \"Do you want to trade with me?\"<br>\r\n\"Shut it, I'm busy! So, J, how about Phillips for Arrowsmith? That's fair, innit?\" Allan grabbed James's cards and handed over his own. Both boys turned to Kalib and laughed.<br>\r\n\"Stupid little kid! Don't interrupt proper business!\" James laughed nastily.</span></div></div>",

He hadn't seen a girl his age since he was 5 and by the looks of this girl, the female version of puberty was very interesting to Kaleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" said Kaleb back, a bit shy. His voice was beginning to deepen as he began his own trek into puberty, cracking every now and again. He was very self-conscious about how his voice sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Vanessa,\" said the girl friendlily, shaking Kaleb's hand kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Kaleb,\" stuttered Kaleb as he blushed. He found it hard to take his eyes off of Vanessa's well endowed bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice name,\" said Vanessa with a smile, Kaleb was sure she was the first person in his entire life to say that to him, \"do you go to that military school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" nodded Kaleb, his voice cracking. He blushed a deep crimson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I don't think I could do that,\" said Vanessa, \"Military school, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't allow girls there,\" said Kaleb, \"we're not even allowed girlfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, that's sad,\" she said. Kaleb realized just how pretty her voice sounded, another layer adding to her overall beauty. She indicated the sidewalk before them and Kaleb and Vanessa started walking together. \"Guys like you must go crazy in there... you know, with no girlfriends and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb's eyebrows raised, Vanessa had hit the nail right on the head. \"You don't know the half of it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor guy, you,\" she said to him. \"This town seemed so nice to live in too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't live here?\" asked Kaleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Vanessa, \"I'm just visiting with my dad. No, I live in Weeburg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? That's where my parents live!\" exclaimed Kaleb, his voice cracking again, but this time the pubescent 12-year-old didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow,\" said Vanessa, \"how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"12,\" replied Kaleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" smiled Vanessa, \"I bet we'd both be in the same classes in Middle School if you lived with your parents!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa!\" cried a man from down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... looks like I've got to go,\" she said. Vanessa turned to Kaleb, \"I feel really bad for you, Kaleb. Here's a little something to remember me by!\" She kissed the tall 12-year-old on the cheek before he could react. \"Bye, Kaleb! Nice meeting you!\" and with that, she ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb blushed deep red, holding the cheek he was kissed on, caressing it as if it was the most precious thing he owned, and already thinking about never washing it again. As he jogged back to the Military School, Kaleb knew what he needed to do...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaleb was kind of enjoying the flight, actually. He hadn't really had much fun at Military School. Sure, it was fun learning about all the great battles of history and learning how to effectively kill somebody in several different ways. He'd gotten used to the harsh discipline, though. It felt so alien for him to drink a soda or watch a movie that wasn't a great military film like Patton or Saving Private Ryan that his favorite Instructor, Sargent Philips, would show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt strange wearing civilian clothing too. His parents had sent them to him in a package for his last birthday and he hadn't had a chance to wear them until now. They were a bit tight on him, the pants high watered a bit. He realized he'd gone through a bit of a growth spurt since his 10th birthday. Nonetheless, he wanted to look normal when he met his parents, if nothing else but to thank them for the clothes they'd sent by wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilitary school was getting a bit weird for Kaleb. The older boys at the Academy were strange people. One older boy, a 17 year old by the name of Frank, would pay Kaleb a quarter a day for doing his chores, but if Kaleb forgot accidentally, Frank would beat him. Kaleb knew that Frank enjoyed beating him and secretly, Kaleb had really had enough of Military school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb munched on the airline peanuts as he thought to himself. He was just wondering if the peanuts were actually made of Styrofoam when he felt a lot of turbulence, much more than usual. The plane started to shake violently and the usual soft purr of the jets was replaced by a whine growing higher and higher in pitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your Captain speaking,\" spoke the Captain's voice over the intercom, \"please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we're... uh... heh...\" the voice cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb, as well behaved and responsible as he was, already had his seat belt in place. His worries grew more and more as time wore on but he remained completely calm and collected. However, the little girl next to him, also 10 and named Lila, was starting to cry. Kaleb hadn't seen many girls since he joined Military School and in the Academy you were beaten by the Drill Sargent if you tried to comfort somebody. Kaleb had a heart of gold deep down, though, and was compelled to comfort the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Lila,\" he said in a voice most calm and mature for a boy his age, \"these guys are trained professionals.\" The little girl looked over at Kaleb and nodded. Kaleb hugged the girl, hoping he'd make her feel safer. He looked out the window as he did. His eyes grew enormously wide when he saw the plane's wing rip right off of the fuselage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm went off and the plane's oxygen masks popped down from the ceiling. Kaleb knew this was not good at all. Still, he was as calm and collected as ever. He put Lila's mask on first before putting his own on. Idly, he thought about putting on a parachute and escaping, but he remembered that there were none on commercial airplanes, making the Paratrooper class he took pretty much useless. Lila held on tight to Kaleb as Kaleb stared out the window at the ever closer ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" he said in his head, \"please don't take me now... I don't think I'm ready yet...\" The 10-year-old boy shed a few tears. Only a few, that was all he would allow himself to shed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaleb regained consciousness. \"I must've passed out,\" he mentally noted to himself. The last thing he remembered was a tremendous boom, which was probably the plane impacting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalm and collected, Kaleb checked himself for injuries and found he'd gotten scratched up a bit. His left arm was broken, he felt, but he didn't cry. He could feel the pain of the arm, which meant he wasn't in shock, he just didn't bother with it. He was sort of used to pain, he shrugged it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked immediately to his right, to Lila. \"Lila,\" he called, \"Lila.\" He checked her pulse. \"She's alive, alright,\" he thought, \"thank God.\" He checked her for injuries and she too looked to be alright, better off even than Kaleb if his arm was considered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane itself was dark, and Kaleb smelled jet fuel burning. He could see a few small fires in the cabin and he gulped nervously. Kaleb heard cries, crying, and moaning all around him. He had to help these people, he had to find a way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleb,\" said Lila as she came around from her unconsciousness. \"Kaleb!\" she said more urgently, alert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, Lila,\" responded Kaleb strongly. \"C'mon, we gotta find a way out of here...\" He unfastened her seat belt and then his. Though it was dark, the light from the mostly shattered windows bathed the cabin enough for Kaleb to see. Kaleb coughed on the slowly accumulating smoke from the growing fires. Lila had her hand firmly in his, her other arm hugged his torso. He squeezed her hand comfortingly, glad for the moment she was holding his right hand, as he stumbled determinately through the debris. He followed the seats forward until he came to the emergency exit nearest to him. The 10-year-old boy grabbed hold of the handle with his good arm and pulled with all his might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleb,\" said Lila, \"is your arm broken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had worse,\" said Kaleb as he pried the door open slowly and desperately. \"Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the fitness training at Military School finally paid off for Kaleb, he was quite strong for a 10-year-old. Desperate to be free, he pushed the door open. A gust of fresh air met him and Kaleb had a smile on his face for the first time he could remember. He kicked the door wide open and bellowed into the cabin, \"This way, everybody!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Lila were the first ones to step out from the cabin, over the embankment of dirt, and into a grassy field. The pilot apparently had made a last ditch effort at landing the plane at least intact. The plane had hit the ground hard, hard enough to bury it in dirt nearly halfway, at least to the level of the emergency door. The plane had landed in a otherwise peaceful and cheerful field of grass, bordered by forest. The plane seemed to have landed about 150 yards from any tree, however, a feat in itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb wasted no time helping everybody get out of the plane, however. He was afraid the plane might explode and rightly so. Many people seemed to not have made it, many others were rather seriously injured. Kaleb appreciated the fact that he was alive and well now more than ever. He heard the sirens of the ambulances and fire trucks and felt himself a bit more relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila, who hadn't left Kaleb's side, looked at the tall, handsome 10-year-old boy. \"Kaleb, my hero!\" she cried. She hugged her heroic life saver and Kaleb smiled warmly as he hugged her back. For the first time in what seemed like and probably was an eternity, Kaleb was happy, truly happy. It felt like a new beginning to his life...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaleb was given a quick 15 minutes of fame for saving the day. Kaleb couldn't allow himself to feel good about it, though. A lot of people had died on that plane and Kaleb couldn't save them. Kaleb had grown selfless in his time at Military School. When he was 5, all he cared about was himself. Though the drill sergeants never exactly told him to be selfless, they did help him have a wake up call of sorts, Kaleb changed himself for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe airline put him on a bus with the other passengers who weren't hurt too badly and didn't have relatives who were hurt either. Kaleb's arm was in a sling and a cast. He looked pensively out the window as the bus got ready to pull out. \"Hey, Kaleb!\" said a familiar voice. Kaleb turned and found Lila grinning at him from the seat next to him. \"How's your arm?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had worse,\" said Kaleb with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already said that,\" pointed out Lila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's true,\" Kaleb said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you had worse?\" asked Lila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bus drove its passengers to their respective destinations, Kaleb told his story to Lila. How he was a bad boy when he was young and then what military school was like, the twisted older boys at the academy, the inspiring instructors, the not-so-inspiring instructors. Lila was wide eyed, she couldn't believe what this remarkable boy her age had been through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb looked around the bus and found only he and Lila remained. Kaleb wondered if Lila and he lived in the same town. Kaleb would've liked that very much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stopped and Kaleb got up to get off. He found that Lila too was getting off. \"You live in the same town as me?\" asked Kaleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, looks like I do!\" said Lila excitedly. They both exited the bus, scanning the area around the small building that was the bus depot. \"There's my family,\" she said, pointing to a large group; a couple with their children in tow, some older and some younger than Kaleb. Lila gave Kaleb a piece of paper with a phone number on it. \"Give me a call, okay?\" She grinned at him and gave him a hug, \"Bye, Kaleb.\" She kissed him on the cheek and Kaleb flushed red. Lila giggled before running off to be embraced by her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched Lila's family leave for a moment. Kaleb couldn't help being a little jealous of the big, happy family. In his early days at the academy, Kaleb cried because he thought his mommy and daddy didn't love him any more. Though they sent him Christmas and birthday presents in the mail and they talked to him infrequently over the phone, he missed them a lot. He felt unloved. He didn't cry about it, though. He was tough and strong and he'd make them proud, he knew he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleb!\" he heard a voice call. It was a voice all too familiar but one he hadn't heard in a long time. Kaleb turned and gazed upon his parents, both standing at the corner of the depot. Kaleb smiled as he walked triumphantly to them. He had discipline enough not to rush up to them, he thought they'd think he was annoying if he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems they themselves couldn't contain their excitement and Kaleb's mom and dad ran up to their firstborn. The two of them embraced him. \"My baby!\" cried Matilda, \"my baby! Oh, Kaleb, it's so wonderful to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, son,\" said Jack, \"We missed you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you!\" said his mother, \"you're so handsome and tall.\" She kissed her boy on the forehead a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb looked up and saw tears in his parents' eyes. He couldn't believe it, how happy his parents were to see him after all those years. They were actually crying with joy upon seeing him. Part of him really didn't understand, he'd thought they didn't love him, that he was a bad boy and they didn't want him anymore. Kaleb felt like crying, but didn't. He was better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleb, we have somebody very special for you to meet,\" said Jack...</span></div></div>",

Kaleb never got to see his new little brother, he'd never been home since he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleb!\" he heard a small voice cry. A little boy ran as fast as he could out of the building. He looked like a younger Kaleb, the same freckles, blond hair, and blue eyes as his older brother. The younger boy hugged his big brother, holding onto Kaleb's waist. \"Hi Kaleb!\" he said cheerfully with a huge grin, \"I'm your little brother, Jacob, but you can call me Jake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb imediately liked his happy little brother. He hugged his little brother and said, \"Hi, Jake, I'm Kaleb, your big brother.\" His voice was calmer than Jake's but not at all less excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb wanted to cry now more than ever. He couldn't begin to think of all that he missed in Jake's life. All the wasted time. He really wanted to cry, but found he couldn't. Kaleb found that he was dry of tears, he couldn't cry if he wanted to. It worried him, \"Will I never cry again?\" he asked to himself in his head. Still, Kaleb vowed that he'd be the best big brother to Jake he could be no matter what. He owed that to his sweet little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family went out to dinner to celebrate Kaleb's homecoming and him helping save the lives of the other passengers. Kaleb told the story to his family and saw Jake's eyes grow wide as he listened. Jake was in awe of his big brother. \"Does your arm hurt?\" asked Jake in the car on the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" said Kaleb, \"it's okay, though, I've had worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're like Superman, big brother!\" cried Jake. Matilda and Jack smiled at each other and chuckled at their youngest son's extreme excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out of the car and walked into the same house Kaleb had lived in before. He looked at the house in the late afternoon sun. It hadn't changed, the entire neighborhood hadn't changed for that matter. Kaleb was home, that was a nice, happy feeling for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb was all too happy to volunteer to read Jake a bedtime story. He read on until he noticed Jake was fast asleep, a peaceful smile on the happy boy's face. Kaleb tucked in his brother and whispered, \"Goodnight, baby brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10-year-old exited Jake's bedroom and was met by his parents, both beaming at him. Matilda and Jack hugged their eldest son and Jack said, \"Son, we want you to know we're so proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't begin to tell you how much we're proud of you, baby,\" added Matilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack said, \"We realize it was a big mistake, sending you to military school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda was in tears, \"Oh, baby, we didn't send you because we thought you were bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't know what else to do,\" added Jack, \"you were crying so much, we tried anything... Son, do you feel unloved because we sent you to military school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb was struck by this. They felt guilty for sending him to military school. \"Well... when I started I did... but Mom and Dad, I was selfish before. You talked to me over the phone and sent me presents every Christmas and birthday... I'm thankful for that. I'm even more thankful that you want me back now. I'm glad. Thank you, Mom and Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband and wife looked at each other, surprised at how mature and selfless their 10-year-old was. \"We love you son,\" was all Jack could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Mom and Dad,\" said Kaleb. The son and parents held each other for a moment more before Kaleb asked, \"Uh... Is my bedroom still down the hall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is, baby,\" chuckled Matilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Kaleb, \"Goodnight, Mom and Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, baby,\" said Matilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, son,\" said Jack, \"and welcome back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb's parents let him out of their hug and Kaleb went down to his room. He entered his room for the first time in 5 years, finding it to be furnished blandly but comfortably, a change from before. Kaleb didn't care, however. The 10-year-old was exhausted and wanted sleep badly. He crawled into his bed and snuggled under the covers. \"It's good to be home,\" whispered Kaleb to himself with a peaceful smile. It wasn't to long after that the boy found sleep, calm and peaceful.</span></div></div>",

He felt so helpless, so weak. He hated how he was paralyzed. His mind immediately recalled a moment two weeks ago. For exercise, he wheeled himself down the street to the local park. He saw a group of boys and girls his age and a little older playing a baseball game from his vantage on a nearby path. He watched as they all played and laughed happily, using their legs to run as fast as they willed, as free as could be. He felt so left out, so weak and helpless. He was depressed because he couldn't play like a normal little boy. He felt, even at the age of 9, that the world was passing him by. And it all was because of a stupid wheelchair and a stupid disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind returned to reality when he heard his mother, his father, and his baby sister screaming his name. \"Oh, baby baby baby baby...\" repeated Matilda over and over, kissing her eldest baby and stroking his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" apologized the truck driver, \"he just flew in out of nowhere. Thank God I didn't hit him... don't think I could bare that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both,\" nodded Jack before he turned to his son, kneeling over his first born boy. \"Son, are you alright?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb looked at his parents, his mother crying, his father concerned. He also saw his sister looking teary eyed too behind his mother. \"Mom, Dad,\" he began...</span></div></div>",

Seeing her little boy so happy almost made Matilda cry with joy. \"Check it out!\" announced the boy. He let go of the railing and stood on his own two feet unaided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, son,\" beamed Jack as he, his wife, and the Doctor walked over to Kaleb. \"I'm so proud of you, son.\" He gave his son a hug whist he stood unaided.

He held onto the railing once more as he looked at the Doctor, \"Doc, do you think I can go home soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled at the boy kindly, \"Well, Kaleb, at the rate you're going you'll probably be able to go home in only a few weeks if not less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!

Kaleb had never been so happy in all his life. \"My love's too strong, Natasha,\" he whispered hoarsely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let tears fall down the side of his head. He didn't want to die. He hadn't planned for it. He was so young and there were so many things he always wanted to do. It didn't look good one way or another. Right now all he could feel was his head.

He was sitting up in bed and could move the upper half of his body again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel great, Natasha,\" said Kaleb brightly. She'd never seen him in such good spirits. He grinned at her. He thought she looked cute in her school uniform. Like every day, the two talked about their days. They talked about the future. Kaleb brightly shared his dreams about being an adventurer, climbing mountains, swimming in oceans, hiking great wildernesses, visiting places he'd only seen on TV or in books. Natasha could only watch the boy, his bright eyes so filled with life. This was why she loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in the hospital for a few more months.

The procedures and therapy was to continue, but Kaleb could go home for the first time in almost two years, just in time for Christmas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb's parents were completely overjoyed. He was glad to see them so happy. Matilda had had bags under her eyes before from crying so much. Jack had looked pale, almost zombie like. They were so much better now, color on their faces, smiles on their lips, and love in their eyes for their family and each other. It did Kaleb well to see them so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was overjoyed and surprised to see Kaleb at his house over Christmas break. He was a determined little guy, walking with the aid of a walker. At times he could even stand on his own two feet unaided. Natasha was simply overjoyed with the boy she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas,\" he whispered lovingly to her as they sat on the couch in Kaleb's living room. He gave her a small wrapped present. The earrings and necklace he'd given her were precious to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you,\" she said, hugging Kaleb tight on the couch and giving him a big kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Christmas, Kaleb went back to the hospital, to continue the therapy and treatments.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaleb could walk without a cane by February. Both he and Natasha thought it was a little strange just how quickly he'd gone from a meek, bedridden boy to a boy who could walk perfectly well. Kaleb and Natasha couldn't understand what more treatments there were. Kaleb could walk on his own now, but the treatments were booked until the end of May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb lived at home now and finally went back to school. He'd finally caught up with the rest of his grade and a lot of kids were happy to see him, surprised that he could walk. Kaleb was a bit sad a lot of the sports were over with. He wanted to join basketball and football. A lot of the kids who didn't know him laughed, making fun of Kaleb's size. Kaleb was about a foot shorter than Natasha and looked like he was 11 and so they laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha and Kaleb's other friends held by him, though. The 14 year old was happy for his friends and the confidence they gave him. Kaleb joined track, hoping his thin build would help him compete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, he still reported to the hospital every weekday for an injection. He had no idea what the stuff they were giving him was but he did begin to notice something strange happen to him. He was growing. In February, he was a foot shorter than Natasha, in March, he was 7 inches shorter, in April, he was only 2 inches shorter than her, and at the beginning of May he was 3 inches taller! The treatments ended at the end of May. Kaleb had grown quite tall, standing 8 inches taller than Natasha. He was Jack's height and Kaleb couldn't believe it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time he'd grown visibly older. It was as if he'd grown three years older in just 5 months. He seemed to have finally entered puberty. His voice broke in April and he grew a bit muscular, thanks in part to track. He didn't need to doubt himself any longer when track started. He found himself becoming a much better runner as the season wore on. He began only barely keeping up and ended up the season winning more than loosing. All the kids who had doubted him and made fun of him were now awestruck, unable to believe that he'd proved them all wrong. His friends couldn't believe it either, Kaleb was once this tiny boy in a wheelchair and now he was a track star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all his friends, Natasha too, were pleased that Kaleb never let it go to his head. He was the same funny, smart, caring, kind hearted friend they all knew and loved. Natasha was especially happy for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the Friday night of the end of the school year, Kaleb took his girlfriend out. They went to the movie theater they'd frequented since Kaleb started walking. Early on, mean kids laughed at Kaleb for being too little for Natasha. Nowadays, most people didn't mess with the tall kid and his hot girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kaleb and Natasha watched the movie, hand in hand, Natasha in Kaleb's embrace, Kaleb couldn't help but reflect on what had happened this past school year. He wondered if it was right, the medical procedures that had turned him from a paralyzed statistic to a high school track star heartthrob. Was it part of something strange and very dangerous the government was doing? Kaleb wondered if he'd look into it or just go on with his life, happier for what had happened.</span></div></div>",

He wondered momentarily why he'd smoked the whole thing. He was crying. \"I'm never gonna smoke as long as I live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you said that, Kaleb,\" said Heather sweetly, \"Adam just said something just like that before I called, didn't you, Adam?\" Kaleb imagined Heather giving Adam a sharp, piercing look of conviction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a sniff and Adam say, \"Mmm-hmm,\" in a small, sad, defeated voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather sighed, \"What am I going to do with you boys!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather, I promise I'll never do something stupid like that ever again,\" said Kaleb, sniffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was quiet on the other side of the line, only Adam's faint sniffing and sobbing was heard. \"Okay, Adam and Kaleb, I can see and hear how sorry you two are for making such a stupid mistake. I forgive you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then can you two come over tomorrow to hang out?\" asked Kaleb as he sniffed once more, trying to feel better. It happened to be a Friday. Saturdays the three friends would go over to one of their houses to play video games or hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Kaleb, if your mom doesn't ground you for what you did,\" said Heather, \"Adam'll come over too if his mom doesn't ground him either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Adam in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys,\" said Kaleb, smiling as a stray tear left his eye. \"and Heather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Kaleb?\" asked Heather on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Kaleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for my best friend, Kaleb,\" said Heather. \"Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" said Kaleb as he hung up the phone. He put the mobile phone down in front of him on the surface of his bed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A knock came on Kaleb's door. The 10-year-old looked up from his position curled up in a ball. \"Who is it?\" he asked as he sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened without an answer and Kaleb knew who it was before the person entered. In stepped Micky and Max, Kaleb's little brothers. They were a little less than a year younger than Kaleb, 9 years old now. The three boys were so close in age it would be easy to mistake them for triplets. Kaleb was only about an inch taller than his brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaleb, how come you're crying?\" asked Max, concern in both his and his brother's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, big brother?\" asked Micky. When the twins were younger, they'd hold hands constantly, never letting go of their identical twin. These days they only held hands from time-to-time, but rarely were they seen apart from each other. Kaleb and the younger two didn't interact much. They didn't hate each other, but they weren't too close either. Mostly they kept to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins sat down on either side of Kaleb, a friendly smile on their faces. Kaleb let tears flow from his eyes some more. \"Let's just say I did something really stupid, okay? I didn't think when I did it and it hurt my friend's feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smoked a cigarette, huh bro?\" said Max cleverly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb gasped, \"How did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, bro, we're not as dumb as we look,\" said Micky, \"we can smell it still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some tough 6th graders made me smoke it,\" said Kaleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it Bert and Thomas?\" asked Micky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you know it was them?\" asked Kaleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one they pick on, big bro,\" said Max, \"and how could we forget Thomas, the boy who almost killed our own big brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know that,\" said Kaleb. He looked from Max to Micky. He'd misjudged his brothers before. They both were nearly as big as he was, nearly as grown up. They weren't the babies he'd thought them to be in the back of his head by any means and if they weren't his brothers, they'd probably even be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you lose your friends 'cus of that, Kaleb?\" asked Max caringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. Heather forgives me 'cus I promised her never to smoke again and Adam promised her the same thing,\" said Kaleb as he sniffed again, \"I guess I'm crying 'cus I almost lost my friends for being so stupid... You probably think I'm a big crybaby for crying, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a human thing to do,\" said Micky sagely, \"don't worry 'bout it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you do look like you need a hug, bro,\" said Max caringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb smiled slightly and nodded. Max and Micky hugged their big brother and Kaleb put his arms around his younger twin brothers. \"Why are you being so nice to me? I don't think I've ever gone out of my way to even talk to you... I'm a terrible brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still our big brother, Kaleb,\" said Micky, \"we're family, and a family's supposed to love each other no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb could hardly believe how golden hearted his brothers were. \"Thank you, Max and Micky, I needed a hug,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna be alright?\" asked Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be fine,\" said Kaleb. Max and Micky squeezed their brother in a loving hug one last time before getting up off Kaleb's bed to leave. Kaleb felt bad, here he'd treated his brothers frostily, barely noticing them, and the twins cared about him so much. He realized he didn't have to treat them that way. If Kaleb wanted to, he could be friends with his little brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of having his brothers hang out with him seemed to appeal more to Kaleb the more he thought about it. Bert and Thomas would be back, no doubt. They harassed not only Kaleb, but Micky and Max too, not to mention Heather and Adam. Kaleb realize he'd be better off having his brothers around. The twins were practically the same size as Kaleb and Kaleb was sure Adam and Heather would appreciate three Kaleb-sized boys guarding their backs rather than just one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Max and Micky,\" called Kaleb as the 9-year-old twins were about to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, big brother?\" asked Max as he and his twin looked attentively at their brother, wondering what he'd say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather and Adam are coming over tomorrow. You guys can hang out with us if you want,\" said Kaleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, big brother?\" asked Micky, \"You don't mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really haven't been too nice to you guys. Don't you think it's time we had more fun together?\" asked Kaleb, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, big brother,\" said Max, \"that's an awesome idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'd love to hang out!\" nodded Micky. The twins gave their brother a thankful hug before racing out of Kaleb's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaleb beamed to himself. He recalled Heather once mentioning that Kaleb should spend more time with his less-than-a-year-younger little brothers and that she really didn't have a problem playing with them, being hardly any younger at all. Kaleb felt like he was turning over a new leaf. He knew Heather would be pleased to see that.</span></div></div>",
