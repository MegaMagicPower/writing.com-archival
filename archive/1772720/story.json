You had short black hair and a small goatee along with green eyes and a small scar near your chin from a bad knife fight you had during one of your older jobs. You were an undercover cop in Chicago, Illinois, one of the best there were. In your 12 years on the force no one had busted up more criminal operations than you, with your closet rival only averaging about half as much. You also had a habit of messing with the criminals you tangle with, often leading to a gun or fist fight.  You looked out as the vast sprawling desert under the endless blue sky above as you headed towards California. You had a new job, one that required you to travel almost halfway across the country to Los Angeles. There was a big name player named Jackie Enzolez, who had been building quite a reputation for himself in the underground.  Your task was to get inside his circle and put a stop to it before any more bodies were found like his last batch of victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour time working with some of the worst scum of the earth had left you hardened, but this guy made your skin crawl. You had thought you'd seen it all... but in truth you were just beginning to step into the big leagues. \"I should get there by nightfall, this guy moves quick and doesn't stay in one place for too long, I'll have to join up with his group by tomorrow or the whole gang might get away again.\" You say as you roll down the window of your orange 2009 Dodge Challenger R/T.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.caranddriver.com/images/09q4/302114/2009-dodge-challenger-r-t-photo-302126-s-1280x782.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.caranddriver.com/images/09q...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to put these guys out of business, too many people have already gotten hurt. This needs to end. Now.\" The sun slowly begins to dip over a few hills off in the distance when the city of LA starts to come into view.

It stood about 7 feet tall and overlooked a sign advertising a specialty strip club. \"The Pink Kitten, huh?\" You said under your breath as you parked on the edge of the sidewalk and got out. \"A place like this probably draws a pretty good amount of low lifes from all around the city, I suppose its as good a place to start as any.\" You made sure your gun was tucked safely out of sight and walked up to a large bouncer standing in the violet hallway leading to the showroom. \"Hold up there pal, I don't think I've seen you around here before. If you don't have a club membership it'll cost you $100 to get inside, trust me though... its well worth it.\" The bouncer said with a smile as he held out one of his muscular hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't wanna pay just to check this place out, but walking back outside right after coming in might draw unwanted attention. \"Sure thing, here you go sir.\" You reply as you pull a couple of bills from your wallet and hand them to the man. \"Alright, step in and enjoy. Don't forget to tip.\" The big man said as he stepped aside and let you past. The inside of this place was decorated with tons of flashing lights in an otherwise darkened room and several woman in bikinis were serving drinks and dancing. Most of them had bunny or cat ear headbands and tails attached to their outfits, but some had full-body costumes featuring other animals.  Even the patrons were wearing their own fursuits.  The whole place really wasn't to your tastes, but you were sure you could find something here...</span></div></div>",

Jack Daniels.\" You say as you pull out your wallet and put a couple of ten dollar bills on the counter. \"Right away sir, thank you for the tip! We're super busy today!\" The girl replied happily as she walked over to get a bottle form the shelf. While she was busy you turned to look back at the old guy she had just served. He seemed somewhat out of place in a joint like this with his gray suit and fedora... maybe he'd have a lead or two. Just as you are about to turn and engage him in conversation he polishes off his drink and gets up to leave while the waitress places your drink in front of you. Both of them are too busy to wait around for you to get done talking with the other...guess you'll have to make a quick choice on who to question.</span></div></div>",

If this wasn't for me what did you set it down on the table for? You already paid for your drink.\" She says with a somewhat confused look on her face. \"This is a tip for you, but I'll need a bit more service first.\" You reply with a sly grin. The woman smiles and without taking her hand off the bill puts her wrist on her hip and raises an eyebrow. \"I can take my top off for ya, but it'll cost a bit more than that honey...\" She smirks as she leans in closer to show off her boobs to you. \"No thanks. I need some info if thats okay... see I'm looking for someone and I'm short on leads at the moment...\" You fill her in on as much the department would let you disclose and wait for her to answer. After a few moments of thinking she decides to give you an offer. \"Okay hun, I think I might be able to help you out there... but it'll run you $50 for that kind of information.\" You'll be pretty much broke if you hand over the cash, but you've already spent so much money to get this far...</span></div></div>",

Now take this, finish your drink, and get the hell out before someone notices us talking this long.\" With that she reaches down into her cleavage and removes a small fold of paper she was keeping inside her bra. \"Follow the instructions written on here, I've gotta go take the next order.\" She whispers as she moves over to a man in a tank top who just sat down on a stool near the edge of the counter. You finish your drink in a single large gulp, stuff the note in your pocket and head back out the door. \"Leaving so soon? Must not have had much cash on ya then...\" The bouncer says as he accepts a roll of cash from a guy who looked like a loan shark. \"Nah, they cleaned me out...\" You call back as you head for your car.

Once you make sure the coast is clear you get out of your car and carefully walk through the untrimed lawn up to the front door.

You were hoping that the price might have been cheaper, but at least you can afford the 5 minutes.

Good money, but if that isn't your thing they have plenty of commodities on tap that aren't widely available to the common man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" you inquire as you blow a ring of smoke through the air.

I haven't been in town very  long and honestly wasn't much before winning my fortune. As for skills, I've served as a Navy SEAL for several years, so I'm a good shot and can handle myself in a fight.  I was also a pretty good driver, even before I joined the service. I've got a few other skills, though I'd say luck is my greatest asset at the moment, what with the jackpot and all. I'm not afraid of hard work or getting physical if I need to... that's about all there is to say really.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nods his head and takes a puff off his freshly lit cigar. \"I see... not a bad resume, we can always use competent workers, especially ones who can protect our merchandise and drive well.

Apparently his little club is going to smuggle some important packages over state lines and plans on using a street race as a distraction to keep the cops away. Not a bad idea in all honesty. Once the man finishes the proposition he makes it clear that the risks were pretty high and could include jail time and some heat from rival groups. If you accepted the mission you'd become a full member of their organization. If not, no hard feelings... you could walk so long as you don't interfere with their plans.

Your legs felt almost like jelly from walking so long, yet you kept pressing forward as you suppress a yawn. Your imagination dreamed up a luxury hotel with soft warm beds, room service and a nice hot meal just around the next corner. You were so tired you had almost forgotten how hungry you were... almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to float off into dreamland you hear the familiar rumble of a car engine down the nearby street. You felt like you should keep moving until you at least reached a better neighborhood, but the allure of a good sports car had always been too great for you to resist and this one sounded like a real beauty. Most of the vehicles you had driven before in your life were rustbuckets, but you could tell this machine was a top notch performer judging by the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slipping down a short alley you come to a big intersection with over a dozen top of the line cars, ranging from old school muscle cars to high-end exotic sports cars, formed into a small circle of sorts. Everything from the paintjobs to the windows and even the rims screamed quality. You almost didn't even notice the small crowd of people standing around the cars, chatting about past exploits and won races. You pulled down your hoodie and walked up to get a better look. You were still exhausted and starving, but the night seemed to finally be looking up...</span></div></div>",

Your father was a billionaire bank CEO and investment tycoon, while your mother was a renowned fashion designer.  They were often away on business and you only saw them rarely, leaving you home alone most of the time.  You longed for a chance find some excitement in your life and wanted to live by your own rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lounging around your family's beachfront estate late one evening.  Your parents were out of town, leaving you at home by yourself.  Bored and with little else to do, you eventually decided to take an evening cruise around Miami.  You went to your bedroom and changed into a navy blue dress shirt, a pair of black dress pants and a pair of brown dress shoes.  You walked out to your Ferrari, slid behind the wheel and drove out the mansions front drive and onto the streets of Miami.

You slip him a hundred dollar bill and he smiles as he opens the door for you. \"Go right ahead kid, the bar's in back and the VIP lounge is on the top floor, talk to the bartender if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a nod as you disappear down the narrow hallway that curved around into the main room. You couldn't even see the dance floor and the music and lights were already hitting you pretty hard. \"Sounds like this'll be my kind of place.\" you muse as you pass a woman in a miniskirt with glowstick armbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance floor unfolds in front of you as a DJ off to the side kicks out a fresh jam. In the back past a crowd of dancing couples you could see a large bar lit up with a back shelf well-stocked with an assortment of bottles big, small and everything in between. Finally, on either side of the dance floor were glowing tables under glowing florescent lights. What do you do?  </span></div></div>",

Can you give me the details?\" The bartender nods as he scoops up his pay and heads over to prepare your drink. \"Right away sir, one moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later he hands you your cocktail and a small piece of black paper with a golden border. \"Normally, we only extend invites to regular customers, but you seem like the right type of company for our club so here's one on the house.
