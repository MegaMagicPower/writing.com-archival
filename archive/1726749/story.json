Run away, and never return.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis uncle\u2019s bizarrely sympathetic words rang through his head, as Simba ran through the dusty gorge. His breathing was short and frantic, peppered with sobs as further tears leaked out of his brownish-red eyes. He wanted to just curl up into a ball and weep, or return to his father and sink into the surely still-warm pelt. But he couldn\u2019t. Not when it was his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe daren\u2019t go back to Pride Rock. Uncle Scar was right; what would his mother think? Possibly, she would comfort him and hold him close, but before long she would find out. She would never give him that warm, gentle smile again. It would morph into a look of harrowing disappointment and shame, mingled with the grief of losing her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dad\u2026I\u2019m sorry</i>. He didn\u2019t know where the time to think came from, as he pressed his aching, sorrowful body into running, but he had to keep going. This was his punishment. If only he hadn\u2019t tried to roar at that lizard, or if he had run to the side of the wildebeest instead of attempting to outrun them\u2026he\u2019d still be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, he\u2019d still be alive\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw his father again, falling with an awful roar of terror and flailing his legs, trying to latch onto something, anything, but soon vanishing into the stampede. It nearly ripped Simba apart, but he had to keep going. He could now hear snarls from behind, and they were growing steadily louder. Fear began to set in, alongside the shock of what had happened to his father, which in itself was ebbing away to the grief. He would never hear his father\u2019s voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would never spend evenings playing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would never see the look of pride on his father\u2019s face, as he pounced on Zazu, accompanied by that booming laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, most importantly, he would never be able to tell him just how much he meant to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust cleared momentarily, Simba could see that he had run out of gorge, and a flat wall of rock was in front. Eyes wide, he turned around. The three hyenas from the elephant graveyard had followed him. Maybe they were going to make him pay for what had happened then? Or maybe the Great Kings had seen what he had done to one of their own. This was their retribution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing their slobbering fangs and eyes set on murderous intent, the terrified cub looked back at the rocks, but saw no means of escape. This was it. All manner of fluids streaming down his face, Simba lay down on the ground, and curled up into a ball of golden fur. He shook with every raking sob, as he braced for the end which he knew was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019ll be with you again soon, Dad. If you still want to see me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before long, he realised something was up. No claws ripped into his hide; no teeth snapped his bones to pieces; not a single drop of his blood was spilt. The growls that had accompanied the hyenas\u2019 arrival fell silent. Confused, Simba lifted his heavy head out of his protective ball, and looked around. He wasn\u2019t sure, given that he could neither think nor see straight, but it seemed as though the hyenas</span></div></div>",

They get into an argument about who is right and who's wrong, and while Kiara stays grown up about it, Simba starts to act childish about it. Kiara thinks that he's acting childish about this and wishes he would act the proper age he is supposed to, at the same time Simba is thinking how great it would be to be a cub again and not have to worry about his duties and raising a child, just letting his parents run things. Little did they know that they would both get thier wish. The great kings of the past had heard their thoughts and decided with Mufasa's approval of course, that they would make Simba Kiara's cub for a little while and only Simba is aware of what was going on (Everyone else seems to think he's Kiara's cub). This was to teach Simba a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Simba's pov)<br>\r\nSimba woke up with a start for he was in some place dark, warm and wet. For a moment he thought must have sleepwalked to the water hole. Then he feels some thing push against him, it felt like flesh. For some reason he felt small and couldn't under stand why. then every thing around him gets tight and it feels as if he was being swallowed or something. Then all of the sudden his eyes shut tight  for he was greeted by a bright light. He then hears a female voice say, \"The second cub is out Kiara it's a boy. Keep pushing dear, your doing great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like his mate Nala. But right now he couldn't tell since his eye's didn't seem to want to open. He then hears someone screaming and it sounds like Kiara. Was she having her cub? Why was it so bright that he couldn't he open his eyes? And why did they say the second cub is out? Sounded like he just lost his bet with Kiara. Soon the screaming has stopped and all of the sudden Simba feels some one grab the back of his neck and lift him off the ground. That's when it seemed to be really weird, how can someone pick him up. He was larger than anyone in the pride (muscle wise). He then feels himself being set down and something wrap around him and bump into him. \"Congratulations on your three cubs Kiara,\" someone says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Vitani,\" Kiara says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba finally has enough strength to open his eye's and Kiara says, \"Look this one is opening his eyes. He looks like... Daddy.\" She had said it with a sad tone for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only wish he were here to see his grandchildren,\" Nala says with a sad tone as well and everyone was silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was right there, and somehow he was Kiara's cub. \"He is here Mom, in our hearts and we should not sulk around in his passing. He would want us to stay strong. I see my cubs as a blessing Mom, and I am very grateful that one resembles my father,\" Kiara says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are your father's daughter Kiara,\" Nala says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba simles and looks over to see two other cubs opening their eyes as well and everyone looks at the three of them. Simba tries to say he is Simba, but all that comes out is a baby mewl. He realizes that he is not gonna be able to say anything to any one here, even though he is fully aware of his situation. \"Sounds like these three are hungry. Come here little ones, time for some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kiara guides Simba and the other two cubs to her nipples which were ready with milk so they could nurse.</span></div></div>",

It was so intense that he couldn't make a sound, couldn't move, except to curl himself into a ball as he cried out in silent torture, though fortunately that ended in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi grinned widely as he raced after her quarry, the prince. Probably the king now actually, she supposed, if only momentarily. She paused a moment to sniff the trail, yep, the little brat had definitely gone this way, and fortunately for her, there wasn't a way out ahead, it was a dead end, dead in more ways than one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, they'd reached the end, and their prize... Except for the fact that there wasn't a prize, no lion cub to do away with, but instead, she found, dozing fitfully, a hyena pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-\" Banzai began, but Shenzi shushed him, then investigated.

Now admittedly, terror was a natural reaction when a pup was facing an adult it didn't know, but this was different somehow. Maybe it was something in the eyes that gave it away, but whatever it was she suddenly realised what had happened, crazy as it sounded, crazy as it <i>was</i>, this was Simba, no longer a lion cub, but somehow now a hyena pup. <i>And a cute one too</i>, she suddenly thought, then wondered why she had; it wasn't like she could just take him in out of the blue was it? Or could she? Sure it'd be unusual in the extreme, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shenz', what's going on?\" called out Banzai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi was silent a few moments, still undecided as to what to do next.

Further, it appeared there were images on the rocks - a lion, like him, at first, then over time growing rounder. A second group of rocks showed a herd of wildebeests growing larger over time, and a third showed Pride Rock becoming an oasis. Another, smaller rock in the center just had a lion's pawprint. Interested, Simba placed his own paw on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled it away when the rock began to glow, but he'd touched it long enough for the glowing to spread to his paw.

The king with a good enough heart, of which there are very few, can follow it! You have brought an age of great joy to your home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was ecstatic to hear his simple action had guaranteed success for his generation and the next few to come, but still found himself with a question. \"What about the growing lion?\", he asked. \"The stones showed a lion growing larger and wider.

Rafiki laughed and clapped, as from his perspective, the lion absolutely transformed into another being entirely.

The young lion was little more than an adolescent, scrawny and inexperienced in the art of hunting and ruling.  Mufasa had just begun to observe his father rule when the good king had died suddenly and without any sign of malaise which usually preceded death.  The surgeon-priest Rafiki hitherto had not diagnosed any problems with the older lion's health.  \"Everything looks acceptable.  Perhaps the ancestors were angry with him for some wicked decision he has made.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mufasa found that explanation horribly lacking.  This sort of death was not unheard of, and it happened to both the just and the unjust.  Perhaps it was just some law of the savanna that this should happen.  But Mufasa didn't want to start a fight with Rafiki over something that both were merely speculating about, so he kept quiet and nodded along as Rafiki gave his explanation to the assembled entourage of guests, who gasped at the cause of the old king's death.  Sarabi, Mufasa's mate, turned to him and whispered, \"Is Rafiki insane?  We really ought to get rid of him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mufasa pondered for a moment before he spoke aloud, loud enough for everyone to hear, in a shaky, nasally, adolescent way with voice-cracks and all, \"Rafiki, I ask you--for I do not claim that you are wrong yet--but I ask you: what wrongdoing has my father committed that caused the ancestors to be angry?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rafiki had stopped, looked up, and addressed Mufasa, \"Your majesty, if you please, I was getting to that.  But as I was saying, we do not know what evil the good king has committed that our next sovereign, King Mufasa, must contend with; but I do know that there is some evil we must fight.  Therefore, your majesty, you must call a council of all your subjects, a delegation of every beast in this land to Pride Rock to hear their grievances against the pride of lions.  So do I advise his highness King Mufasa to ordain.\"  And here, Rafiki took a less formal tone, \"Speaking of ordaining, your majesty, we must anoint you as king of the savanna.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mufasa nodded nervously and stepped forward, but Rafiki moved to dismiss all the other animals from the crypt of pride rock before he would ordain Mufasa king.  But Mufasa called Rafiki to stop, \"Rafiki, please, let them stay, let them see their king anointed in all his splendor.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Rafiki protested, \"Your majesty, with all respect, this process is sacrosanct.  We can't have these other animals looking at us while I anoint you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Mufasa stood firm: \"Rafiki, if you refuse my command, I will ask you to step down and let someone else take your place.\"  Here Rafiki balked between obeying the king's orders and respecting the will of the ancestors, but eventually he obeyed the crowned prince, \"As you like it, majesty.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thus Rafiki, having all the necessary ingredients for the ceremony, called Mufasa to a raised bed of rock that served as a platform for all to see.  \"King Mufasa,\" Rafiki began, \"you must honestly swear to all of the following things: do you swear to uphold the good of the kingdom?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you swear to obey the will of the ancestors?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And so went a litany of vows that Mufasa made before a mixture of what appeared to be the blood of his father and various herbs mixed into a paste was imprinted upon his forehead.  The gathered multitude of animals cheered, but before they had left, Mufasa turned to them: \"My subjects, in seven nights after tonight, counting tonight, we shall have a great council for as long as need be until I should hear all of your grievances.  Tell all the members of each of your races and any races not represented here today that there will be such a meeting.  Gather all of your grievances and send a delegation of the finest of your races to come to me and submit them; and I will do all that is reasonable to correct them.\"  Thus Mufasa decreed and all the animals present heard him and obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The arrangements necessary for the great assembly overwhelmed Mufasa immediately.  There was resistance form Taka, Mufasa's brother, who claimed that the animals would all demand that the lions stop hunting them but that no other grievance would or even could be aired.  Sarabi immediately protested that to call an assembly such as Mufasa had done was a sign of disunity and a lack of prosperity, which would cause scandal and attract rogues.  \"Perhaps if you would help me arrange and stop complaining,\" Mufasa spat at his mate, \"we wouldn't appear to be in such a mess.\"  And Mufasa only ignored Taka, who liked to criticize without proposing solutions to fix problems that arose, in other words, he like to whine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mufasa slept little in the days leading up to the assembly because he was restless and nervous about the assembly.  He was young and inexperienced; and despite his advisers Zazu and Rafiki, he would have to speak and moderate extensively in debates and prevent misunderstanding between the lions' faction and the other animals.  Sarabi was especially nervous and called secretly upon Rafiki a couple of days before the assembly to get a sleeping agent for her mate and to rub it into his food.  Rafiki at first balked, but seeing Sarabi's pleading glances decided that such a request would not be wisely denied.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And so it was done, and Mufasa never learned of it, but awoke in time for the first meeting of the assembly.</span></div></div>",

It took a while, but in the end, after a bit of exploring she found somewhere she was willing to lie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it wasn't perfect, the cool morning air caused her to shiver as she lay back, she hadn't realised until now how great an advantage another body or two was in preserving comfort. Still, she thought, it would only be temporary, soon enough Simba would be back, and then the cold wouldn't be so much of an issue.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nSimba growled to himself if frustration, where was that waterhole, surely he couldn't have forgotten where it was surely, he'd grown up in the jungle, he knew every paws-breath of it. The more he wandered however, the less certain he became of his own sense of direction, it had been many years since he'd been here after all, and his memory was prone these days to confusion. To further add to his troubles, most of his memories were of the jungle in as much sunlight as filtered through the canopy, whereas now he was moving in the long shadows of the very early dawn. Resolutely though, he carried on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed as Simba wandered on blindly, ever deeper into the jungle. By now he was taking frequent rests, almost a day of hard travelling had taken more from him than he'd first realised, and with the undulating, obstacle-strewn nature of the forest, his aches were beginning to play up badly. Eventually, the elderly lion was almost ready to give in and return to his mate when he sensed a clearing up ahead, and moved towards it, hoping that he'd finally find, if not the waterhole he'd been intending then at least somewhere to quench his thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clearing did indeed contain a waterhole, but not one Simba had ever seen before. The whole place seemed to have an odd, almost mystical feel to it, which put him slightly on edge. As he approached the waterhole, the feelings only grew, the almost perfect roundness of the waterhole, and the trickling of water out of a pipe in the opposite wall only adding to the strangeness. Still, he was thirst, and there was water, and so the elderly lion spent only a little time in examining the surroundings before moving slowly towards the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was cool and fresh, and somehow sweet, Simba though as he lapped at it, first tentatively, then thirstily. Yes, this was what he needed, he thought, he was dry, parched, and the water was filling the gaps, easing his aches and making him feel more full of life than he had in...a long time. After drinking his fill, he set off once again, this time in the opposite direction, at a brisker pace.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nNala snorted as the bug tried to work its way into he nose, blowing it out. This intrusion, combined with the unusually humid, clingy air of the jungle was enough to waken the elderly lioness, though that same humidity made her feel listless and tired. A slightly unsettling feeling motivated her to sit up, groaning at the stiffness that lying in a nest even as comfortable as this brought on. She pushed the thoughts to the side though as she scanned her surroundings...</span></div></div>",

Lets this will be youre answer!<br>\r\n- I told you you need to work on youre stealth<br>\r\n- I was but when i was close enought they suddenly got super speed and ran off.

We need to work on youre muscle mass so you can have enough energy to catch them. -</b> then he walked away to the deeper and colder parts of the cave picked up a gazzele which he caoght earlier, came back and threw it to Kiara <b>- Now eat that up. You need some mass so we can develop more.<br>\r\n- You want to train me?<br>\r\n- Yep, just like old times.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts been a month since Kovu trained Kiara. It was a hard times for Kiara. It started with a 10 mile jog around the pridelands, lifting up rocks, sit up's and push ups. Kiara looked at herslef in the reflection of watering place. She could finally notice muscles under her sandy fur. She had a body of an athelete. with visible six pack slabs on her stomach, broader arms, a noticble bulge came form her arm when she flexed, her breast even pupmped a bit, had wide and muscle toned legs still kept her houglass figure. Afther flexing a bit she frowned and looked down<br>\r\n<b>- I dont understand i feel myslef better and stronger, but i still cant keep up with cathing my pray.<br>\r\n- That is becouse now we start the second phase of training - said Kovu throwing this time 2 zebras beneath her feet.<br>\r\n- I thought you ate?<br>\r\n- I did this is for you<br>\r\n- What? Why that much?<br>\r\n- We need to increase the training and for that you need more food. Afther that we are emping up.<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nAnother month has passed. And Kiara noticed the changes while she incrase the training and eating. She noticed that afther the jog she felt like she could to another lap. From lifting rocks she started to lift boulders with ease. While doing the training she even noticed how her muscles grew and made stronger. She love to watch how her legs buldged with muscles, how the biceps were growing while lifting herelf up or the heavy boulders. She did grew more and more day afther day. She doulbled her weight and muscles mass in every correct direction. The result were amamzing Kiara started to finaly catch up to her pray. She usually caught up to triple amount of meat for her family. Kiara lived the high live. She was proud of her body, her achivments and the food, which she indulged as a way to celebrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day though while Kiara was eating, Kovu noticed something and said<br>\r\n<b>- Eating again?<br>\r\n- Well yeah i need to keep my body in peak shape and i catch up that antylope that was outrunning me. So it is a perfect opportunity to celebrate<br>\r\n- Better watch out or you loose it.

She still had her toned muscled arms and a the chest was perked but lower she noticed how her abs were gone replaced with a pudged muscle gut and a wide jigly butt with adipse fat starting to cover her muscled legs. When she saw that she said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1 -<b> I still look amazing! </b><br>\r\nShe keeps with her routine growing widder (muslce and weight gain)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2 - <b>This is Horrible!

She knew she should be heading down now, to find a place in the cave with the others, but for now she just wanted to be alone. It wasn't that she disliked the others, it was just that, well, having been her mother's so-caller right paw for so long she didn't really feel comfortable in large groups. It was times like that that got her to thinking, what if mother had been sane rather than crazy, and had seen the madness in her ideals, what would <i>growing up</i> in the Pridelands have been like? Her reverie was interrupted when she felt a brush against her side, and looked around to find Ki-<i>princess</i> Kiara sitting beside her, \"princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cut out the formalities Vitani,\" Kiara laughed, \"there are times I enjoy being a princess, and other where I wish with all my heart I wasn't, and this is one of those times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to be princess,\" Vitani asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't,\" Kiara replied, \"because you know what, it gets tiring, everyone being so respectful around you, trying not to hurt your feelings, you get the idea right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I can see how that would be tiring I suppose,\" Vitani replied, \"I guess I-hey, did you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what,\" Kiara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for a moment I thought I say a streak of light up there,\" Vitani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better make a wish then,\" Kiara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why,\" Vitani asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason I suppose,\" Kiara said, \"it's just something mother used to tell me when I was young, if you saw a streak, and made a wish, the wish would come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds...\" Vitani said, trying to think of a diplomatic word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, sounds daft,\" Kiara said, then stood up, \"you coming soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon,\" Vitani agreed. She heard Kiara leave, then shook her head at the though, whoever thought of wishing on a streak? Still though, she thought, it was silly things like that that it might have been nice to have once. Sighing again, she got up and descended the promontory, before making her way over to the cave and settling down near the entrance. With her mind still heavy with her earlier thoughts, sleep came slowly, but she did eventually nod off.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nVitani awoke early the next morning, feeling unsettled, something wasn't right, but she couldn't be sure quite what-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake early this morning Vitani,\" said a voice that was familiar, and yet not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Vitani saw herself looking up at a lioness that like the voice, was familiar, and yet different, \"yeah, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter dear,\" the lioness asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no, no,\" Vitani said, \"I'm just a bit tired still I guess.\"  Who was this lioness, she looked like-no, that was impossible-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure there's nothing wrong,\" Zira asked, and it <i>was</i> Zira she realised, Zira, her mother, but this wasn't the Outlands, this looked exactly like the sleeping cave at Pride Rock- Suddenly her thoughts were interrupted by...</span></div></div>",

Her eyes were moist, but she insisted to herself that she wasn't crying, crying was something done by cubs unable to control their emotions, and since she was an adult what she was doing wasn't crying, it was just, letting her tears flow. She was angry too of course, oh not at anyone in particular, not even at Simba for he was, she had to admit, entirely innocent in this affair, but just angry in General that he brother had been taken from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitani's eyes were drawn upwards suddenly when a streak of starlight blazed for a moment. A 'visiting king' Nuka had called it when he'd first told her about it back in the innocent days of her early cubhood. Of course, she hadn't really accepted it even then, their life had been too hard even then, and harsh living and harsher training at her mother's paws had long since worn away any pretensions of fantasy. Still, deep down in her soul, a tiny germ of hope sprang up, what if, maybe, this was the one time that things were different? She chuffed at that, no, no that would never happen, wishing on a 'visiting king' was a fantasy for cubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however, somehow, a wish was granted, and wishing was indeed a fantasy for cubs, only this time not in the way Vitani would have ever considered.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nVitani lay back looking out over the Pridelands, now her home. She was alone at the moment, and that suited her fine, for although she enjoyed company almost as much as any lioness, there were times when solace was welcome too. All was well now, she lived in perfect happiness, at least most of the time, though now she was taking the time to remember, remember her family departed and her life left behind. Not a day went by when she didn't think about them, but the memories were less distinct now, more distant, the Pridelands was working its way into her soul and mind, blunting the sharp edges of her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past wasn't quite finished with Vitani just yet though, for although she'd long since forgotten the wish she'd made on her last night in her old life, the wish had been granted. The effect of this had not yet begin to show, eclipsed by more rapid and for now larger changes that came with a much improved lifestyle, but those were slowing down now, while this one was only increasing, and eventually it would be unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moon in her new life, Vitani...</span></div></div>",

There seemed to be a weight in her gut as though she'd eaten a large meal, but constant, and indeed separate from anything in her stomach. At first she was content to hide it, but as time went by she became more and more concerned, and so knew she'd have to consult someone eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, who to talk to, She didn't want her former Outlander pridesisters to know lest they ridicule her, she didn't trust Kiara to keep her mouth shut about it, nor Kovu for that matter, and she didn't really feel confident enough around most of the former Pridelanders to try to ask delicate question, which finally left but one option, Queen Nala. Of course, catching the queen alone wasn't easy, but finally she managed it, or at least close enough, one day when they were dragging carcasses back to Pride Rock and she managed to end up on the same one as the queen. \"R'm, Qu'n N'ra,\" she said, her mouth full of zebra leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y's, V't'ni,\" Nala replied, her mouth clamped around the carcass's throat, its head having been turned over almost onto its back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'n I t'lk 't y'u 'ft'rw'rds, 'n pr'v't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala glanced back at Vitani, as noticed a certain nervousness, even trepidation to the young lioness, which she found slightly odd for she knew the younger lioness was usually quite confident, \"'f y'u w'nt.\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"So what's wrong,\" Nala asked Vitani when they seemed to be far enough away for the younger lioness's comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's this weight that's been growing in my belly for a while now,\" Vitani replied, \"it's, I don't know what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been to see Rafiki about it,\" Nala asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rafiki,\" Vitani asked, \"who's-wait, is that that, monkey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never-\" Nala began, then she thought about it, \"of course, you'd never have met him would you, well maybe it's time you did, come on.\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n\"Look, let's get one thing straight okay,\" Vitani said impatiently, \"I haven't <i>ever</i> mate with a male okay, not in my entire life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I am at a loss to explain your pregnancy,\" Rafiki replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant,\" Vitani asked, shocked, \"no I can't be, is, isn't there anything else it could be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one or two things perhaps,\" Rafiki replied, \"but they are much less likely and much <i>much</i> more serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it can't be,\" Vitani shook her head and turned to Nala, \"it can't be possible can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up until today I would have agreed with you,\" Nala replied, \"but the way you described it, well, I've been through it, and it sounded exactly like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've never mated,\" Vitani said, by now almost frantic, \"how can I be pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are not pregnant,\" Rafiki said gravely, \"whatever you have will kill you before the next moon is out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Vitani's expression of desperation segued into horror, and before either Nala could think to stop her, she was off and running, not even bothering to look back as the queen called, \"Vitani wait, Vitani.\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nAt first Vitani wasn't sure where she was going, and indeed only noticed her surroundings when she reached a cave-no, <i>the</i> cave, the one where she'd spent every night before betraying her mother. Finally free, she sat down, and for the first time in her life she wept, not out of sadness, but out of fear. Alone and terrified, she cried herself to sleep. Slumber brought little solace however, and she was soon awoken by...</span></div></div>",

Plus, Simba does not have the same relationship as Kion does with the rest of the Guard, which makes it harder for him to pretend to be Kion, since the Guard does not know that Simba switched bodies with Kion.<br>\r\nAs for Kion; he'll not only have to get used to being in the body of a fully grown-up lion, (his own father's body, nonetheless), that's at least four times as big as the body he is used to, he'll also have to get used to making important decisions that concerns all of The Pride Lands; something he has great difficulty doing, since he's just a cub and as such is inexperienced at that sort of thing.

This would certainly be an awkward and interesting experience for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose that Kion wouldn't be so comfortable with the swap. Mtoto is quite younger than Kion, for one thing.<br>\r\nFor another, although Mtoto's body is younger and smaller than Kion's, it's a lot heavier since he's an elephant, which means that Kion is no longer as agile as he is used to. Kion would also have to get used to Mtoto's large ears (along with their exeptional hearing), as well as his new flexible trunk; something that I imagine would be a challenge for the lion-turned-elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to think that Mtoto would be a lot more excited to be in Kion's body. Not only would he be in a body that's older and bigger than his own, but he would be able to be with Besthe all the time! Also, since Kion's body is a lot more agile than his own, he'd have a much easier time keeping up with Besthe.<br>\r\nOf course, he'd also have to get used to using the Roar of The Elders, not having a trunk anymore and being much lighter than normal, which could be a bit of a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways; how do they end up swapping bodies?</span></div></div>",

His father, Simba, had taken him to a strange watering hole in the middle of a cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out,\" answered Simba. \"Tell me, Kion; have you ever wanted to be an adult instead of a cub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes,\" said Kion. \"Mostly when Janja calls me 'lion cub' in that mocking way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sometimes I want to be a cub again,\" said Simba. \"To go back to being carefree and take a little break from being a king. Which makes this the perfect chance for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" said Kion, looking very confused. Simba chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rafiki once told me about certain places in the Pride Lands where there are mystical watering holes. He said, that if you drink from one of them, strange things will happen to you. You could turn into a different kind of animal, you could grow bigger than a giraffe is tall, or many other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! That is awesome!\" exclaimed Kion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Simba. \"And we are heading for one of them right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Kion and Simba entered a vast cavern with a glowing watering hole on one side. As Kion looked into the glowing water, Simba said: \"This particular watering hole is a bit different from the others. This one needs two animals to drink from it at the same time. But when they do, it exchanges their ages. They still have all of their memories and personality, but they will physically become the age that the other animal is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion looked up at his dad. \"So... If you and I were to drink from this hole at the same time, then I would be a fully grown lion and you would be a cub again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" said Simba. \"And that is why I brought you here: To give you the chance to be the adult for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing that Kion looked a bit nervous, Simba guessed what the problem was and quickly said: \"The effects are only temporary. We will return to normal after about three days. Does that comfort you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does. Thanks, dad!\" said the now perked-up Kion, as he moved to the edge of the watering hole, his dad walking up beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now; are you ready?\" asked Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!\" was Kion's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaniously, the two lions bent down and drank from the water. When they were done, they both felt a strange feeling spreading through their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion looked in awe as the changes began. He could see his dad slowly getting smaller. His mane began to retract into his skin, his muscles diminished and he started to shrink as the years slowly went in reverse for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kion watched his dad getting younger, he could feel himself getting older. He felt his own mane beginning to grow in, as he himself slowly grew, while muscles were added to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the years changing between them, it wasn't long until father and son were equal in age. But that didn't last long, as Kion continued to grow older, while Simba kept getting younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the changes stopped, Kion had become an adult lion, while Simba had become a cub again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hevi kabisa! I'm..... big.....\" Kion exclaimed in his new, deeper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it would be interesting,\" said the young Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an understatement,\" said Kion. It was strange for him to see his dad being a cub again, but it was even stranger to be an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they decide to do next?</span></div></div>",

Kion wanted to hang out with Jasiri mostly out of boredom as nothing drastic had been happening in the Pridelands recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he wanted to explore the area a little bit before meeting up her, fortunately he didn't meet up with any of the hostile inhabitants such as Janja's gang. As he walked around the barren wastelands, passing by various rock formations, gorges, and dried shrubbery, he came across a grim and dismal site. It was a graveyard valley of sorts filled with bones strewn about, mostly elephants, zebras and other kinds that are more prey than predator. It was a dead end, emphasis on dead, as the valley was closed with great big cliffs/rock walls all around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his eye caught something unusual about one section of that wall. It was actually a large pile of bones! Curiously, he walked towards it and looked up. It seemed to be climbable enough if he was careful and what is on the other side is anyone's guess which is also a reason for him to check it out. After the climb over, he discovered something rather interesting. It was a cave whose mouth looked to be around over 30ft in height, having two stalagmites and two stalactites act as fangs, and pitch black inside that even sunlight couldn't reveal more than a few feet within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt definitely proved to be intimidating for the lion cub and felt it necessary to have someone else accompany him with his findings with Jasiri being the closest one nearby. But still he was this far and want to at least take a quick look inside with how strong his curiosity was making him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?  </span></div></div>",

And the heat wave was the only threat that pervaded the Pridelands at the moment. Nothing the Lion Guard could do. In fact, the rest of the guard were off cooling down with their families and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the lion's den back at Pride Rock was cool and shady enough, Kion thought this little jungle like paradise was just as good and next to a water source to drink and swim in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his body was yearning for some rest and long nap as his eyelids felt heavy. Soon, he fell into a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until around ten minutes later that something unusual happened. His body glowed in a golden light and he began to shrink! Soon, he was the size of a grub with the world becoming much larger as blades of grass became as tall as trees. After a while, Kion tossed a bit before waking up, stretching and yawning as he got up. He slowly opened his eyes to discover his surroundings had drastically changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?!\" he said looking around in panic of the bigger world he was in. Then, he heard a familiar voice as it flew pass him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm late! I'm late! I'm terribly terribly late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zazu?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the red billed hornbill yet as small as he was and didn't seem to notice or care about. He kept repeating about being late but for what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion called out as he attempt to catch up with the bird before he dove into a meerkat hole at the base of a nearby tree. The lion cub followed suit into the hole before tumbling down into it. After getting up and shaking off some dirt, he found himself at the beginning of a tunnel. Zazu seemed to have went farther ahead into as he couldn't see him anymore down the passage yet could still hear his mantra of being late. After going down some ways, he encountered a three way fork in the road and decided which path to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way did he go?</span></div></div>",

After some time, the pathway began to shrink as the corridor became cramped with his mane nearly scrapping the ceiling. How darker it was complicated things further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I should head back and take a different way.' he thought to himself. However, before he could turn around, his next step made him tumble onto a slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA!\" he cried as he rode down with twists and turns around every corner. The ride took a few minutes before it dropped him into a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed onto his back after falling a couple feet off the ground. Kion got up and shook off some dirt before taking a look at his surroundings. The room was rather large, like the size of a fully grown tree, made up of clay colored rock like the lion's den but unnaturally near smooth and perfectly square. The floor was a gray slate, also smoothed out. The walls were adorned with some cave drawings of various animals, similar to the ones Rafiki makes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what caught his attention was a smooth flat round rock in the center of the room as tall as he was. On top were two half coconuts, like it was perfectly cut down the middle. As he approached them out of curiosity, he discovered the halves were filled with some kind of liquid, the left blue while the right red. His nose caught a fruity scent from them. What would they taste like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm late! I'm terribly terribly late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar voice broke him out of his thoughts as Zazu flew past him, now the size of a beetle, smaller than before. Now where did he come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wait!\" Kion called as he tried to pounce at him only to miss as the bird flew into a door the size of a mouse hole. A feint click was heard afterward, locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now what?' he thought to himself as he looked around the room, looking for a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked back to the coconuts again. He was getting a bit thirsty and maybe a drink might help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich coconut did he drink from?</span></div></div>",

However, Kion can choose whether the animals he uses this ability on can still control their own bodies, even when their heads is attached to someone elses body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo fx, Kion could remove Bunga's head from his honeybadger-body and attach it to Kion's own lion-body beside his own lion-head; then either let Bunga keep control of his own honeybadger-body, letting Bunga move his honeybadger-body even though it is now headless and having no influence on Kion's lion-body even though his honeybadger-head is attached to it; or remove Bunga's control over his honeybadger-body, leaving his honeybadger-body headless and immobile, and giving Bunga shared control of Kion's own lion-body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, Kion could also fx, choose to remove an elephants head from it's body, attach his own lion-head to the elephant-body and then choose to remove the elephants control over it's elephant-body and letting Kion himself keep control over his own lion-body, thus leaving the elephant as a disembodied head, and giving Kion control of two bodies at the same time; the massive elephant-body that his own tiny lion-head is now attached to, and his own tiny headless lion-body.<br>\r\nThis ability can be used even when Kion's own lion-head is not on his lion-body, so Kion could eventually end up controlling a small army of headless bodies, even if he should choose to re-attach his lion-head to his lion-body, until he decides to relinquish control of those bodies, fx by attaching their own heads, or others heads, back on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just because Kion can control multiple bodies like this, it does NOT mean that he is able to control all those bodies flawlessly right from the get-go. He will always, I repeat, ALWAYS have great difficulty controling/adapting to any new bodies he gets under his control.<br>\r\nUsing the above example to explain; it's like this: Kion's lion-head is attached to an elephant-body, so Kion now control the elephant-body, but at the same time, he still also has control over his old lion-body, even though it is now headless. He can feel both what his elephant-body feels and what his headless lion-body feels; however he is used to only having one body, and since he now has to control two, well, that's a difficult matter anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Kion is used to being on four legs, so if he head-swaps with fx an ostrich, he's naturally going to have much more difficulty getting used to walking on two legs instead of four.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How about this: In addition to the abilities from the previous chapter, Kion also gets the ability to grow copies of his own head on either himself and/or any animal whose body is headless or with heads on, courtesy of the abilities mentioned in the previous chapter? So, Kion could choose to fx give himself two more heads for a total of three, or he could choose to place copies of his lion-head on fx the headless bodies of Beshte and Ono, with their consent, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember; while Kion can copy his head any number of times, those extra heads won't have copies of Kion's mind inside them. Instead, it's Kion's own mind inside all the heads, meaning his one consiousness is inside all the lion-heads. So, fx, if Kion chooses to give himself two more heads, he will now look through three pairs of eyes at the same time, and since they are all on his own lion-body, it's going to be hard for him to get used to, having triple his normal field of vision.<br>\r\nAnd if, to use the above example, he places those lion-heads on Beshte's hippo-body and Ono's egret-body respectively, it's going to be even harder for Kion to get used to; because not only does he have to deal with looking in multiple directions at once, (looking through the eyes of both his normal lion-head on his regular lion-body, the lion-head on Beshte's hippo-body, and the lion-head on Ono's egret-body at the same time), but he also has to deal with controling those bodies that his new heads are attatched to, and with Kion's conciousness steering both his normal lion-body, Beshte's  big hippo-body and Ono little egret-body at the same time, well, that's hard for him to get used to right away.<br>\r\nPlus, Beshte's and Ono's bodies both have a different body-configuration than what Kion is used to, so that'll be tricky too. For example, Beshte's hippo-body is a lot bigger and bulkier than what Kion is used to, not to mention that a hippo walks and runs in a different way that a lion does, so Kion will have to get used to that too. As for Ono's egret-body, well, he is an egret. So not only will Kion have to get used to walking on two legs, in itself a challenge since he has walked on four legs his whole life, but he'll also have to get used to flying with Ono's egret-body, which will definitely be a challenge, since Kion is used to being on the ground all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, all of Kion's new lion-heads, always remain the same size as his regular lion-head, no matter what animal-body the new heads are placed on. So, to use the above example, again, the lion-head on Beshte's hippo-body will therefore look slightly too small on the hippo-body and the lion-head on Ono's egret-body will be a bit oversized on the egret-body, making the lion-head just a little heavy on the smaller egret-body and also making it harder for Kion to learn how to balance/fly with the size and weight of the lion-head slightly bigger/heavier than the optimal for the egret-body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally; all of Kion's lion-heads have the ability to use the Roar of The Elders, no matter which animal-body the lion-heads are on.</span></div></div>",

Only problem was, the answer came out of the same mouth that Kion had used! Kion could actually feel his -Jasiri's- mouth move and talk, whithout him being in control of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hebi kabisa,\" said Kion. \"That felt really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you think it is for me?\" asked Jasiri, again using her own mouth, (currently shared with Kion), to talk. \"I can hear my own voice talking and my own mouth moving, but I'm not in control of what they say. It's downright freaky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right about that,\" said Kion, still weirded out that his, no, Jasiri's, mouth had moved without him being in control, again. He then formed Jasiri's mouth into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the other paw,\" he said, \"this whole experience does give a new meaning to the expression 'talking to yourself', right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" chuckled Jasiri. \"By the way, how come my, or should I say our, body feels so darn heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had to guess,\" answered Kion, \"I'd say it's because we are both in the same body. Since there are two of us in one body, it's likely that we both control it simultaniously. So if one of us tries to move, without the other performing the same action, the body would feel a lot heavier. Of course that's only a wild guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a good guess,\" said Jasiri. \"We should see if it's the right one. Now, I'll move my left fore-leg and then you can try to move the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jasiri,\" said Kion. He did as she had said and lifted Jasiri's body's right fore-leg up. At the same time, he also felt her body's left fore-leg lifting up, indepentently of him. However, because both of Jasiri's fore-legs were lifted at the same time, Jasiri's body ended up falling on it's belly, causing both of the spirits in the body to feel the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant, we should move them seperately,\" complained Jasiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" said Kion, while trying to get Jasiri's body to stand up again. But he found that he couldn't, though it wasn't for a lack of trying. Everytime he tried to move one of Jasiri's legs, he could feel that leg move to another spot immediately, causing it to look like Jasiri's body had spasms. Apperently, Kion and Jasiri had different ideas of how to move Jasiri's body back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't working,\" said Kion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Jasiri. \"At least we now know that we really do have to move in synch with one another to move our...I mean MY... body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could have found out in a better way,\" said Kion. \"So, how do you suggest we get up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me think,\" said Jasiri. It didn't take long for her to come up with an idea. \"I've got it. I'll tell you how I'm going to move my body and then you just have to move it at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's worth a try,\" said Kion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasiri then told Kion exactly how she intended to move her body. Kion listened carefully to what she told him. When she was done, he prepared himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" asked Jasiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then. One... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Jasiri's count of 'three', Kion tried moving Jasiri's body in the exact same way as Jasiri did. Of course, she did move her body slow enough, so that Kion could more easily match her movements. But since this was a first for both of them, Kion didn't completely match Jasiri's movements, wich resulted in their shared body's legs moving quite wobbly. Nevertheless, they still managed to get Jasiri's body standing up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we did it!\" exclaimed Kion, still using Jasiri's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but just barely,\" said Jasiri, using the same mouth. \"You know what, Kion? I think we'd better learn how to properly move around like this, if we should decide to try it some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's a good point you have there, Jasiri,\" replied Kion. \"I guess we had better start the training right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, but no sweat,\" said Jasiri. \"We'll get the hang of this in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as always, that was easier said than done. If any animal would have come by at that moment, they would have seen an odd sight; a female hyena pup, with a look of great concentration on her face, walking almost in slowmotion, on VERY wobbely legs. Of course, none of those animals would ever have known that there was really two souls inside the hyena pup's body; her own soul and the soul of her best friend, a male lion cub. Likewise, they wouldn't have known that both the hyena pup and the lion cub were both in control of the hyena pup's body at the same time, nor that they were trying to move in perfect synch within the body, so they could walk normally without it looking strange. Neither would they have known, that since a hyena pup would naturally move in a different way to a lion cub, the cub in the pup's body would have great difficulty moving in the exact same way as his current body-mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Kion had trouble adjusting to how Jasiri would move, since he was used to being in his own body; and while he had possessed Jasiri's body before, at that time he had been in complete control of it. And even then, he had still walked like he would have walked in his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErgo; even though Jasiri was moving her body as slowly as possible to give Kion the best chance to adjust, Kion still couldn't quite get it right. Sometimes he would move their shared body's legs faster than intended, causing Jasiri's body to do an awkward jump forwards. Other times he would place Jasiri's body's down on the ground slower than she did, resulting in her body giving an odd jerk. And the whole thing culminated in an incident, where Kion somehow got one of Jasiri's paws to step on a loose rock, then moving the leg a little too fast, resulting in a trip and sent the two-minds-in-one-body flat on their stomach, their legs sprawled out on either side of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man,\" groaned Kion. \"Who would have thought it would be this hard to be sharing one body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no one said it would be easy to be two animals in the same body,\" retorted Jasiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, but still...\" said Kion, as he and Jasiri got their body standing again. \"I mean, we can barely even walk like this; what if Janja or someone else were to come by? Then we wouldn't be able to fight them off. We are close to their teritory, after all. Perhaps it's best if we try this two-in-one thing somewhere we know that Janja can't get to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet another good point,\" said Jasiri. \"I think we'd better wait until we are back at the Pride Lands befor we try this again. At this rate, it'll take us forever to learn. And we would be very vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we had better go back to normal and fast,\" said Kion. But just as he prepared to de-possess Jasiri, an interesting thought came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jasiri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking; when I gave you this abillity, I ended up still possessing your body and you just re-possessed it while I was still inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I can possess your body and leave you as a spirit, maybe you could possess my body and leave me as a spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you getting at, Kion?\" asked an interested Jasiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you try de-possessing your body first, then when I leave it, maybe your body will still be there, but lifeless since no one would control it. Then, I will make myself solid again and then you could try to possess my body. Then when we both have control of my body, we could de-possess it like with yours, only this time I would go first and then you. If it works, then we can not only have gained the abillity to just remove our spirits from our bodies, instead of turning our entire body ghostly to possess someone, but we could also possess each others bodies! You can be me, while I can be you! We can both be each other simultaniously!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" exclamed Jasiri exited. \"That would be interesting! What are we waiting for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe de-possessed her own body right away, leaving Kion as the sole occupant of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Kion! Hurry!\" she called to her own body, which still had Kion inside. \"I want to try being you as soon as possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming now, Jasiri!\" answered Kion with Jasiri's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Jasiri's soul watched her body, currently inhabited by Kion, Kion himself was getting ready to de-possess Jasiri's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion focused on the familiar feeling of leaving someones body. In no time at all, he was back in his spirit form, right in front of Jasiri's spirit form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" he managed to say to Jasiri, before they heard a thud coming from behind him. They both turned to see what had made that noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, it was Jasiri's body that had made the thud. Kion had been right; without a soul inside the body, it just fell down on the ground, lifeless, although a closer look revealed the body to still be breathing. It was just not possible for it to do anything else, unless a spirit were to possess it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it worked!\" exclaimed Jasiri. \"My spirit is now seperated from my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, it worked,' thought Kion. 'Thank the Great Kings of The Past for that. I wasn't sure if it would really work, but it did.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasiri and Kion went over to look closer at Jasiri's unmoving body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really bizarre,\" said Jasiri, as she walked around her lifeless body to look at it from all sides. \"It's almost like my body is sleeping. But I know this is no dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, but you might soon fulfil one,\" said Kion, as he made himself solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Jasiri, walking closer to Kion. \"This will be fun!\" Her spirit form then walked right into Kion's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jasiri entered his body, Kion felt the same thing he felt while in Jasiri's body; he was still in control of his body, but his body now felt much heavier, as he had to share that control with Jasiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the first part over with,\" said Kion's mouth, but it wasn't Kion that had said it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf his body hadn't felt so heavy, Kion would have jumped ten feet in the air. Sure, he had already experienced this while he was in Jasiri's body, but hearing his own voice coming out of his own mouth was quite disconcerting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hebi kabisa! You scared me, Jasiri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you know what I felt when it happened to me,\" said Jasiri, using Kion's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you were right; this DOES feel freaky!\" exclaimed Kion. He then snapped himself out of the freaky feeling and said: \"But let's let go of that for now. We have an experiment to perform!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion then tried to de-possess his own body. When he felt the familiar leaving-a-body feeling, he knew it had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whiew, that's better. I could swear your body was getting heavier, the longer we were both in it,\" Kion heard his own voice say right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Kion's turn to watch in awe, as he saw his own body move, talk and even jump right in front of his spirit form. He then watched as his own body started to look itself over, then his body's head looked up and made eye-contact with his spirit-body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is surreal,\" said spirit-Kion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly what you mean,\" said Kion's body, or rather, Jasiri in his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know you really want to try out my body a bit more, Jasiri,\" said Kion, \"but I need you to de-possess my body for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, do I have to?\" pleaded Jasiri, making Kion's body's face look really sad. (In fact, Kion didn't even know he could look that sad.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you have to,\" insisted Kion. \"We need to make sure that both of us can do this, or we could end up never becoming ourselves again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright,\" sighed Jasiri, before she, somewhat reluctantly, de-possessed Kion's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kion and Jasiri then looked on, as what had happened to Jasiri's body, now happened to Kion's; without a spirit in it, his still breathing body just collapsed to the ground with a dull thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Kion's turn to inspect his own breathing, yet otherwise lifeless, body. He was fasinated by the fact that he could now see himself from an outside perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" asked Jasiri. It was clear that she was anxious to try out being Kion a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we need to go back into our own bodies,\" said Kion. \"We need to make sure that we can really seperate our spirits from our own bodies, before we try being each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, fine,\" groaned Jasiri. ('Is she really THAT anxious to try being me?' thought Kion.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends then possessed their own bodies. They de-possessed and re-possessed their own bodies a few times, just to make sure that they really could do it, and without any side-effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, Jasiri,\" said Kion, as he de-possessed his own body. \"Now can try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" beamed Jasiri, as she too de-possessed her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" answered Kion. \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, I've been ready for ages!\" said Jasiri, as both she and Kion, in their spirit forms, took a 'ready-to-pounce' stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then,\" began Kion. \"On three! One... two... three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the count of three, Kion's lion-spirit jumped into Jasiri's hyena-body and Jasiri's hyena-spirit jumped into Kion's lion-body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Between Janja and his hyenas scaring the zebras, the rockslide that ruined a lot of nests, and a few other things, Kion was done with the day. With a yawn, he plopped down and quickly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his dream, everything was white...and poofy? Kion blinked and realized that he was inside of a cloud. Kion took a step forward before somehow and tripping, but only his head went through the cloud. What the young lion saw horrified him. The Pridelands were burning, its inhabitants being hunted without care, and above Priderock a large shadowy head of a lion watched this with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion pulled his head back up and hyperventilated in shock at what he just saw. Kion heard a cough from behind him and spun around to see who was there. The leader of the Lion Guard recognized who it was, \"Grandfather, what was that? What's going on? We have to do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa replied, \"Calm down, Kion. This is not real, at least not yet. Someone is planning to do this, and they will succeed if we don't change something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion asked, \"Change what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa answered, \"The past. The Pridelands needs you to go into the past and change it to prevent this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion frowned, \"But, what could I do? Who would believe that I'm from the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa bent his head down, \"You would be placed in the body of someone from that time, giving up your life here. This means you will lose the roar. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion gulped, \"If I can stop that from happening, I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa smiled gently, \"I'm glad to hear it, you can also take someone else with you. But, they too, would have to give up their life here. If you do this, I recommend taking someone who knows the Outlands, as you will have to go there at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion nervously replied, \"Well...I know a hyena who lives in the Outlands. Jasiri. But...can we ask her first? I don't want to force her to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMufasa nodded, and suddenly, Jasiri popped out of the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasiri looked confused as she looked around, but calmed down a little when she saw Kion, \"What's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion and Mufasa explained the situation to Jasiri, who agreed to help out because she didn't want the circle of life to be destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen do they get sent back to?</span></div></div>",

As much as I would want to see it, there are already two Lion King weight gain stories, and I don't think a third is necessary. </span> As one of the Lion King weight gain stories has disappeared, and the other two cater exclusively for one gender each and have limited options available, I am now allowing weight gain storylines to be added to this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe characters may be made anthros in the story, either as a transformation or in general, as long as it is stated at the start of the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, don't kill off the characters without asking me first (I will allow it for a good story reason), and have fun while making this a good story :)</td>",
