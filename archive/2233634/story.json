However, little do I know, I would soon find the biggest discovery and gift I'll likely ever find again, and that's YOU, a tiny 5-inch human being in my apartment. If only you knew of the things I had planned for you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up into my driveway, I turned the engine off and parted my lips to let out a soft yawn. It was a long, horrible day, so I was too lazy to go take a shower. All I wanted to do was go inside and sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbuckling the seat belt, I opened the door and swung my feet out of the car and planted them onto the floor. Pushing myself up, I closed the door behind me and locked it. I began walking towards the front door and placed the key inside of the hole and unlocked the door. Pushing the door open, I walk inside and close the door behind me, locking it back. I place my bags on the floor next to the door and go to walk into the kitchen in search of something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know, there was a tiny person watching my every move....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter deciding to eat leftovers, I placed the plate inside of the microwave and leaned against the counter as I waited for the food to heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the microwave went off, I carried the plate over to the table and began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way through my meal, I glance down at my feet and widen my eyes. \"What the hell is that!?\" I said as I reached down and quickly engulfed your tiny body in my hand. I bring you up to my face to inspect you and immediately realize you're a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a tiny person? How's that possible?\" I question, but my lips curl into a smirk, \"Tell me who you are and what you're doing in my house!\" I shouted, my hot breath washing over your tiny face.</span></span></div></div>",

This thing is going to teleport me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam scoffed and adjusted her glasses. \"No, it's going to disassemble your molecules, transport them, then reassemble them elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...it's going to teleport me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stared over the bridge of her glasses and I smirked at her. \"I'd punch you if this wasn't so delicate. The slightest miscalculation and you could be shot out into space, to say nothing of how you might be reassembled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'd have much time to worry about the second bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to be a pain in the ass about this, Jake, that can also be arranged.\" Sam leaned over and displayed her sizable rear. \"How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promises, promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flushed and muttered to herself as she punched in a few more calculations. \"For this trial run, I'm going to rematerialize you in your own bedroom. I've got your exact measurements and the distance and vector. Accounting for earth's movement. It will take a minute, but for you, it should feel instantaneous. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As anyone can be.\" I stood in position. \"Call you when I get there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded, and for a moment her smirk fell away. \"Thanks for this, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm writing a thesis on classic sci-fi. How could I say no?\" I smiled. \"Besides, I trust you. What could go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just shook her head, a faint smile. \"Alright. Dematerializing in three...two...on-CHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sneezed, Sam's arm mashed into the keyboard and that was the last I saw of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit! Oh shit, okay. Don't panic. He's...anywhere within a thousand miles, and...oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I rematerialized, the first sign something was wrong was the pitch black. I'd left my light on so I wouldn't stumble into anything on this end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here I went stumbling. I took a few steps and ran square into some sort of pillar, falling on my butt. As I recovered, suddenly the world lit up and I was blinded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squinted to adjust, feeling a distant, rhythmic pounding coming closer. But I couldn't take any time to consider that as I stared up at the leg of a gargantuan chair I'd just run into. I was in the middle of a kitchen for giants. No, the kitchen had to be normal. I was tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the reality of my botched teleportation set in, the distant booming came to a head and you walked into the kitchen, completely unaware to my presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hid behind the chair leg and watched as you sleepily prepared a meal not unlike what I'd had earlier in the evening. A single movement from you could kill me...unless I was stronger like this? I wasn't about to risk testing that possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of me wanted to run out and catch your attention crying for help, but part of me was worried you'd be no help at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have much choice in the matter when you pulled out the chair I was hiding behind and sat. I looked at either of your feet, both easily longer than I was tall, then looked up and gasped when I saw your eyes lock onto me. I froze in place, all the easier to scoop up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of your breath washing over me was hot, tinged with your dinner. The expression on your face told me the hiding half of my brain was correct, but...here we are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit of a disheveled mess at the best of times, chaotic brown curls and lanky, half-toned body. I can't imagine how that came across at this miniature scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Jake. I'm a grad student. My friend in a science program built a teleporter, but something went wrong and I think it shrunk me and I don't think even she knows where I am...and...um...\" I really should not have mentioned that last part. I tried to smile and look friendly, not terrified. \"Can you help me?\"</span></div></div>",

It had always been a dream of mine to randomly find a tiny person and dominate them in any way I saw fit, and luckily for me, that dream came true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squeezed your tiny body tightly in my fist, but not hard enough to actually do any literal damage. Just to show off my power over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I listened to your words knowing that the girl who sent you here by mistake had no idea you were here, I could feel my cock begin to harden within my pants. Knowing that nobody would know what happened to you was such a turn on, I could literally do anything I wanted and get away with it, which I plan to. Unfortunately for you, you were about to find out what I plan to do to you first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, she doesn't know where you are, huh?\" I repeated back, raising an eyebrow in question. Did I really want to risk it, though? You bet I do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jake is it? Pleasure to meet you, I'm Billy!\" I grinned down to you showing off my teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you asked if I could help you out, a part of me wanted to, but a much bigger part of me didn't want to. The plans I had in mind were far more better than helping a tiny person, which you never really see since we all knew it was impossible, but here we are! Why would I waste an opportunity like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would help you, but I'm not going to.\" I said, keeping the same grin on my lips. \"You see, I've always had this fantasy of dominating someone as small as you, and now I get to do just that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up to my feet, I walk out of the kitchen and into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing you down on the coffee table, I sat down on the couch and reached down to begin untying my shoe laces. Placing them off to the side, I peel one sock off before peeling off the other sock, tossing them away as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, let's begin!\" I said, kicking my sweaty bare feet up on the table. My feet towered above you, so you could barely see my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to try your best to give me a foot massage. If you don't, or fail to do your best, you will be spending some time taped to one of them!\" I threatened.</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When your grip tightened, I let out a pained yelp, though more for the realization that I was right and you were bad news than for actual, immediate pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I mean. She might know.\" I croaked out, but the damage was done. You weren't going to help, and as far as I knew, the transporter had been one way. I winced at the wor dominate. This was no momentary amusement, you had put time and thought into...whatever came next. But that probably meant ypu wouldn't kill me outright, at least...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI collapsed on the coffee table struggling back to my feet and looking in your direction, I caught whiff of a truly putrid scent and realized its origin when I heard your shoes hit the floor. Then off came the socks and it was magnified. One of the sweat-soaked rags whizzed past me as tou tossed them away, and then I was faced with the mountainous feet I'd just been worried about, now bare, slick with sweat and radiating the stench of twelve hours of work I couldn't know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gagged, bent over in recoil, and unfortunately caught myself on the arch of your nearest foot as you finished explaining my options. I looked up at your face, horrified at the prospect of being taped to these monstrosities. Just being near them was unbearable. But all I received in response was your smirk. I didn't doubt for a second how legitimate that threat was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering, I looked up at the foot directly in front of me. Nearly twice as tall as I was, I didn't think I could reach your toes even if I stretched. I hoped you wouldn't...assist with that as I watched them wiggle, indifferent to my plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grit my teeth. If for nothing else than to avoid the tape, I set to work, driving my hands into the skin of your foot. At this size, I barely made an indent. All I got foe the effort was hands coated in sweat. Worried that you wouldn't feel it, I drove my elbows in, having what felt like a stronger effect. I worked them into the arch of your foot, then as I started to wear down, worked them into the ball of your heel, trying notnto think about how firm the bone under it was and what it could do to me. Shaking the thought away, I pulled myself up and dug my palms in above my head, trying to knead the upper reaches of your foot and cover as much area as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, I moved over to the other foot and repeated the process. By this point, I was coated in the sweat and scent. My nostrils were numb, my muscles ached, but I didn't dare stop until you told me to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI traded left foot to right foot back and forth, taking each opportunity to do so as a good sign that I hadn't done a bad enough job to be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to steel my nerves. You had said you might have helped. Maybe, just maybe, you'd reconsider if I held out long enough. It was a faint hope, but it kept me going. And besides, if I could make it through this, what could possibly be worse than massaging - or being taped to - your feet?</span></div></div>",
