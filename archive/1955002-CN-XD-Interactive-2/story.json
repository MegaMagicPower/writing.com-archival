There was a Nick on CBS block on CBS before Cookie Jar TV took over. So I thought CN XD was doing a favor by resurrecting that same block- until I found out the shows and runtime, and that's when I saw it: Soul Eater! Nickelodeon shows should be on the block, not adult comedies and anime! I had to lock up my room for that same Saturday morning, which is two days from now.</span></div></div>",

She stopped at 6'8''. And who should see that but Piper Matthews. Piper Matthews is basically Holly's online counterpart. Then that gave me an idea- a sweet idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could give Piper Matthews the biggest surprise money can buy- a helium tank, stuck to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first of all, I have ZERO money. Second of all, real body inflation does NOT exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I called Rowley Jefferson over. He said he'll be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, he arrives. I'm starting to think if he went to a Joshie concert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I told him two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first is if he brought a helium tank. The second is if he wanted to sleep over here tonight. He said yes to both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents agreed to the sleepover, and we looked up \"Body Inflation\" and stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked when an ad for a \"2DS\" and stuff like that pulled up. Then a \"Lil' Cutie\" ad. Lil' Cutie is the worst comic in the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm pretty sure that Fregley isn't going to barge in and ruin the fun.
