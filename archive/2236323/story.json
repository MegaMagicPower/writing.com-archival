Sex. BDSM. Weight Gain. Muscle Gain. Hypnosis/Mind Control. Diapers. Bestiality. Bimbofication. Petplay... Just to name a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a onclick=\"$('#dropNote2').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Here are a few examples:</span> <span style=\"font-size:8pt;opacity:.75;text-decoration:none;\">\u25bc</span></a><div id=\"dropNote2\" style=\"padding:0px;display:none;\"><a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paraphilias\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paraphilias</a></div> <br>\r\nBut you can always add a new fetish, of which you can think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can decide, whether the character is going to be straight, lesbian, or a bi-sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clred\">NOTICE!</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will allow ANY fetish, but there are still some ground rules for this Interactive:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- No killing of the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- This is a combination of Adult, Erotica, and Romance/Love, so you can decide for yourself, whether the characters indulge themselves, to the fetish of your choice either willingly, or unwillingly. That's why this item is rated XGC, just to be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You may add more characters on the same storyline, but keep the main focus on the character, of which you picked at the beginning of the story. ( i.e. If you choose Kasumi, then she becomes the main character in that storyline. If you choose Ayane, then it's Ayane, etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No one-word, or one sentence chapters! You know you can do better than that, so be creative and try to keep this a readable story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Use proper grammar. Things such as, \"OMG!\", \"I dunno\", \" I wuw U!\", are NOT allowed! <br>\r\n(Unless you choose to make a storyline of Bimbofication, then I'll allow it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- When adding a new chapter, make sure that you always leave a minimum of TWO options at the end of the chapter. The more the better <br>\r\n(from 3 to 5 options, if possible), but always a minimum of two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can pair the female character with an SI-OC ( A.K.A. You, the reader) if you want to. <br>\r\nBut if you do, choose a name for your character at the beginning. Or, if you can't decide for a name, then just simply put in, (Name).</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>I reserve the right of making more rules and edit them, plus the editing and deleting of the chapters, of which I find not following the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(But mostly I'll be just checking on for possible grammar mistakes. I know, I know. My own writing's not perfect either, but I still try to make it readable, by the best of my abilities.) </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this Interactive Story, email me and I'll reply to you as soon as possible.<br>\r\nOther than that, be creative and HAVE FUN! :)</td>",
