You know your parents won't be home for hours, so you'll have Emma all to yourself. You keep the conversation going as you take out your key to let yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your house\", Emma remarks. She seems genuinely excited to be invited into your home. Her slight smile is so cute. You want to kiss her right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. We can sit down over here\" you reply, \"I'm glad you were allowed to come over\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit on the couch, you turn and face her. Once again, looking at her stirs up longing inside you. You glance down at her light blue dress, following all the way down her bare legs to the Toms slip-on shoes on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I couldn't stay alone at a boy's house, but my parents are fine with me being here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. What makes me so different? How do they know you're not into girls?\" As you say this you subtly attempt to lean a little closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just never been interested in girls.\" Emma shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back to your original position trying not to betray your disappointment. Though ultimately with what you have planned it doesn't matter. You do hope she changes her mind later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well while you're here...\"</span></div></div>",

After grabbing the glasses you check for the sleeping powder you've hidden. You've never tried it before, but this is your last hope of getting some fun time with Emma. You're distracted thinking back to a few months ago, at a sleepover. You had gotten up around 4am and noticed Emma asleep. If there hadn't been such a light sleeper, you might have tried something then. That's when this plan was first born. You pour the sleeping powder in the glass on the right. The powder dissolves as you pour the lemonade, the two drinks are indistinguishable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to Emma, you make sure to hand her the right glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" she says, accepting the glass and drinking eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was quick.\" you quip. \"Do you need anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm okay. I am sure one glass is enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a long walk... how are you feeling?\" you ask before finishing your own glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little tired but I'll be okay...\" Emma sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a massage might help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A massage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be... weird. I'm just...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drink is clearly kicking in. Emma's speech is slowing and her eyes glaze over. You're not sure what she'll remember, but she'll be out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just see if you like it\" you say while moving closer to her. You put your hands on her shoulders and she begins to lean on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just... I... don't...\" Emma is whispering at this point. Her eyes flutter and close. You've never been so excited. She lets out one final sigh as she loses consciousness in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan actually worked! You have Emma unconscious and all to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you do is:</span></div></div>",

It's just a relaxing repeating pattern that'll help you get her into trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Emma asks again, staring at the screen confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of those optical illusions.

You're having so much trouble keeping those eyes open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you see her fighting the urge to shut her eyes. It's so exciting to see her eyes flutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know when you close your eyes it'll send you deep down into trance. You'll be so deep asleep but your mind will stay awake listening to all my instructions. You want to be in that trance. You want so much to close your eyes and experience this. When I snap my fingers you'll no longer be able to fight it. Your eyes will shut and you will fall deep into trance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP* She falls forward into you.

It's unlabeled so she doesn't know what hit her. With luck, when she wakes up she'll have no idea what happened. You hold the bottle away from you and spray her once.
