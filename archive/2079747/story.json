Birds were singing in the trees while animals and humans woke up. <br>\r\nAya however was still in bed. Curled up under her blanket of mammoth fur. It was nice and warm. She turned once to the wall of the cave and tried to fall asleep again. She heard sounds and knew that her family woke up. <br>\r\nHowever she was happy. I had gotten warmer the past days. That mend summer was coming. Aya loved the summer. Because that mend there was more food. The only thing she did't liked about the summer was that the mammoths were gone. She loved mammoth meat. But she normally only could eat it in the winter. Maybe late autumn or early spring. It depended a bit of the weather. However she also liked the summer because that mend it was warm outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aya. It's time to wake up!\" Annie yelled and pulled her blanket of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee. I was trying to sleep!\" Aya mumbled angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. You slept long enough. You don't wanna miss breakfast.\" Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one simple last word breakfast got Aya's attention. Aya had a big appetite. In the stone age you need to eat whenever you could. Then at least you had some extra fat for the times when it was harder to find food. However Aya had been very lucky. Her father was a very good hunter and mostly could get some meat. Her mother knew exactly which plants and roots you could eat so they mostly had food. <br>\r\nBut since Aya was kind of small her parents made sure she got enough food. This made the little cave girl very chubby. Almost fat. But Aya did't mind. Her parents surely did't mind it. She thought she looked a lot like the mother. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venus_of_willendorf\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venus_of_w...</a>  The mother of all living things. Who gave birth to any human and animal. Everything cam from out her womb. She was the goddess. Looking like her was't a bad thing.<br>\r\n However her siblings however did mind that their little sister got so much attention. Especially Annie. Jon just accepted it but Annie sometimes teased her little sister.<br>\r\nAya put on a on a dress made of deer skin a waddled to her parents. Who were sitting around their fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Aya there you are. It's nice weather. If this continues for a few days we can eat eat outside.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya smiled however she did't care if they ate outside or inside, as long if she got food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana said she spotted a group of deers. Near the waterfall.\" Aya's father Groom said. \"If we can catch some of those we have food for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The deers Groom was talking about are't the normal deers we have today. These were a lot bigger. There was about a length of two yards between the antlers. But sadly enough those animals are extinct a long time ago. But not in the stone age.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna check if some fruit is ripe.\" Aya's mother Angelica said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya moaned softly. She knew that this mend walking and if the fruit was ripe carrying it back to the cave. It was hard work, and Aya hated hard work. But she also knew that there was no way out of it. If the fruit was ripe she had a chance to take a bite when they were there.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She reached out and pulled at a cord. A minute later a servant walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want your highness?\" She asked polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cold. Could you make a fire?\" Cassandra asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I must admit it is kind of cold in here. It's the time of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra looked at the ceiling while rubbing her beautiful big belly. As a princess and future queen she of course needed to look beautiful. If she looked at herself in her mirror she always thought she looked beautiful. She loved wearing nice dresses and always loved it when a servant did her hair, or used some make up for her face. She never need to do those things by herself. Her servants did it all for her. They even helped her dressing herself. She could do it herself but liked it if somebody did it for her.<br>\r\nThe servant finally made a fire and soon the room was getting warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I go?\" The servant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I think I'm ready to get up. Help me get dressed. I would like... a pink dress today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant walked to a walk in closet. Cassandra had dozens of dresses and gowns. As princess she could easily get them. But she also outgrew them kind of fast. Not in height but in size. She finally found a pink dress that would probably still fit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this one your highness?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfect. Put it on.\" Cassandra ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a bit of a struggle. The dress was tight on the overweight girl but the servant was able to squeeze her in and pull up the zipper. <br>\r\nCassandra looked at herself in the mirror and liked what she saw. Especially how her belly pushed against the fabric of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like some breakfast.\" Cassandra said. \"Some sausages, three eggs hard boiled, six toast covered wilt jelly, a omelet with two eggs and a pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may think this was a bit much for a seven year old girl but this was a normal breakfast for the spoiled princess. She walked to the dining room. She sighed when she did't saw her parents. They were busy again. She knew it was hard work ruling a kingdom but still she did't liked it if they were't here.<br>\r\nA few minutes later a servant came with the food. Cassandra took her fork and knife but ate very well mannered. Since she was a toddler she was educated in the etiquette. But the most important reason was that she wanted to keep her dress clean. She could become furious if her dress became dirty.<br>\r\nShe wondered what her parents were doing while she ate mannered but fast her breakfast.<br>\r\nSome time later Cassandra had eaten all the food she ordered for breakfast. She laid back with a swollen belly and put her hands on it.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she sat there, rubbing her dome of royal belly, she was sure there was nobody in the kingdom who could be as stuffed as her. She opened her mouth to order a belly rub, but instead she burped. Loud and long she belched, and just like that, she was hungry all over again. She called for more. \"The same again, but six eggs this time, and have the cook send up some ham as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, and before too many growls of hunger from the fat young princess, second breakfast had made its way up to her royal bedchamber. The cook had delivered on the ham, and done quite well- it was glazed with some sort of honey sauce and tasted perfectly delicious. In a few minutes all of that was gone as well, and <i>now</i> the princess was sure she was stuffed. She was full, totally, completely, ridiculously-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her dress was rent in two, and she suddenly had more room. This time, she called for cake- two of them, light and fluffy, like she liked. She laid a hand on her pale, pampered globe of belly, and hoped that these thirds would be enough to satisfy it. </span></div></div>",

She knew she ad a big appetite but she could't remember she had ever eaten this much. Maybe it had something to do with the time of the year. Was there a time when girls got hungry?<br>\r\nThen she saw her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! My dress ripped.\" She moaned. \"I loved this one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra hated it something happened to her clothes. If someone made her clothes dirty or ripped them (did't matter if it was on purpose or an accident) she became furious. But when she outgrew them that was something she did herself. She did't became mad at herself. But she could't show herself with a ruined dress. She pulled her cord again and again a servant appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it your highness?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dress. tore in two. So I need a new one. One that is't so tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant took of the old dress of the princess. When she saw the princess in only her underwear she was a bit jealous at how beautiful fat the princess was. But of course she did't say that. She looked in the closet. She hoped she could find something. If their princess kept stuffing her face like this she would soon have outgrown every one of her dresses and gowns.<br>\r\nLucky she found some bigger ones in the end of the closet. She took another pink dress and walked back to the princess who was rubbing her round belly. She smiled while doing it. <br>\r\nThe servant looked at it and could't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh can I touch it princess?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... well... okay. But you have to rub it!\" Cassandra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant smiled hearing this. She rubbed the full, bloated and swollen tummy of the princess and liked doing it. Cassandra liked it too. It did feel nice that her tummy was rubbed now it was so full and swollen. After a few minutes Cassandra looked at the servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right that was enough. Now put on my dress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you highness. Right away.\" The servant said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the dress on her princess and was relieved it still fitted. But it probably would't take long before she would outgrown this one too. Perhaps it was better if she told the king and queen. Then they could buy some new bigger dresses and gowns for their fat growing daughter. She always liked it to get new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I think I go outside. To the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, your highness? I mean the village is no place for a pretty princess like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but mom and dad are away. So I don't have anything to do. Besides you go with me right. To keep an eye at me.\" She said and waddled outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis really was't what she expected to do with her day. but making sure the princess was happy and safe was her first priority. It always had been.<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Her love handles, her rubbing thighs, fluffy upper arms, big belly and even some fat around her chest. A body so beautiful almost every other girl in the kingdom would kill for. It showed that the girl who this body belonged too came from a wealthy family. Well that was true. You could't became more wealthy then the king,  queen and princess.<br>\r\nThe servant care full took the new dress. She sighed relieved when she saw it was a few sizes bigger then her old one so it would probably fit her easy. The king kept track on his daughters growing body. Well her body was growing.

You don't want to have chocolate stains on your dress now do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra stopped eating. No matter how much she liked eating and how much she liked chocolate, she hated it if her dress became dirty. Especially a new dress.

How do I look?\" Cassandra asked turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect you highness.\" The servant said telling the truth.

They're always away.\" Cassandra said fast grabbing the box of chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they of course need to rule the entire country. That's a lot of work. You'll see when you become queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra knew she would once be queen. She did't really knew about that. It was a lot of work. But you could also do a lot of things. You could eat whatever and whenever you liked. That was a good thing. You could get the best dresses. But being away so much to make sure everything in the country was going fine... that might be less fun. But she was the first born so she had right at the throne and she did't had any siblings... yet. Who knew her mother was still young enough to get another child.   <br>\r\nFinally she reached her parents and ran over to her father who hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" She asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there were some problems. We need to make a well for a village, and another village had problems with some robbers. But we got them. Another village was complaining about some wolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they eat little pretty princesses?\" Cassandra asked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They normally go after animals. Like our sheep's, pigs and chickens. But they might be dangerous for little kids. But the mostly hunt during the night. Around then you're safely inside. No wolf will harm you. But we can't have them eating our sheep's, pigs, and chickens. That's our food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we love food.\" The queen added. \"Just like you Cassandra. Are you sure you eat enough? That dress seems a bit wide on you. I don't want my daughter to become a thin twig like some of the village kids.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't mommy I promise.\" Cassandra said with a greedy grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that all changed the day I brought a whole chocolate cake smothered in icing. Oh I remember how your eyes lit up upon the sight of that marvelous dessert. I gave you a slice and you gobbled it down, and how overjoyed I was when you begged me for more, why I hardly satisfied my hunger. Realizing you had a sweet tooth I took advantage of it and frequently brought you desserts which you would happily eat. Why before I knew it you had fattened up into a beautiful chubby princess. Your thin legs had plumped up, your arms were chunky, and your belly was nice and flabby.

She's the daughter of a good friend from me. A duke. Too bad the robbers took everything he had and his castle was burned too the ground. However Kimberly survived. She's the daughter of a good friend from me. I could't leave her behind.

Te girl seemed nice but perhaps a bit shy and thought she was't allowed to look at the royal family unless when told. Cassandra liked this. She must admit she was a bit lonely. Sure the servants were nice for her, since she was the princess, but still they were servants not real friends. And doing things she liked was still not easy with servants. Sure she had several servants, She liked most of them but a real friend would be nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you daddy. This will be great. Right Kimberly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said something.

Cassandra in particular was interested in why Kimberly was so thin. \u201cWhy are you so thin? Even not being as wealthy as the king, you should have gotten at least a little weight on you.

Despite not getting as much as a girl of my ages should have, I still had a decent stomach. But more organized banditry arose one day. It not only raised the price of food, but forced my father to spend most of his resources in taming them. Despite this, they grew in strength. One day, they assaulted my father\u2019s castle itself. The siege was repelled, but I lost a lot of weight. Not even a sixmonth later they came back and burned the inner works to the ground. I only survived as I was able to escape out the back entrance. A peasant family then took me in, not knowing who I was. I lost what little weight I had regained working the fields. I would have died in that house if I had not known Latin. Your father just happened to come through my village on his campaign of revenge, and he saved my life.\u201d \u201cThat sounds horrible. You went through a great deal.\u201d Cassandra said, still not comprehending what she had gone through. \u201cIndeed.

A few minutes later, a servant appeared \u201cWhat is it you require?\u201d she asked. \u201cBreakfast,\u201d Kimberly said. \u201cI would like four pieces of toast with butter, some sausage, bacon, and two eggs. With apple juice to wash it down.\u201d \u201cVery well. Anything else?\u201d came the response. \u201cNo,\u201d Kimberly responded. As the  servant left, Kimberly rubbed her stomach in anticipation of  the coming meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is your breakfast, miss Cassandra,\u201d A servant said as he put each plate before her. \u201cThank you,\u201d Cassandra responded. She began to eat immediately. In her typical style, the food vanished very quickly. In barely half an hour, she had managed to completely eat everything. Her stomach was a round little thing that strained against the fabric of her dress, and never before had she been so full. She pulled on her chord and called a servant again. As she appeared, Cassandra spoke \u201cPrepare me a sling. I wish to inspect the castle. Make sure it had snacks.\u201d \u201cYes, my lady,\u201d the servant said.<br>\r\nKimberly laid back in bed and felt pleased with herself. She had eaten more for breakfast than she had in a long time. After she finished with her first order, she placed a second for two cakes, and a third for bacon. And her stomach was packed because of it. The formerly flat stomach had developed into a curve that started at the waist and continued from there. Breathing heavily, Kimberly got to her feet and walked down the stairs of the tower. Panting, she opened the door to the castle greenhouse, where she often lay after a meal. She lay down on the soft mattress that was there for her at all times and rubbed her belly, the heat of the sun warming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra took another bite of the provided pie and watched as her stomach strained against her dress. Her tour of the castle had proven most interesting, and she took note of several flaws in construction and decoration that would be rectified. Everything from rotting cables on the drawbridge to minor errors paintings. She spent the entire first part of her day doing such things until lunch rolled around. And she had no idea how what she would do with lunch.</span></div></div>",

I would like something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever you want your highness.\" her servant said, who almost could't believe she could still eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is my new best friend by the way? You know? Kim?\" She suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. Well normally if she is't doing anything with you she's in the greenhouse. I must admit it's a very nice place to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you be so kind and get her after your done getting me to the dining room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course your highness. Everything for the princess.\" Her servant answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was still in the greenhouse enjoying the sun. She pulled her dress up to her chest so she easily could rub her round belly. It had really grown and she planned to make it bigger. She maybe would never be able to beat Cassandra in being the fattest but she could become a nice second. She and Cassandra became good friends. Playing games, talking about clothing, jewelery, playing and of course eating. <br>\r\nShe heard to door of the greenhouse open and fast pulled her dress down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah miss Kimberly. Princess Cassandra asked me to come get you for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Okay. Great I was getting hungry anyway.\" She stood up and looked around. \"It's so nice here. Oh look. Those are my favorite plants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at some strange plants. The servant would have expected some flowers with girl liked Kimberly but these plant did.t seem that special at all. Suddenly he noticed a fly. He went sitting on a leaf. The next moment the leaf closed like a mousetrap. Capturing the insect. Kim chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A plant that likes eating just as much if I and Cassandra.\" Kimberly said while she walked to the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant fast walked after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh excuse me but... what just happened there? I mean what;s happening to that fly?\" The servant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fly. He gets digested. That plant is called the Venus flytrap. It a carnivorous plant. He eats insects. Whenever a insect lands on a leaf it closes and then the insect gets digested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant was surprised. His purpose was serving the princess. He did't knew much about plants. Hearing that there was a plant that really ate insects was something totally new for him. It scared him a bit but he was trained to act normal. No matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Kim! There you are. I just ordered lunch. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... how about three sandwiches, two pies, two cakes, some bacon and sausages. Oh and apple juice. Hm, I love apple juice. My parents used to call it liquid gold before they... well... never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra noticed that Kim never talked about her parents. She could understood why. If she tried to image how it felt when you heard you lost your parents... it seemed more then awful to her. So she never asked Kim much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm glad you're here. I mostly needed to eat alone. Except when my mom and dad were here. But you noticed... mostly they're not here. I know they need to rule the country... so I don't blame them but still... It would be nice if I saw them more often. So I'm glad you here, so I have someone to eat with. Eating is't so much fun alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit I also like it here... and of course I also like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment their lunch arrived and both started eating.         </span></div></div>",

It seemed like she was always chewing on something unless when she was sleeping. She was eating from dusk till dawn. She ate so much she more the once ate so much her stomach was hurting. But she kept eating and it showed on her body.<br>\r\nThis weight gain made the king and queen very happy. Cassandra was't the only heavy weight. Her father had a normal weight but her mother the queen was also queen sized. She was happy Cassandra wanted to follow in her deep footprints. She understood what her daughter was doing when she heard about the party. She made sure Some dresses and gowns would be made a few sizes bigger so they would still fit her daughter. She hated ruined clothes. <br>\r\nBut now the were in a carriage of to her cousins birth day party. Even now Cassandra was still chewing on something. She did her best the past three weeks to eat as much if was possible so she would be fatter then her cousin. She had more then once been in serious pain from overeating, but she managed to keep all the food and calories inside. It also had been worth it since she did gain some weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, there's my brothers castle!\" The king shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra looked out the window. She looked forward to see her cousin again. She always had fun with her cousin. However she did't liked the two younger brothers of her cousin that much. They were't fat like them. There were always running around, screaming, jumping. They also loved  practical jokes. Normally their sister and (when she was there) their cousin were the targets. She sighed. She hoped they became a bit more mature but she doubted it. She wondered how much her cousin gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have her present. Right Cassandra?\" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom. Of course. It's a beautiful piece of jewelry. Believe me I know if a piece of jewelry is worth full or not. I'm sure she will love this.\" Cassandra said and hold the package tight to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you think you beat Annabelle in your weight gain contest?\" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so. I've been eating so much lately. I believe I'm sweating gravy. But look at this.\" Cassandra said drummed on her round belly. Not only her belly became bigger, she gained all over her body. Just like her mom and Cousin did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we'll see how much Annabelle gained.\"  Her father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure bigger then her brother. Either one of them.\" Cassandra mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're heavier the the two of them combined.\" Her mother said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage stopped and the king stepped out and helped his wife and daughter out of the carriage.. Guards were standing left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are the king, queen, princess and princes.\" One person yelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards blew their horns and Annabelle, her brothers and her parents walked over the them to greet them.

Of course, each queen complimenting the other's heavy weight and girth. Like Cassandra's mother, Annabelle's mother was proudly corpulent, taking great care of maintaining and adding to her frame. Each queen wore a complimenting dress which displayed their well endowed physiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, indeed I must admit defeat, Cassandra you are definitely fatter than me.\" Annabelle admitted eyeing her cousin's flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI graciously accept your defeat. But don't feel too bad Anna, for you are really big as well. Plus I was eating constantly for the past few weeks preparing for today.\" Cassandra said.  Cassandra than brought her lips to Anna's ear and whispered \" In fact I forced myself to eat even though it hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls giggled over their arduous preparations until they were interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you again tubby!\" said one of Anna's brothers as he poked Cassandra's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez you're fat! It's not every day we see someone fatter than sis.\" added the other brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa even her legs are chunky!\" declared a brother lifting up Cassandra's dress, peeking ar what's underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEK!\" Cassandra shrieked thrusting away from the intrusive boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stop it you two! Sorry Cassandra I deal with this all the time.\" Annabelle scolded and apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two should learn some manners.\" Casandra scorned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok we're sorry. Let us make it up to you.\" the brother said reaching into his pocket. \"Here have a snack!\" he said pulling out a bug laughing wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EWWWWW!\" yelled the girls in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rowdy tumult caused the queens to quell the situation \"Enough children its time to begin the party.\" the queen sternly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then entered the castle's ballroom were dozens of high class families waited each one possessing a well fed daughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"   </span></div></div>",

Those girls are nothing more then skin and bones. You can count their ribs. I would't wanna look like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me neither. But I heard that they can't... afford... it. Or something like that.\" Cassandra slowly said. Being a princess who had and could get everything she wanted she did't understood some people could't afford things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. I introduce you to some girls.\" Annabelle said, pulling Cassandra with her to a girl. \"This is Leni.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLeni had white blond hair and her upper body was normal but this girl had enough  fat in the lower half of her body, giving her a pear shape. She had big thunder thighs that rubbed if she walked a huge butt that looked like two swollen melons and also a belly however a lot smaller then Annabelle's or Cassandra's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I'm Leni. Well she just told you.\" Leni said, she talked very fast. \"She told me a lot about you. At least the good things. You look great. You have a nice belly. I love good food. It seems like you like good food too. My favorite food is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your pi hole blabbermouth.\" Annabelle said. \"I'm sometimes surprised you're able to breath when you're talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Annabelle. I thought I heard you.\" A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice belonged to a little girl with dark brown hair. Even on the tips of her toes she was shorter the the other three girls. But what she had't in height she made up in size She carried a big belly and also her limbs were fat and her cheeks were so pink and puffy it looked she stuffed a jawbreaker in each one of them. She smiled with pearl white teeth. Cassandra got a better look at her. She also had a big bubble but and rubbing thighs but just like Cassandra and Annabelle her belly was bigger and also her upper arms and chest had a nice layer of fat on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little one is Charity. Don't get fooled by her height. She's very smart and can eat a lot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also a lot older then I look. I just don't grow so fast. The doctor told me I will get a growth spurt once. Just wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you stay little for the rest of your life.\" A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big girl walked over to them. Her belly was huge while her limbs were normal sized. It seemed like all her weight was in her huge belly. But what got also a lot attention was her hair. It was bright green. Cassandra wondered how she was able to have green hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it possible she has green hair?\" She whispered to Annabelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. She keeps that a secret. Guess she colors it with some stuff.\" Annebelle whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Faith. That's my name.\" The girl with the huge belly said.\"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry.\" Charity said. \"Can we get some food?\"<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

She softly smacked with her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm tastes just like chicken. It does't taste bad but I think it's a bit cruel to kill a frog just for one tiny bite of meat while you can have a entire chicken. I mean come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra suddenly saw Charity. She was eating so fast her mouth almost seemed a hole that was open almost the entire time. Cassandra wondered if she chewed the food. It was funny seeing such a short girl with such a big appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked when she saw Cassandra looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat so fast. They always tell me I eat fast but you eat way faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well If you want to get a body like me you need to work for it, or eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that boy over there likes me.\" Leni said, looking at at a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not even looking at you.\" Annabelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he might.

But I'm sure there are also some nice boys who would like such a fatty like me.\" Annabelle said with a dreamy look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. But don't you think your father would like it more when you marry a prince to connect two kingdoms?\" Faith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he probably would.\" Annabelle said while eating a strawberry pie. \"That's such a downside about being a princess. You need to make sacrifices for your country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The plus size is you don't need to put much work in finding a boy. You parents do it for you.\" Leni said while eating potato salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but what now suppose if you don't like the boy they chose. Perhaps he's awful person and who knows he might be very ugly.\" Charity said while munching on shrimps from a plate in one of her hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the way it's a sacrifice I need to make. I need to do it for my country. It's what I need to do.\" Annabelle said while finishing the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra stopped eating for a second. She was also a princess. There was a good chance her parents wanted her to marry a prince. Somebody she did't knew and perhaps did't even liked. But she  decided too worry about that later an now first focused on something important. Like eating!<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

Most girls, no matter if the were princesses or village girls had a huge crush on him. Leni who normally had always something to say was only able to say: \"Ba... ba... ba.\"<br>\r\nAll other three girls just looked at him with their mouths wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra did even noticed she opened her mouth and said: \"Well certainly.\" She suddenly realized what she said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's go.\" Prince Adrian said and took her by the hand and pulled her towards the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it. He hoped he would ask me for a dance.\" Said Faith grumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? We all hoped that.. But Cassandra is the lucky one.\" Charity said calmly. \"I also rather had he asked me but I accepted that he asked Cassandra. Since I like her I hope she enjoys herself. As for me... I'm hungry. I'm gonna take a bite to eat... or several bites. Ha ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Adrian and Cassandra were dancing slowly. One arm of prince Adrian was around her middle and the other on her shoulder. While the were dancing her belly was constantly bumping to his flat belly. But both kids did't mind this and liked the touching of their bellies. <br>\r\nCassandra smiled and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good dancer.\" Cassandra said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not so bad yourself.\" Prince Adrian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... slow dancing is fine but when we do fast dances I easily get out of breath.\" Cassandra said and smiled. \"I'm also a big eater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I could tell that with one look at the gorgeous belly of yours.\" Adrian said with a proud smile.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nOf course which man would't want a woman who was so fat like hers. All boys wanted to have a fat girl friend. Fine the village kids often married skinny girls but that was only because there were any or at least no much fat village girls and there was no way the daughter of a count, duke or king would marry a kid from the village. But she knew very well that most village girls were jealous at her. Her body, but also her dresses and gowns and how she lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" Adrian asked waking her up from her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Sorry I was just thinking about some... things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're out of breath or need to eat something just tell me.\" Adrian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no... I'm okay. Really don't worry.\" Cassandra fast said smiling again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She dances pretty good. Well he too of course.\" Charity said while munching on some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

Cassandra was almost in tears as she wore a beautiful dress that was now ruined by those two brats. Later Annabelle found her and invited her to her room to wash herself and borrow one of her dresses. After taking a bath with Annabelle's servants washing and drying her Annabelle opened her closet for her to choose what dress she would like to wear.

Luckily enough she noticed it were fingers before she did real damage to them. Adrian did't seem to mind. Both enjoyed this very much. Cassandra even wondered if he maybe could become her boyfriend. He came from a wealthy family else he could't be here so that was no trouble.<br>\r\nBut the problem came when she suddenly heard a embarrassing and sadly but familiar sound. The sound of ripping clothing. Her dress ripped right at the front in the middle. She did her best too hide it. What bothered her most was the fact that this dress was from Annabelle. She hoped she would't be mad at her. <br>\r\nMost other people at the party were too busy too notice this. But Annabelle suddenly walked over to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Annabelle I'm so sorry. Your dress...\" Cassandra started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't worry about that dress. We have a terrific tailor here in the palace. I also already asked some servants to clean your dress. They have cleaned dresses from this kind of stuff more then once. Or do you think my brothers never did that to me. Sometimes I wish I was a only child. Just like you.\" Annabelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well It's not always great being an only child. I must admit that I rather don't have bratty siblings like you... but I would like to have a sister like you. Someone to hang out with, or do games, or... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody you can borrow clothes from.\" Annabelle said with a grin. \"Perhaps we can better get out before people started to notice your dress ripped. It's a bit embarrassing. Don't you think. Come let's go to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids walked, or in Cassandra and Annabele's case it was more waddled to Annabelle's room.  They fast entered her room and Annabelle closed to door and sighed relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we made it. But I'm afraid it's gonna get hard finding a bigger dress for you. Most are even tight for me and for you we need a even bigger one. Most of my dresses are made especially for me by my tailor. He measures me every now and then she knows my clothing fits perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a difficult time finding clothes that fit.\" Cassandra said. \"Luckily my parents buy new ones often. Else I needed to walk around naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those girls from the village don't have to deal with those difficult problems. I see the toddlers of them running around naked all the time. Those girls seem to hardly have any clothes.\" Annabelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well most of them don't have any other clothes. Also they're so thin so they don't have the problem their clothes don't fit them.\" Adrian mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra pulled of the ripped dress and wrapped Annabelle's blanket around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sleep with me. My bed is big enough for three girls. Even if the're a bit overweight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra smiled. She and Annabelle always slept together if they visit each other. So they could talk a bit with each other. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I also still need to think of a way to get back at your brothers. They'll pay.\" Cassandra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my mother already punished them and send them to bed without supper. But if you want to teach them a lesson I'll be happy to help. Aha. Here it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hold up a pretty blue dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one has several rows of buttons on the back so you can make it  a bit bigger. \" Annabelle said while Cassandra put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle fat started to close the buttons.

Is it already morning?\" Annabelle asked with a smile. \"Then a servant could get in anytime to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted when someone knocked on the door. After a: \"Come in!\" From Annabelle a servant walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning your highness's. What do you two want for breakfast?\" She asked and bowed for the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a lot of sausages, 5 sandwiches, 6 backed eggs, 3 boiled eggs, some fruit and 5 toasts with jelly and a two cakes, and fruit juice to wash it all done. I guess that will be enough to start. What do you want Cassandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I think I have the same.\" Cassandra said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant nodded and left the room while Cassandra and Annabelle got dressed. Annabelle got a beautiful blue dress. But when she turned she saw that Cassandra was trying to squeeze her beautiful, obese body in one of her  dresses. But it did't seemed like it was gonna fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Cassandra... I don't wanna be mean but I don't think that's dress is gonna fit you. Even if it does it will probably rip during breakfast. I think it's better if you look for something that fits... instead of someone that looks nice.\" Annabelle said carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I guess your right. I have this trouble at house all the time. What is your biggest dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.\" Annabelle said and rubbed her chin while she walked into her closet. \"Too small, too small, way too small and Ewwww! Why did my parents buy this one? Too black, too tight, I was gonna use this one for my ball next month... But I guess you can use it now. My parents bought it a few sizes bigger so it would still fit me by then. But I'm not sure it will still fit me. I outgrow clothes pretty fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the dress fitted Cassandra perfectly. The two girls waddled as fat if their chubby legs could carry them to the dining room. There parents were already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice that you two could join us.\" The father of Annabelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra wanted to sit on her chair but her cousin stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second Cassandra. What is that on your chair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra looked surprised at her seat. There was something on it. It seemed to be some sticky stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Cassandra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is glue. I also think that those two are responsible for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted the tablecloth and Cassandra saw the brothers of Annabelle. One of them holding a can of glue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well You two little brats! I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, that was very mean!\" Their mother said.\" Cassandra and her parents are our guests. You should treat them with respect and honor. You don't want to give our family a bad name. Now say you're sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry Cassandra.\" Both said but Cassandra could clearly see they did't mean it, but she suddenly got a idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay if can have your breakfast! From both of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" They both yelled. \"You can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think she can. It's a good punishment. Perhaps it will teach you two too behave. Don't even think about asking someone else for food. Because if I find out and I do you two will be in very deep trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But can we go then.\" One of them asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you can leave.\" The queen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment the servants came in with the breakfasts. <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Cakes, pies, pizza, pastries, sandwiches, mashed potatoes, but what mostly caught her eyes were the fish, shrimps and lobsters. Jester loved sea food. She started to eat right away. Cramming the food in her mouth with both hands. Don't minding manners. It seemed like she was all alone so who would care? She ripped meat from bones, swallowed stuff without barely chewing it. Wolfed down everything edible that came near her mouth. <br>\r\nHer belly soon poked out between her pants and shirt. She kept stuffing her face and her belly kept swelling. Growing bigger and rounder. <br>\r\nJester liked this. She was busy eating the fish and lobsters when she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jester you need to wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJester opened her eyes. She was still the same. No table full with food in front of her. No big round belly. Not even chubby, just flat. Jester looked disturbed at her twin brother. They looked the same like two drops of water apart from the fact that she was a girl and he a boy and her hair was longer. She was aware that in about five, six years there would be another difference. Or two to be exact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you need to wake me up. I was having such a great dream.\" Jester moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dad is't around so that means that I'm the man of the house. So you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man? Come oooooon. You're a boy. Should't I be in charge. I'm the oldest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only by two minutes!\" Jack said grumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best two minutes of my life.\" Jester mumbled with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we can better practice a bit. The kings brother comes with his wife and daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His daughter. That fat one?\" Jester asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJester remembered her from last time. Pretty friendly and nice girl. Also very fat. Jester thought she was nice but at the same time she was very jealous at her. This girl was so fat. <br>\r\nJester lived in a room in the castle of the king. She her brother and her father had always been jesters. And because the king thought they were pretty good and he liked good entertainment they got a room just like the servants. Nothing special but at least they got a roof above their head, protection from the bad weather, and enough food to stay alive without being hungry.<br>\r\nBut Jester loved eating. It was a secret she never told anyone. Not even her twin brother. But what  she really wanted was to pig out at a table full with food. Just like in her dream. Stuffing  her face with both hands. That is what she wanted. <br>\r\nBut also a secret was that she liked it to be fat. That was the reason she was so jealous at that girl. She wanted to be fat too. Not that fat was a problem. It was a sign of health and wealth. A sign that you would be great for  carrying children. Every girl wanted to be fat  but wanting and able to become were two different things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I believe it are those. So wanna practice?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah!\" Jester mumbled and stroke through her hair. \"Not yet. I'm hungry. First I want breakfast. But after that we can practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractice was what they both did a lot of the day. Thinking of new tricks, jokes, dances, small plays. Since almost no one could see the difference between them if they wore their hats they could do some very funny things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day was't different from any other day. After breakfast she practiced every thing with her brother until they knew for sure they knew everything right.<br>\r\nThat evening they put up a great show. People laughed and clapped loudly. Jester saw the fat girl. She was even fatter then before. Suddenly the fat girl looked up and said:...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

The warm sun made her drowsy. <br>\r\nSuddenly a shadow fell over her. Erica opened lazy one eye. But when she saw who it was she got up right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Hi mom.\" Erica said trying to look sweet and innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Hello. Did you have a nice nap? A nap when I asked you to clean the stables?\" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I need to do that. That animals get shelter, food, and water. Can't they clean their own stables?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was pretty lazy when it was about doing chores. Like taking care of the animals. Working in the field. piking fruit and vegetables. Too bad for her all those things included food and Erica loved eating. She was pretty good at it too. You could clearly see that by taking one look at her huge belly, flabby thighs and big butt. There was even some fat at her chest. She had also bowl pink cheeks and a second chin. Erica had a big appetite. But Erica's mother and most other woman in their village were kind of heavy so nobody cared about it. However part of their size was muscle because the hard work on the land but that was't the case with Erica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really expect a answer?\" Her mother asked. \"While you father is gone I expect you help a bit with the chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you only take me? Why did't you take a sister or brother? Then he or she could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we tried. We're still trying. Perhaps you get one. Now we need to get back to work. That includes you too young lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm hungry!\" Erica whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess we can take a short break and get something to eat. I'm kind of hungry too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica's mother knew her daughters big appetite so she made sure there was enough food on the table so she could also eat herself. Erica started stuffing her face. If you saw her eat she looked more like a pig then a girl. Erica had totally no manners but at the other hand her father also did't had any manners when it was about eating so she did't really blamed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't figure out where you putting it all.\" Her mother said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my belly!\" Erica yelled. \"Is daddy coming home today?\"' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know sweet hart. That depends on the weather. But I think he will soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut of when the look out shouted: \"Ship! There's a ship coming our way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica's mother (Carol) and even Erica forget their food and went over to the quay. All other people of the village joined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see their sails!\" Someone shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it one of our ships or from somebody else?\" A other asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't tell yet. It's too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the ship came closer they saw it was the ship of their man. They cheered loudly and started waving. A few minutes later she ship went into their harbor. Erica's father, the chief was the first one who jumped out.<br>\r\nErica and Carol ran over to him ans he hugged his wife and daughter. He too was a big guy but it was for a great part muscle. He had a wild brown beard with mustache. A scare under his right eye and black and brown clothing. A sword and dagger at his belt and the strength of a bear. He also more a helmet.<br>\r\n<i>Authors note: The helmet's of Vikings did't have horns. Sure they had helmet's but without horns. The mistake was made when they first looked in viking graves the also found drinking horns. They thought the were originally attached to the helmet's. Later they found out it were drinking horns. So vikings wore helmet's but without horns. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you bring me something Daddy?\" Erica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sweetie, and I also have something for my terrific wife. And tonight... we have a feast. We stole some great things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered. Erica too. She loved viking feasts. There always was lot of food. She was gonna eat herself to the point of bursting and grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Erica knew that at the end of the feast most men would be so drunk that the would fell asleep at the table and woke up with a terrible hangover. However no matter how terrible the hangover was, at the next feast they did it again. With being only 7 years old she only drank fruit juice just like the other kids.. She looked almost drooling at all the delicious meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great!\" Her father shouted. \"We plundered a lot of villages. I will tell you exactly what happen first we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica filled her plate with food while she listened to her father. She enjoyed hearing the stories of her father. She hoped that she once would be able to tell stories about herself. But her father still refused to take her. Because she was a girl, and because she was just seven years old. She could understand that he did't wanted to take her because she was a bit young even while she was tall for her age. But she could't understand why her father did't wanna take her just because she was a girl. After a few years she would be older that would solve the first problem but she was't able to change her gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men I have something important to tell you!\" Her father suddenly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stopped eating, talking and drinking and listened to their chief.

Just for the kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica for once forget the food. An archery contest for the kids. That sounded interesting. But she soon realized most other kids also looked smiling with sparkling eyes. A lot of the young kids practiced archery. Swords and axes were too heavy for them and spears were too long so bows and arrows were the only weapons the younger kids could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there also a prize?\" Delila asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looked curious at her father.  </span></div></div>",

She saw it. How a woman was tied to a pole. Even from this long distance she saw that it was her mother. Clearly. She cried and saw how the people but branches around her feet and put them on fire. She saw how the fire finally also got to her mother. How she was screaming and she finally died and how her corpse kept burning. until there was nothing left then a pile of ashes.<br>\r\nShe cried her eyes dry. She felt exhausted. What now. She had no dad. People probably thought she was a witch. Just like her mother. The witches child. Even if they did't burn her... then what? living on the street? Perhaps being stuffed in a orphan home? Or on the market finding someone who was willing to take her in home? <br>\r\nFour different options. All four not really something you would look forward too. The only other option was... run away. That seemed the best option. She knew very well which plants you could eat. She was used to eat small meals. Her mother lately had trouble making money. She climbed down. Whipped her tears away and started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can be lucky that it's nice weather. Also that I was away looking for spices an heard those men talking.... Why did they burn my mother. She was't a witch. She was a christen. She went to the church. Just like me. It does't make any sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other hand she saw many other ways how to kill witches. She had seen other people who got burned. She water test. Throw someone in the water with a heavy stone. If she came floating to the surface she was a witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm thinking about this, no one ever came floating to the surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also heard something about a scale some where else. People needed to be weighed. If you did't weigh enough you soul had no weight and you got burned. A lot of people moved over there,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have also moved over there too. At the other hand my mother was kind of skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe herself had a normal weight for a girl of her age and size. However she loved eating. At least she loved eating good food. Like the food her mother made... what she would now never make again. Tears started running again. She did't cared. She was all alone. She had no one. Not even a pet or far relative. At least not one she knew about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do now. Just walk until I can't walk anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the sky. It was getting dark. Perhaps it was better to find some shelter. But where? That was a good question. She moaned. She did't really thought this through. Well she did't thought people would look for her. Just a helpless eight year old girl... what could she do? Not much. That's for sure. <br>\r\nEveryone was scared of witches. Even the priests were scared of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I can go to another village. Far from here. Where they don't know who I am, and then I....\" her voice trailed of. No matter in which village she ended up the options were the same. Living on the street, in a orphan home or asking if someone was willing enough to take her in home. Or perhaps they thought a kid that came out of the woods was a witch and they would burn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really get a choice. What then? Stay here in the forest until I die of starvation. It was fine now but... What when it get's winter? I can find fruits, vegetables and nuts but what about meat and fish. I don't know how to hunt for my food. What can I do?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly she got a little bit hope. She saw</span></div></div>",

She walked closer and saw the light was coming from a window in a small house. Lucy thought it was a bit strange. Who would want to live all alone in a forest. It was still a long walk to the nearest village. <br>\r\nShe came closer and smelled something delicious. Lucy had a normal weight for somebody her age and height, but she was't happy with that. She would rather have a big round fat belly. Like some of those rich girls had. Who were munching on candy from the moment she woke up until the moment they went to bed. They never shared a single crumb with other people. Lucy did't liked them but she could't deny they looked good. She also liked eating but the past years her mother barely made any money. She was used to eating small meals. She could live on them but she would rather eat huge meal. Really pig out and eat until you belly was round and full.<br>\r\nBut could she come in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try. What harm could it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the door. She heard some noise. Suddenly the door opened. She saw a young woman. She must be somewhere in her twenties. long blond straight hair, a tiny waist but with big boobs. She wore a long black dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well. What have we here?\" She asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... well hello. Eh could I come in? I'm lost in the woods and it's getting dark and I have no food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh poor thing. Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside it was warm. there was a fire burning in the fireplace. Lucy loved fireplaces. She many times fell asleep in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wait here. I will be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy went sitting in a big chair and looked around. There was another big chair in the room a desk covered with papers wit a small chair. The she saw shelf's filled with books. Books? The only ones she knew who could read were priests and doctors. Some other shelf's were filled with strange liquids ans some jars. All labeled. But she could't read. She wondered what was in them. But she knew that not everything was what it seemed.. She looked at the sealing and saw some plants hanging upside down. That was normal. She did it at home all the time. With her mother...<br>\r\nShe could't help it and started to cry. Suddenly the woman walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Did you hurt yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked at the woman. She seemed so worried. Lucy did't care anymore and between cries she told her mother was burned because people believed she was a witch. The woman listened calmly without interrupting her. After she was done the woman tried to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible. So that's why you were walking alone in the woods. Where were you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I have no relatives. Not that I know. I'm now known like the daughter of a witch. If I come back they probably burn me as well. If not then were can I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those lies about witches. They're not so bad.\" The woman said. \"I'm sort of a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a witch?\" Lucy asked and got the feeling like it got colder in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm nothing like the stories they tell. I don't eat or hurt kids or babies, I can't spread diseases, I can't make the milk sour, I can't let the harvest go to waste and I don't worship the devil. I don't have a witch sign and I don't want to hurt anybody. Perhaps the're witches who can do that but not me. Sure I make potions and ointments but those are all to help people. But if you do that people still think you're a witch and still think you're evil. That's why I live alone here. Deep in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have so many. I believe you have enough for a entire village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there are three people who know I live here. My brother, the doctor and his assistant. I give my potions and ointments to them. They sell them and use the money to buy food and clothes and other stuff I need and give that to me. Oh I almost forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left and returned with a plate full of food. It smelled delicious and Lucy was hungry so she ate. The woman sat down and looked at her and said:\"You can stay here if you like. Become my student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy stopped chewing for a moment. Become the student of a witch. That sounded idiot. But at the other hand... if she really was't evil. Besides where else could she go? And she knew some things about spices, potions and ointments. From her mother. But still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I need to do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I will teach you how to make potions and you need to help me with that. Help finding spices and plants. Help in the garden. I will also teach you how to read and write.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Write? Is't that only for priests and doctors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should it be only for them? I believe you will learn it easily. You seem pretty bright. I also have a extra room you can have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this food? Do I get more delicious food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you will. I will also teach you how to cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough. Lucy would stay here and become some sort of witch. A good one.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trudy was model for some time now. Strange how the life could go. A artist saw her once and wondered if he could paint her. For some money of course. Trudy's mother said yes and he made a beautiful painting of her. He told some others about her and since then Trudy was asked sometimes to be a model. Trudy was good at sitting or standing without moving. That was exactly what the artists wanted. The fact Trudy was fat also helped. Fat girls were seen like beautiful.<br>\r\n<i>Look at the paintings of Rubens and Bortero</i><br>\r\nTrudy did't mind to pose in nice clothes or even nude like now. Artists liked to paint her because she was adorable and looked kind of pretty. Some artists also used her just to see how a fat body looked like. After that they made it a bit taller and added a bit more female curves and finally they made a beautiful paining of a voluptuous woman. <br>\r\nTrudy did't really mind if they painted her or more adult version of her body. She did't mind painting of her in fancy clothes or without clothes. But she hated bad paintings. She did't mind strange things but abstract things was something she disliked. Paintings must look like something. Not just some colors together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. I'm done.\" The artist said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy looked at the painting and smiled. It was a garden. Full with existing and non existing plants. Also a pond with a waterfall. There was she. Next to the water. one leg pulled up and the other leg hanging down. With her beautiful curly dark brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks good. I think this is really your best work.\" Trudy said and started to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you. It's time for you to get home. It's kind of late.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy pulled down her shirt. It was getting very tight and showed her bellybutton. Not that she minded that. It was snowing outside. She put on her jacket, hat and mittens. She almost wanted to go when she suddenly remembered the most important thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh the money please.\" She asked sweetly and polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Oh and I have something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He handed her a envelope with the money and gave her a chocolate bar. That made Trudy always smile. She loved chocolate. She ate a lot of it. That was part of why she gotten pretty fat. But that was a good thing because people thought she was beautiful and artists wanted fat ladies and girls to paint. If she kept this body she would stay a model. As long if fat girls were seen like beautiful. But how could that ever change? <br>\r\nTrudy stepped outside. She heard the snow crack under her feet.She fast started to waddle home. She was also hungry. Well her mother always saved some food for her. Trudy was one member of the family that made money. She was very proud that her daughter was a model and made sure she got enough food and a bit more so she kept her beautiful curvy body. <br>\r\nAfter a short walk she arrived home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there's my beautiful modeling daughter. How was it sweet hart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Said Trudy and handed her mother the envelope. \"Can I have dinner? I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can.

The one thing that was absent from her plate were veggies, Trudy loathed them. They didn't meet the girl's palate and since they weren't fattening her mother didn't force them upon her, more room for fatter foods she figured. Trudy inhaled her meal to her mother's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm now weres my dessert?\" asked the gluttonous girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sweety I would never forget that.\" replied the mother bringing out a chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its looks delicious.\" said Trudy with eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the model finished her cake, she leaned back in contentment and rubbed her belly, while her mother began cleaning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you just sit there Trudy and let your dinner settle.

However no matter how big the dress was it was still very tight. At least for her. But when she took her pose she saw a few girls outside running around. She was thinking about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Trudy! I wanna see a smile. You're a happy princess. You get a lot of food and that clearly shows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's just that... well I saw some other girls. They look awful. So skinny you can see their bones. I don't understand why don't they want to become beautiful and fat just like me? They would just need to stop running around so much and eat more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Trudy... some of those girls can't get fat. They could stop running around. But they can't eat more because... There is no more. They don't have any more food. But if they had more food they might wanna get fat. You're so lucky you're already fat and with the money you make you earn enough money to stay fat. But a lot of other people don't have that much luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's terrible. Can't we help them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. There are so many. If we would give them money we would become poor ourselves. Even if we would get a lot of money we need to split it between so many people that they would't get much money anyway. No we can't do much. But the rich ones. The mayor, the dukes, the church. They could do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy got a bit scared. She was raised with the Bible. That god made people after his own image. Saying that the church could something but did't... that sounded almost like he had no faith in God. But she must admit that the church had a lot of valuable sculptures and paintings. And those priests also seemed to be well fed. And they had barrels full of wine. God was good, but the she doubted the priests were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they make thieves this way. That's too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do they akes thieves that way.\" Trudy asked without moving lips what was the reason why she did't said the M. (It's impossible to say the M, B or P without moving your lips, try it)<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well if people don't have enough food and get very hungry they do anything to get food or money to buy food. even.... steal it. I know it's wrong but sometimes people have no choice. If you have a wife and seven kids and you only get a nickle for working in the mines it's hard to get enough food for them. Working in the mines is also pretty dangerous work. Sometimes there are accidents and some die. Other have problem with breathing. If a man dies what's gonna happen to his wife and seven kids? How are they gonna get food. Beg for money or steal it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy had done enough modeling to look like a happy, joyful princess. But deep in her hart she felt a bit bad for those people. But she did't think she could do much about it. Besides it was't like she did nothing. She worked for her money. Fine it was just sitting still but she got money for it. A lot of those other girls were't able to sit still for a minute.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girl had long blonde hair, blue eyes, snow white skin, and was bulging in her taut dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um are you the painter?\" the girl inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I am. You must be Julia, please come in.\"  the artist replied bringing the plump girl in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trudy this is Julia, she will be modeling with you for this painting. She's new to this so try to make this easy.\" the painter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining in position Trudy complied and worked beside Julia.  The two models assumed their positions as the painter captured the image. Trudy had become rather professional but Julia was fresh to this work and had trouble remaining still but it didn't become problematic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the painter was finished. \"Good work you two, here's your payment.\" he said handing the girls a generous payment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked out and Trudy wanted to talk to Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Julia I noticed that you're still new to modeling.\" Trudy stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've been trying to get into modeling for some time now but I was constantly getting turned down for being too skinny.\" Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too skinny!?

But my mother stumbled upon an old family recipe while looking for spare money. Turns out that the recipe was really cheap and super fattening.

I think I can remember what's in it. Why? Do you want to become fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that too... but what I really wanted to do is to help those poor underfed girls. They look like walking skeletons. I think they would be much happier if they were fat. But they can't afford more food. But with that recipe they can become fat. So they look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea... but... don't you think they will take our jobs? If they become fat, Artists will ask them to pose for paintings instead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you worry a bit too much. Besides I wonder if those girls are able to sit still for a minute. I also don't know if they're fine to pose naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let some artists paint you naked?\" Julia asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Why would't I? It pays good. There are so many artists who paint their models naked.  So what's the point. It's just one more painting between all the others. I don't really mind. As long if they pay enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's why we do this for is't it? The money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... the money is important, it's the reason why we do this of course. But I'm fat and I'm proud at it. I love it to show my curves, and I don't mind it to sit still for some time. I don't have to do anything. Just sit still and do nothing, and I get paid for that. Easy way to make money. If that has to be naked so be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find it hard to sit still for so long.\" Julia asked. \"Not that I'm that active... but to sit totally still is different  from just being a bit lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I feel bad for those other girls in the village that are't able to get fat like us. With that recipe the at least have the chance to gain some weight. I can also gain a few extra pounds. That's always a good thing.\" Trudy said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it's better for those girls to gain some weight. But I just hope they don't take our jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't trust me. Or perhaps we need to pose with them. That's no drama. Now tell me the recipe. I have a pretty good memory. Especially when it's about food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right listen carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia told exactly what she needed and Trudy listened carefully. She repeated everything once to be sure she remembered everything right. But finally Trudy had the recipe fresh in her memory. She thanked Julia and waddled home. <br>\r\nOutside it was white. Trudy could see her breath. She was happy she did't lived so fat fro this artist. She hated the cold.. Cold was nice when you were inside by a nice warm fire. Not if you needed to be outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Trudy nice you're home.\" Her mother said when Trudy walked in.\"How was it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I need to work with another model. She's new in this world but she's nice. She even give this recipe. She said it's for very fattening food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy repeated the recipe and Trudy's mother carefully wrote it down. She always tried ways to make her daughter fatter. Trudy smiled but now she also needed a way to make sure the other girls knew about this too.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Sure most of them were stick thin to start with. Sure they gained some pounds. But before they were fat or even chubby that might take a while. But each gained a noticeable amount of pounds. They looked a lot better then first and they did still run around but not so much like before. However everybody was happy with the gaining of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Trudy I want that you are almost naked. But we use a silk scarf to hide your private parts. A bit like Amor. You know. That cupid that shoots arrow's through the harts of people. That makes them fall in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy knew Amor but found it a bit strange idea. A lot of people still believed in god and the devil but that a cupid shoot an arrow at you to make you fall in love... no she did't believe that. But it was a nice story. But as far if she knew bows and arrows were only used to kill people or animals. Or a fun thing at a contest. But even then still very dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind if I have to do it naked.\" Trudy said calmly while she stripped. \"I posed naked before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not necessary. But I'm glad you could pose for me. You're a lovely girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy smiled but she was glad she could pull her clothes out. They were awfully tight lately. She also knew very well why. She really needed to ask her mother for bigger clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like posing. At least for good artists. You make nice panting's. But I really hate abstract art. Or paintings were you need to see something in. I never understood those things. Show something in some shapes. I like just a normal painting where you can clearly see something in. Just some people having a picnic. Or young girls together in a garden. It's not wrong to use some fantasy but please make a good paining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do my best.\" The artist said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also once met an artist who painted me sitting on a flower and added wings on my back. Like a pixie. That was also fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Trudy. I heard there's a famous artist coming to town. I think he would love it to paint you. He hardly smiles and is't very friendly but he's a very good artist and pays very well. Should I tell him about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I would like that.\"Trudy said and took a pose with the scarf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right now. Don't move. Hold that pose.

Her body, along with her long brown hair emanated feminine grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annndddd Finished!

I might have given it to some other girls.\" Trudy said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I don't know that. I also talk with other mothers. I know they got the recipe, and they're all very happy with it. It's cheap, easy to make and it gives them and their kids some extra fat, what makes them look a lot better, and they also have some extra fat for when they don't have much food. Also a nice layer of fat protects you against the cold. So they're all very happy with it. All girls are happy that they are becoming fat and pretty. Everyone is happy with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone. I just met a girl. A real twig. However she was angry at me. angry that I gave other girls the recipe. Because since they gained weight they became less active and rather sit around playing with their fat. She called it dumb fat. I thought she should fatten up, and you know what she said? She said she liked being thin. I don't see how that is possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so one girl is angry at you. That does't matter. You made a lot of families very happy. So many people are happy with this. Only one girl is angry. That's a price I'm willing to pay. A lot of others too. Don't care about one person who's angry while you made so many other persons happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess I should be happy about that.\" Trudy said and smiled weakly. \"Oh before I forget I heard a very skilled artist is coming to town. He pays a lot of money, aaaaand, maybe he wants to paint me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's great honey. I'm so proud at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but mom... I might need some... bigger clothes. Mine are awfully tight. Probably because of all the extra weight,\" Trudy said and slapped her belly making it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother did't seem happy. She loved Trudy and did't want to deny her clothes, but clothes were expansive. She would probably outgrew them soon too. But she could of course make her clothes a bit bigger. That would't be to hard.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

This little piggy stayed home.\" Trudy started to sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lucas always liked it when Trudy was singing that song. It was the best way to calm him down. Suzy went sitting with him on the couch. Lucas looked smiling at his sister. He leaned for over and landed on her fat belly what was his favorite part to lay on. He liked it to be on his sisters soft warm fat. Even while it was a bit harder now because of her recent meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just hungry. I make a bottle for him.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she was doing that the doorbell rang. Her mother looked outside. wondering who was coming at this hour. She returned later with a letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess another artist wants you to be his model.\" Her mother said and fast read the letter and gasped for air. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Mommy?\" Trudy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas looked a bit grumpy because Trudy stopped singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A famous artist want to paint you. You won't believe how much he's going to pay you. He wants to paint you, but he also want to hire you for his class. He teaches art to students. So he want to hire you twice. One time for him alone, and one time for his entire class. You don't have a problem with that do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why I would have a problem with that.\" Trudy mumbled.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"That's a good thing. Because this man is gonna pay you a lot. He heard from you from some other artists and he really wants you. But you never been a model for a entire class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see that like a problem. It's not very different from what I do normal. It's just a few people instead of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas started to softly punch Trudy since he wanted her started sing again. But he was just a baby so his punches were't really hard and Trudy was a bit to occupied to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I'm so glad you doing this. You don't mind doing this do you? Because if you don't I would't force you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Really mom I'm fine doing this. All I need to do is to sit still and don't move. That's pretty easy, and I get paid for it. If I need to do it in fancy dresses or naked I don't really care. However especially around now I like it when they have a warm room. It's not nice to pose naked in a cold room. It gives me goosebumps.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah I understand what you mean. I'll tell him that you do it. It's in a few days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy suddenly noticed the punches of Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. All right now where were we. This little piggy had rose beef to eat. This little piggy had nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother came back with a bottle for Lucas. While she gave him the bottle she looked at her daughters fat belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in just a few days but let's try to make that belly in the meantime a little bit bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that!\" Trudy said with a grin.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was known as Leopoldo Gepetto, he was a famous artist known for his beautiful paintings of fat girls. However he hasn't had a new painting for over ten years. So it was a surprise to Trudy that she received a letter from him. Trudy arrived at the address that was written in the letter and knocked on the door. A while later it opened revealing a young man in his late twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello are you mr Gepetto?\" asked Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm his nephew Ezio. I help take care of my uncle\" said Ezio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EZIO WHO'S AT THE DOOR?\" asked a voice yelling in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the model that you request for today uncle\" said Ezio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh then send her in\" said Leopoldo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio then led Trudy to a large room where she met Leopoldo Gepetto who is in his early seventies, had long white beard and was bald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be Trudy, please to meet you\" said Leopoldo as he shook her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please to meet you too sir. So what would you like me to do?\" asked Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first I would like you to wear this toga and then just lay on that couch\" said Leopoldo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy did as instructed and wore the toga and laid on the couch. After a few hours Leopoldo was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe that this is my finest work\" said Leopoldo as he showed the painting to both Ezio and Trudy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he showed the painting to them both he paid Trudy and gave her two chocolate bars much to her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright here's the money I owe you. Now you do remember that I also want you to model from my class tomorrow right?\" asked Leopoldo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do\" said Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, then I will see you again tomorrow\" said Leopoldo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said Trudy then walk back home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Trudy walked through the snow covered streets. Snow flakes were falling from the sky. Trudy wrapped her scarf tight around her head. She hated how cold it was. She saw a few kids throwing snow balls. They seemed to have fun. But Trudy had work. She was kind of proud that she worked. Her mother did't earned much money but raised two kids on her own. She did lover her and her brother and was very good for them. So she was happy she earned some money for the three of them. The earning of the money also made it able for her to eat enough to keep a big belly what most artists liked to paint. She must admit she also liked having a big belly. She knew Lucas liked it also and her mother also liked her big belly. Everyone won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah here it is.\" Trudy said and looked at a big building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up the steps and knocked on the door. The door opened and a tall man looked down at the little figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you?\" He asked with a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I'm eh... Trudy. I was supposed to be model for a class. Could you tell me were that is?\" Trudy asked while she brushed the snow out of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course miss. It's on the second floor. up the stairs first door at your right. Class 101.\" He said with his deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I think I can find it then.\" Trudy said and walked up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised how big it here was. A lot of artists only had a small attic. It was hard becoming a famous artist. Only a few of them really became famous in history. But She probably would never be named. Perhaps century's later people would see paintings were she posed for. The people would know the artist, the name of the painting and what was on it. But no one would knew the name of the model. Of course not everybody had a model. Some people just draw things from out their heir head. But some people really painted strange things. She did't mind painting things that were't real but she did't really like paintings that made totally no sense.<br>\r\nThere was the door. She knocked and walked inside. She saw a lot of men looking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah great. There we have our model.\" Leopoldo Gepetto said who was sitting on a chair in front of the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the men had a white canvas in front of them and paint on a board and a few brushes. Some also had a tiny very sharp knife. Trudy knew they used that to scratch away paint. She looked at Leopoldo Gepetto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I need to wear? Nice dress? Toga? Nude? I don't care.\" Trudy said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought about it. I Thought about it very long. I think it's best if you pose naked but with a scarf. Something like that little kid with wings that shoot's arrows that make people fall in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean Amor.\" Trudy said. \"Yeah I know a bit how he looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stripped and smiled when she saw a big fire burning in the fire place. And she needed to pose right in front of it. She let Leopoldo Gepetto put the scarf around her. <br>\r\nThen all started painting. Trudy hold perfectly still she only blinked a few times with her eyes but apart from that she did't moved.<br>\r\nLeopoldo walked from one artist to another. Sometimes complaining a bit, sometimes giving advice and sometimes complementing them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can clearly see that  by my belly. Well one artist saw me one day and asked me to be his model. I liked the work. Just sitting still. Don't move... that's all and you get paid for it. So he told to some of his friends who told their friends and so on. Now I pose for ever artist who pays me. As long if they pay me I pose in whatever they want. Dresses, fantasy clothing even naked if they want me too. I don't really care. At least those way I make money. That way my mom is able to take care of me and my brother. She also makes sure I eat enough to keep my big belly since that's what most artists like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well my family is pretty rich. I always liked it to paint.

Suddenly she remembered what it was. Today she had a date. Well a date was maybe a big word for it. But at least she would hang out with somebody else that happened to be a boy. However Al did't looked bad and seemed pretty nice. <br>\r\nShe rolled out of bed like a beached whale and looked at herself in her mirror. She liked her body. She never had been a thin girl. According to her mother she had always been a bit fat. But since she started to become a model she really gained. Thanks to her mother who wanted her daughter to stay fat so she stayed a model and could make some money. Trudy was happy with that. She liked her rubbing thighs, wobbling butt, roly-poly arms, puffy pink cheeks, second chin, and even her chest that even had fat on it so it seemed she already got a start of some boobs. But the biggest part was her big round belly that artists always liked it to paint and she liked to show it.<br>\r\nShe walked over to the closet. She thought about a dress. It would look nice but outside it was freezing so she decided to stick with some normal clothes. Besides it was't like they were boyfriend and girlfriend... at least not yet.<br>\r\nShe brushed her hair and went downstairs and was greeted by Lucas. Who tried to say something however she had't a clue what it mend. Her mother saw her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Trudy. Are you ready for your date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm ready. But I'm still a bit nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Trudy I'm sure he's even more nervous. Don't you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps.\" Trudy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered her bread with jelly and stuffed it in her mouth. Normally she would eat more but she decided not to. Who knows what Al might do. She played a bit with Lucas to kill time before she finally heard the doorbell. She ran over to the door and opened it.<br>\r\nAl was standing in the doorway. Normal warm clothes just like Trudy. He smiled at her and she smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you ready to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I am. Mom I'm going!\" She yelled and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you live here with your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Trudy said while they walked. \"She's was happy with the money I make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you give the money to your mother. But it's your money. not from your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother gave birth to me! Me and my brother. She cooks for me, takes care for me, I'm just able to tie my own shoelaces. With the money she buys food, clothes and the rent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah if you put it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through the park. Trudy must admit she liked seeing the park covered in white snow. However she did't really liked all that walking. She did't really liked exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we sit for a minute? I'm getting tired.\" Trudy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh of course.\" Al said and shoved the snow of a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit it looks nice. But I'm not such a fan of walking around.\" Trudy admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Al asked. \"Then what do you like except modeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeel. I like to eat.\" Trudy said wit  grin showing her teeth.      <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Now then I can take you....\"   </span></div></div>",

Although calling it his house would be an understatement. His place resembles more a small castle rather than a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you live\" said Trudy surprised at the size of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is. Don't forget I come from a rich family, after you\" said Al as he opened the door to let Trudy in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered she still couldn't believe in the hugeness of this place. She looked around to see that there were many pieces of art around and most of them featuring fat women. Alphonse led Trudy to the dining room where he ordered a lot of food for Trudy and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Al, what do your parents do for a living?\" asked Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father is a banker and a pretty successful one at that. But most of the money came from my mother who used to be fat model like you\" said Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\" said Trudy intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you know those paintings of fat women that you saw. That's my mom\" said Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that she used to be a model. So what happened?\" asked Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she got pregnant with my big sister, she decided to retire so she could take care of her. But don't worry her legacy is still strong\" said Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a few years ago my sister has started modelling and is pretty good at it\" said Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a few butlers were entering the room bringing lots and lots of food but before Trudy could begin eating she and Alphonse heard somebody say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm that smells delicious\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked to see who it was and it was.</span></div></div>",

Sure she changed a bit in the years but you could still clearly see that she was the woman at the paintings. She might be retired but she did't lost her figure. She was still very fat. A huge Belly with some big boobs resting on top of it. Rubbing thighs and a wobbling butt with some extra meat on it. Even her upper arms looked like pillows. Her neck was gone and she had bowl pink cheeks and three chins. She waddled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Al. Where is all this food for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi mom. I told you I met a girl. Well this is her. Her name is Trudy. She's just like you a fat model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Trudy. Nice to meet you. I'm the mother of Alphonse. So you're a fat model. Good good. The art world need people like us.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy was a bit surprised seeing this woman but suddenly her belly rumbled. She remembered her food again. She smiled at Al's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I see you're hungry. Go ahead dear eat. Eat as much if you want. You can always ask for more. I like seeing young girls enjoy a good meal. Like my Ari\u00ebl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy decided not to wait and started to stuff her face. she pushed one kind of food after another in her hungry mouth. Al told him one of the best chefs was working for him. She must admit he was right. The food tasted fantastic. She wolfed everything down. Al did't take a single bite. He just looked at her while she was eating and seemed to enjoy it. His mother also looked smiling at her. Trudy could't stop eating. It all tasted to good. So she ate, and ate, and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Trudy leaned back in her chair. The table was covered with empty plates. Trudy had eaten everything until the last crumb. She  had a silly grin on her face and was clearly stuffed. Her belly was swollen and bloated. Full of food. Sure she felt a bit pain from eating so much but it was a good kind of pain. She also felt proud for eating so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Trudy I did't know you could eat this much.\" All said. \"I did't thought you would be able to eat all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did.\" Trudy said still with a silly grin, the next moment she let out a huge belch that sounded way too hard for such a little girl. However Suzy was't that little anymore. Sure she was still short but nobody could call her little \"Oops excuse me.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The footsteps grew louder and louder until she saw a HUGE figure in the doorway. This girl was 15 years old and was triple Alphonse's mother size. You name it triple belly size, triple breast size even triple arms size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ari\u00ebl\" said Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Al's sister!!\" though Trudy as she just stared with her jaw dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ari\u00ebl was entered the room Trudy noticed four female servants who were helping her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost at the table miss Ari\u00ebl just a few more steps\" said one of the servants. When Ari\u00ebl arrived at the table she sat on four chairs and ordered some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ari\u00ebl darling I thought you were asleep\" said Al's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was mother but then I smelled something delicious and that made me hungry. Oh who is this?\" asked Ari\u00ebl as she noticed Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Trudy. She's the model I met yesterday\" said Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you're Alphonse's girlfriend\" said Ari\u00ebl making both Al and Trudy blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" said Al as he punched his sister, although Ari\u00ebl didn't feel a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax little brother I was only teasing\" said Ari\u00ebl to Alphonse and then turned to Trudy. \"It's so nice to see such a young girl with a healthy appetite unlike those skin and bones little girls I see all the time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much\" said Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants then brought the food to the dining room and Ari\u00ebl began to eat the food in a fast but civilized manner. She would eat the food as fast as it was brought to her. Within minutes she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that was simply delicious\" said Ari\u00ebl as her servants rubbed her huge belly. She then looked outside a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my look at the snow outside. It reminds me so much for the days me and my brother would go outside and play in the snow. Say why don't we play outside right now\"said Ari\u00ebl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay and maybe Trudy could join us\" said Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it sounds like fun\" said Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then went and put on some warm clothes for outside. Trudy noticed that the servants who were helping Ari\u00ebl walk were helping her putting her warm clothes on and when they were done they put on warm clothes themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got outside they...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trudy opened her mouth wide to taste it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do you wanna do?\" Al asked. \"Throwing snowballs, building a snowman, sledge riding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A snowman!\" Trudy yelled. \"I want to build a snowman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That sounds like fun. A snowman. Then I don't have to move so much.\" Ari\u00ebl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Why don't you two start and I get a carrot. Oh and girls... the carrot is for the snowman so don't eat it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Trudy said. \"I don't like vegetables. I like them even less raw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I eat everything!\" Ari\u00ebl said proudly like it was something fantastic. \"I'm always happy when I have something in my mouth. I like eating. Well you can see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy smiled friendly. Ari\u00ebl seemed pretty nice but Trudy was very jealous at her. At her huge size. normally she was always the fat girl. Or at least fatter then all the others. But Ari\u00ebl was so much more. Fine she was about two times Trudy's age but still Trudy was jealous at how fat she was. Especially at her boobs. Sure she knew she would get them when she would get older. Trudy did have some start because of how fat she was. That gave here a head start of some boobs. Of course it was only fat and she knew that but still it was there but it was nothing compared to what Ari\u00ebl had. But anyway Trudy hide how jealous she was and acted nice to Ari\u00ebl. After all, Ari\u00ebl acted nice to her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also like eating.\" Trudy said with a smile. \"You saw those empty plates? Food is all in my tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well then I guess I need to be careful or else you're gonna be bigger then me. Well you're at the right path shorty. But It will take some time before you reach my size. I worked five-teen years to get this body. It's fantastic and beautiful but it's hard to move around with. You need to realize that. I have four people here who help me. I think it's very nice they help me. Sure they get paid for it but still they do it. If you don't have any people who help you... it's a burden. I can't walk on my own, I can't get out of bed on my own, I can get dressed on my own. I don't mind! I'm happy with my size but that's because I have help. If you don't get the help you need to think twice about getting this size. But you sure could gain a bit more before you get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy was a bit shocked about what Ari\u00ebl said. Everything what she said was true. Sure she liked being fat but she did't had any servant who could help her get around like Ari\u00ebl. At the other hand... she could still move around. She walked to every artist who wanted to paint her. Sure she did't liked it to walk but she did it. It was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I guess you have been overweight you entire life.\" Trudy said while she started making a big ball of snow for the snowman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Even when I was a baby I was fat and hungry. My mother stimulated that of course and fed me lot's of fattening food. I was already over 200 pounds at the age of five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl suddenly walked out with a carrot. He also had small pieces of coal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every thing all right here?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah everything is all right.\" Trudy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy decided not to worry about her mobility. It was't a problem yet. If it did become a problem... well she would worry about it then.   <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

First we walked a bit through the city. But when I told him I liked it to eat he took me to his house. There's a chef and he made me a lot of food and I... ate it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother already thought Trudy looked a bit fatter then before. She had an eye for detail. Especially when it was about the weight or size of her daughter.<br>\r\nTrudy and her mother went sitting at the dinner table while Lucas was playing with his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened after wards?\" Her mother asked a bit worried. \"What did he think about you eating so much food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to much. I think. His mother used to be a big model too. She's pretty fat. But then I met his sister. She was a massive size. She was huge. I mean really huge. She needed four other people to get around. Compared to her I'm a thin girl. She was defiantly morbidly obese. If there's something beyond that she is it. Her name is Ari\u00ebl. If you see how much and how fast she's eating you won't believe it. But sh\u00e9's pretty nice. She was very friendly to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled kind of relieved. She was a bit worried that Alphonse maybe would be a bit disgusted if he saw Trudy eat. But if his sister ate more and faster then Trudy he had no reason to be disgusted by Trudy. However she was surprised hearing there was a girl fatter then her Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She even asked me to join her tomorrow. She's posing for an artist. I could come. Just too... watch. Would be fun to see it for once from the other side. And who knows perhaps he wants to hire me for a different painting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother nodded. How more artists would see here how more chances there were someone wanted to paint her, and how more people wanted to paint her how more money she made. She was proud her daughter made money like a big model. She knew enough woman who became whores working in the streets at night to earn a few penny's to survive. She felt bad for them. It was't that the wanted to be whores. But they needed the money. You did't need education or something else to be a good whore. Some even took their daughters if they were old enough. She was happy that would never happen to her or her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you had a fun date and had a lot to eat. That's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy took a bite  of her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I had fun. He's a nice guy. And his mother and sister are pretty friendly too. I would't mind meeting him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas looked with a confused look at his face at his sister and mother. He did't had a clue where they were talking about. But at his age there was't much he did understood or cared about.   <br>\r\nHer mother looked smiling at her but looked at her big belly and how her shirt started tearing at the sides. Of course she wanted Trudy to become fat but clothes were expansive.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the artist painted Trudy couldn't help but admire the professionalism of Ari\u00ebl. After a couple of hours the artist was done and Ari\u00ebl was putting her regular clothes on with help from her servants. When they were done they were getting out of the room before the artist stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute I would like to talk to both of you\" said the artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Ari\u00ebl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Saturday I would like both of you to come back here so I can paint both of you together\" said the artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that will be splendid\" said Ari\u00ebl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I would like that\" said Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, then I will see you both on Saturday\" said the artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got outside they waited for their carriages to arrive.

Not really caring about manners but neither did Ari\u00ebl both fat girls stuffed their face. Ari\u00ebl had a bigger mouth and more experience but was so fat she had more trouble moving her arms. Trudy was smaller but was also a good eater and could faster bring the food to her face. It slowly became a sort of competition.<br>\r\nAlphonse and her mother both noticed this and enjoyed watching this while more food was brought in and  empty plates were taken away but Trudy and Ari\u00ebl did't really noticed, Both had only one thing in mind... eat.<br>\r\nBut while they were eating Trudy's too tight shirt finally reached it's limit. it ripped at the front right in the middle. Trudy did't noticed or else did't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Trudy has a good appetite.\" Their mother said. \"I'm sure she's a good model and stays one. You really like her don't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Al said. \"She's nice friendly and fun to hang out with and she looks really good too. I also like it to paint her. By the way, the artist wanted to paint both of them next Saturday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Well it's nice that she likes Trudy. Ari\u00ebl does't have any friends thanks to her size. Not that I mind it but it's fine that she finally has somebody she can hang out with. Even if it is just with modeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And eating. She does a pretty good job.\" Alphonse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah perhaps. But she can't beat Ari\u00ebl. She can perhaps keep up with her but finally she'll be full before Ari\u00ebl. But of course Ari\u00ebl is older and has a bigger stomach to fill. Trudy needs to become a lot bigger before she can beat Ari\u00ebl. But I must admit she does a pretty good job. I never saw a seven year old kid eat so much except for Ari\u00ebl. I already noticed yesterday she could eat a lot when you took her home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Finally Trudy's too tight pants also split but Trudy was still too busy eating to notice or care.<br>\r\nAlphonse's and Ari\u00ebl's mother was right. Trudy finally got full. She laid back in her chair while she still had some food in her mouth. With a lot of will power she was able to swallow the last food in her mouth but after that she was really full to the brim. She could't remember she ever ate so much before in her entire life. Her belly was swollen and bloated. She also felt a bit of pain from eating so much but it was a good kind of pain.<br>\r\nAri\u00ebl was still eating. Trudy knew very well from the  beginning she would't be able to eat more then Ari\u00ebl but still she was a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you have some problem with your clothes.\" Ari\u00ebl said between two bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy then noticed her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw well they were too tight anyway, and you said I could have some old clothes from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I did. Say could you get some from my old clothes when I was about seven years old. I believe they're still in a box in the attic.\" She said to a servant who went to get them right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy smiled while Ari\u00ebl kept eating.  </span></div></div>",

Kind of easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah a little kid could do it.\" Ari\u00ebl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not my little brother Lucas. He can't sit still for second. Except when he's sleeping. But I don't like exercise. I think you're not a great fan of exercise yourself.\" Trudy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you think I got this huge beautiful body from doing exercise. No my friend. I got this more from eating a lot and eating more instead of exercise. So you have a little brother. Just like I have. Al is a good little brother. He probably can get a job as artist and if he becomes famous he can earn a lot of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some artist I know only have one small attic room.\" Trudy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they need to have their first breakthrough. Some of them get famous once they passed away. Well that's the risk. You would make a funny couple. A artist and a model. Kind of funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he paints pretty good. Trudy said. \"Good thing too because I really hate bad paintings. What I also dislike is abstract art I saw sometimes and honestly I don't understand what people like about it. But of course that could just be me. But I think it looks like it's made by a kid. Or also some artists that paint nothing at all. Some of them just throw some paint on a canvas and call it art while I don't see any shape in it. They call it something while nobody can see that in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I get that. It must mean something. I also dislike paintings that made totally no sense. With things or animals that just without any reason float in the air or things were you don't know if they go in or out.. It just makes no sense. I don't like that kind of art. It must mean something. It does't have to be real. If the artist paints some fantasy figures it's fine but it has to mean something. Not just paint things with no reason why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I also don't really like that. However I knew a artist who painted me like a fairy. He panted me and the he added some wings on the panting and some flowers that were pretty big what gave he impression I was tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a painting of a fairy that does make sense. But some people like those strange things. As long if it's painted good. I really don't get those people.\"That's why the world needs us models. So they can make good paintings. We're needed Trudy. Thanks to us they make good paintings of beautiful girls and woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. We are beautiful. We are fat. Most girls I know are skinny twigs. There are't many fat girls. We and you mother are a few of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's more the part that some just don't make enough money to buy enough food to become fat. That's the reason why they're skinny twigs. I feel kind of bad for them. I mean I always got more then enough food. Thanks too the fact that my family is rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime the servants cleaned Ari\u00ebl and Trudy. However Trudy was cleaned a lot easier and faster then Ari\u00ebl. Trudy found it a bit strange when it started but soon she started to like it to be cleaned so she did't have to do anything by herself and could talk with Ari\u00ebl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also nice to once talk with another big girl model.\" Ari\u00ebl said. \"I don't go out much.... you van understand why so I don't have many friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy and Ari\u00ebl were now both cleaned and got out of the tub and servant came with towels. Trudy must admit she liked the towel. It was Probably made from something expansive material. She saw that the servants had a huge towel for Ari\u00ebl. Without a doubt special made for Ari\u00ebls huge body. It would take some time before Ari\u00ebl was rubbed dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go miss.

That could be pretty exhausting. She lifted her shoulders.

Only her mother, and perhaps Lucas. Good he was just a baby now but after eight years he would be a lot bigger. But she could still walk.

Just like me. Most girls in the neighborhood are very thin. I can see their ribs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't have to worry about that with Ari\u00ebl. You won't even feel her ribs. With all that fat around it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fat and the fact she has huge tits. True those are also made with fat. Well I'm sure we will never be able to feel and even less able to see them.\" Trudy said. \"And I don't need to. But what I mean is: I just don't think skinny girls look that good. See those paintings all artists make. That are paintings of fat girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get this the wrong way Trudy but believe me. There are hundreds of artists. But only a few of them are able to really make money with them.  You can become famous and immortal with making paintings if you're good at it and people like your work.  But if not, you won't make any money and no one will ever know or remember your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you're an artist too. Soooo are't you afraid that happens to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought about that too. However Mr. Gepetto thinks I can really make money with it, and he is a famous artist himself so he should know that. I'm still young. Perhaps my paintings have success before I'm an adult. If they do, I don't have to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they don't?\" Trudy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my family is pretty rich. So I'm sure they'll help me if I'm in money trouble. But I'll worry about that later. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I get paid anyway. Does't matter how good or bad the painting is or if people like it. However I hate bad art or that abstract art I mean come on a toddler can make that. But well the artist get's fame from a painting, the painting but the person on it... get's forgotten.\" Trudy said with a fake sad look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I will remember you. Perhaps I can make painting of you and call it my girlfriend Trudy. At least that way people will remind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means if the painting get's famous. Well I guess that will be no problem. If Leopoldo Gepetto want to give you a private lesson again. How do you wanna paint me? Nice dress, playing, having a picnic, nude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse blushed deep red after hearing the last word. He tried to hide it by looking another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Trudy said. \"Don't act so prudish. It's no big deal for me. I have posed naked for artist hundreds of times. Sometimes the want me to wear some fancy clothes and all. Well I don't really care. I wear whatever they want or don't want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you never a bit well... nervous. Posing for a famous artist? Perhaps thousands of people will see that painting of you. Perhaps millions. does't that bother you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really. I posed so many times it became... normal. No big deal. Besides it's not if I see those people. Well this is my house. I can better hurry up. I don't want to miss dinner. I'm not the size of your sister but still I need a lot of food to fill this belly and make it even bigger. See you Al!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse walked back to his house thinking about how he would paint Trudy.   </span></div></div>",

Trudy though that these were memorabilias of Leopoldo Gepetto's very long career. They arrived at his chambers where he greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Trudy it is good to see that you are on time, unlike Alphonse\" said Leopoldo with frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alphonse isn't here yet?\" asked Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he is not.

You can lean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy pulled one leg up the couch and leaned against the arm rest. She smiled perfectly.

With an apple in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGepetto looked carefully at what Al did. And nodded and sometimes mumbled a bit. Trudy sat perfectly still except from blinking with her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Al this is the best thing you ever painted.\" Gepetto said. \"I knew you were good. But when I see this I almost would think about it to  give up painting and make room for the new generation. Almost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Al said while sweat was dripping from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe painted carefully using small brushes. Looking carefully at Trudy. She wondered if he still had trouble that she was naked. She posed naked for so many artist so she really did't care. It was't her first time and surely not her latest. After doing it so many times it became normal. <br>\r\nFinally Al slowly put his brush down and whipped his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done. It's finished.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy fast walked over to them to see the panting. She was surprised how good it looked. It was fantastic. It almost looked real. And Al had been right that the apple in her hand did look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.\" Gepetto said. \"Al this is without a doubt you best painting ever. Would't you agree Trudy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I do. Al this is wonderful... But is has been a while and I became kind of hungry!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure she's chubby but every baby is a bit chubby. However if my mother feeds her the same amount as food like me she will be fat soon. Perhaps she also wants to look like her big sister.\" Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Alphonse and some butlers walked over to them with more food for the three girls. All three started stuffing their face. Ari\u00ebl ate faster and more then Trudy or Julia  but not one of them really noticed. They were all too busy eating. Alphonse enjoyed seeing his two friends and sister eating. The three girls did't leave a single crumb. Every last bite ended up in their bellies. <br>\r\nWhen they were done the bellies of Julia and Trudy were both swollen and bloated. Both felt full and satisfied however their bellies were also hurting a bit but in a good way. Both tried to make their bellies feel better by rubbing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alphonse, go over to Trudy and rub her belly.\" Alphonse's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse fast walked over to Trudy and started to gave her belly rubs. Soon Trudy let out moans of pleasure. This felt so good. However Julia looked a bit disappointed. The mother of Alphonse and Ari\u00ebl noticed and ordered a butler to also rub the belly of Julia. A few moments later all three girls were enjoying belly rubs to digest their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you three sure have a good appetite.\" The mother of Alphonse and Ari\u00ebl said. \"Of course I expected this from my little Ari\u00ebl. I also noticed Trudy could eat a lot but I did't knew how much you could eat. But you have about the same appetite like Trudy. That's nice. Just like my little Ari\u00ebl had around that age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy could't help and giggle a bit. Calling such a huge girl like Ari\u00ebl little did sound a bit funny. Ari\u00ebl was't anything like or even near little. And being this size she probably always used to be fat. Trudy also never had been a thin kid. She was fat as long if she could remember. However she sure noticed she gained a lot of extra weight the past years. Thanks to the money she made her mother was able to buy enough food to keep her fat and make her fatter. Also some artists gave her a bar of chocolate. <br>\r\nHer mother also made some money by cleaning and together with the money Trudy made they had a pretty good life. But not even near as good of Ari\u00ebl and Alphonse. A huge house, servants a bathtub especially made so Ari\u00ebl could fit in. Trudy wondered what would happen to her if she became this big. What would she do. They had no money for servants or huge bathtubs. What then? Dieting? That seemed to her a fate worse then dead. Especially since she hated vegetables, exercise and she also did't really liked thin girls.<br>\r\nBut she decided to worry about that later. She looked down and saw how her belly poked out more then ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew for sure you all three will be great models. Century's from now people will still know you from the paintings. You and the artist. My Alphonse. How did you do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he did a great job!\" Trudy said excited. \"He painted me and it looked terrific. I almost looked real. His best work ever. That's what Mr. Gepetto said.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really well, I'm glad that the money I paid for those lessons is't thrown away.\" The mother of Alphonse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah my baby brother really has talent.\" Ari\u00ebl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for all the food and the belly rubs. But I need to go home.\" Trudy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't walk home so stuffed. You can take the carriage, And Al is coming with you to make sure you arrive home save and sound. You can also take Julia home at the same time.\"  The mother of Alphonse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice. I'm so stuffed I would't really like it to walk now.\" Julia mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butlers helped the two stuffed girls inside the carriage and a few minutes they drove to Trudy's house.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She used to be fat for some time but lately she was getting fatter and fatter. No that she minded. It was also thanks to her mother. Her mother fed her a lot of food to let her girl stay fat so she would stay a model. But she fed Trudy enough to stay fat and gain weight. Well Trudy liked being fat and so did her mom, Lucas, Alphonse, Ari\u00ebl, Julia, Gepetto and a lot of other artists. So everyone was happy. <br>\r\nShe rolled out bed like a beached whale and got dressed. She thanked Ari\u00ebl for her clothes. Her old ones were getting uncomfortably tight. Cutting in her soft flesh, leaving marks, while her fat tried to peek out every opening it could find. But those new clothes fitted her perfectly. She went down stairs. <br>\r\nLucas was already in his high chair making sounds. Trudy wondered when he would start talking. She asked her mother but she always said that it was different for every kid. The table was already full with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow looks delicious mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget young lady, You're going grocery shopping with me. After breakfast. I already asked Miss Glemcer to watch Lucas. So hurry up and eat your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy smiled and started to wolf down her breakfast. If you saw her eating you would almost think her parents starved her. But her fat body told otherwise. Her mother did't mind. It showed that Trudy liked her food. Lucas looked at his sister while he was eating or playing with his food. <br>\r\nHer mother knew Trudy could eat but even she was surprised how much and how fast Trudy ate her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure were hungry.\" Her mother said. \"Well we need to go grocery shopping anyway so....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door opened and a woman with a normal size and gray hair walked inside. She seemed very friendly. When you looked at her face you felt a nice cozy warmth, running through your body. A feeling that you could fully trust her, and tell her everything. She knew terrific stories and had always fun ideas to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Miss Glemcer. So nice you could babysit Lucas. Trudy and I go grocery shopping.\" She bent with a friendly smile over to Trudy. \"Can you also carry some of the food. Since you eat most of it. Don't  forget you hat and mittens. It's cold outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudy and her mother walked through the Streets white from the snow. It was making cracking sounds under their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trudy I noticed yo hang out a lot with that young artist. Eh... I believe it was Al... and his sister. I'm fine if you hang out with them but I would like to meet them. I like it to knew the people my daughter hangs out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course. I don't think that would be a problem. But... I think it's better if we're going over to their house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... sure.

Trudy and her mother were walking around the market to see what kind of food they would like. They made sure to buy a lot of food to last them to the end of the month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people couldn't afford the vast amounts of food Trudy and her mother were buying but due to Trudy's job as a model they can afford it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that's everything on the list\" said Trudy's mother now that they were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really have to buy vegetables though?\" asked Trudy because she hated vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Trudy you know that I have no problem with you getting fat but that doesn't mean you can't eat some healthy food once in awhile\" said Trudy's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\" said Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to make their way home until Trudy smelled something delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom do you smell that?\" asked Trudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do, I wonder where it comes from?\" asked Trudy's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed the smell until they came across a bakery and entered inside.

Her parents own this bakery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but the need to put a lot of time, effort and money in it. But it was worth it. And I like they have a bakery.

She hoped she would fall asleep again. But now she woke up it was hard to fall asleep again. She also knew that everyone needed to help. There was always work to do at a farm. That was just what she hated about it. She knew she was pretty lazy but she did't cared. There was't much she cared about. Except eating and sleeping. That and stories. She loved stories. Telling stories and hearing them. She had a lot of imagination like most young girls of six have. She rubbed over her belly. She was kind of chubby. She liked that. Besides she looked good with this. Guys liked chubby girls. She wished she could get fatter. She dreamed that she could stuff herself once somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up!\" Time to work!\" Her father Marcus yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and pretend she did't heard him. She heard the others getting up and get ready. Maybe they would't notice she was still in bed. If she just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up! You lazy weasel!\" Her sister suddenly yelled in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee. Auw my ear. Did you really have to shout in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I need to make sure you woke up.\" Betta said while getting dressed. \"Since your so lazy! Don't deny it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did't deny it. Olive thought by herself. Fine I am lazy but I'm beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to help dad. Everyone here needs to work. You too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I hate working. I don't want to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does't  work does't eat!\" Her father yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlive kept her mouth shut since she knew that her dad would keep that promise and no food was even worse then hard work. She stretched herself once and  started to get dressed. Well at least it was warm. hard work was far worse when it was wet and cold. <br>\r\nHer mother handed her a basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go pick berries. Don't eat them all like you did last time. We did't forget.\" Her mother (Nana) told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered. She must admit it was a fun time. Just eat the entire time. But it was less fun when her family found out. The punishment was so bad so she would't forget it. She did't. She would eat one single berry. that was for sure<br>\r\nOlive was alone in the part were the berries grew but she liked that. Now she could think of the rest of her story. She liked it to make up stories. She often told them to her grandfather. She would like it to tell them too little kids but she was the youngest. Well she knew her sister was seeing some guy. So perhaps she would get a cousin in a few years <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Around 5300 BC it was very normal to get kids around you teenager years.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nbeing the youngest in a family of ten was sometimes a little hard. Grandma also used to live with them but she died two years ago. And her aunt was pregnant but the kid died at birth. Well that was tragic but it happened more often. She sighed.<br>\r\n Her stomach was rumbling. She would like it if she could become really fat. Well the good thing about the life here was that there was always food. In the old times you need to hunt or look for food. Now it was outside your door and you could even get food in the winter when nothing would grow. Well that was a good thing. With a big appetite like hers it was good to have always some food ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it's soon time to eat since I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her father, Henry, is an industrialist and the owner of the extremely rich Partington Foods Incorporated, the third largest food company in all of Western Europe. Her mother, Jane, is an author, socialite, and designer of dresses in her free time. From these Mary has gained an enormous house, an enormous intelligence, and an enormous love to eat, which has in turn resulted in her becoming rather enormous herself.

Her father enlisted in the Polish Army and was quickly killed during an ill-fated attempt at charging a tank. This filled Anya with rage, and she soon became active in the Resistance, running guns, delivering supplies, and even killing a few Germans herself. Unfortunately, her efforts soon attract the attention of the German High Command- and with it the attentions of a team of Nazi scientists running a study on weight gain... </span></div></div>",

Then I have more room in my tummy for the extra tasty food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary disliked being hungry but she made exceptions for the fantastic parties they had. Then there were tables filled with plates of delicious food and tasty treats and Mary was always able to eat a lot of the food. She had a huge appetite. It clearly showed at her figure. Even while it was now stuffed in a corset. Mary disliked corsets but ladies were supposed to wear corsets and she wanted to be a proper lady. She came from a rick and wealthy family with proper etiquette and manners. She would never do something what would bring shame to the family. <br>\r\nMary was also incredibly spoiled. Since she was the first and only child from a rich family She could get everything her hart desire. Mary was interested in three things only. Food, parties and reading. Even at only the age of 5 Mary was able to read. Mary's intelligence was almost as big as her appetite. She had been home schooled. Mary was very bright and learned very fast and since she was the only child the teacher could easily go a bit faster and Mary picked up reading very fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah honey you look perfect like always.\" Her mother said with a smile. \"What a lovely perfect girl I have. You're with a doubt the best I ever made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well daddy did half of the work.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half of the work? Come on. He gave his... eh... stuff to me. I needed to carry you for nine months in my belly. I looked like a fat cow. I had trouble walking and getting up and down the stairs. By the way you were kicking all the time! after that I needed to get you out. Do you know how painful that was? Man don't know how hard it is for woman to get kids. Even then you still need to raise that child. That's also hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary wondered how much effort her mother put in raising her. It were normally servants or Nanny's who did things like put her in bath, dressing her, cared for her and everything else. Sure her mother loved her in her own way, but if Mary needed help it were the servants and Nanny's who did things for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the kicking mommy. I did't knew it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah It's all right honey. I forgive you. But you look lovely. Are you ready for the party tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready mommy. Oh do we have cake tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Honey. Would't be a party without cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCake was a big weakness of Mary. She loved cake. She was addicted to it. No cake was save around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The corset is a bit tight mommy.\" Mary said pulling a bit at her dress trying to put some less pressure on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a corset honey. It's suppose to be tight. You wanna look good tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do!\" Mary yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl. No can you please leave me alone. I still need to write another chapter for my book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary sighed. Her mother was busy writing and around that time she had no time for her. Her father was busy planning the party. No siblings to play with. What now?     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary with little to do made the short trek to the reading room to occupy herself away from her parents. The reading room contained wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. She was mostly limited to one side of the room too, where the children's books were, but she was quickly approaching an age where she would impress her parents by picking up something more difficult and educational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary liked many subjects, but she had a childish weakness for animals, plants, and food. Mary automatically drifted to a small section with some older cookbooks their kitchen staff wasn't using or whatever Mary asked them to borrow, and she kept them in here. She loved the pictures of the food the best but she also picked up a surprising amount of knowledge from these books. The ingredients alone helped her practice fractions and arithmetic, as well as teaching her about plants, utensils, and other items from around the world, and so forth. This made her parents proud enough to turn around and brag to their friends about how smart Mary was, even if they weren't sure where the knowledge was coming from. The kitchen was also proud of this. They definitely knew how Mary was learning, and they were proud of it. Mary was a darling to all of the chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost everything came back to food for the well-fed child. She saw no reason to change things up today and thumbed through her favorite cookbook. In the desserts chapters, she'd found her favorite recipe - tres leches cake - and worked on memorizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Mary to make herself hungry doing this. Her belly rumbled quietly. My tummy is so cute when it cries, thought Mary, idly stroking her tummy. She liked feeling hungry as long as it wasn't too extreme because next, she would stuff herself, which felt even better, and her tummy made cute noises while it was digesting, too. She thought about what she wanted and called for Lucille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucille, bring me some cake,\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Lucille responds immediately and departs for the kitchen. Despite Lucille's warning about not indulging minutes earlier, the kind, old maid often doted on the Partington's little girl the most herself. Lucille thought of her and cared for her like the granddaughter she never had. It was hard for her to say no to Mary about much, particularly food. It was no wonder how the girl who ate till bursting so often had quite the ravenous appetite. An appetite that only grew the more Mary challenged herself, the more food she packed down, and the older she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's eyes went big when Lucille came back with a huge slice of the milk cake that she was reading about earlier. Lucille gave her the fork. Mary was starting to get hyper like, somehow, the little butterball was going to jump in the air and scream in joy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille stopped her by pressing a finger to Mary's lips. \"Be careful not to stain your clothes,\" she said, \"and we'll keep this snack our little secret.\" The maid pinches Mary's cheek affectionately and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary wasted no time and used the fork to shovel the cake in her mouth in large pieces. Mary sighed, having practically inhaled the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her tummy, already fondly remembering the treat. The cake sat heavily in her tummy though, and it felt good. She wanted more of it. There was no way that one piece was going to satisfy all of the hunger in the large girl, but the party was probably soon. \"Ooof, I want more,\" Mary whines to herself. (Just outside and peeking through the door was Lucille, who giggled quietly to herself when she heard Mary. I overestimate how long that girl can go without food, Lucille told herself as she left to do something else.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Mary stroked her stomach, the more things she found that she disliked. Her tummy was taught, and not the soft puddle of goo she liked to massage. She could feel the bones and lacing holding back a wall of fluff that normally stuck out in a beautiful, big, squishy ball. It dug in so tightly, she hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary tried to take a deep breath. The pressure only made her hurt and made the corset groan with the effort of blubber trying to escape. \"Stupid thing!\" said Mary, fed up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was grumpy and just wanted to eat her way out of this thing. </span></div></div>",

Mary was't active. With no siblings and no school friends since she did't went to a normal school Mary did't had much contact with other kids so she did't do much games with others. She mostly sat in her house on her fat lazy butt reading while wolfing down huge amounts of food. She had gotten so fat that any exercise had gotten hard for her so she did't do it.<br>\r\nShe smiled when she saw plates with delicious treats. They looked so delicious it had been worth being hungry for some time. She licked her lips but knew she should wait. She could't start eating until the other guests arrived. That was't polite ad she had good manners like a good lady. The same reason why she wore a corset. Even while she hated it. But she dressed and acted like a good lady just like she and her parents wanted her to be.<br>\r\nSoon the first guests arrived. Mary polite greeted them and soon the room was full and this was the time Mary had been waiting for. She started eating. But slowly and mannered careful that she did't get any stains. While talking to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do like garlic. Of course not pure garlic but butter with garlic or garlic on vegetables tastes pretty good,\" Mary sad to some people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It also helps against those mean vampires that try to suck your blood,\" A man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just vampires. Century''s ago people knew that garlic was good for keeping evil things away,\" A woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary clacked with her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps but I only knew garlic like something that helps make other stuff taste delicious. It really does. Now we even have garlic powder. We use garlic in some of our food. Gives it that extra taste.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMary was talking with a piece of food in each hand. She liked the party but there was one thing that was a little uncomfortable for her was her corset It was really getting tight. Mom told her that a corset was suppose to be tight. That might be, but the corset started to feel very tight now. She wolfed another treat down and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's so smart. My kids don't even know what garlic is,\" A woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes she's the smartest kid I've ever seen. So polite and well mannered. A good little lady. The perfect daughter..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I still had a daughter,\" A older man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to your daughter old chap?\" A man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were on a vacation. Like always my daughter wore a corset. We were on a high cliff and suddenly she complained she could't breath. I thought she was just being a bit silly but suddenly she froze and the next moment she fell of the cliff right on the huge sharp rocks below. She was dead the moment she hit the rocks. She was just seventeen. I still miss her every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was so caught up in the story of the man she even stopped chewing for a moment. It seemed awful to her to lose a child. And also terrible for the parents. She decided to stay way from high cliffs. She wondered if that corset was just as tight as hers. The next moment some servants brought some cake inside. Mary stopped thinking clear. Her mouth started to water. She started stuffing the cake in her mouth even before the servants put the plate down. She almost inhaled the cake. Enjoying every bite.     </span></div></div>",

There's no 100% guarantee it will work like it should. It could work a bit different on humans. Perhaps it has some strange side effects. We tested this on mammals but not on a human.

She looked slowly around the room. It sounded again. <i>Clank.</i> Now it was very clearly the sound of a jackboot, hobnails clattering on the hard metal floor. <i>Clank.</i> Anya sprang up, ready to...what, exactly? Fight? She had no gun, no knife, no weapon but her own frail ten-year-old arms against a much older German. Run? She couldn't, she was in prison. At best she could give the German a little exercise. <i>Clan-Clank.</i> The Nazi had stopped. A single bead of sweat formed on her brow. She fancied she could hear him breathing, breathing down her neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then the clanks resumed, but quieter. The Nazi was leaving. Anya was safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed a heavy sigh of relief, cursed quietly in Polish, and slumped to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of this place,\" she said to nobody in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, though, she saw it. Most people wouldn't have. It was merely a slight oddity in the pattern of the wallpaper. But Anya, who had slept in many a house on her way through Poland, knew exactly what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A vent!\" she whispered excitedly to herself. \"Dzi\u0119ki Bogu, a vent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was right. It was, in fact, a vent; even better, one that she would fit inside. She beamed, and set to work unscrewing the cover with her thumbnail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vent, she discovered, led to a small opening about ten feet off the ground. This would have been terrible for her had it not been for the ladder right next to it. Elated, Anya leaned out, grabbed the ladder, swung herself onto it and headed up to do a bit of reconnaissance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view was not a pretty one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her perch on the roof of the laboratory, Anya was able to see the entirety of the yard. Across the yard, though, was only one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe yard was entirely set up to be a brutal obstacle course. Many hundreds of men were running, climbing, and jumping through the course. Each time they completed it they jogged back to the beginning and went again. Surrounding the course, orchestrating the struggle, were the guards. A thin line of green surrounded the writhing mass of striped pajamas, shouting at the prisoners within to keep moving. Sometimes, the prisoners could not. One man tripped on a  monkey bar and fell, unmoving, onto the stone beneath the course. A guard stepped forward, shouted something, then swung his rifle over his head and onto the head of the prisoner. Anya imagined she could hear the <i>crunch</i>. She winced and looked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view was no better where she looked next. High walls, twenty feet at the least, surrounded the entire compound. Higher then those stood the guard towers, faceless, bristling with machine guns. And, around the perimeter, more guards, talking, smoking, and laughing as if the horrific events in the middle weren't even happening. Anya seethed with rage, but just then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Frau Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya looked down, shocked, only to see the woman and another guard...</span></div></div>",

And do you think the guard towers are just for the view. You have no chance Anya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya listened to this but she must admit that there was't a way over that wall. The only way out was through the gate. She should think of a way to do that. She looked angry at Kristen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah so that is my test subject.\" A voice suddenly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya and Kirsten both looked up and saw an old friendly looking man walk over to her. He smiled and put a suit case in the desk and got out a needle. He filled it with a strange liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do sit still. If you don't it's gonna hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya did't listen and tried to get too the door which was locked.  Kirsten looked at the two men who were busy repairing the vent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you two please hold her for a few seconds please. Be careful she's pretty strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was't easy but after some time they were able to hold Tanya still for a moment and give her a injection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. That was all. That was't so hard no was it?\" He said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya's stomach suddenly started to rumble. She now realized how hungry she was. She had been so occupied with the fact she was captured she did't put much attention to it but now she noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you're hungry. That's good. You get a delicious meal.\" The old man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it's full of poison.\" Anya said snappish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. It's not. Believe me. I need to see how your body reacts to the serum. You're no use to me when your dead. That would be a waste.\"      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnya looked at the the men who were busy with the vent. She saw they made sure she would'be able to escape through that vent again. Well that did't matter. She would end up on the roof again. From there she could't escape. <br>\r\nShe was thinking when suddenly a man walked in with a huge plate filled with food. Delicious looking food. It also smelled delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Anya. Go ahead eat.\" Kristin said. \"I will visit you later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristin the old man and the men who were done repairing the vent walked out and left Anya alone. <br>\r\nAnya doubted for a few seconds. But she was hungry, and the old man was right she would't be any use to them dead and besides that it all looked and smelled so good. After one bite she must admit that it also tasted good. <br>\r\nAnya had't been able to eat much food lately. She could't be picky and ate what she could get. But that was't as tasty as this..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm locked in here anyway. I might as well eat the food while I'm here.\" She said to herself and started to stuff her face. It had been a long time ago since she had a tasty decent meal.   </span></div></div>",

Below, she saw one soldier saluting- clearly, the one who had spoken. He was saluting the woman from earlier, who, in the company of another soldier, appeared to be...leaving? <i>Yes,</i> thought Anya to herself, as she watched the two get into a staff car and drive out the gates, <i>yes, they're leaving! I can find my way out!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with typical Polish pluck, she jumped off the roof and landed on the nervous soldier's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight that commenced was totally unfair...for the German. Anya had experience and surprise on her side, so it was no great shock that within two minutes the German was dead at her feet, throat slashed with his own bayonet. Unfortunately, the only gun he was equipped with was a rifle, a gun far too heavy for Anya to sneak around with, so she stuck the bayonet in her belt and padded softly away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed. At four, the prisoners were taken off the obstacle course; at six, half the guards went for dinner, and the rest ushered the prisoners to their barracks. Through all this, the little Polish girl snuck through the camp, slowly and quietly making note of entrances, exits, guard routes and gun nests. By seven, she was sure she had a complete picture of the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a depressing picture it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only two gates, and both of them were watched at all times by constantly-manned machine guns. The walls were the same height-too high- throughout the camp, and the tops of these were studded with bits of glass and barbed wire to prevent any hope of climbing over. There was a small hole, partially covered by a bush, at the supreme northeastern end of the camp, but Anya was almost certain it was a trap, designed to give a slight hope of escape and then take it away in an instant. From her refuge beneath Barrack 23, Anya was certain it could not get any worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the sirens went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurwa!\" swore Anya quietly. \"They must have found the guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camp, formerly still and quiet in the night, erupted into activity. Jackboots pounded on the hard dirt of the well-trodden field. Above her, the prisoners stirred into confused action, murmered whispers of various languages and the shuffling of feet muffling her hearing. Searchlights, bright and powerful, snapped on, sweeping the camp. In another barrack, a shot- perhaps it wasn't her they were looking for? Somewhere else, a motor roared to life. Anya clutched the grass and prayed to God. </span></div></div>",

Perhaps they did't looked for her, however if they found her she would also be in big trouble. Of course being a preteen girl did't really helped her disguise either. There were't any kid soldiers here leave alone girls. If anyone saw her they could count one and one together. They were'maybe not the sharpest arrow in the case but they were't that stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it. How can I get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid under the ground. Lucky she was hard to see under the bushes. How could she get out. Over the wall was impossible. There was no way how she could climb over that wall without help. Even then they could easily spot her. Digging a tunnel was a useless idea. This was a real situation not a cartoon. Disguise herself... not a chance they would believe she was a soldier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One option left. That hole. However I'm sure it's a trap. But still... Do I have another choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw some soldier run by. They did't see her. When they were gone she looked around. No one. She suddenly saw a door. She fast ran over too it and tried it. Locked of course. But that did't stopped her. Her cousin once learned her how to open locks with a hair pin. She became pretty good at it. She stroke through her hair and found one. She bend it a bit and stuck it in they keyhole. She wiggled it a bit and with a click it opened. She got inside. <br>\r\nPerhaps she could find a way to get outside in here. Who knew. Perhaps hide between the laundry. It happened before. But then she saw the room she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was filled with tons of food. Pasta, sauce, a cooler full of meat, and cookies, cakes, pies, cans and jars of food. Anya's tummy let out a huge growl. Now she remembered how hungry she was. Being hungry was't unusual for her. She had been that many times but not this hungry. She looked around and her mouth started to water. It could't hurt to eat a bit before she looked for another way out. It was hard to think on a empty stomach right?<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Not a single cloud. <br>\r\nSilver Snake still rubbed her belly. She had a chubby belly. She knew that but she just liked it to eat. She really enjoyed it to eat. But she also liked it to really pig out. Stuffing her face. But she always kept this a secret. She never told it to anyone. Not even her mother or her best friend. This was her secret. Hers and no one else. She had done it a few times. When she was alone in the woods. she sometimes took some food to really pig out. But mostly she could't find that much food to pig out. Good thing to maybe because else she would be as round if a barrel. Not that she would mind that.<br>\r\nShe also had a big weakness for berries. It did't matter which ones. Rasp berries, blue berries, strawberries as long if it were berries. She often went to the forest to pick berries and to be alone. She did't really mind it to be alone. To be honest she liked it to be alone in the woods. Surrounded by animals. Because she did't really minded animals. They were't mean.

She's actually a nice girl and doesn't (usually) steal from those who can't afford to be stolen from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there is one thing that Jessica has a major weakness for: food, especially sweet treats.

While many might expect a thief to go after the local treasure, Jessica is usually the most dangerous when there's food around. Forget guarding the treasure safe.

In the green fields you could hear crickets and fruit started to grow. It was a nice time for everybody. <br>\r\nOn the dusty road came some heavy footsteps of a girl with a stuffed look. She played a bit with her hair while she walked further through the fields. She ignored the sound of the crickets. She did't cared so much about crickets. She stopped when she saw the first houses of a village.<br>\r\nSlowly she walked closer. She could see the people. The kids and adults seemed to be doing great. They looked well fed. Not fat or chubby but not starved like in some other villages. Further she saw a castle. Perhaps the home of a count. But looking at this people he took good care of them. Better then some others. Some had no trouble killing people on their land. She walked further but kept hidden around corners and in the shadow. Trying to keep a low profile. But her belly let out a loud growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee. Something here smells good.\" She said and sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delicious smell came from a nearby open window with a pie cooling on the windowsill. Jessica licked her lips. But she knew she needed to be careful. Just taking the pie would be stupid. That was what amateurs would do. First you need to be sure no one was looking. Be sure whoever was inside  would't see you taking the pie, and be sure it was easy to get away. But Jessica knew exactly how she needed to do this. She had done this many times. <br>\r\nShe walked closer to the window. The other people were around the corner. She looked inside. The kitchen was empty. But be careful. There was always a chance somebody would come in. She looked over her shoulder. It was a short distance from here to the forest. She looked one more second inside. The next moment she grabbed the pie and ran straight into the forest. Some further she stopped too catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this pie was worth this.\" She mumbled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she buried her head in the pie and started eating like a starved animal. Soon the entire pie was gone in her round belly except was was on her face. With a chubby finger she rubbed the remains of her face.  Afterward she licked her finger clean and burped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious. apricot stuffing I believe. I think I stay here for a while. The people here seem to have it okay. They would mind If I take some food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica knew very well that the people would mind. More then once she saw how angry people were. But that was't her fault.  She was abandon by the age of 5. What else could she do. At least this way she was able to get food. She was always a hungry and fat girl. Her belly was round and needed a lot of food to become full. Jessica liked her big belly. She thought it looked beautiful and some other people thought that too. Some people even thought she was pregnant. But that was silly. She never had a boyfriend. Leave alone had sex with a boy. She was't interested at boys. However she once heard that there was a time she would be interested in boys. She decided to think about that when it was that time. <br>\r\nHowever since some people thought she was pregnant they were nice to her. Thinking they need to take care of her and her baby. giving her food. <br>\r\nBut she could never stay long at one place. It they found out she was't really pregnant but just fat and stole food she would be in big trouble. She knew that too. But she only stole from people who could miss it. She never stole from poor people. That would be just wrong. They hardly had any food at all. No but the rich people. Counts and dukes. Those people were sometimes so fat that their butt hang of the edges of their chair. They could easily miss some food. The people in this village seemed to have enough food. Else you could't make a pie. <br>\r\nShe rubbed her round belly. She was still hungry. She could look for more food in the village.

Just like she hunted for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also have four chickens for eggs, and two goats for milk but their now in the barn. I also have about a dozen of bats around there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bats? Are they from you? And you keep them with the other animals?  Are't you scared the suck the blood of your animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my dear child. To answer your questions, they're not my pets but the stay in the barn. They stay there with my other animals but mostly they're away during they night. They don't suck blood. At least not this ones. Those eat insects. I like them because they eat insects that could harm or hurt my animals... or me. I hate gnat's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked surprised. She really need to think again about those animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wait here. I'll make something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica went sitting next to the cats and started to stroke one. The cat got up on his feet and went sitting on her lap a started to purr. She liked that and did't noticed how long she did until she heard: \"Dinner is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to the table and was surprised. A big pan filled with baked potatoes. A huge bowl filled with salad, cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, boiled eggs, and a lot of dressing. And two roast chickens. Her mouth started to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as much if you like sweet hart.\" The woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica did't need to be told twice. She started to eat. On her own she mostly ate like a pig. But when she was among other people she started to eat polite with a knife and fork. However the woman was surprised how much food the girl put on her plate and how all the food ended up in the little girls big tummy. She was doubting when she first saw her but seeing how much she consumed she knew for sure her big tummy was't because she was pregnant. Not that she cared. She would't have treated her otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a guest bedroom behind that door over there. You can sleep there if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice. Thank you.\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to the room and undressed. She crept under the blanket. As soon if her head hit the pillow she was out like a light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just go from village to village and steal some food. But I don't steal from poor people. Only people who can afford it to miss it. Mostly counts and dukes and... well the people here seemed to have enough food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are a little criminal.\" The woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't steal money! I only steal food to feed my hungry tummy. And only people who can it afford to miss some food. I admit I sometimes use my belly to act like I'm pregnant to get food, and sympathy, and get out of trouble. But I can never stay long on one place or else they find out I'm not really pregnant. I'm not proud at it but what can I do? I'm just a little kid. If I would't steal I would starve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I understand.\" The woman said friendly. \"You did't had much choice.

As far if she remembered she ate about everything in the kitchen before waddling back to her bed. thinking about food made her well... to be honest, the feast from tonight filled her up pretty good. She was't exactly hungry but she could eat something. She got out of bed and got dressed and waddled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great you're up.\" A friendly voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica saw the old lady looking friendly at her. With next to her a plate with some sandwiches on it.

It's almost midday you know. Then you don't have to steal food from any of my neighbors. They're my friends you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much. But how were you able to  make these? I thought I ate everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did some grocery shopping this morning. What are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know really.

After that one.\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's a village over there. Over that mountain. But it might take a few days to get over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica let her head hung. It promised to be a lot of hard work. But suddenly she remembered the castle. Perhaps she could steal some food from there, and get some food for in her backpack. Then she could eat something in those day's it took to walk mover the mountain. That was her best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I go to that village. They already know me in the other one... and we were't really friends.\" Jessica said and wolfed down the last sandwich. \"Thank you so much for every thing.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime sweethart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Jessica was wondering what to do first. She could go to the castle and look for food but at the other hand her tummy was full now. Perhaps she could better look for a place to sleep and go tomorrow to the castle to take some food and the leave. In the forest she could find some now and then a small house used by hunters. Jessica became pretty good at opening locks. However she only used them to sleep. She did't steal anything. However if there was food inside it would disappear in her stomach..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Look for food in the castle.... or go look for a place to stay tonight. I could go already try to get over the mountain but without food that's going to be very hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Only the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fantastic. I can fill my backpack now and then go over the mountain. Yeah that's a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to fill her backpack. Breads, cheese, dried meat, fruit, even some vegetables. She was't a big fan of vegetables but a few were't so bad. She filled her backpack to the brim. She was almost having trouble picking it up. But the she heard something. Footsteps. All those times stealing she learned you need to be careful if you heard something. Fast she hide behind some barrels with potatoes. She looked through a tiny hole between the barrels. First person who cane in was a cook. The next person was a tall, muscled man with long dark hair. Probably the duke or something. <br>\r\nThe she heard some more heavy footsteps. Her mouth fell open. She knew she was fat. She was aware of that. But this girl was even fatter then her. She wore a very expansive dress. She was about the same age as Jessica and had yellow blond hair and was very fat. Her upper arms were like pillows. Her cheeks were so bowl and pink you thought she had stuffed a tomato in each of them. Fer thighs had rolls of fat of their own rubbing if she waddled.

Take what you like.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl started to stuff her face with everything edible in the kitchen. Jessica thought she was more a pig then a girl.

Finally with a belly swollen and bloated because of so much food inside it she felt full. <br>\r\nAfter that she looked at the food and knew she needed to do one more thing. She filled her backpack with food. She needed to be careful not to eat it all. She could eat some of the food here for breakfast. But she needed to have food for dinner tomorrow and breakfast the day after tomorrow. Perhaps she would find another house, but she could't be sure about that.<br>\r\nShe leaned against the wall and noticed the wall was warm. She then knew why. It was the chimney. She saw a sheet and some bags. She used the bags to make some kind of mattress. She curled up against the chimney and closed her eyes and was soon gone to dreamland while her belly digested her huge meal.   </span></div></div>",

She even smiled in her sleep while she absently rubbed over her bulging middle as she snored away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, which was already quite large, had grown a few inches from her most recent stuffing. Round but still soft to the touch, the 9 year old girl's stomach rose into the air like a great pale mountain covered by the sheet she found earlier. The food-filled dome surged and fell with each snore she took. Oh, how much fun it was for Jessica to have a full tummy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child slowly awoke as sunlight hit her face. It was now morning and the air, although still somewhat cool, was beginning to heat up. She slowly stretched out causing her big tummy to jut out even further. She grinned at this and patted her middle before she threw off the sheet and prepared to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly grabbed her backpack and brushed down her hair a little, wanting to look presentable in case she came across someone and needed her charm to get out of a situation...or into a kitchen.

But the stuff was clean. So she knew at least one person lived here. But were was he or she? Maybe still asleep. Or out. If the person was asleep he or she could wake up any second. If he or she was out she had hours of time. Her belly rumbled. She did had a backpack full of food but she wanted to use that for dinner and breakfast tomorrow. But perhaps there was some food here.

At least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened carefully. If there was somebody asleep here that belch probably woke them up. She listened carefully. But still heard nothing. She looked in the closets and found a box with some cookies she wolfed down. There was a bowl at table with some fruit that also was fast devoured and joined by a bottle of milk and big piece of cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tasted good. But still I wonder who lives here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw something out of a corner of her eye. It was a jar of honey. She tasted honey before. To her... it was fantastic. So sweet and soft. She loved honey but hardly had a chance to eat it.<br>\r\nShe stretched out her hand to the jar but it was just out of her reach. But that did't stop her. She shove the stool over to the counter. Climbed up on the chair and grabbed the honey jar. She brought it to her lips and poured the sweet sticky stuff right into her mouth. After that she scraped with her finger the last honey out. She did't want too waste a single drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good breakfast.

However she knew the smell and taste. It was wine. She knew many people stored wine in the cellar. The person who lived here was no exception.

As Jessica groggily stood up and stretched, she noticed that her clothes still felt tight. Looking down she noticed a bulge in her dress, her pot belly still looking like she had a sizeable food baby. She examined her belly quizzically, the bump stuck out a few inches making her look like she had swallowed a small melon. She went over to a nearby brook and looked at her reflection in the water. She pulled down her dress, frowning at the way her belly stuck out. As she continued examining her reflection something worrying happened. Right before her eyes, her stomach swelled slightly larger. \u201cAhh, what just happened.\u201d She squeaked exploring her middle nervously. Not knowing what to do and still feeling very hungry she ignored her worries and headed into the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she skulked around the village, she noticed a couple was preparing a feast for a family gathering. Delicious roast, aromatic soup, ripe succulent vegetables, the food made her mouth water. She snuck up while the couple were chatting, and reached over the table to snatch a piece of roast. She didn\u2019t notice until it was too late however that her bulging belly knocked over a tankard alerting the couple. \u201cHey, what are you doing over there, child.\u201d The couple came over to confront her and Jessica recoiled in fear and instinctively started acting all sweet and innocent. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir and madame I just so hungry, I was wondering if you could spare some food.\u201d She said in an annoyingly cute way as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple glared at her suspiciously but then their focus shifted to her round middle. As they stared at it their angry expressions softened until they became warm smile. \u201cWhat a cute little child, she must be starving.\u201d The wife said rubbing Jessica\u2019s tummy, the action leaving Jessica confused. \u201cNo child should starve in this village, help yourself.\u201d The husband said, the wife continued. \u201cYou know I would have loved to have a sweet little daughter like you.\u201d The wife said playfully pinching Jessica\u2019s cheek, which made Jessica blush. \u201cJust look at you, you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d The wife said grabbing hold of Jessica\u2019s round tum. When she said that Jessica paused, they\u2019ll were joking right she didn\u2019t look skinny at all. The ushered Jessica to a seat and started offering her food. Jessica was confused but gladly accepted their offering scarfing down the delicious meals as the couple affectionately fawned over her slowly growing stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning Jessica had a round belly that rivaled that of a woman entering her second trimester, comparatively looking about five months pregnant compared to her small size. As she greedily ate the couple\u2019s food, her stomach filled up and out, it started to look like she was seven months pregnant, very round and full. By the fourth plate Jessica started to feel full but the couple didn\u2019t have any intention of stopping. \u201cThank you for your kindness but I don\u2019t think I should eat anymore.\u201d Jessica told the couple. \u201cNonsense you\u2019re still so thin.\u201d The wife cried making Jessica a little worried, she thought fast and put on her act again. \u201cBut I\u2019m really sleepy.\u201d She said in another sickeningly sweet way. \u201cOh, of course you poor thing.\u201d The wife said and the couple helped Jessica up with some effort and lead her inside. Jessica found that it was more difficult to move around, her heavy belly causing her to awkwardly waddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down in the bed and waited for the couple to leave. She knew something weird was going on. The couple seemingly wanting to fatten her up. Did this have something to do with that witch\u2019s curse, she wondered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She woozily waddled away quietly escaping from the affectionate couple. She wandered around town rubbing her tummy in satisfaction. As she walked about the village the smells of food being cooked all around the town distracted her. She became entranced with a certain smell and unknowingly followed her nose to a man cooking some savory mutton. \u201cHey there child, care for a taste.\u201d The burly man cried snapping Jessica out of her blissful trance. She looked around seeing food vendors all around her, the man that called to her offering her a leg of mutton.

Birds were singing. crickets were chirping. <br>\r\nOn the roads between the green fields drove a carriage. A beautiful carriage. Highly decorated with beautiful designs on it and made from the best material. Of course the carriage of the royal family must be the best from the best. In front of the carriage and behind were some soldiers for protection. There were robbers or thief's in the woods sometimes. <br>\r\nInside the carriage was the royal family. The king, queen and the two princesses. They might be sisters but that was about the only thing they had in common. Elizabeth was fat while her sister was skinny. Elizabeth's black hair was a big contrast with her sister blond curly hair. Elizabeth had a big appetite and hated exercise while her sister had a small appetite and loved exercise what was responsible for the sizes of both girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Elizabeth. Try to look a little more happy. You gonna meet your future husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. I never even met him. Suppose he's ugly. Or he could be stupid. Maybe even aggressive. Then he maybe kills me and get's away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on sweet hart. I heard he's a kind, handsome, smart and sweet boy. Or do you think I just let my daughter marry the first person that asked. No. But you really need to marry him. Then or two kingdoms will become one. Then we have a bigger and stronger army so no enemy will dare to attack us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But suppose we don't like each other. I mean there must be some kind of love between two people. I all those stories at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna marry! You're gonna marry!\" Her sister was singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up half pined!\" She said angry. \"Mom I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey we ate just a short while ago.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I'm a bit stressed since I'm going to meet my husband. And when I'm stressed, I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I guess you can have some cake. but promise  me that you give that boy a chance. Who knows, perhaps you do like him. He's about your age so you must have some of the same interests. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it to eat.\" Elizabeth mumbled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" Her little sister Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost honey. Look from up here we can see the castle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Elizabeth looked out of the window and saw a huge castle. It looked pretty nice. with a moat around it, several towers. At least it looked okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just hope that boy is okay also.\"<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Elizabeth was stunned by the majesty of the castle only returning to reality as her mother handed her the cake she requested earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um thank you.\" Elizabeth gracefully thanked as expected of a regal lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a chunk with a fork, Elizabeth let out a squeel of joy as she took a bite of the cake while her sister was peering out the window bouncing around in excitement as they drew near to the massive doors.  A guard greets the family as the carriage comes to a stop. Emily jumps out and immediately runs circles around the carriage while Elizabeth is still sitting, chunky legs crossed rubbing her cake filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on dear its time to get out.\" the queen told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Groan okay.\" moaned a disgruntled Elizabeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me princess\" a guard noticing the princess's struggle reacted by offering a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you. You certainly know how to treat a princess.\" complimented the princess adjusting her lavish dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As representative of the royal family allow me to welcome you.\" said a well dressed servant. \"Now if you will all please follow me I'll escort you the the royal family.\" the well mannered man said leading them into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh we have to walk.\" muttered the displeased princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush dear don't make a scene. Besides I'm sure they'll have a welcoming banquet.\" the queen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes so just bear it Elizabeth, your sister isn't complaining.\" added the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph! but she likes this sort of exertion.\" Elizabeth rebutted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant than brought them to a staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth immediately expressed her dismay \"Wha! Stairs! I hate stairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoosh! Sorry she's just not accustomed to exercise.\" her parents mustering up an accuse for their daughter's outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth lifted up her dress and began her ascent, while her little sister displayed her typical energy and hopped up the stairs. They continued climbing Elizabeth heaving her soft body up the loathed staircase in turmoil complaining the entire time. \"Arrg stupid stairs. A fine lady like me shouldn't belittle herself with such barbaric exertions.\" soon Elizabeth began breathing heavily. \"Huff there..better..be ..a ..huge...banquet ...after this huff.\" Elizabeth wheezed.  Emily however enjoyed the climb running circles around her sister adding to her torment, displaying her fondness of exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the prince was anxiously waiting with his family to see his future bride. They had set up a huge banquet providing various foods. <br>\r\n\"So I really have to get married?\" asked the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been over this my son. For the good of the kingdom you will marry this girl.\" answered the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She better be cute and chubby.\" the prince thought. \"That's why I insisted that we throw a huge feast for her, to inspect her appetite and potential.\" the prince continued thinking.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe princess' family finally reach the end of the stairs.  First to come up was the spunky blonde twig, Emily. <br>\r\n\"Oh no that's who I'm going to wed. She's so skinny and look at how wily she is she'll never put on weight.\" the prince gasped filled with distraught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Elizabeth emerged red faced and burdened with fatigue \"Alright were's the cake?\" demanded the overworked girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god\" uttered the relieved prince looking at the chubby girl with long black hair in an elegant dress, catch her breath and wipe the sweat from her forehead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edward von Hubitz, Prince of Saxony, was not a lad accustomed to nervousness. All his life he had been bought up to be regal, officious, strong; the kingship of Saxony demanded nothing less. Thus, he had faced all his prior suitors with decorum and tact; somewhat coldly, actually, mostly helped by the fact that he was attracted to none of them. In fact, the young Edward was rather drawn to the...larger side of life. Of course, his parents, rather busy with being King and Queen of Saxony, knew nothing of this; they did not expect Edward to marry for love, and had rejected all his previous suitors for political reasons. However, the large girl that was making her way in now was the Princess of Burgundy, and Saxony needed Burgundy's support, so Edward was not allowed to say no. Luckily, in this case, he was not inclined to. However, that also made him very nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bead of sweat dripped off of Edward's nose as he watched Princess Elizabeth of Burgundy struggle to walk the few more feet to the banquet table. It was very possibly the most adorable thing he had ever seen- though, once she reached the table and started shoveling the nearest item of food- a plate of potatoes- into her mouth, that image was rather shattered. Edward found her insatiable desire for food even <i>more</i> adorable, especially since she seemed to be tiring herself further with the simple effort of eating. Another bead of sweat rolled down his brow. He wished nothing more than to walk over to her and introduce himself, but all his princely courage seemed to have left him. <i>How am I supposed to greet her? I don't even know that much French, what am I to do? She's going to hate me, I just know it...</i> Thoughts whirled in his brain, causing him to lose track of the scene before him. He stood there, rooted to his spot, until: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward jumped out of his reverie- actually jumped, about a foot into the air. \"What- Who- What's happening?\" he cried out, searching for the source of the noise. A giggle sounded from next to him, and his surprise quickly turned into a look of mild distaste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're her sister, aren't you?\" he said, with all the snideness he could muster with his limited French. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you looking at Elizabeth...\" the younger girl tittered at him. \"Do you like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should not think,\" said Edward, lifting his nose even higher into the air, \"that I need to answer my intentions to the likes of <i>you</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndeterred, the littler girl giggled again. \"Don't worry! My sister's a big fatty, you don't need to do anything fancy! Just give her some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward was about to retaliate with something even snider when he realized she was right. \"But what should I give her...\" he mused aloud in German. <i>What was it she said when she was walking up the stairs? Something...about...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...CAKE!\" he cried aloud, and raced to cut a slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Elizabeth had worked her way through three or four very large plates of rich Saxon delicacies, and was feeling somewhat sated from her strenuous efforts on the stairs. However, she was still somewhat peckish, and was just about to reach for something else when someone started talking behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...may I interest you...eh...\" said the voice in heavily-accented, fumbling French, \"...can I get you...um...would you like some cake?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned her heavy body around, rather slowly, and got a first look at the prince she was to marry. She immediately knew...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked at the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you I would love some cake but... it's not so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward heart from the inside jumped from luck. Finally a girl that did what he liked. Eating and getting fatter.<br>\r\nHe walked over to the cake and picked up the entire plate and brought it over to his princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you. That's really nice of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward himself did't eat much. He enjoyed it more see this girl stuff her face. Her sister was nibbling at a small portion of the food. Enough for a mice. Edward thought. He wondered from who Elizabeth got her genes. She did't looked anything like her sister and he was thankful for that. To be honest he thought Elizabeth's sister looked kind of ugly. She should be fattened up for some time. Like they did with pigs. It would be good for her. But he could of course fatten up her Elizabeth. She seemed to do it already by herself. By the way he had to marry her. She was just what he wanted in a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth must admit that it seemed like she would be able to get along with this boy. But still however. She had another test. <br>\r\nAfter the banquet was over she looked at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was a good meal. But my belly feels a bit bloated. Could someone give me a belly rub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward rushed over to his future wife and started to rub her belly. Elizabeth smiled at him. She liked the belly rubs and Edward liked giving them. <br>\r\nEdwar's mother nodded in a  approving way and Elizabeth's parents also seemed happy that their daughter liked her man so much. <br>\r\nElizabeth's sister wondered what would now happen to her. After all she was also a princess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl is perfect. Edward thought. She has a big appetite and a big belly and seems it to like to eat. She can be sure that I will make her a lot fatter. I surely hope that she also likes it to become fat. He wondered if she liked it. She did't seem to have a problem with it. He hoped she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth also thought this was perfect. This boy gave her food and rubbed her belly. If he kept doing that she might really love him. At least he did't seem to have a problem with her weight or her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now did we all have eaten...\" Edwards mother said. \"Lets... </span></div></div>",

They are raising an army large enough to rival mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have, Monsiour le Roi,\" replied Edward's father in French, \"and, to make matters worse, I have also heard they are allying themselves with Denmark- who is similarly raising troops.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Well, I am sure Prussia could be leveraged to our side, but only if they get something out of it- and I am sure France wouldn't be happy if Prussia entered yet another war...\" said Elizabeth's father, deep in thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Russia? Well, in any case, we should begin planning- if you would care to follow me, I have a map in my study we should peruse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kings walked away, deep in conversation.

Isn't that right, you two?\" she cooed to the children, patting Edward on the head. The little prince groaned in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, isn't he such a <i>dear</i> child! I'm sure he and my Elizabeth will get along perfectly!\" smiled the Queen of Burgundy. \"Now, is there someplace we can talk? I don't want to ruin any surprises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course! Just come with me,\" said Edward's mother, and they, too, wandered away in conversation. Just like that, the prince and princess were left alone. Edward attempted to find the courage to resume conversation with Elizabeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well, how was dinner? Did you enjoy it?\" he asked, looking into Elizabeth's deep brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blushed somewhat, suddenly conscious of the amount that she had eaten. \"Oh, it was simply-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BO-RING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the two royal children were not quite as alone as they thought they were. Edward looked around in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that? Come out, that I may berate you soundly for your insolence!\" (Edward had a bad habit of talking far too fancily.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother giggle rang out, and a small, blond-haired girl crawled out from underneath the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's <i>you</i>,\" said Edward, mustering every ounce of sarcasm in his body. Elizabeth, on the other hand, cried out in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily! How could you! You're going to absolutely <i>ruin</i> that dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stuck out her tongue in response. \"Whatever, you ruined yours anyway! With all that food you dropped on it, I'm surprised it hasn't turned color!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth, thoroughly embarrased, looked down at the floor. Edward sprang to his feet, eyes flashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insolent fool! I should have your ears for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled yet again. \"Sure, if you can catch me!\" And, with that, she sprang off, sprinting away across the great hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you little- Get back here!\" shouted Edward, racing after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now come back- Wait- Rats!\" cried Elizabeth, heaving herself to her feet and following slowly behind. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Small branches were able to hold the weight of a skinny kid but not the weight of the fat Elizabeth. She ran from room to room up and down stairs and hide behind some things and finally Edward must admit he lost her.<br>\r\nHe looked around and found out he also lost Elizabeth. She was't that fast.

I want a fat girl. like you, and I would love it to make you fatter. That's the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well. I did't expect that. But... I guess that turns out... pretty good. We both want that I gain weight. But to gain weight I need to eat, and I like it to eat. Then I guess this might turn out all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so it seems. But I don't like your little sister. I also find her very unattractive. Hee come with me. I wanna show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her by the hand. Elizabeth did't liked she needed to walk again but Edward walked slowly so she could keep up. It was also all downstairs so that it was easier then going up. Finally he stopped by a door. He opened it and took her by the hand. <br>\r\nElizabeth let out a soft squeal. It was a garden. Filled with hundreds of flowers. Different kinds.In all colors. A big pond. Big trees with fresh green leafs. bright green grass at the ground. Different kind of bushes. But what she also really liked that a lot of the trees and bushes had some fruit. She was glad they came at the right moment. The most fruits were ripe now. She also saw some animals. Birds, rabbits and squirrels. But instead of running away these animals did't seemed to be scared and did't run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the garden. I like it here. especially during the spring and in the summer. Like now. Then it's very beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It truly is amazing.\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went sitting on the grass since she was still tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garden is pretty big.

She herself said that if she were to, one day, be able to do nothing more than sit on a soft bed and eat everything, she would be the happiest girl in the world.

It's about time.\" Her mother said. \"Where have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward... took me... to the... garden.\" Elizabeth said between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Of course. Our garden. We're very proud at it. It's a very nice place. Especially now. With the flowers and the fruit. No wonder he took you there. I also often go there when I want too be alone or just don't want to be disturbed. But enough about that. We're here for you. Your wedding dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And also those dresses.\" Her mother said and pointed to a few small bright colored dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. I won't fit into these things in a hundred years. The person who fits in there would fit three times in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Of course not. These are for Emily. She's bridesmaid. You can pick her dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh eh... of course. I think I pick... that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to a bright pink dress. She knew Emily would love it. She loved everything pink. She must admit that that dress would look nice at Emily. Brides maid was really something for that sweet little sister of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now the most important thing for you...\" Edwards mother said. \"Your own wedding dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked at the dress. Bright white. Made of some sort of silk. Anyway it looked amazing. Elizabeth loved dresses and this was the a fantastic dress. She finally started to look forward to this. <br>\r\nEdward seemed okay. Her parents liked his parents. He wanted her to get fatter what mend he would feed her a lot and that was a great plus punt. She must admit that she liked the garden and the wedding dress. <br>\r\nSure she first was bit irritated about it to marriage someone she never met before at a very young age. But Edward was also still young and around her age. The most important thing of the marriage was to combine the two lands. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Now lets see if the dress fits.\" Edwards mother said happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled but noticed her mother was't smiling. She seemed more worried. She did't had much time to think about it since Edwards mother slide the dress over  her head. She puled her head through the opening but when the queens pulled the dress down she noticed something was wrong. The dress felt awfully tight at many places. and it was't pulled down yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to be stuck.\" Edwards mother mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should force it.\" Elizabeth's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense I just need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the dress further down but the moment the heard a loud: RIIIIIIIIIIIP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blushed. She knew what that sound mend. She had heard that many times before. The dress was't even all the way down yet.<br>\r\nElizabeth knew the dress was too small, or she was too fat. In any way it was obvious the dress would fit her. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

However he did saw a little girl with blond curly hair near the pond. It was Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's you.\" Edward mumbled disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be a bit nicer to me. After all I'm gonna be bridesmaid at your wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward sighed. He surely did't picked her to be bridesmaid. Probably his parents. He did't liked it but he also knew she would become bridesmaid anyway. He did't really liked Emily. He found her sassy, annoying and very unattractive. With no fat on her body. Unlike her perfect sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna marry you sister. Not you. So I don't have to be nice to a skinny, ugly twig like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked angry at him.

I'm looking for your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at him while he walked away with tears in her eyes. She could't remember anybody ever insulted her that much in such a short time. However he did made one terrible mistake. He made her angry. You should never made Emily angry. Emily might be a pretty and cute girl. But if she was angry she could be very mean. Very, very mean. Revenge was something powerful.<br>\r\nEmily looked back at the frog and fishes that were swimming in the pond. She looked at her reflection in the water and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not ugly I'm cute and perfect and I know it.

The man probably got the right measurements but she ate herself in the meantime a few sizes bigger. It happened more the once that her clothes ripped or did't fit anymore thanks to her increasing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be that the measurement in your country are different from the measurement here.\" The tailor said trying to find a good excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... maybe. It's possible. However I want a wedding dress for my daughter. I hope for you it's the right size this time. You better hurry up. The wedding is soon, and I want my daughter to have the perfect dress.

He liked the idea that his future wife had gotten too fat for her wedding dress. But at least now he knew where she was.

Besides she must admit she liked the garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe offered her his arm, that she took blushing. The two walked too the garden. No one noticed the small figure that followed them in the shadows. Emily took a gray and black dress. She also took a black scarf and curled it around her head to hide her blond curls.

Then she could use her plan. All right first was supper, after that she could look for a good spot. A spot were she would first lure a lot of birds. Then throw a entire box of bird seed over Edward.

I heard stories about them. It were huge birds. So huge they could lift elephants. So big that the looked like storm clouds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I never heard about them but I know for sure that we don't have him.

Some are dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can they walk around free?\" Elizabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not. We made a huge hole in the ground. made straight walls so the animals cant climb out. We also planted some plants there and made a small poodle. There they live. We made bridge's over those  holes. I was a lot of work. Different holes for different animals and all but it was worth it. Even while there in holes stay careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's lips curled in very evil smile. She now had a perfect plan for her revenge. She only needed to do two things.First: Find out were the cages with birds were. Two: Get some bird seed. But both things would't be a problem. Sure her sister was first in line to the throne but she was also a princess. She could easily ask a servant  for some bird seed and ask the way to the bird cages.

Having grown up in the circus she considers all the freaks to be a part of her family and hates it when people are mean to them just because they're not 'normal'. She has always admired her mother and hopes to one day follow in her footsteps.

Then one day the town people had had enough and lead a revolt that resulted in them burning down the mansion that Angela lived in which killed her parents while Angela ran away to the woods. A few days later a cold and hungry Angela was found by a ringmaster named Oscar who took her to his circus partly out of sympathy and partly because he wanted a fat lady to be one of his main attractions. While Angela is still a spoiled brat she is slowly becoming more humble.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two of those three girls were't like other girls. The third one looked like a normal girl but the other two were not. <br>\r\nOne girl was incredibly small. She was the size of a baby but acted like a normal girl. She had black straight hair to her shoulders and wore a pretty pink dress <br>\r\nThe other had a normal upper body. But there was something wrong with her legs. She had a tail. The bones of her legs were together in a bag of skin. her feet sticking out. Making her look like a mermaid. She was sitting on a board with small wheels under it that could easily turn so she was able to get around. Her dark blond hair fell like a waterfall over her shoulders. She was slender and looked really friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on April.\" Anna said. \"Just a few more bites. You want t\u00f6 get big and strong, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril hold her swollen belly between both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really Anna I'm full. One more bite and I pop. I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April! If you really want to follow in your mothers deep footprints you need to put a little effort in it!\" Anna said with her hands in her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Anna. I'm glad you want to feed me but I really think I can't eat another bite now.\" April said and looked at the plate with still a half cake on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should listen to her.\" Lily said. \"I mean if she eats more she can handle she will barf it all out like last time. Remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I forget?\" Anna asked snappish. \"I was totally covered in her barf. But just one small bite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small like you?\" April asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh that was under the belt.\" Anna said. \"Being this size also has positive things. I look adorable. I can use my clothes longer since I don't outgrew them and I don't eat much so I don't cost much money. But I admit it also has less good things. It's hard to reach things. I also have short legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you have legs.\" Lilly said. \"I'm stuck with this tail. my parents used to live near a lake. They have legends about mermaids. Who can do things. When I got born with this tail the people in my village thought the mermaids had done something to me, and that was my mothers fault. Some even thought she had sex with a merman and I was the result of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't have scales, you can't breathe underwater, so I don't think you're part mermaid.\" April said .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to the people of my village. They did't want to have anything to do with me or my parents and that's why we end up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad you came to live with us since I like you.\" April said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee girls are you done?\" A deep voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge man walked over to them. About seven feet tall but that was't all, he was incredibly muscled. Ever square inch of his body was covered in muscles. He was obvious incredibly strong but also very friendly. A giant with a golden hart. He was known like the strongest man in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The show is about to start. Anna, Lily you need to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was one of the things that irritated April. She saw all the other freaks like family, and they treated her like family too but still... she was't  a freak. However, if she would be able to gain a lot of weight that she could be on the stage with her mother like: the fat lady and her fat daughter. She wanted to become a morbidly obese girl. The fat girl. But she never had been able to gain that much. But her mother supported her. Her father died when she was two and she did't really remembered him. Her father was a pinhead but she appeared to be normal. She did't like that. She decided to look at the show like she often did. Were the others showed how strange they were for the amusement of other people.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Romana was sitting on a luxurious couch nibbling on exotic sweets while a fat servant girl brushed her long luscious hair. Romana was a girl who basked in opulence and utterly loved being pampered, but she also found amusement in pampering others especially girls. Romana gleefully kept her servant girls well fed resulting in many plump girls around her palace. Although she was not the only woman in her family to be known for surrounding herself with other fat women. Each of her sisters were corpulent and had also kept their female servants well nourished. But her mother took female obesity to the next level. Proudly entitling herself as the embodiment of gluttony, the empress consumes enormous amounts of food daily and insists that any female who she makes contact with must possess a fat body, to her this showed that the woman appreciated life's gracious bounty. This attitude had a profound influence upon her daughters resulting in everyone adoring their fat physiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm how exquisite.\" Romana professed as the delicacy slid past her tongue. \"Now rub my tummy.\" Romana ordered as she laid back awaiting said belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes milady.\" answered an enthusiastic chunky girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being demanding, Romana's servants loved serving the little princess. It was an honor for them to caress such beautiful flesh, Romana's soft, well kept fat truly was immaculate since she never had to work which made her body completely unblemished by such laborious afflictions.  Plus working under the royal family provided the girls with access to sumptuous foods giving them rotund bodies that all skinny girls envied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone bring me more food.\" Romana ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plump girl approached bearing a dish loaded with foreign treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm these look promising.\" Romana said as her blue eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a handful to her mouth \"Oh my these are exemplary, girls do partake.\" Romana insisted desiring to encourage gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking great satisfaction in watching her female slaves stuff themselves, Romana than desired another type of entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're all feasting let's have a good show. Bring in some boys to wrestle for us.\" ordered the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked two muscular boys each bowing to the engorged princess out of respect before commencing their match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah excellent! Girls fattening up and boys competing how perfect!\" exclaimed the little glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the exhibition took place an older servant walked in. An immensely fat perfumed woman in a golden bikini, one of her mother's servants, approached Romana. She had long hair, huge boobs oozing out of her bikini top which rested upon her gargantuous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her majesty requests your presence your highness.\" spoke the immense woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh very well I shall see what mother wants. Ohh maybe she has food!\" she said getting up. \"Oh be sure and eat up ladies, I'd like to see you all a bit fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes milady.\" bowed the girls as they continued to eat though more diligently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now off to mother.\" Romana said as she waddled off.     </span></div></div>",

Although Romana loved fat girls of all ages, she always found that girls her age were prettier and happier when they were pudgy. But women had huge developed breasts and she envied huge breasts. Breasts are the culmination of femininity and the bigger and fatter they are the more feminine. Romana yearned for massive breasts but she still had a few years to wait but studying her mother's colossal bust, she didn't have concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached a room were the fat slave girl opened a door for Romana unveiling her mother's chamber, a testament to the opulence of Rome. There were dozens of beautiful bikini clad women eating from heaps of rich food. Every last woman was obese and bore a satisfied countenance sending an indulgent smile at the princess. An enticing aroma flowed throughout the room a combination of decadent foods and expensive perfumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomana than reached her mother who was reclining on a luxurious couch being massaged and fed meat from her top slave girls. The slave girls were ornamented with jewelry wearing fine loincloths, each girl obese with mounds of flesh. The slave girls sat beside the empress feeding her while caressing her flesh. Despite being slaves these ladies were some of the happiest people in the world, getting taken care of and getting to eat tons of food making their bodies gorgeously fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem your highness, I present to you your daughter.\" bowed the humble servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Romana, my dear daughter.\" welcomed the empress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mommy.\" greeted Romana.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomana looked at her mother, she was adorn in mesmerizing jewels, wearing a lavish toga that was very tight with bulges spilling out, well manicured features, her nails shined as did her long blonde hair which was magnificent, her skin was smooth and impossibly soft. Her body possessed such perfect curves, such as her massive bust which displayed her deep long cleavage that which Romana yearned for. Romana held a high opinion of her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Romana it seems you've been eating well. Here have the rest of my meat.\" she offered clapping her hands to signal the servants. \"Now I want something sweet to nourish myself with.\" commanded the empress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm this is really good mommy.\" said Romana tasting the splendid meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific dear, just be sure to eat it all, I'd really like it if you gained more weight.\" stated the empress as sweets were being fed to her.  \"Now dear there is something I have to discuss with you...\" the empress addressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has lots of money so she shouldn't have to eat modestly. Why would a girl of wealth deprive herself of delicious foods?\" Romana pondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused by the idea of a skinny girl abstaining from gluttonous revelries, Romana wandered through the halls. Romana could feel her buttocks jiggle as she strolled along. Romana delighted in her jiggly flesh, from her flabby arms to her chunky legs, to the impressive fat deposits on her chest, and her belly. Romana adored her belly, it was so big and soft, and it squished against things especially during hugs. She always loved embracing her fat mother, feeling her soft warm fat gently smother her, and how she would shove her face in her mother's massive breasts. Romana wished for huge breasts like that, even though she knew she'd acquire them in time, she was still impatient, plus she could always fatten her chest by eating heaps of food. And she knew it wouldn't be too long since her older sisters had developed rather quickly. Then Romana thought of visiting one of her sisters. Maybe they could help her understand the skinny girl. Plus her sister would certainly have food available, Romana was famished from all the walking, she did hate exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomana than entered her older sister's room. Upon entering Romana was greeted by the sight of her sister being fed by her boyfriend and having her hair brushed by a fat slave girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide my dear.\" suggested a dashing teenage boy pressing his hand filled with cake to her sister's drooling mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm yes keep feeding me more!\" professed her sister as her oncoming serving entered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" Romana made her presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then turned their heads to see Romana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings sister.\" Romana politely addressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Romana! how nice to see you and.. you've gained weight!\" rejoiced her sister as she heaved her girth up to hug her little sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've put on some weight too.\" Romana joyfully pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with how much a fine lady like me eats its guaranteed to happen.\" said the sister wrapping her pillowy arms around Romana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hug concluded Romana took a scrutinizing look at her sister.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Queen Victoria was out for a meal, desiring to bring something home to the palace. She felt it would keep her somewhat in touch with her subjects, and, her great love of food did not stop her from sampling dishes that normal folks would eat. Her retainers would often tell her that anything her majesty wanted she could have at the palace, but she shrugged them off. Every meal then would be filled with posh and circumstance, she thought. So, even amid protests from within the court, she would have a Roman Holiday.<br>\r\nOn the itinerary was to go to her favorite butcher and get a meat pie, a leg of lamb, and then cross over to a bakery to fetch a fitting sweet for dessert. Like a cake, or perhaps a fruit pie, or maybe something else would call to her tummy. She really didn\u2019t know what. But she was content to let her appetite decide.<br>\r\nOf course, she still made the barest effort to go there. Like a proper lady, she would be chauffeured by carriage, something which appeased her retainers, but it was also convenient because Victoria detested exercise. Her only exertion was to leave the carriage and walk into the store to get her prized mutton.<br>\r\nOn the way, Victoria strolls happily, innocently toying with a velvet pouch of money, thinking only of the meat and not the attention she was attracting.<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of time before a thief bumped into the queen, knicking her pouch for himself and dashing away. \u201cStop!\u201d calls out Victoria. \u201cStop I say!\u201d She tries to run after the criminal herself, but only manages to speed up to a light jog, and even then, she went down maybe fifty meters and wound up breathless.<br>\r\nOlivia, who had been shining shoes for some coin, paused her work to pay attention to the commotion. It wasn\u2019t too long before she knew the thief would disappear, and thinking quickly, she lobbed her shoe shining brush at his head. The wooden handle clunked against his head, and he fell, dazed. It wasn\u2019t long after that the queen\u2019s entourage had swarmed him. Even Queen Victoria walked up leisurely from behind and smacked him viciously with a handbag.<br>\r\nIt was only later that the Queen appeared again before the street girl. Olivia smelled the food just purchased on her majesty. It made her mouth water.<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d says the queen politely, \u201cI wish to return to you your brush. You were very helpful during that incident. I thank you, young lady. May I know your name?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Olivia, your highness, and please forget what happened. It was nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I assure you, you\u2019re mistaken! Your wits and quick thinking have made my rescue possible. You deserve to be rewarded. Go ahead, Olivia, you can ask me for something.\u201d<br>\r\nIt was by now that the scent of the food was just too pervasive and tempting, and Olivia\u2019s stomach rumbled. This kicked off a rather amusing, and yet hasty discussion. The queen and Olivia discover that they shared a great love of food. Olivia just didn\u2019t have much of it, sadly. Yet, she could speak on the tastiest porridge, fruit, breads, and other goods. The queen was sure she could nurse this girl to a point where she'd have a hearty appetite, just like she did. Victoria found herself wanting to feed her, too. Oh, this was a most interesting experience! It wasn\u2019t long before the queen welcomed the famished girl to the castle for a special dinner. Heck, the Queen had enough for a snack on the way, if Olivia really wanted it and couldn\u2019t wait.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A plump woman with short black hair who mostly was away for her work. Daisy asked sometimes what she did but never got a clear answer so she stopped asking. But she must made a lot of money because the lived in a big house with a swimming pool a big garden in the middle of a forest.<br>\r\nThen there was Robert Hewitt the seven year old son. Short pale wit same hair like his father only cut a bit shorter and seemed to avoid her a bit for some reason. <br>\r\nUnlike Kari Hewitt. Chubby with long black hair. She was five, the same age if Daisy and wanted to play with her and was for some reason pinching and rubbing her love handles.<br>\r\nAnd then there was Nikki. But she was just a baby with short dark hair. She did't really knew what to think of her but always had the feeling Nikki was looking at her like if she was a delicious piece of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Daisy was kind of happy living in this family. They never made her do chores or anything. They were nice to her, but they wanted her to eat. A lot. Well that was no problem for Daisy. She enjoyed eating. For Daisy it was't something you need to do to survive but a hobby. She was just as happy with food like other girls with a new doll. Daisy could eat a lot. Also Daisy was happy when she was eating. So eating was something she did a lot of the time and the Hewitt family seemed to like this and fed her even more. They also made her strip down once a week and weight and measured her. She had no idea why but she did't cared, The fatter she got the happier they seemed. <br>\r\nDaisy did't mind being fat. Since her new family seemed to like it so much she started to like it to and decided to gain more weight. Her new family seemed like they wanted to help her gain more<br>\r\nDaisy thought this was the best place in the world. She was so happy she was adopted by such a fantastic family. Her own parents net let her eat so much while that was just what she liked to do most.<br>\r\nShe stretched herself once and again a pants button popped of what made her belly spilling out like a river forcing her zipper all the way down.

He continued \u201cI know it is not the normal time for this, and I apologize for upsetting your routine, but let us see how much you weigh now. That is the second pair of pants you burst out of.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Daisy responded, dutifully picking her self off of the couch. Walking into the bathroom, she then proceeded to strip down to only her underwear and step on the scale. \u201c70 pounds, not bad Daisy. When we first picked you out of foster care, you were only sixty two pounds. You are growing into a fine young girl.\u201d Howard said. \u201cand let us see how you measure up,\u201d Howard said. Internally Daisy felt a rush of happiness. As she was measured, she felt a further rush of happiness. Her waistline grew by one half inch, her hips by three quarters, and her thighs by two tenths. \u201cI\u2019m still hungry.\u201d Daisy said, her stomach growling almost sounding through the house. \u201cRobert! Kari! Prepare the special table!\u201d  Howard said. \u201cGive us an hour and It\u2019ll be set!\u201d Robert shouted back. </span></div></div>",

She did't knew why but decided that it would be right and got dressed again and took some new pants. However those pants were also pretty tight and the button would probably pop of soon. She really needed new, bigger clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Daisy you can come in now!\" Helga yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy walked in. She wondered what the 'special table' mend but with what the Heiwitt family normally did it would have something to do with food. Food for Daisy. Daisy liked this but wondered sometimes a bit why she seemed to get so much food while the rest of the family ate a normal amount of food. But since she liked eating a lot of food she did't care.<br>\r\nDaisy looked and her eyes almost popped out of her head. She saw a table and it was filled wit pies. Chocolate, apricot, apple, raspberry, custard, peach, cherry, cream, strawberry and a meat pie.<br>\r\nDaisy was a real meat eater. She loved meat pies and stew but was also a real sweet tooth and loved pies just as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Daisy this is simple.\" Kari said. \"What we want you to do is eat every pie on this table. They all need to go in this beautiful belly of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Daisy said. \"They all look really delicious, and I am hungry. But I'm not sure if I'm able to eat them all. I mean it are a lot of pies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no problem. If you're not able to finish.\" Kari said. \"But if you don't succeed this time perhaps next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do succeed this time you might try to do it again next time.\" Robert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you succeed you get a nice surprise.\" Howard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  What is it?\" Daisy asked greedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if he would tell you it would't be a surprise anymore now would it?\" Helga said.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n\"Well new clothes would be a nice surprise. All my old ones are getting tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why did't you tell me your clothes were getting too small. I'll take you and Kari clothes shopping tomorrow. But now first... the special table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure if I can finish... but I can try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she attacked the pies like a wild animal Stuffing her face enjoying every piece of pie the went past her lips.<br>\r\nWhat Daisy did't knew was that Helga had been busy with a injection needle and filled every pie with a huge amount of liquid butter. That would fatten Daisy up good. She did't seem to notice the extra amount of butter or did't care.<br>\r\nKari walked over to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy\u2026 are we going to eat\u2026 this one too?\" She asked on a whispering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Why would't we.\" Her mother answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that\u2026 I don't know\u2026 I guess I sort of... like her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kari I told you about a hundred time don't get too attached to our food. Besides, she looks way too delicious. So nice and fat. She's only gonna become fatter. She gonna be a real feast. So stop acting this silly and be careful you don't blow our cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell that to Nikki. She looks at Daisy like she's a delicious piece of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does't matter. She's just a baby. Even if she would say something about eating she would think it was some silly baby talk or something she heard on T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari looked at her adopted sister that was only adopted to become her families next meal. But she must admit she did looked pretty delicious.</span></div></div>",

First, she ate two meat pies. Then she ate the chocolate one. Finally she ate the apple pie. Much to her disappointment, she would not find out what the surprise was that the Hewitt family would give her for eating all the pies. Her stomach, as it turned out, was literally stuffed full of food, and the pies were of such huge size that they could not all fit. Admitting defeat, Daisy rubbed her stomach, now hanging out over her pants and covered in sweat. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Hewitt, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry Daisy. I did not expect you to be able to eat everything.\u201d Howard responded, helping the now much bigger Daisy to her feet. He continued, \u201cIn fact, you did better than I expected. Most people are not able to eat as much as you do. Go to sleep now darling, we will be shopping early tomorrow morning.\u201d Daisy responded \u201cOkay, I guess. It\u2019s past my bedtime anyways. Tuck me in please.\u201d \u201cI will darling, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDid it go well,\u201d Helga asked as Howard came down the stairs from Daisy\u2019s room. \u201cYes. Her appetite is growing day by day. She will still need a lot of work to be fat enough to eat, but she is taking more easily to the weight gain process than most. I would almost say she could be fattened to death and she would not care. I almost want to do that, as we have never done so.\u201d \u201cYou want her to be fattened to death. Are there any reasons why?\u201d \u201cThere are. The first and biggest reason is we have never done such a thing. The second is I want to see what kind of meat this girl can give. I also want to push her appetite to the limit, and fattening her to death is the easiest way to do so.\u201d \u201cCan we discuss this later.\u201d \u201cCertainly.\"</span></div></div>",

You need to wake up! Wake up! Wake op!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Daisy asked and crawled deeper under her blanket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause we go clotes shopping silly. Did't you remember? Yesterday you said you clothes were getting tight, and mommy said we would go clothes shopping early the next morning. That's now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy went sitting up straight. She did remeber that Helga said that yesterday. She really did need new clothes. She had outrown most of her clothes.<br>\r\n Her pants had trouble going up her tighs and even if they did she sometimes was't able to button them. Most of her shirts were to short and did't cover her belly button. However not that she minded that last part. The Heiwitt family seemed it to like to see her big belly poking out between her shirt and pants. To be honest she liked it too.<br>\r\n She knew she gained weight since she came living here, what was probably thanks to her eating and the amount of food she was getting. But she liked being fat. It made her look she puffy, round, cute and adorable, and after the food was digested it was so soft and squishy like a nice pillow. Also eating was a lot of fun, and the Heiwitt family seemed to be happy with every pound she gained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need new clothes to see.\" Kari said and pulled of the upper part of her pajamas, showing her chubby belly but not as big if Daisy's. \"See? I'm getting a bit chubby. There's nothing wrong with that. But tight clothes are't fun to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I get dressed  right away!\" Daisy said looking for some clothes that would hopefully still fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Else you can use this.\" Kari said, and handed her a rubber band. \"You can use it to button your pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later both girl arrived downstairs. Daisy used the rubber band to button her pants. Helga noticed this but just smiled seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I see you two are ready. Well then lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... go? Without breakfast?\" Daisy asked surprised. Her tummy let out a loud growl, like if it heard its owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Daisy. We get some food when were in the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we can buy some food in the town. That food tastes way better!\" Kari said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Kari. Now you're hurting my feelings.\" Helga said with a laugh while the three got in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to eat a lot of food when we get breakfast. You need to stretch your tummy a bit. Else you'll never be able to finish the special table. I know you were't able to do it yesterday. But you just need to keep practicing. I'm sure sooner or later you will be able to beat the special table!\" Kari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did't expect you would be able eat all the pies the first time. It takes time and practice before you're able to do that. But I'm sure you will be able to do it. Sooner or later.\" Helga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy liked her lips. She looked forward to the next time. But first she looked forward to a nice breakfast.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Looking out the window, Daisy saw a weird sign.\u201dMcdonald\u2019s? What is this McDonald\u2019s restaurant?\u201d \u201cA good place to eat,\u201d Helga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy looked at the food before her and concluded that Mcdonald\u2019s was indeed a very good place to eat. Ten quarter pounders with cheese, ten large orders of fries, and, for later, 25 gallons of coke were in front of her. Helga and Kari ordered a more modest three quarter pounders each and a gallon of coke to share. \u201cEat up Daisy,\u201d Helga said. \u201cI will\u201d Daisy responded, eagerly digging in. <i>I wonder if I will be able to eat all this food,</i> Daisy thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You need to stretch your stomach.\" Kari said. \"You need to get used to eat a lot of food. Else you'll never beat the table. If you want to beat the table you need to train. Eat more and more. Every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy smiled weakly. It was so different from her real parents. They loved her but were't so fond of her weight. They often said she needed to lose some weight and forced her to go outside and run and play for a while. Hoping she would lose some weight while Daisy hated exercise. Her biggest hobby was eating and she rather did it until she was full. But her parents tried to control her weight. But now with the Heiwitt family it was a totally different story. The seemed to want her to eat more and more.<br>\r\nDaisy knew very well that eating a lot made you fat. She was't stupid. But to be honest she liked being fat. It made her feel so soft, warm a squishy like a nice pillow. But the Heiwitt family also seemed it to like it if she gained more weight. Well they were very nice and adopted her so she tried to gain weight to make them happy. But to make them happy she needed to eat and that was one of the things she liked most. So it was a win-win situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sweetie. Just eat as much if you can.\" Helga said. But I want you to get nice and stuffed. So the clothes we buy are big enough to fit after you have eaten a meal. Else they maybe rip after eating dinner. Perhaps we should buy clothes for you a few sizes bigger. Then you have some room to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh sure.\" Daisy said and took a first bite of a quarter pounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up surprised. This tasted terrific. She wondered why her real parents never took her to a place like this. She stuffed the quarter pounder as fast in her mouth if she could. It tasted so good she wanted it all in her belly as soon if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee mom they are called quarter pounders. So they weigh a quarter pound. Do you also gain a quarter pound from eating one?\" Kari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No honey. Because you use the muscles in you jaws to chew it so that way you burn calories. Besides you also use you muscles to lift that thing up to your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy did't mind it and swallowed the last bite of her third quarter pounder. The she realized she had fries to. She took some sips of cola and started stuffing fries in her mouth taking sips cola between. Daisy was really hungry since she did't had breakfast while since she came to live with the Heiwitt family she always got a big breakfast. She was wondered why they did't gave her one this morning but now she understood and she was happy she did't eat breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow mom. She really can eat. She eats way more and better than Sonja. Remember her. She was such a trouble maker with fattening her up so we could\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother pushed her with her elbow gave her a angry look a whispered: \"Sssssh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga did't need to worry. Daisy was to caught up in her eating. Sure she had been hungry when they arrived here but now wit six quarter pounder's in her stomach and six large orders of fries she must admit she felt very full. However her hands grabbed another quarter pounder and she started to stuff it in her mouth. But halfway she must admit her defeat. She felt too stuffed to eat another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I'm really full. If I eat another bite I'll explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can take what's left with us. Maybe you're hungry later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari took a seat next too Daisy and started to rub Daisy's tummy. Daisy must admit that it did feel good.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Helga had such a tendency to recommend such good clothes. She first recommended a number of baggy dresses. She then recommended nice smock tops with appealing prints. Jeans were nice and loose as well. All the clothes were so nice, and so freeing of her stomach. They were so flattering of her figure, and yet they left room to expand as she grew in both height and weight. Kari got a lot of good clothes as well.

I could't even eat all of that while I was pretty hungry. So I would love to go another time but right now I'm really full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's to bad. But if you're still full you don't need to continue eating. Else you barf it all out.\" Helga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Kari asked. \"I thought that your tummy exploded. Like in that cartoon I once saw.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cartoons are normally not real Kari. They're just for fun. However I must admit that a lot of movies also are so fake sometimes. Things that can never happen in real life.\" Helga said. \"Does't matter. Let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got in the car and drove of.<br>\r\nKari sat next to Daisy and bend over. Suddenly she put a hand on her belly and started to rub and massage her belly. Daisy must admit she liked this. It was just like a nice belly rub. Her real parents never did this. Perhaps partly because her mother did't wanted a fat daughter. If she could see her now. If things were going to stay this way she probably would soon be the opposite of what her mother wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You starting to get a nice and soft belly.\" Kari said. \"Just like Sonja.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Sonja?\" Daisy asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari looked shocked and turned a bit pale and looked in the rear-view mirror at her mother for some help. Daisy did't understood why Kari looked so scared. Like if she told a terrible secret. After a minute Helga started to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonja is a girl that lived with us for some time. Her parents were busy with some work in another country. Could't take her in the start but after some time they found a way they could take her. Anyway she now lives far away so we probably never see her again. Too bad... she was such a nice girl. Kari was kind of close with her so she's a bit sad when we talk about her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this was't the truth. Sonja was a girl they fattened up and ate before Daisy. But of course Daisy was''t supposed to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy looked at Kari. She thought Kari had looked more shocked and scared then sad. But she decided not to think about it. She would probably never see that Sonja girl anyway. She did't saw the mean look Helga gave her daughter in the rear view mirror.<br>\r\nKari stayed silent for the rest of the entire trip. Looking like she prepared for a angry lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon if they arrived home Daisy took her new clothes to her room. Kari wanted to do that too but Helga grabbed her tight by the wrist and dragged her to the basement. Carefully closed to door so no one else would hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kari that was on of the most stupid things you have ever done. Saying the name of one of our earlier meals. Do you also want to tell her about Annie, or else Kathy, or will we just show her all people we fattened up and ate. What was wrong with you. What's rule nr. 1?  Never blow our cover. Now I saved you by some silly story about Sonja. But now I need t make sure that you brother and father know about it too or else we could end up with strange questions that I don't want to answer. But please be more careful with what you say around our delicious feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mommy.\" Kari send with bend head and let out a sigh. After that she took her new clothes and went upstairs.<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

They never came out and no one ever saw them again. They must have known what is going on but just refused to believe it. However her servants and cooks knew.

Sure they made human more then once so they knew for sure but they were't allowed to go outside.<br>\r\nShe did't feel any remorse for the people she had eaten. She did't feel any remorse for anyone.

Then you could eat them and use their skin or fur. Maybe their bones. That was the only things animals were good for.<br>\r\nThe servants had placed Hungia at her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for. Continue fanning. I'm melting over here!

Go look and make sure  that nobody else kept a tasty zebra behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your highness\u2026 people are hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant who was still busy rubbing closed his eyes. He could't believe how stupid this man was. No one said \"but\" to Hungia. He was lucky she just had eaten or else he would be the next one who would end up in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say: but?\" Hungia asked on such an cold and icy tone it could freeze fire. \"Do you know what happened to the last person who said but to me? And what the heck were you talking about? So some people are a bit hungry. So what? Who cares about them when I'm the one who's starving? I'm more important than them. If they want more food they need to hunt more. Then there's also more food for me. So I can become fatter and even more beautiful then I am now and\u2026 Where was I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungia could sometimes be a bit sidetracked like every eight year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to know if anyone else got a zebra your highness.\" The servant who still rubbed her belly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" She said and looked at the other servant. \"Where are you waiting for? A invitation? Go over there and make sure they don't have a extra zebra. Because if I don't have enough zebra I might eat something else.\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n \"Like you wish your highness.\"  </span></div></div>",

He hoped this would dissuade her from doing anything too rash<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when the mouthy servant from before re-entered the hut that he felt a bit better.

She didn\u2019t have a care in the world and enjoy every moment of her decadent pampering<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon though, she began to hunger.

You just need to be useful. Most people did't liked Hungia but were wise enough not to say that out loud. There was only one person. The spice lady. A old woman with white hair. She was mostly a bit grumpy scolded a lot and sometimes insulted people. Even Hungia. Hungia had planned to eat her when she insulted her but her servants advised her not to do it. The spice lade knew more about healing plants and spices then anyone else. Hungia knew that even a princess or queen could get ill or get injured. When that would happen to her if she needed the spice lady and she was eaten. That was the only reason she was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready with my dinner!!!\" She yelled. \"I'm starving over here. I'm looking forward to a nice tasty zebra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost done with the first your highness,\" A servant said. \"Just a few more minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. You better make sure that those zebra's are worth the waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course your highness. Cooked over a spit and covered in peppers just like you asked. However your majesty I Must inform you that some people... are,,, not... too... happy with this all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Hungia asked bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Many families are hungry. Some families need to go for a few days without any food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? What do you want me to do? It's not my problem now is it?\" Hungia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you are the queen... or princess,\" He mumbled.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. So if there is't enough food the hunters need to work harder to catch more animals and the farmers need to grow more grains and vegetables. How hard is it to understand that? Do I need to think of everything? It's not that difficult. They need to do those things. Not me. Besides the most important thing for them is that their queen is happy. As long if I'm happy they're fine. Now where's my dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment servants brought in the first zebra. Hungia wasted no time and buried her face in it and started eating like a wild animal. Chewing loudly. Burping and sounds from ripping the meat of the bones. Even pigs had better manners then her. But everyone was wise enough not to say that. after all what difference would it make. Except maybe that she would eat the one who said it as well. The sounds that were so disgusting some people felt the urge to vomit. But Hungia was't done with eating. There was nothing left of the first zebra except some bones. Totally clean. Not the tiniest small piece of meat was left on them. But the next moment the second zebra was brought in. Hungia licked her lips. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The same rude noses she made on her first dish filled the hut with the second dish of her supper<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery quickly, Hungia had finished her meal.

True, the young fatty\u2019s gut was already a sight to behold. However, after eating the servant, and the 2 zebras, the big, chocolate-brown, belly looked stuffed to its limit.

That was good for them since then they would't get eaten. If you did your best to please her and you were useful to her you were safe. Her servants were well aware of that and that and that way she had power over them, because they were scared of her. Fear could give you power over people.<br>\r\nShe hoped the servant would return soon he could give her some belly rubs until the dessert was ready.<br>\r\nThis was the life. Being pampered and get whatever you want. She was surprised when she heard she would become queen. She did't really cared her family was gone because now she had so much power and now she could eat people. Something she had't been able to do before. She always wanted to taste one but of course she was't allowed to eat another human being. But now she was and she must admit they were delicious. But it could become a problem if there were't many of her people left. Perhaps she needed to capture some poachers or bandits or enemies the she could eat those. Those would be just as delicious if other people. Besides who would miss them. Her people would be happier to since it mend they were more save. Being queen was the best thing what had ever happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness. The cooks are busy with you dessert. It will be ready in a few minutes. Will you need anything until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I could use a belly rub until my dessert is here. Oh and when I'm done with my dessert I really need a belly rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away your highness,\" He said while he bent down to give his queen a belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later a huge dessert was brought in. A huge bowl with pieces of fruit with a lot of sugar and cream. Hungina bent forward and started stuffing her face with both hands. She acted more like a pig than a human girl or a princess. But everyone was wise enough not to sat that. At least not if the did't want to be eaten the same way.<br>\r\nThe bowl was soon empty. After the last piece of fruit was gone the servant started to rub her belly what made her happy and that was good for the servant.<br>\r\nSuddenly another man entered the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Hungia,\" He said. \"I'm starting to worry a bit. Our people have problems. Some people are starving. Some families have days they don't have any food. How can we help them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can we? I'm not a hunter. I can't hunt. I can't run after animals. You know I get tired if I have to stand more then a few minutes and how walking exhausts me. The hunters need to work harder. I told you that before. How hard is it. Am I the only one with brains here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighed and left the throne room.

Besides if she bite or ripped of her flesh she would most likely wake up and ran away, and since it was in the middle of the night it would be hard looking for her. <br>\r\nBesides that, she did her job pretty well. She was fast and that came in handy sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lucky girl,\" Hungia whispered. \"You look very tasty but I choose the fruit... this time. Next time it might be you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young teen girl let out a soft snore and kept sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much meat on you anyway,\" Hungia said an looked at the flat belly, thin limbs and not fully developed boobs. \"Besides I need to wait with eating humans until I find some poachers or bandits. It will make a great example what I will do to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Hungia did't cared so much about the animals. She only cared they took animals that need to end up in her hungry belly. Not theirs. However sometimes they only took the tusks from elephants and the horns from the rhino. That was a waste of a lot of good flesh. Besides it were her animals. They did't have the right to kill animals in her kingdom. Only her people were allowed to do that.<br>\r\nHungia started to stuff her face. That was really what she did. Her mouth was chewing non stop. Bit she was eating and swallowing so fast that most of the food was barely chewed but Hungia did't seemed to have no problem with that while all the fruit went past her lips into her paunch.<br>\r\nThat she was eating her breakfast did't mind to her. If there was't any other food she need to sacrifice another servant. But still she thought it was better to wait with eating people until she found some poachers or bandits, perhaps some enemies. Not that she cared about her people but this way not many of her people would remain. She was aware of that.<br>\r\nShe swallowed the last piece of fruit. It was enough for now. But she would like a belly rub. She lifted her feet and kicked the teen girl n her stomach. This woke her up. She was crying from pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you crying about. You are here for me. I just have eaten so I need a belly rub. Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant was still in pain but crawled over to Hungnia and started to rub her belly.

However she was careful with the tusks. She was in eating trance but knew very well that the tusks were a nice decoration for her throne. She ate the elephant like a starved animal and did't care about anything or anyone else. <br>\r\nThe other people slowly left. After all there were three deer's left. It was for some people the first good food in days. Some good hunters were able to catch some small animals like rabbits and lizards but most big preys were given to Hungia. So most hunters were't able to hunt other animals. Hungia left three deer's and they rather ate them before Hungia would change her mind and ate them too. <br>\r\nHowever Hungia was fat. Well not fat but morbidly obese. Her belly was huge. Just like every part of her body. Her pillow arms with chubby hands and sausage fingers Her pink puffy cheeks that looked like she stuffed a jawbreaker in each of them. Her neck was gone and her head was melted to her chest. Her chest also had some big boobs for a eight year old. But it was only just fat (well probably). And her thighs that were rubbing with each small waddling step she made just like her wobbling butt behind her. But to surprise of some even Hungia had a limit. She was halfway through the elephant but then even Hungia was full. She let out a huge belch and passed out. Her belly was so big and swollen she could't walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So even Hungia can't eat a entire elephant,\" one servant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but she ate more then any other human ever.

If you considered how many deer's, zebra's, elephants, rhinos, birds, fish, humans and other animals ended up in there. But Hungia did't cared about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's asleep. So what do we do with the other half of the elephant. I guess we can\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we need something for breakfast tomorrow morning.

She's kind of Lucky. Her parents have good jobs so they have enough food. That's why Wyona has enough food to eat and became kind of chubby. But that's no problem because she think it makes her look beautiful and she will gladly gain some more weight. She's nice and always ready to help others.  But is she a werewolf?<br>\r\nAbout that. Some time ago she was bitten by a wolf but survived and recovered. But since that night she sometimes feels a bit strange. She believes that the animal that attacked her was't a normal wolf but a werewolf. She's convinced he turned her in a werewolf too. Some nights (not only with full moon) she goes outside a howls to the moon. Runs around sometimes on hand and feet, stops thinking clear and attacks and devours everything that comes on her path. She did't encountered humans yet but several little critters became a victim of her and ended up in her belly. But is she really a werewolf?<br>\r\nPerhaps not. She doe't transform. She gets no fur, tail, claws or razor sharp teeth. She just is a young girl that acts like she's a blood thirsty werewolf. So perhaps she just mentally ill. <br>\r\nOf course she did't told anyone. If someone would find out she was a werewolf they would burn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr how about this one <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nName: Unknown<br>\r\nSkin: White<br>\r\nTime area: Some where around 1850<br>\r\nIs: A wild girl<br>\r\nAge: They believe somewhere around 5 or 6.

She was raised By wolves(just like Mowgli). So she lives in the wild. So that's why we're not sure about some things. She can run fast at hands and feet but not on two legs. She roars and howls like a wolf and will bite if she sees you like a threat and she can smell better tthen any other human. <br>\r\nWhat will the people of the village do? See her like a threat and chase her away or are  they nice people and do they take her in and try to turn her in what she really is? A human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr do you still want another girl? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just a normal day. It was summer and the sun was shining bright. It had been nice weather for the past weeks. <br>\r\nOn a path between the fields walked a young girl named Wyona. She blew some hair out of her face. She was very proud of her long straight blond hair and knew a lot of girls looked with envy at her blond hair. They also looked with envy at her body. Wyona had a healthy appetite. She was Lucky since her parents earned a lot of money and they were able to live a good life with enough food. Wyona became kind of chubby but in the 16 century a chubby girl/woman was seen like a sign of wealth. Someone who earned enough money to buy a decent meal. So her parents never saw this like a problem. They even were proud at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Nice weather. Guess it's gonna be a hot night. Perhaps I can go out tonight. I've staid inside the past two nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she was bitten by that wolf she sometimes felt strange. She was convinced it was a werewolf and knew for sure he had changed her in a werewolf too. More then once she got outside during the night. She howled against the moon. She would run around, sometimes on hand and feet. She acted like a blood thirsty predator. Devoured everything on her path. She had't met any humans, yet. Good thing too. She had't met any human but she had met enough critters on her path who ended up in her belly. About two weeks ago she ate five chickens from a farmer. However eating all that critters added a few pounds to her frame but she was happy with them.<br>\r\nBut was she really a werewolf. Well she does't transform. No fur, tail, razor sharp teeth or claws. She's still a normal girl that acts like a blood thirsty predator during some nights.<br>\r\nPerhaps Wyona was just a girl with a lot of imagination. <br>\r\nPerhaps she has schizophrenia (when you don't can't tell what's real and what's not). However in a time when people really believed in witches and werewolves it was sometimes hard to tell who has schizophrenia. <br>\r\nPerhaps she was just mentally ill. Some people also believe they are Napoleon, or Jezus. So why not a werewolf. Especially in a time were people really believed in werewolves and witchcraft.<br>\r\nPerhaps she just swallowed some strange stuff. For example the plant belladonna. Even while it means pretty lady this stuff can give people terrible hallucinations. <br>\r\nWe don't know for sure what caused it but she was convinced she was a werewolf. Well more a werewolf cub, she was just eight years old after all but still. <br>\r\nBut she knew very well she needed to be careful. If people found out she was a werewolf they would burn her without a second thought (thousands of people were burned in the 16th century because people thought they were werewolves, just like witches). She had it seen a few times. Back then she thought it was for the best. But when it happened to you it was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to kill animals and humans but I just can't help myself. I don't have control. I'm stop thinking clear. The wolf is just taking over my brain. I can't stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and walked further through the fields. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
