Mira was a tiger cub you found a while back she was lost and alone in the middle of the street. It was pouring rain and well after dark. You couldn't just leave her, that'd be cruel... so you took her in. That was four years ago. Now she's grown quite a bit and has matured into an adult tigress. It never occured to you to send her into the wild or to call someone to get her. Originally you were going to take her to a shelter but you grew fond of her. But one day she really surprised you and talked! She was able to speak complete sentences and think for herself with a concience, emotions and anything else you would find a compitent human capable of doing... mentally at least. By now you've reached your house and are unlocking the door. You expect to find Mira in the backyard lounging about or sleeping. But on the other hand there were days when she surprised you.</span></div></div>",

You leave you're bedroom in your night clothes. But before you go into the living room you check to see if Mira is still asleep. You find her sleeping on her belly with a slight smile on her muzzle. Seeing that she was asleep you began tiptoeing to the kitchen as quietly as you can. \"So far so good\" you whispered to yourself as you reached the midway point which was also where Mira was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you doing?\" Mira asked keeping her eyes closed and without even moving.

I have a job, just putting that out there.\" You respond. You notice Mira sigh as you put your bowl in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, you always have that same response! How do I know you're not playing with squeaky toys when you're at this job thing?\" Mira chided. She obviously still doesn't get the idea of having a house, or having to pay for things<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first, all you do is wander around the house and the backyard all day!\" You say, slightly annoyed. \"And second, if I were playing with squeaky toys, we would not be in this place, we'd be in the forest.\" You finished. Man, that almost came out kind of harsh, you mentally make a note to slap yourself later. But, she'll probably just get back at you by wrecking the, already torn-up, backyard again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sheesh, sorry. Didn't know it was such a big deal.\" She retorted, looking at her plate. She looked up to see your legs in front of her, bending down to pick up her plate. You walk over to the kitchen and place the dish in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, I'm sorry too, I didn't mean to sound angry at you.\" You spoke, calmly. You immediately started to feel your throat burning, and your eyes started getting heavy. You notice this but it has no effort over you. \"One moment, Mira.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to and climb up the stairs. Making a sharp right, you held out your hand pre-emptively to turn the knob on the door. You swing the door open with a slight feeling of a headache. The mirror was right in front of you for simpler access.<br>\r\nYour face was red, like, you got burned by fire red. Your legs start to slowly give way, you shove your hands onto the quartz counter, the sink in the middle. You feel the brisk coldness of the counter hitting your fingers and forming condensation under and around your hands. Using the sink to support you, you raise one of your hands, this was red too. The headache you felt earlier was now a pulse of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan, louder than expected, this made your raw throat hurt like hell. Mira perks her ears up and hears some noise coming from upstairs. *caugh, caugh, .. sniffle* ..... *slip*....... <i>*thud*</i>.</span></div></div>",

GET IT OFF\" he cried as Mira shredded his clothes and gave him a few minor scratches before clamping her jaws down on his leg and dragging him downstairs and into the darkness of the basement. \"Help me!

However, trial and error does yield benefits and in this case the benefits were experience. You learned that while you couldn't hear or see Mira, you could still <i></i>feel<i></i> her. She may be a tiger but she's your not in the jungle. That being said, the fact that she weighs much more than you means that you can feel her footsteps. The only flaw with that is she has to be right on top of you to feel her footsteps. You hear purring coming from behind you and you feel vibrations on the floor.

You cleaned up the mess and were sitting on the couch. It was a simple couch, like most. In front of you, the t.v. was tuned in to a random show of Veera's choosing. It was her turn that night to have control of the t.v.. You question a fox's ability to watch t.v. and actually <i>like</i> it, but Veera seems to be able to, and you also don't get why you even share the t.v. with a fox?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe true answer is that you care for Veera. She lay atop your body, watching the t.v., you had decided to stretch out but she wanted to sit there too. So without asking, she hopped up and got comfortable. You're in a deadly serious situation, as you don't want to make her uncomfortable... because she looks so cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh come on!</span>\" Veera suddenly squeaks in protest to the t.v.. (Yes, foxes squeak.) She sits up whilst on your stomach. \"<span class=\"corange\">Even I could do that! Now you're out ya dummy.</span>\" She pushes a paw into the surface below her in protest. With a surprised flex, she realizes that she was accidentally pushing into your gut. She winces, \"<span class=\"corange\">Sorry.</span>\" She apologizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">Oh, it's okay...</span>\" You smile playfully. You grab her in a big hug. \"<span class=\"chunter\">Aha! Gotchya!</span>\" You exclaim, the two of you are laughing as you wrestle on the relatively small couch. She yips and bounces on the back and kicks off the floor a couple times. After a moment, you're both tired, hair out of place and crazy. She shakes as you get up. You make a quick move to fix your hair. (Whatever it looks like I guess...? Let's not debate.) \"<span class=\"chunter\">Good night, Veera.</span>\" You tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Aww, good night. Guess I'll be watching this show by myself.</span>\" She trails off. You give a small hand gesture as an apology. You head upstairs and to your room, making sure of getting a good night's rest for the weekend. Tomorrow is Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arise, you find for once that Veera is not on the bed near your feet. The sun shines into your room. While getting up, you check the time. It's pretty early. You stretch and head out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear sickly moaning from somewhere in the house. You stand at the top of the stairs wondering what, until you recognize the familiar voice of your fox. You rush down the stairs in your pajamas. (Whatever they look like I guess.) You glance through the living room and see Veera laying on the floor. You immediately realize that maybe you let her have too much pizza. You head to her and kneel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Ohh... you're finally awake... ughhh.</span>\" Veera whines. You shake your head. You should've kept an eye on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chunter\">I think you're sick.</span>\" You point out dumbly. She nods. You feel deep regret. \"<span class=\"chunter\">Well, Veera, we can do two things. Lay off the pizza or go to the vet.</span>\" You explain. She doesn't like either option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Does the pizza hospital have a vet?</span>\" She mumbles. She's not thinking clearly. Maybe this is worse than you think. You decide.</span></div></div>",

The spot you were going to was actually in a secluded clearing that was reached on foot through a trail. When you arrived you began unloading g the firewood and carrying it over to the clearing. After several trips you finished building a pile of firewood and sat down on an old tree stump which you always used as a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Man</i>\" you thought to yourself \"<i>I love coming out here...

You shook yourself from your blissful state and dove behind the pile of firewood you'd built earlier. As the hail of gunfire continued you drew your own gun and peeked around the corner of the wood pile finding three men with machine guns firing in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay...\" You said to yourself \"I have two clips for a Compact forty five pistol and they have three machine guns.\" You knew this was bad and still even worst while you did have a gun and you were an excellent shot you hated violence and had never shot, didn't plan on and simply wouldn't shoot another person or animal if you could help it. The gun was more of a deterrent than anything else. Yet, to make matters even worse these guys where raiders, people who lived outside of the town and robbed tourists and travelers. You'd only encountered them once or twice and they bared their fangs but never bit you so to speak. However you did know that these people where territorial and it looks like they just found out that you live on their self proclaimed property.... Obviously they don't take well to 'trespassers'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The barrage suddenly stopped and all was quiet you looked over the pile of wood to find the men staring you down with guns at the ready. \"That was a warning shot!\" One of them shouts \"You have five minutes to take everything you can carry and get lost!\" After hearing that you open your mouth to give your reply...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fourtunately, you only used a quater of the clip because the didn't really expect your attack. While their reaction to your shot was slow, their retaliation was not. Within moments the barrage from before resumed only easing up when one or two of them would reload. Your defensive wall was being chipped away slowly as it was assaulted by bullets. You returned fire whenever you could, but because you only wanted to wound them, you had a hard time finding any shots that you could actually take and most of them missed. The shootout continued and pretty soon you where down to five rounds even though you were beeing conservative. You fired three of your five rounds at each of the men forcing them to take cover. This left you with two rounds, you sank down behind the logs and looked at your gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What am I supposed to do?

And it was really hard to think with all the gunfire in the background, especially since it was directed at you. \"I can't think with all of this noise going on!\" You shout in frustration. As if in answer to your frustrating plight all of the gunfire stopped. \"That's better.... wait? But why?\" Followed by the silence was multiple screams and many gunshots and half spoken sentences. You where just about to look and see what had happened when there where several loud explosions and flashes of light and then there was silence once again. You stood up and took a look at the scene, not knowing what you would find. You found several burn marks on the ground as well as small craters left behind by bullets. You also found footprints that indicated where the raiders where standing and what direction they had... run in? <i>\"Why would they run?\"</i> You wondered. You further inspected the burn marks that you had seen before and noticed that some where long strips while others where simple craters. <i>\"These don't look at all like they were made by explosives... and those guys weren't carrying any flamethrowers... so who or what made these marks, and why?</i> You where absoulutely baffled. You looked around a bit more and found that littering the ground where very large footprints, footprints that were'nt human. You followed them with your eyes and found that they led deeper into the woods.</span></div></div>",

Seeing as how you where nearly killed once tonight, you figure its best to pack it in and head home, you really don't want to see if you can survive another attempt on your life. On that note you jump into your truck and drive home, all the while trying to figure out what happened, who or what intervened and why. Everytime you answered one question another arose. After a while you found it pointless to dwell on it and decided to just head home. You reached your house and went inside and locked the door, you also closed all of the window shutters and readied the escape door that was in your basement for good measure.

You carefully went downstairs where there was yet another knock. At first you thought it was the raiders, but then you second guessed yourself. <i>\"Raiders are direct and always come right out with their attacks....\" </i>but then again maybe they're trying to deceive you.

So you told her that she could stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was overjoyed at your response, If you had time to cringe you would've. As soon as you gave her your answer she pounced on you and pinned you down to the floor while nuzzling you. All the while, she never stopped thanking you. Eventually she let you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well it's late and it's time for bed...\" You say as you glance at the clock. \"I'll be right back\" You go to your linen closet and grab a bed spread and lay it out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you doing?\" She asks, \"Don't you have a bed?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do, but I imagine that sleeping in that cave every night alone can be depressing. I thought it would be nice for you if you had someone here beside you... tomorrow I'll move my bed down here. That way you never have to be alone when you sleep ever again\" You say as you climb into bed \"Oh, and I think I have a name for you, how about Aeriss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're so kind...\" She says... she then stops for a moment to think about the name you've offered her. \"Aeriss?\" She asks wondering listening to how the name sounded as she said it...\"I like that name, I'll take it.\" With that both of you happily fell asleep in each other's company</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being what it was, it felt weird to sleep with a creature the world did not know existed. More like, pet, if you think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you found yourself awake, there was a noise at the back exit to your kitchen. Getting up, you try not to wake the dragon. I guess you can call her many things, dragon, pet, savior, friend? Many. Anyway, you grab your pistol, it was sitting on the counter. You know that there must have been a disturbance in the force for you to have woken up. (You're a heavy sleeper.) Putting your weapon in holster, you make a silent dash towards the kitchen. You stop at the doorway and peer around the corner. Those raiders were there again, man, that is annoying. You silently make a run to your stairs, passing Aeriss, and you grab the support beam and start moving upstairs. You head over the the room that had a window with a view to the outdoors next to the kitchen. There were more than three raiders this time, there were about 10. Putting your palm against your head and quickly running your hand through your hair, you start to get nervous about the situation, and now you realize you have to get yourself and Aeriss out of this situation. You beam through the doorway and back down the stairs, running over to the sleeping dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aeriss! We gotta get outta here!\" You rush quickly, there was a shaky edge to your words. She did not wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AERISS!!\" You shout, shaking her shoulder. She blasted to her feet and glanced around the room. She was more keen on her senses, considering her appearance. She already knew that this was trouble, by the way she heard your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Aeriss replied, groggily yet with a sharp tone. You gesture to the kitchen as you see flashing lights blasting off every surface. The automatic lights flashed on. Aeriss glanced over to the source, her expression was surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what's going on! We have to get out of here!\" You shout. You hear a sharply put noise in the kitchen, the window broke. There was a clink following this, and a faint roll. Your face turned pale, there was a grenade in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" Yelled a voice from the outside. Aeriss grabbed you with a sudden jerk and hit her shoulder against the wall, the wall broke down and there was a hole in it. The grenade went off and you heard a sharp noise that pierced your ears. The explosion was placed perfectly to the point where you saw a huge explosion. This was just a grenade, how did a huge explosion like that go off?! You remember as you have had a gas stove. You had a big view of the explosion. Wait, how? You looked down and saw that you were flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Oh my god!\" You shriek as you were being carried by Aeriss. She looked down at you, she looked as if she was sorry. (She didn't know if humans were accustomed to flying, because she's seen airplanes before.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Aeriss lands at your spot. She lets you down and sits next to you. Both of you were traumatized, you especially, you loved that house and you weren't planning on moving again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Aeriss asked, she obviously does not know what a grenade is, but she knows that was no fire. You get ready to respond.</span></div></div>",

You look into Aeriss's eyes with an expression of pure confusion. You shake your head and look away, staring blankly into the forest. Aeriss turns her head to see what you're looking at. She look back at you. You drop down and sit there, at your spot and brush your hand against your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey--\" Aeriss spoke again, trying to get your attention. She gets closer and sits down next to you. \"I don't know what to say either.\" Aeriss admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know what to do now. My forever home is utterly destroyed.\" You sigh. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No swearing, obscene language or dirty jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Use proper grammar, I'm not asking for perfection but I don't want to see a chapter that looks like someone half sleep wrote it with a six year old's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Write the story in first person. Remember YOU are the main character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. And finally no throwing in completely random chapters. I don't want to see \"And as he opened the fridge he pulled out a machine gun and ran outside punching the hulk in the face.\" I hate crud like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay... those are the rules and just as a small side note you should know that I CAN and WILL DELETE if you break these rules.
