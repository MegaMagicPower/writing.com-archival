He was in the middle of reading his favorite manga series \"the record of a fallen vampire\" and needed the next book, so he was willing to go. \"Sure Mom.\" He called down as he put up the bok and walked down stairs. Max was semi-cool in school and somewhat athletic, so reading manga was a secret of his. He had a good amount of friends and a girlfreind who he's been dating since the beggining of the school year, so life was pretty good for him. Though he didn't know it yet, he was about to be sent on a journey that would change his life in more ways than one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax walked down the stairs with the money he got for his fifteenth birthday, which was only a week ago. When he got down stairs, his mom was getting her purse. \"Ready to go mom?\" He asked. She turned around. \"Yup....as soon as I find my car keys.\" She said as she started to look through her purse. \"Good old mom.\" Max said under his breath. His mom was always losing her car keys. He went to the kitchen and grabbed them off the counter and handed them to her. \"Thanks, we can go now.\" She said as she walked towards the garage. Max followed her and got in the front passenger seat of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's mom started driving when she noticed that max's seatbelt wasn't buckled. \"Max buckle your seatbelt, most accidents happen close to the home.\" She said as she pulled on to the road and started driving on a busy street. \"Yeah Yeah.\" He said. He started to put on his seat belt when a ar came speeding from intersection his mom was crossing and crashed right into Max's side of the car. Then there was a white light and Max felt himself start to float. He noticed he was getting closer to the light and higher up, so he looked down. His body was awake and moving the car which had no evidence that it had just gotten in a car accident, whats more is that the car that hit him was nowhere in sight. \"What the hell?\" Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then max was surrounded by a white light. Then he started to see the silhouette of a man. \"Hello Max.\" He said in a deep voice. \"who the hell are you?\" He asked. \"I am known by many names, none of them are of any importance to you, and i will tell you none of them.\" He said. \"What the hell kind of answer is that?\" Max asked. \"It's the only one i'm giving you if you don't let me explain.\" the man said. Max thought about this for awhile then agreed. \"Fine, tell me what the hell is going on here.\" He said. \"Okay then, you are now what I like to call a spirit guide. what that means is that you now have the responsibility of helping people with problems in there life. You will be assigned a new person every week to possess and help a problem in there life.\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me and what if i say no?\" Max asked trying to stay calm. \"I chose you beacuse you seemed the best fit, and if you say no, I put you in the body of a worm and feed you to a bird.\" The man said. \"Well seeing as i have no choice, i guess i'll do it.\" Max said. \"Good, well i have five choices of people you can help so you can choose.\" He says as he hands you a file. In it there is paper work on five people, two girls and three boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople who need a spirit guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan Fernell<br>\r\n27 years old<br>\r\nOn the verge of a divorce needs help with his marriage <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Burkawitz <br>\r\n16 years old<br>\r\nWants a boy friend need help to get one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy Williams<br>\r\n18 years old<br>\r\nJust got fired, needs help to get a new job<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNacy Hilton<br>\r\n35 years old<br>\r\nSeven months pregnant need help with <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil Collins<br>\r\n12 years old<br>\r\nBig test coming up, needs a better grade<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Normally, you might have been flailing wildly or screaming, but you found yourself unable to move or scream at all. Suddenly, you could feel yourself becoming physical again.

He was moving at a great speed and crashed into a woman walking on the streets with her husband. Max felt physical again and fell forward but was caught by an arm, Max passed out due to dizziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Max regained consciousness, he slowly opened his eyes.

Max remembered what had happened, he agreed with the man to help this pregnant woman. Max lifted his arms and saw that his hands and fingers were much slimmer than before. The blonde hair that was by the side and not to forget, the emptiness in the crouch. Max tried to lift myself up but fell backwards. Noticing the big lump at his new tummy and two big melons at the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Nancy, the doctor said that you need plenty of rest and do not move about too much.\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Max do now?</span></div></div>",

He has several accounts of bullying but was never caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax thought for a minute while casually looking at the other people he can choose. Jonathan is having a divorce and Max is not particularly fond of marital problems. Susan is good choice but being in a girl's body must be strange, like the menstruation thing. Andy is finding a job and Max is not sure if he's going to accomplish such hard task. Nancy was the number one nope. She is the last person in the world that Max will possess. Max saw pregnant women on MTV and it sure is a thing that he would likely to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose Phil Collins. Sixth grade mathematics is easy compared to high school algebra.\" Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" The being asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, just one question. What happens to my body while I'm doing this helping thing of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's being controlled by another person whose job is like yours. She is helping you to man up and propose to that girl you were having a crush on. What was her name? Yeah it's Caroline Williams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She? You mean a girl is controlling my body. Oh my God. I wish she will not do anything girly to my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk, I'll bring you to your job now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being of light muttered words that are strange to Max. It raised it's hand and drew runes in the air. Max watched in wonder as the runes glowed and floated in air. The being's voice rang in the hot afternoon air, periodically echoing. The echoing voice suddenly stopped. The runes glued itself to Max and it carried him towards east. The runes carried him at an intense speed. They stopped over a house and Max was thrown to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor another time, Max heard the being's voice again.  \"Max, I forgot to say that you'll forget all the things you learned in your school, including math. But don't worry, it will be replaced by Phil's knowledge. Sorry for the inconvenience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Max felt all his knowledge about math vanish one by one. Fractions, exponents, algebra all gone from his mind except for the remaining knowledge like basic math. Once all his knowledge was replaced, Max felt disoriented gradually falling back to sleep.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax woke up at the sound of an alarm. <i>\"The alarm's ring was off by a pitch, strange\"</i> Max thought. He reached his hand to the left and searched for the annoying alarm clock. He found empty space as he reached all the areas in his left side. <i>\"I don't remember moving my alarm clock and shit! My blankets so comfortable.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax opened his eyes and found himself in a different room. It was bigger, a lot bigger. It has a large flat screen TV, a high end gaming computer at the corner, football posters everywhere and other 12 year old stuff. A head ache hit Max and memories of him with the otherworldly being returned. He touched his head and felt a silken hair at the top. It was smooth as silk, his hands freely sliding as he tried to comb Phil's hair or his hair. He turned to his right and pressed the off button of the solid gold alarm clock that was saying 3:30 A.M. Max looked again at the alarm clock. Solid gold! This boy must be rich. <i>\"I wonder how this boy looks.\"</i> Max jumped out of his bed and searched for the bathroom. Lucky for Max, the bedroom has its own private bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom was huge, insanely huge. His old bathroom could fit in here 10 times more and it will still leave a few space behind. Max walked towards the ridiculously gigantic mirror near the ridiculously same large sink. For the first time Max saw his body that he shall have for two weeks or what the strange guy said. His hair was gold and shines as he angled it towards the light. The face was cute as fuck. <i>\"If I had a face like this when I was young, Caroline might be the one who's having a crush on me.\"</i> His body is neither thin nor it is fat but it's normal by everyday standards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA speaker near the door lit up with a light of red and a sound of a broken radio. A voice with an english accent was heard. \"Master Phil, I see that you are awake and at the bathroom. Would you like me to prepare a morning bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Must be the butler.\"</i> Max thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA morning bath would be nice but someone preparing you bath is entirely alien to Max. \"That would be nice but I'll be the one preparing my bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of static was heard again and the soon followed by the same voice. \"Master Phil, are you sure? This is the first time I heard you say that. Your father might disagree with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How lazy could this kid get and how would my father disagree with me taking my own bath.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it by myself and thanks for the concern.\" Max finally said. Afterwards, the voice did not came back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax walked towards the bathtub which was at the far side of the bathroom. Tons of bottles and candles surrounded the bathtub. Scents of all kinds, labeled the bottles. Coconut, Cinnamon, Vanilla were one of the tens or a hundred labeled scents in the neatly stacked containers beside the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards something happened? What was it?</span></div></div>",

The need to relieve himself growing stronger. He lowered his red plaid pyjama bottoms, revealing the white underwear underneath. Shyly, he lowered those too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Refusing to look down, Max starred forward at the dull brown walls as he felt the familiar feeling of relieving himself. A few moments later when he was finished, he leaned over and flushed the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Max stood there. Releasing that he could not do this for two weeks, he decided he should at least look at it. (Although, it was more likely that it was curiosity.) Eyes drifting downwards, he saw his new dick for the next two or so weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Either it was the timing or something else, the small little dick began to stiffen. Crap, why now? He thought to himself as he began to panic. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to feel someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boner! All he could do was to stand there as it got larger and harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Within the minute, it was full size and stiff to the point where it was throbbing and painful. Even if it was smaller than the one Max used to have, it seemed to hurt even more than he ever remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unable to do anything else, he wrapped his small hand around it. Max did not expect the amount of relief that he did when his cold hand touched it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before he knew it, he was sliding his hand up and down the dick, pumping it with intensifying pleasure and speed. Thinking he heard a sound outside, he turned and saw his reflection in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing his new reflection playing with himself did not help with the boner as it seemed to get even worse. Seconds later, a pleasurable sensation took him over as his dick began spurting out its contents uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shortly after, it subsided, leaving much of himself, pyjamas, and a fair sum of the floor and wall covered in his stickiness. Trying to find something to clean himself off, Max finished pulling his underwear and pyjamas completely off before walking over to the sink, where he found a wash cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wetting the cloth, he set about to cleaning himself off, which ended up proving a slight challenge as he was decently coated. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I don't have the mood in baths anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the oaken door and was welcomed again with the more illuminated bedroom of his. Intrinsic Romanesque French Design was evident from the room. Even though I lost my precious mathematical knowledge, I still have my intellectual fond for architecture. What made the room out of order was the abundance of Soccer posters, Video game rack and that comfortable Race car bed of this kid. What a shame my father must have with this kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the room after getting myself bored with the room. As much as I want to play my toys, I imposed myself a time limit of one week before fixing this kid's problems. I want to get back to my body as soon as possible and find out how much damage the girl possessing my body has done in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside was a hallway of doors with renaissance paintings between this doors. I recognize some of this paintings but I didn't bother to stop at one and stare at it for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened one of this several doors and found myself at the dinner hall. Several maids were there and they were fixing today's breakfast. I placed myself on one of these hundreds of ornate seats and prepared myself to munch all the food on the table until I was stopped by another person who is also sitting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phillip Cornelius Collins! What in heaven's name are you doing?\" a feminine voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the direction the voice came from. A middle aged thin woman was the voice's source. She was wearing an extravagant hat as if she's cosplaying a female peacock. \"What?\" I replied. <i>\"Is it just me or is my accent British?\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are paring the Fish Fork and the Fruit Spoon. Are you out of your mind mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked beside my plate and found an assorted sizes of spoons, fork and other ding dong or whatnot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I use to it then?\" I complained. This British accent of mine is getting quite out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness gracious. Use the fork and spoon that is near your platter. Haven't Mistress Belladonna taught you sufficient manners?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the spoon and fork that she mentioned and proceeded myself in grabbing all those munchies on the table. Bacon, Chicken legs, yang chow rice, I put then all in my plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOODNESS GRACIOUS PHILLIP! What are you doing again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But your father will know of this.\" She wiped her mouth and pushed her plate away leaving large amounts of leftovers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited for her to leave before munching all those food on my plate. While I'm eating, one of the servants was looking at me. Hunger was in his eyes and his rumbling tummy can be heard from miles away. He's looking at the food at the table and I'm quite sure that he wants a mouthful of this food. There's too much for me and I think I can't finish it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

Even his other co-employees can see that he is really hungry and his stomach growling is getting kind of annoying too.<br>\r\nI faced his general direction and nodded him in an attempt to go beside me. He caught my drift and started going near me. While he was walking towards me, he did not only tripped once but thrice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he was in front of me. His face shows evident signs of deep sagging eye bags and paling cheeks. His eyes looks sullen and dripping with watery tears.<br>\r\nHe positioned the towel in his arms and talked to me in a funny kind of British accent. \u201cHow would I assist you today Master Phillip? Perhaps would you like me to assist you in the morning bath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head and denial. \u201cI don't want a bath. Anyway, come sit beside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indeed sat beside me. \u201cWould you like me to cut your food into tiny pieces and place it into your mouth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 no. I called you here because I want you to eat with me. Do you think I can finish all of these Chicken.\u201d I pointed at the spiced chicken at my plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is unlike of you master but if I did follow your orders, the head butler might get me fired or worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorse? Don't be so absurd. I'll talk to the head butler. And that reminds me.\u201d I called all the maids and servants around me and invited them to eat. They were afraid to grab a leg of lamb at first but once one of them grabbed a handful of Curry Chicken, other soon followed. They filled their hands with all the food they could grab and chocked them all to their mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the hungry butler beside me. \u201cAnyway, what is your name?\u201d<br>\r\nHe swallowed a mushroom omelet. \u201cGerry Castigore Wantu, sir. But sir, thank you for the food. I haven't eaten since yesterday morning.\u201d He forked the other half of the omelet and chocked it full in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon washed it down with a glistering Iced Tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy haven't you eaten?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed another bite of another food. \u201cMy mother is sick at the vineyard and the head enslaver won't let me see her. I tried to see her again but the head butler saw me meddling with the farm affairs so he locked me in the cellar and I was only freed this midnight.\u201d Tears began to bead in his eyes and then dripped heavily on the floorboards. I looked for some handkerchief in my pajamas surprisingly I found one. I gave the ornate handkerchief and he immediately blew his mucus reserves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlavery? I thought Abraham Lincoln abolished it.\u201d I swear I read that info on the almanac 2003. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you are mistaken sir. Abraham Lincoln promoted slavery. And why would he abolish it?\u201d He sneezed another handful of snot while eating a mouthful of yang chow rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large man stormed through the door. He was wearing the underside of a tuxedo with bloody reddish stain at the arms. That bitchy woman was beside him and horrified face was stamped to her bitchy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stopped eating and looked at the general direction where the bloodied man was standing. Some servants started to back away while some hid themselves at the linen table cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst he was doing uncivilized manners and now this? See father, Phillip is out of his mind.\u201d That bitchy woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large man walked towards one of the maids and castrated her with one of his large hairy hands. \u201cWho told you that you can eat my son's breakfast? Who told you!?\u201d he lifted her up and smashed her at the ground. The maid struggled to remove my assumed father's hands but her undernourished limbs failed her. She gave up in fighting and instead pointed her crinkly arms at my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you dare lie to me slave!\u201d he lifted her neck once again and smashed her bloodied head at the floorboard. She looked at me at the eyes before losing her consciousness. I can't let this happen any longer. I ran in front of my father and raised both of my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's true father. I did order them to eat the buffet.\u201d His angry faced watered down to a blank expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas this some kind of prank again Phillip? Did you poison the food so you can kill my slaves and take revenge on me for sending you to remedial classes?\u201d he said on a deep groaning voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the slaves and they seem surprised when father said poison. \u201cPoison? No dad. They are hungry and I couldn't even eat it all. It's all going to waste anyway so I thought \u2018why not share it?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn't you just order the slaves to throw the leftovers at the compost pit like you always used to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI decided dad I must change for the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you are going to be like that then I think that you can take care of the \u2018slave'\u201d he nodded at the bloodied maid's direction. \u201cAfterwards, clean this mess and go to Mrs. Garamond to restart your etiquette lessons. And come see me this evening. Is that clear young man?\u201d I nodded my head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned behind and walked back to the hallway. That bitchy sister followed but before leaving, she tongued me. Father noticed this. \u201cPerhaps you'll be retaking Mrs. Garamond's classes too.\u201d She nodded her head in denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
