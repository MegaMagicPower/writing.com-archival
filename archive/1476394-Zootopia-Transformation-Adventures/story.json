Not the Philosopher's Stone; a different one.<br>\r\nImbued with immense magical power, the stone would give the alchemist the power to change, alter and transform everything around him as he pleased, whenever he held the stone tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever; fearing that unscrupulous mammals might use it for evil purposes, the alchemist hid the stone somewhere and managed to find a way to depower the stone for centuries. He then disappeared, never to be heard from again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo every mammal in Zootopia, this was nothing more than an old legend. However; what nobody knew, was that the story was actually real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason the stone had not been discovered before, was thanks to the alchemist rendering it powerless. But now the enchantment was about to wear off and it did so in the paws of two of Zootopia's finest police officers: the bunny Judy Hopps and her partner Nick Wilde!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mammals were in for a truly crazy adventure; filled with alterations, swaps, transformations and all kind of awkward situations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how exactly did these two mammals find the stone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 1: After a raid on a crooked collector, Judy discovers that the stone has fallen into her pocket. Showing it to Nick, the two friends quickly find out what the stone can do, but in an awkward way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 2: Acting on a tip from Fennic, Nick single-pawed busts a jewelry-smuggling operation. However, one of the jewels is really the stone and when the ZPD can't find an owner, Nick brings it home with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 3: While on vacation on her own, Judy suddenly stumbles across some ancient ruins, finding the stone inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 4: Getting a call from a construction site, Judy and Nick discover that the crew have dug up some ancient artifacts. Whith all the artifacts identified, exept for the stone, Chief Bogo allow Judy and Nick to keep it as a souvenir of sorts. But they are in for a surprise when they come home...</span></div></div>",

Today had been a very busy day for the ZPD's bunny officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA raid on a crooked antiques dealer, which the First Precinct had been setting up for months, had gone down today and while the dealer and his henchmen had all been arrested, the sheer amount of adrenaline she had experienced during the raid, had left her really tired. So tired, that her partner, the fox Nick Wilde, had had to drive her home to her new apartment. (A gift from the re-instated Mayor Lionheart for saving Zootopia from Bellwether's plot.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, Nick followed Judy inside. While Judy was still wearing her police uniform, Nick had already switched to his casual outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting a glance at his partner, Nick playfully said: \"What's the matter, Carrots? I thought rabbits had lots of energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please; no rabbit-jokes tonight, Nick,\" groaned Judy. \"Not like you can talk; I can see that the raid took it's toll on you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you got me there,\" admitted Nick. \"But I really eanted to make sure you got home okay before going home myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nick,\" said Judy. \"But I'm just tired, not injured. You didn't have to...\" She trailed off as she suddenly felt something in one of her pockets. Pulling it out, she saw that it was some kind of shiny stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha got there, Carrots?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Judy. \"It must have fallen into my pocket when I bumped into that shelf during the raid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy studied the stone a bit more. 'I'm sure I've heard something about a stone before, but I can't quite remember where...' thought Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, stone or not, I'd better get back home,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" replied Judy. \"We have to figure out what kind of antique this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we do that tomorrow,\" asked Nick. \"Besides, I thought you were tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" replied Judy, \"but it's important that we identify this stone as fast as possible, to determine whether it's stolen or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nick let out another groan, Judy began to get a little annoyed with her friend and partner. Gripping the stone hard, she thought: ' That dumb fox. If only...'<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nWhat did Judy think? It determines what kind of change will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: '...he knew what I was going through sometimes!' This causes Nick and Judy to somehow become each other! Could be through body-swapping, life-swapping, or something even crazier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: '...he knew what it was like to be a bunny!' This causes Nick and Judy to swap species; making Nick a bunny and Judy a fox!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, do you want a different kind of change?</span></div></div>",

As soon as Judy had thought those words, she suddenly noticed that the stone was starting to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Carrots?\" asked Nick, who had also seen the glow of the stone. \"What's with the light-show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just managed to say: \"I have no idea,\" before the light from the stone grew so bright that it completely filled the apartment and forcing the two mammals to shut their eyes in the face of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange feeling enveloped the two mammals. It was like they were being sucked up into a vacuum cleaner and then spit back out again. As the strange feeling disappeared, so did the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was the first to recover. She opened her eyes, but couldn't see anything other than a vague, gray blob. Since her vision was still blurry, so she blinked a few times to make it go away. She noticed how the gray blob became gradually clearer, until she was looking at.... herself???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a weird situation for Judy. How could she be looking at herself? Even more puzzling was the fact that the other Judy seemed to be smaller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy watched as the other her stared up at her and then asked: \"Why am I seeing myself?\" It was such a strange question; but it was even stranger that the other Judy suddenly moved her paw to her throat, like she was surprised by her own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could be asking the same...\" was all Judy managed to say before she apruptly cut off. Her voice sounded a lot deeper than it usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy stood pondering over this, she watched the other Judy first looking at her, then looking down at herself, before turning wide-eyed and white as though the other her had just seen a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of dawning realization flickered across the other Judy's face, before being replaced with a look of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy watched as the other Judy looked up at her again and said: \"Is that you, Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's eyes went wide. There was only one mammal in Zootopia that called her that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" she asked the other bunny in her new voice. The other Judy nodded. \"But... how come you look like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to ask you that, too,\" said Judy's clone, whom she now knew to be Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment before the full meaning of Nick's words sank in. And it lead Judy to see a very disturbing pattern. The fact that her 'other self'/Nick seemed to be smaller than udual, the strange feeling from when they were in the light, her new deeper voice, Nick now looking like her... it all added up to one undeniable solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, Judy looked down at herself and gasped. Instead of the ZPD uniform and grey-furred foot-paws that she was used to seeing, she instead saw a green Hawaiian shirt, an indigo necktie, khaki pants and red-furred foot-paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hit Judy like a ton of bricks. Somehow, she and her partner had swapped bodies!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following scream could be heard across all of Zootopia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

We need to do something about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Nick replied, placing the floor while trying not to trip over his new giant rabbit feet. \"People swap bodies all the time! I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation to all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bizarre to hear Nick's usual sarcastic quips coming out of her own mouth. Though he was making some sense. There had to be a reason for the sudden change, it shouldn't have happened for no reason. Judy shifted on her own new feet, trying to become more comfortable in the idea that she was a taller and slimmer fox. Being male was also something that was going to take some getting used to. She hoped that they could solve this problem before one of them had to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy flexed her new paws, she suddenly found them rather empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nick asked, rabbit ears picking up what she had quietly mumbled. \"The stone we found? Carrots, you don't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had wished that you could know what I was going through sometimes,\" Judy explained. \"But it was in my own head! I didn't think it would actually do...This!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then all we have to do is find it and undo this by wishing the opposite. Problem solved. Where did you put it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had it in my paw when I made the wish. But that was when I was in your body. I mean, my body. You don't have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick checked both of his paws but was holding nothing. \"It must have gotten dropped when that flash of light happened. Or maybe it just evaporate entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say things like that! Let's look around, we'll find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could both go to the floor, there was a familiar ringtone humming in the apartment. Nick felt around his back pockets and produced Judy's cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, answer it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? The last time I talked to them, I'm pretty sure your dad thought I was trying to eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, you're me now. And unless we want everyone freaking out, you need to suck it up and work out your problems with dad. I'll look for the stone, you talk to my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick groaned as the call went to video on NuzzleTime. \"Oh...Hey. It's, uh, it's <i>my </i>parents...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jude! Is this a good time? We have some big news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Nick looked to Judy for guidance. She just shooed him along. \"Suuuure. Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nick was busy pretending to be amazed that someone in the family was having <i>another </i>litter of Hopps, Judy scoured the floor for any signs of the stone. Unfortunately, Judy's apartment wasn't built for foxes and she was feeling more cramped than usual as she ducked under her bed. This entire situation was easily the most bizarre thing that had ever happened to her and it was about to get even worse if she didn't find that stone. Judy shuddered to think what might go wrong if it landed in the wrong paws, even if its only power was swapping bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their search continued, Judy...</span></div></div>",

They both covered their eyes instinctively, attempting to save their precious pupils from harm. Yet as quickly as it appeared, the light vanished. They slowly removed their hands, looking around curiously, looking for whatever the stone might have done. As far as they can perceive, the magic it wound was relatively mundane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as they could perceive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you look at that, Carrots,\" Judy slouched her shoulders, grinning at Nick with a smug grin. \"Your little stone is a magic clothes swapper. What a handy little tool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's body sighed, resting a hand on his hip. \"We come across magic and you're going to sass about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't sass. I snark. There's a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, it's clearly done something magical, Nick. That's an important discovery! Something that, as far as I'm concerned, means it gets filled into evidence asap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged. \"Suit yourself. As long I get changed back into something more my style and can clock off, that's all fine by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy huffed, crossing Nick's arms. \"You better not stretch my uniform...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could take it off, if you'd prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, already moving to the car. \"Don't even joke about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's body laughed. Silly rabbit. With a slightly bigger bounce in his step than he seemed to recall, Nick followed what he believed to be a rabbit into the patrol car. \"Where we stopping first then, Carrots? Your place or mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I want to see the state of your place. We'll change at my apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shrugged again, leaning back into the seat. It felt... bigger than usual. But that was ridiculous, so he brushed the thought aside as he unbuttoned a bit of the uniform. It was hard to breathe in such a small thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the duo arrived at the apartment and trudged up the stairs to to Judy's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy briefly felt around for her keys before realization struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it Nick, you have my keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grinned widely, lifting them out of Judy's pockets. \"So it would seem... What do you want for them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, come on, I don't want to be in your stupid shirt longer than I need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped, putting a pawed hand on his tiny chest. \"Carrots, that is a classic. I saved up a while for that little  ensemble, thank you. You've probably been dragging it through the dirt all day, it barely fits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy paused for a confused second. This shirt and tie really shouldn't fit her... yet she had no trouble at all. Why was that....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thought was quickly interrupted by the sound of Judy's annoying neighbors arguing once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, the yogurt from 3rd street is much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBucky shoved a finger at Pronk angrily as they passed the police officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're insane, you are absolutely out of your mind. The 5th street grocery is much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can handle being so wrong without your brain exploding?!\" Pronk quickly turned to Judy. \"Neighbor, tell Bucky he wouldn't know taste if it ran him over.\"</span></div></div>",

The red stone stumbled from her paws and rolled under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy laid sprawled out on the floor, her entire little rabbit body convulsed and jolted. It was like something was tugging at her from ear to tail and stretching her out like taffy. She could hear something rip and tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it all stopped in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blinked a few times lying on the floor, before rising to a strange sense of vertigo. As she rose from, she looked down at herself only to find that she was looking quite exposed. Her vest and uniform lay in tatters all around her. It was almost as if she had exploded out of her clothing. At the thought of being indecent, her first instinct was to cover herself with her paws as she realized she hadn't been the only one to be hit by whatever that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being nearly naked, Judy rose for the door only to find her center of gravity was completely out of whack. She stumbled on her oversized feet and reached for the nearby desk...Only to find it much lower than she thought it would be. In fact, glancing around the room, everything looked a little bit smaller than she remembered it, even despite her apartment's miniature status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it dawned on her. It wasn't the apartment that had shrunk. It was she that had grown!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots,\" Nick responded from the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Judy called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have normally rushed for the door to make sure her friend was alright, but it was for her own safety that she was keeping herself steady. Her head was loopy and she wasn't prepared for the sight she saw in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had grown, on the opposite end of the spectrum her partner had seemingly shrunk. He stood before her in a uniform that was far too big for him while the last shreds of her clothing remained pressed to her body to keep her covered. In fact, it was almost like the two of them had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick,\" Judy spoke up. \"Did we...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switch heights?\" asked Nick, tugging his now very loose shirt up his shoulder. \"It certainly looks that way. But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Judy's keen detective mind clicked and she went down on her knees to reach under her bed. That proved to be an easier feat with such longer arms and her fingers grasped hold of her hunch. The now pulsing red stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Have you ever heard of something like this before?\" asked the now giant bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very long time ago,\" said the shrunken fox. \"When I was a kid from a few crazy hobos. But I certainly didn't think something like this existed. I know I certainly didn't pay attention to rumors about magical stones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know someone who might?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" he shrugged, giving up the fight to wear his shirt and just letting it slide off his shoulder into a heap on the floor. \"Course, if it was just me, I would finagle with the thing and fix this myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the question. We need to bring this to the ZPD...I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick just shrugged, standing in a pile of his formerly fitting clothes. \"It's your call, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy often had to make the decisions in their pairing. But, in this case, she didn't quite know what to do. She sighed and sat her expanded body down on the floor to think for a moment before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

We should give it another go, maybe it can reset this whole situation?\" Judy said after mulling it over a bit more and wildly gesturing to her and Nick's bodies with her thickened arms and enlarged paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Ok that sounds like a plan!\" Nick answered with weak confidence sounding shaken by the strangeness of looking up at his formally \"small\" partner to meet her gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Judy concured but wore a look of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we activate it?\" Nick asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hummmm, not quite sure. All I remember from last time was thinking what a hard headed fox you were and that you never seem to listen to me\" Judy thought outloud as she gripped the still glowing stone while closing her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to recall how to activate the stones power once again she continued \"I thought if I was larger you would have no choice but to take me seriously, but not only that but if you were meeker than you might find me more commanding maybe even a little indimidating\". All the whlie the glow of the stone intensified and began to shine brightly threw the fox sized rabbit's fingers before setting of a blinding flash once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy raised her free paw up to her eyes to shield them from the brightness as she stumbled backward onto her rear. She managed to hold on to the stone this time but this caused a strange sensation to occur, she phyiscally felt the stone seemingly shrink in her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was flown back by the discharge again, only this time he was tossed with much more force. He could hear the sound of fabric streching poping and tearing from where Judy was and he aimed his sights there as soon as he was able. \"Carrots! You ok?\" Nick blurted out as his vison slowly retured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy watched in horror/amazement as her body swelled even larger as her rump took up more and more of her apartments real estate upon the floor as it spread in all directions. \"Uh Nick, I've got some bad news.\" Judy said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick finally able to see was flabberguasted by the sight before him. Judy was HUGE! Now she was big before and Nick hadn't gotten to his feet yet but something definatly didn't look right. \"I think I see what you mean.\" Nick replied with trepidation hoping once he was standing things wouldn't look as bad as they appear to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick gathered the courage to take the stand and approach the oversized bunny he braced for the worst. Upon donig so he was met with two revelations. One as he got to his feet the rabbits appartment floor wasn't all that far below him and for that matter everything about her appartment was oversized. The countertops were almost as tall as he was and her coffe table was up to the top of his thighs! Two Judy herself was truly MASSIVE he barely cleared the top of her head and she was sitting down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear Judy had grown again as Nick had shrank even smaller. Judy had been proped up against the wall with one arm over her rasied knee footplanted firmly on the floor while the other lay limp with the pulsating stone loosely in her open palm next to the corosponding leg outstretched and foot strait up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant rabbit got to her feet the fox truly felt small indeed, \"Oh boy Nicky, what are we going to do? You seem so tiny now, can you even see over my counters? Ha ha!\" the huge rabbit quiped with levity. Her form rised higher and higher still as she finally reached her \"new\" full height, with Nick comparitively shrinking lower and lower until his eye level settled around her lower abdomen. Now being only inches away form her Nick wasn't quite prepared for the spectacle so he found himself retreat ever so slightly \"Uh y-yeah carrots I guess so. Huh hu.\" Nick stated as he laughed nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her ears merely inches from the ceiling while picking up on Nick's apprehension she tried to put him at ease by proclaiming, \"Holy mackerel Nick, look at me I must be the size anatolain shepherd. This is nuts!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are quite large Judy especially to me, but I'm not so sure I want to have to look old Finnick in the eye next time I see him.\" Nick stated bluntly wincing at the thought of such a scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I could use it again and you can police the streets of Little Rodetia, you could be our inside fox. There sure is a whole lot of crime we just don't see in that town, it could really help the ZPD.\" Judy said in a joking tone that got more and more serious as she got lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should worry about covering yourself up first, your not leaving much to the imagination you know!\" Nick scolded her absentmindedness while gesturing to her completely tatered clothing and turning to face away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering rabbit turned slightly red at the thought of her exposure and quickly removed her shredded garments and covered herself with a bedsheet. \"You could have spoke up sooner perv.Besides if you hadn't noticed your not exactly decent yourself!\" Judy said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know I know, but I'm not nearly 6 feet tall now am I. I think I could get away with it far better than you can. Anyway I'm sorry but I hadn't actually noticed until you stood ALL THE WAY UP! Nick explained while spreading his arms apart vertically sounding truly sorry to calm the behemoth buuny down not wanting to escalate her clear anger further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Nick, I know this must be tough and you did turn away so I was out of line.\" Judy appologized with deep regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's OK Carrots, what do you want to do? Maybe since you've seemingly figured it out you could use the stone to reset our sizes!\" Nick stated in a hopeful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe, but don't you think we should look into it first so we don't make a ireversable mistake?\" Judy asked in ernest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do that, I believe this fits the tale of the Wishing Stone to a T. So we could start there.\" Nick states recalling and old legend he heard as a cub.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wishing Stone eh, that sounds about right. Say I got an idea maybe you could use it to reset our sizes so we don't run into the whole \"it can only grant three wishes\" thing.\" Judy spoke normally until it got to the inner quote whereshe embelished with a silly voice before finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, It's not a genie Carrots or at least that's not how the legend goes. Yeah I could do that just to be on the safe side.\" Nick said matter-o-factly clearly amused by the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then, here take the stone \"little\" fox.\" Judy said with a toothy grin cleary loving this situation, hamming it all the way up with her delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she held out the stone out to the dwindled fox he couldn't help but belt out, \"Wow it's so BIG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What my paw or the stone?\" Judy intriguingly inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well both, I suppose!\" Nick answered quickly even though he hadn't given the stone that much thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess to you everything is BIG, however this stone is looking kinda dinky now but you can fix that now can't you?\" Judy idulged sweetly while anticipating Nick's next move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, how did this work for you, exactly?\" Nick asked, staring up at Judy. \"What did you do to trigger it again, Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought about what it would be like to be the tall and intimidating one, for a change. It's really strange but you have to really <i>feel </i>the wish or it won't work. Or, at least, that's what it seems like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick pondered Judy's words as he did some quick math. Each wish seemed to drop him at half his size each time. If he wasn't counting his ears, he stood at about 80 centimeters tall while Judy was closer to 60. If Judy made the wish twice, that would mean he went from 40 centimeters to his current height of 20 centimeters. And that 60 centimeters of lost height went straight to Judy, who effectively doubled in her normal size. No wonder Judy looked 6 feet tall! Nick was currently standing at much less than a foot in height, while Judy was just a hair shy of four feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers boggled Nick's mind as he looked up at Judy. At this height, he didn't even come up to her knees! There was a whole lot of bunny to love and the stone, which had been like a billiard ball when Nick first saw it was more like a medicine ball now in his paws. He had to use both of them as he lifted it up for Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Carrots, I think this is better off in your capable paws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Don't you want to get big again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe there is something to the idea of policing Rodentia,\" Nick laughed as he tried not to stare too long as Judy's towering form. \"World's first mouse-sized cop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're quite mouse-sized yet,\" Judy commented as she effortlessly hoisted what was a giant ball from Nick's paws. \"In fact, what if...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played with the orb for a moment and was able to now perfectly clench it in her paws. Then Judy gave a wicked smile before she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a growing flash again as Nick closed his eyes. Though he was not knocked back this time. Judy had gotten so big that she was able to contain the force of the stone all in the palm of her paw. No sooner than when Nick opened his eyes was he overcome with a familiar sinking sensation as the world around him got a lot more bigger. He dropped deeper into the pile of his own clothes as he lost another half of his dwindling height and he now stood mere inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was doing her own growing in the other corner of the room. Granted, the stone had less mass to transfer over to her, though it was still enough that her ears were pressed down from the ceiling before her head finally bumped it. She giggled slightly as Nick now barely came up to her ankles. The bedsheet wrapped around her was just hanging on by a thread. She was now 130 centimeters tall, while he was a measly 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" she said. \"The first mouse-fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick would be jubilant if he could see Nick in this state. Nick had always given the small fox trouble, now he was barely the size of an action figure. Though, somehow, he really enjoyed seeing Judy tower over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she said, reaching down with her free paw and opening it like a platform. \"Climb aboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick swallowed and did as commanded, standing shakily on Judy's paw. He lost his balance as she raised him up to her level. It was like riding the world's fuzziest elevator. From his eyes, Judy was the size of a small apartment building. And the room they were in was like a giant stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots,\" Nick finally managed to find his tongue. \"This is so...Surreal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Judy replied, holding him up to her face so she could hear him. \"I didn't think I'd wake up today and be able to hold you in my palm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick blushed slightly as he stared at her massive lips. \"Well, uh, I think I figured out what this stone really does. Every time you use it, I seem to lose half of my height. And then it gets transferred to you. So, it's not really a Wishing Stone more than it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Absorbing Stone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy finished his thought as she held up the Stone in her other paw. Nick gawked that it was now about half as big as he was. To think he had be carrying that around like a toy mere moments ago...Now he didn't even think he could lift it up in his state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a theory, anyway,\" Nick said. \"No way to know for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...Test it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to bringing it in, Officer Hopps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's clearly not harming you or me. And technically we did find it on the street, a public place. So what if we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick didn't know if he was scared or aroused by the wild look in his partner's giant eyes. Though, at this height, he was powerless to stop her. <i>What kind of monster have I just unleashed?</i> He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was up to Judy and Judy wanted to...</span></div></div>",

I mean look at me, I can barely fit in here as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true. Judy was like a building from Nick's eyes, though he knew that just meant he was very small. But even with their differences in height, she kept bumping around the furniture meant for someone half her current size. She had to constantly lean over so she didn't bump her head on the ceiling. Nick shuddered to think what she might be like at full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat said,\u201d Judy continued, a mischievous smile at her lips. \u201cI still want to get even bigger though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big are we talking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig enough,\u201d she winked at him causing Nick to shiver with excitement slightly. \u201cPerhaps somewhere so I don\u2019t have to go too far. I think walking around like this is going to certainly raise a few eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least until we find clothes that fit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, there was some noise in the hallway. Nick had been to Judy\u2019s place long enough to know that she didn\u2019t have the greatest neighbors when it came to volume. Being mouse-sized, however, the shouting match of Bucky and Pronk was intimidating to hear, especially with the holes in Judy\u2019s wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy\u2019s usual frown whenever the two came home suddenly lightened up as she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we tried it on them?\u201d Judy whispered. \u201cI could use a bit of revenge on the two of them and them being smaller might quiet things down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBucky and Pronk were a kudu and a gemsbok respectively, each standing roughly 170 centimeters or 5\u20197 each. And they were both about the same height the last time Nick saw them. Judy looked down at Nick in her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it could be nice to have some revenge on your noisy neighbors,\u201d Nick started, he still wasn\u2019t sure if he was on board with making Judy a giant or not yet. \u201cBut bursting through the door like this might raise some questions. Granted, you\u2019re still smaller than them. But they\u2019re pretty observant, last I saw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Judy thought aloud. \u201cWell, if I can\u2019t burst in then why don\u2019t you sneak over and sneak the size for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Me? How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy! You\u2019re small enough to fit in through the holes in the wall now! You can just creep over with the stone and catch them by surprise. Then head back with the stone when you\u2019re giant again. Then you can give the stone back and I can take the size you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a complicated plan, but Nick could see it working. The problem was, did he want to go through with it or just have Judy burst in and steal their heights? Or maybe there was another way they weren\u2019t thinking of?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to use two paws before she was forced to drop him on the floor, but by then Nick was nearing the size of her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, shrimp,\" she said, still looming over him but no longer the crushing giantess she had been moments before. \"Welcome to the land of the big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled and nodded along as he approached heights he had been used to before this whole mess with the stone had happened. As he continued to grow skywards, he did the math quickly in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Bucky or Pronk were 170 centimeters and he took half from one of them, that would mean that Nick was about to grow to 95 centimeters, a good head taller than he had been at the start. Despite that extra boost in height, Judy still remained taller than him. He frowned as he finally stopped growing, seeing how he barely came up to her chest in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,\" Judy said, rubbing him on the head. \"You look so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought rabbits didn't use the word cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do when they're not the ones being looked down on. You're just so tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just keep in mind I'm actually bigger than I once was,\" Nick confirmed by grabbing his shirt and showing that it was now a tight squeeze on him. \"It's you who's actually a giant bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to drive that point home, the two's ears perked up at the sound of shouting behind the apartment wall. They both pressed against to hear as the infamous noisy duo of Bucky and Pronk put on their usual show for them. Only with a twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck was that blinding light?\" squeaked a rather stunted sounding Pronk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck is with your voice?\" Bucky responded. \"You sound like a hamster on helium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shut up! I sound just fine! Think you're so cool making yourself all giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything, dumbo! You think making yourself small is going to make me take pity on you, think again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to be big in order to whoop your butt! You shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy couldn't help but snicker. Even magically shrinking one of them seemed to change nothing in particular about their usual verbal sparring matches with each other. Nick began to wonder what it would take to finally get them to stop fighting with each other before Judy whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, maybe we should mess with them a little more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Shouldn't we figure out a way to get you back to normal soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this one last thing! I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick realized he was still the one with the stone and sighed. Even if she was a giantess, Judy was still just too cute for her own good. \"Alright, what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy grinned and said...</span></div></div>",

I promise it's last time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouple seconds later Judy hold glowing stone in her paw tightly and wish to become even bigger. Bright flash and for her everything around again start to shrink. Her head hit the ceiling despite that she already bend it. Moments her back also press the ceiling, forceing rabbit to take a sit on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow... I can't even stand in my flat. It's so awesome\" Judy said. Her long legs press opposite wall so also there she need to bend it, trying not to crush the wall, any furniture or worse - Nick. But it was hard as she take more and more space in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy grow, Nick watch in amaze how everything around become much more massive, high. Especially his partner. Fox need to take step back against wall of gray fur. Floor moan under Judy's pressure. It was design to hold rubbit size animal, not three times bigger, and according to math about twenty seven times heavier. Hope it will hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a ride.\" Judy summarize as she finally stops growing. She was big and she now it. But only when she leave the room and stand straight, she could estimate how big she is. She carefully do it, trying not to crush anything. Also she takes couple blankets and bedding. Judy tight them up and make some kind of cover for her most private areas. <br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" She asked miniature fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well... like mountain of fluffiness, carrot\" Nick reply as he leave the room. For now he could reach Judy's knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy knock to noisy neighbors doors. \"Bucky! Pronk! Be quiet please!\"<br>\r\n\"Get out bunny!

He looked up... and up... and up to meet her eyes. Judy not even was small bunny at all, she was slightly bigher tham himself. About 180cm tall* but with her ears she looks even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"listen there. I got hard day today, I'm tired and someone almost shot me during raid. I want to sleep and I got enough your noisy shouting! Also <br>\r\ndisturbing the silence of the night is an offense. understand?\"<br>\r\nCombination her unusual size, almost nudity and confidence completely surprised Bucky and he can only stare. \"okay ma'am. I'm sorry\" He said and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow...

Growing had taken a lot of energy out of him, probably because their body's muscles and bones had to stretch and expand at a rapid rate. Shrinking was kind of the opposite and left Nick feeling very energized like a small child. Judy, however, had been doing nothing but growing the whole time. And growing quite a lot, at that. At 180 centimeters, she was standing three times as tall as she normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick could only watch as she leaned back with her head on the bed, now using it as a pillow instead of its intended purpose of a mattress not that she could fit on it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious,\" Nick stammered at the bunny that was four times as big as he was. \"Carrots, come on now. This has been fun but it's time to get things back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pretended not to hear him, closing her eyes and faking a snore until she actually did fall asleep. She was so exhausted from growing that she almost instantly passed out, the orb still clasped tightly within her paws. Nick was left dumbstruck at the sight of the sleeping giant, now far too small to be wearing any of his clothes and covering his lower body with his tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe that Judy was being this selfish. That rock must have been doing something to her head. Nick sighed as he knew what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get that thing back,\" he muttered. \"Before this gets even more crazier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgoing his shame, Nick began his long ascent up Judy's body, starting with her legs. He was careful not to use his claws so he wouldn't wake her, but she was out pretty cold. Though he still froze every time she breathed in funny before continuing his climb. He just had to get to her paw in his pint-sized state and free the orb from her clutches. The only question was if Nick was going to be sneaky enough to get the stone and make his wish to shrink Judy down to size a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen?</span></div></div>",

That made his outfit the best choice to wear as she made her way to the station. Thankfully, no one gave her a second look as she slipped down to the locker rooms to find herself a bigger uniform she could wear, being 50% bigger than she usually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed something for someone 90 centimeters tall, she was greeted by a sly voice around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean, Carrots. It's rather nice to be living large for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy fought a groan as she once again found herself looking up at Nick. She hated to admit it to herself, but she rather liked having to look down at him. Given that she had been 180 centimeters last night and Nick had been 45 before she went to sleep, that placed him in the range of 135 centimeters. Much larger than what he had previously been at. Judy noted that he seemed to be wearing his own new uniform, meant for more a wolf or ram in sizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh it up,\" Judy replied, adjusting to her new uniform. \"What did you do with the stone anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for me to know and you to find out. Lucky for you, we have work right now. Else I would take us home and fix this. Double lucky for us that no one seems to notice our little growths. They're so used to looking down at us, even being fifty percent bigger isn't much change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would if we used the stone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about the stone. Let's just get through today so we can fix this later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two of them made their way to the center of the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another busy day, with everyone off doing their own things that they didn't notice the oversized bunny and fox respectively. No one, that was, until the pair approached the front where a rather morose looking cheetah sat dejected. Judy broke from Nick to check up on their friend, much to Nick's annoyance who would rather go through the day keeping conversations to a minimum so they wouldn't get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clawhauser!\" Judy called, liking the fact that she no longer had to stand on her tippie toes to reach the front desk. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Clawhauser before doing a double take at the two. \"Did you guys get taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just because you're sitting down,\" Nick dismissed before changing the subject. \"What's eating you, big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" blubbered the cheetah. \"It's Bogo, I guess. He caught me listening to the new Gazelle album at work and confiscated it. But I think he's just listening to it himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible,\" Judy said. \"Clawhauser, you need to stand up to him. He shouldn't bully you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would, but have you seen the guy? I mean I know I'm big, but he's a giant compared to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true. Clawhauser stood at around 170 centimeters while Bogo towered over all of them at 250. And even he was on the small size compared to some of the rhinos and elephants in the precinct. As Nick frowned in sympathy for their friend, Judy's face suddenly lit up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick,\" she whispered in his ear. \"Can you bring out the stone again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, we're not using it to make you bigger, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that!

She gawked, realizing that she wasn't even as big as one of Bogo's pencil at her size. Each one was like a massive pole to her, which she could use to her advantage. Reaching the edge of the desk, she hung the pencil over the edge and used it to swing into the lock of the drawer where the album was being held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo,\" she said, pleased to find the CD case easily enough.

Before she could decide on what she could do, she heard a door open and felt the rumble of loud hoofsteps. Bogo had returned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her ear pressed against the lock of the drawer, Judy listened to hear the chief grumble to himself as he paced the room for a bit. What if he looked in the drawer for the album? Judy was likely to get caught! Then there was the stone that she had to leave on the desk. Crap! If Bogo found it then she might not have a way to get big again. Worse, Bogo might accidentally use it himself! It might be worth getting caught then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy weighted her options before deciding...</span></div></div>",

Luckily, she wasn't sent flying as \"field\" that was Bogo's desk seemed to get smaller and smaller, just as Bogo himself was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopps,\" he called out in a diminished voice. \"What are you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe disappeared into his shirt before he could finish his sentence.

Perhaps it would be good for him to see what it was like from a rabbit's perspective for a change. This, of course, also brought her to around 195 centimeters, the biggest she had gotten so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogo had finally won the battle with his clothes and his tiny head out from the collar just as Judy stopped her growing. He looked about ready to chew her out until he realized that she was suddenly over three times the size of him. With the stone in her paw, Judy had all the power over her boss, though she could just as easily play dumb as to why this happened and hide the stone from him. Then again, at this size he probably couldn't even get out of the room if Judy locked it up until they figured out what to do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought for a moment, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

He had the easy job in comparison and the poor camel driver in question was looking worse than if he had been in an actual bad accident. Nick finished up early enough and passed the time by looking at the name on the semitrailer. Mumbo's Magical Devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Nick couldn't help but say to himself. \"There's a first. A name I <i>don't</i> know in Zootopia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin was undamaged, but the back had taken a dent and the doors had swung open. Thankfully, only one box had spilled out onto the street and the driver had been quick to pick it up. A few loose items that looked like TV remotes had scattered on the road, but Nick didn't pay it much mind. The camel looked more concerned about the state of his package rather than his actual truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And don't do it again,\" Judy said, putting on her best impression of Bogo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his head hung low, the camel returned to his cabin and pulled out onto the road while Judy continued to direct traffic. Nick went to inspect the hydrant, now that the truck had moved, but thankfully there had been no damage done to the hippo-sized water container. Though Nick noticed something else on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, guess the poor guy missed one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far too late to flag the driver down, with him having sped off. Nick figured they would trace it back to the company owner eventually as he thumbed at the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly looked like a TV remote at a glance, though it only had two buttons. A plus sign and a negative sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This had to be the worst remote control I've ever seen,\" he muttered to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much of a thought, he thumbed at the buttons. Who wouldn't, after all. Nick absentmindedly clicked the plus sign in a general direction, and that direction just so happened to be Judy Hopps. To his surprise, an almost invisible bolt of lightning shot from the top of the remote and straight at Judy without her even noticing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bolt struck her right in the...</span></div></div>",

There it was absorbed in almost a blink of an eye. Nick quickly hid the remote behind his back, afraid someone might notice what happened. Judy certainly didn't and it was a good thing too as Nick's eyes drifted below the equator. His jaw dropped like when she had busted him for tax evasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no kind way to say it. Judy's butt was inflating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like someone had taken an air pump and used it several times, like in the cartoons, all focused on her rear end. Her tail went straight up as there was slightly more space for it to be resting on. Indeed, her rump was starting to look more like a shelf for her cottontail. But then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" Judy must have realized he had been staring at her. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Judy remained blissfully aware that there was significantly more of her down below. Nick to process all that had happened in the span of a few seconds before she starting asking the wrong questions. Somehow, he had gotten his paws on a magical remote that could...Well, inflate people. And he had just used it on his partner, making her more pleasing to the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked at him expectantly as he went with the first thing to came to mind...</span></div></div>",

It just needed to be in the right time and place, not standing in the middle of the street with people watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, um, Carrots.

That's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy did as commanded, taking a look over her shoulder at the cracked mirror off in the corner of the alley. Her reaction was predictable, eyes wide with denial until she grabbed hold of her bottom to confirm that there was significantly more cushion in her caboose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet cheese and crackers,\" she shrieked. \"I'm as big as a whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd say you're more chubby in the bottom than an actual whale, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly what this is!

While Nick stared at the most fascinating tin can in the world, Judy wiggled her enlarged rump around slightly as if she was getting a better feel for it. Then she cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I be honest too, for a minute?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, no one's gonna stop you, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...Kind of feels good.

There's a million and one regulations on what we're supposed to do in this situation, as bizarre as it is.

Nick, being a canine with a sharp nose, could detect that the clear arousal in her eyes wasn't just a mask. He had never seen Judy quite like this before. Had he accidentally stumbled upon something that finally triggered the stonewall bunny cop? The prude who couldn't even walk through the naturalist colony without a blindfold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick found the remote in his paws again, aimed as Judy.

She could barely contain herself as she waited patiently for Nick to make his decision, all the while battling with herself. Indeed, her thoughts were something of a war zone. The rational part of her was telling herself that this was impossible. Mammals didn't just inflate. Yet, here it was. The ability to make anyone bigger with just the push of a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would never admit it to anyone, but she hated the fact that she was always the small one. Even among rabbits, she was rather shorter and skinny. Her parents called it the \"runt of the litter\" syndrome, which is why they attributed it to Judy's need to do dangerous things like being a cop. That deep longing to be seen as one of the bigger mammals developed into something more pronounced when she reached adolescence, like a secret obsession as she found herself drawn to curious things like the scene in the blueberry scene in Willy Woofa and the Chocolate Factory. Though it wasn't until a few months of living in the city that she stumbled across something that truly defined her interest. They didn't have much in the way of internet on the farm, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough careful research, she discovered that there was a society within mammal culture which fantasized about inflating themselves into giant balloons. Judy once laughed at the prospect, until she found it fascinating enough to fall down the literal rabbit hole. Suddenly, she was immersed in what amounted to a secret internet cult, making an anonymous persona and infiltrating several groups for various catered specifics that caught her eye. She approached the matter with the same vigor and determination as she did anything she set her mind to and rather ambitiously made a name for herself rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, she had become a closet inflation fetishist in the span of a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose first few days were intense, scouring the catalogue of various artists and writers who had pooled collective works together in the many unsavory and deviant places on the internet. Over time, she developed a refined taste and could hunt down exactly what she knew scratched her particular itch. More often than not, she would spend her work hours daydreaming of what might await her back at the apartment when she had alone time. She wouldn't dare use the work computer for such activities, after all. It was only when she had become situated enough that she would begin fantasying what it would be like with her as the intended victim. To become bigger, bloated, balloony, full, and swollen. There were several brave mammals she had seen videos of who would actually use a hose in the most inglorious ways to achieve a partial real life effect. But nothing like the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for that reason why Judy found herself shaking with anticipation as Nick pulled the trigger and let her wildest fantasies come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy yelped and brought a paw to her belly. Now that she was really focusing on it, she could feel it happen as the bolt of electricity from the remote settled into her stomach to do its business. What followed was a rising sense of pressure akin to what might happen if one drank a whole liter of soda in one sitting. It was like having a burp that couldn't quite get out. And with that growing pressure came a fullness like eating a very hefty meal. And just when Judy felt like her stomach couldn't hold anymore of whatever she was filling up with, she broke beyond her limit. That was when the swelling started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tightness in her lower abdomen that caused her to panic slightly until she realized it was her belt cutting into her growing stomach. It looked as if she was taking her deepest breath out, and try as she might she couldn't suck the gut back in. Instead it only pushed forward at a steady and comfortable pace. Judy quickly undid the strap of her utility cord and was met with instant relief as her inflated stomach surged forward a few inches. To the unknowing observer, it might look like she was a few months pregnant. Her fur was tight as a drum beneath her jumpsuit, yet somehow it was able to keep stretching like it was made of elastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt around her growing new addition, she bit back a moan. Her paws traced around her expanding girth, finding unfamiliar curves as she explored herself. The surprise came when she found her hips were also growing outwards, giving her a distinctly pear shaped silhouette. There was the faintest sound of a hiss in the air, if she listened closely enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel when the experience stopped, her body settling into place to accommodate her enhanced attributes. It was almost disappointing were it not for how tight and stretched out Judy was feeling already from the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked just as fascinated in the expansion as she was as he lowered the remote. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy bounced on the balls of her feet, expecting there to be some heavy resistance with so much more of her taking up her point of view. The laws of mass told her that she should be weightier and bulky, but she didn't feel that way at all. More like the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light,\" Judy commented. \"Almost like I'm filling up with air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, a pat on her stomach caused a hollow noise to resonate from her touch. Nick continued to step around in the background, looking over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said. \"I pressed the button. Now we gotta get you back to normal before someone sees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was suddenly overtaken by an irrational rush of fear, like the thought she might lose something. She had finally gotten to be big, or at least bigger, and the idea of someone taking that away from her was enough to abandon all logical thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" she bargained. \"Just one more press. Then we can go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You must <i>really </i>like this, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you?\" Judy asked, showing off her new curves. \"You're the one who picked this part of me to grow, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you guilt me into this. You were practically begging me for it. How come I gotta be the responsible one here? You're messing with our group dynamics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Nick,\" she put on the best face she could to warm his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick groaned and aimed the remote at her again before saying...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How about you go to normal for now?\" Nick asked, pulling back the remote as soon as Judy made a jump for it. \"But then we play with this in private? You know? When we're off duty and not lurking in the alleyway like a couple of goons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Judy loathed to admit it, Nick had a point. She had almost lost herself entirely to the rush of fulfilling her deepest fantasy. And now that she was settling down for a minute and thinking rationally, she could look down at herself and feel rather exposed. In that embarrassment, she started to cover herself like she was standing there naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken,\" she muttered, trying to hide the blush in her ears. \"Is this weird, Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird doesn't even begin to describe it,\" he replied. \"But the good kind of weird. I didn't think you'd be into this sort of thing. Heck, I didn't even think I would be. But here we are. And it can be our little secret if you want it to be. Or you want to just do it on your own, I would totally get that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the blush spread from Judy's ears to her face. \"I kinda like having you here. As a measure of control in case I go nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we both know that there's no stopping you if you set your mind to something,\" Nick chuckled as he held up the remote. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy inspected herself one last time. She still felt like a tick ready to pop, but it was rather soothing being like this if a bit strange. Nick had put it best, it was the good kind of weird. Like scratching a particular she didn't even know she had. She gripped a pawful of her bloated belly, letting it wobble in place before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost bizarre being back to normal, even though she hadn't been inflated for all that long. When she was swollen, she felt bigger like for once she didn't have to worry about getting stepped on in the city. Being deflated left her feeling empty, almost. Everything was heavier again, even if it was only slightly. And it only made the day drag on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was the longest day in the ZPD that Judy had ever experienced, her first day on parking duty being a close second. More than once Judy had felt the urge to go to Nick and find out where he had hidden the remote so she could use it and scratch that deep-seeded itch that seemed to be growing with every passing minute. But she remained professional and dutiful, never once letting her desires take control and completing everything that was assigned to her in her typical speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive o'clock rolled around and Nick did the usual after work ritual. They met at the steps of the ZPD, hopped on the same bus together, and left for home. The difference this time, however, was that Nick got off with Judy at her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long have you been into this?\" Nick asked as they entered the relative quiet of her apartment. Buck and Pronk were out on a date tonight, meaning they would have some privacy for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering you didn't immediately freak out, you're either remarkably calm and rational all the time, which trust me you're not, or you have an interest what this thing does.\" Nick held up the remote, which he had kept hidden all day. \"Speaking of which, when we're done tonight we should probably done some research into this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Judy groaned. \"And you're right. About both things. To answer your original question...I dunno. I guess always? But I didn't really know until recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we're both novices here then,\" Nick undid the knot of his tie. \"So, how do you want to do this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had been thinking about this all day. She suddenly had the power to fulfill her ultimate deviant fantasies right at her fingertips, there was so much she wanted to do with it. To narrow it all down on a place to begin was almost laughable. But she could think of one initial goal in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be able to float,\" she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a balloon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was feeling lighter when I was bigger,\" Judy patted her now flatter stomach. \"I know it's possible, even if it doesn't make physical sense. But there was also a limit I was feeling too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you'll pop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Judy admitted. \"But I feel like the first step is going to be to try and see what that limit is. See how big I can get at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope we have enough space in your apartment then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy appreciated a little humor in all this as she removed her work vest in favor of slipping into something a little more comfortable for the activities they were about to do. She settled for a robe, loose enough not at all constricting so there would be plenty of room to grow without ruining her clothes. As she returned from the bathroom changed, she found Nick waiting for her with his own clothes disheveled to get comfortable. She bit her lip in anticipation of the moment of truth. How big could she get at this stage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nick would finally press the button, she would grow to...</span></div></div>",

Just do it already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy knew by now that Nick was just fooling around to relieve some of the tension in the air. She couldn't deny that she was nervous too. They were friends, best friends. But this was the most intimate thing they had ever done together. There certainly was that same level of anticipation in the air. Not that Judy hadn't ever thought about it. Heck, even one of her daydreams had been something akin to this exact situation, only with a pump instead of a remote. Truthfully, she was overjoyed that she could share this with him. It felt close and personal, but he just had to ruin it by talking sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another second of warning, Judy was hit by the same bolt of electricity as in the alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer paws shot to her gut, slightly growing beneath her robes, as Judy failed in hiding her surprised yelp. It was a gentler pressure than before, but it nevertheless was foreign. Almost immediately she felt as if she had eaten a very big dinner, despite having skipped the meal to jump into inflating herself. She briefly toyed with the idea of never having to eat again as a balloon before loosening her robe's belt. The speed at which she returned to the size she was before was quicker and even Nick noticed as he lowered the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's happening faster now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Judy said, patting at her exposed belly. \"And I don't feel as full as the last time either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's getting easier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" a rather kinky idea crossed Judy's mind. \"Nick, could you do me a favor? Could you just hold the button down until I say stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a little dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit. But that's kind of the fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo sweeten the deal, Judy shouldered off her robe and dropped it to the floor. She was still wearing her underwear and sports bra, of course, but it was the most exposure the two of them had with her each other. She wasn't blind and though her nose wasn't as powerful as a canine's, she could detect her own little things too. Try as he might, Nick couldn't hide his own arousal from her as he shifted around on his feet. And even though she felt like a pumpkin with bunny legs, Judy clearly had his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" she cooed with the right tone of voice. \"I want to see how big I can get before it's too much. Don't you want to see that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick thought for a moment before holding up the remote again. \"Alright. But the safe word is watermelon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy trembled as the bolt struck her again, only this time it continued to splash into her like a beam of violent blue light. It was almost like it was swirling within her before growing out in all directions. She was glad to have removed her robe, doing so allowed for a front row view of the changes going on in her entire body. Not just her potbelly, though that was certainly the epicenter of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her two paws on her stomach and pressed down into the soft fur as it swelled between her fingertips. In a matter of seconds, she had gone beyond the point of looking pregnant and into the realms of cartoonishly distorted. Her hips and thighs were also starting to see some swelling to accommodate the extra growth, making her look more like a rabbit who had gained a lot of weight in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, the feeling was ecstasy. The feeling of fullness magnified a hundredfold, yet despite that there was a deep hollow feeling that kept growing with her size. The hissing she faintly heard earlier that day was steadily increasing in volume and taking a deeper pitch as there was more of the bunny to fill out. It felt like a thousand tiny hands tugging and pulling her skin in all directions like a gentle massage. And it was all so soft. The inflation seemed to make the flesh beneath the fur doughy and stretchy, like she was slowly being molding into rubber as a deeper force within her expanded and made room for itself in her body. Patting her taunt belly, Judy knew it was air that was moving around in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't content with lingering around in just her lower body and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's feet curled as the air built higher and higher on top of itself, spreading to all corners of her body. It came in the form of her chest looking puffy, when moments before it had been nonexistent. Her breasts were beginning to strain the clasps of her sports bra, which below her underwear was stretching to its very limits to keep up. Three key areas on her body began a focus. Butt, belly, and boobs. But even then, the growing didn't stop there. Her arms were starting to stiffen ever so slightly, all the way down to her fingers which puffed up like she was wearing gloves. Her legs were harder to keep together as her thighs and calves thickened as the swelling muscles in her groin started to inflate too. She even lost a little flexibility with her ears as they straightened up on top of her head and plumpened with the air coursing through her body. And it wasn't just outwards she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed it when her breasts had expanded a few cup sizes and her torso was starting to look like a beachball. Nick didn't look quite as tall as she was used to seeing him. Judy held her breath, she was actually starting to get taller as well as rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inflation process seemed content with keeping her in the proportions she was in as the room around her started to look just a little bit smaller, her tiny apartment seeming just a bit more cramped. The sound of Judy's heartbeat pounded away in her ear, muted only by the continually hiss of air. Her bra was really starting to dig into her torso and her panties starting to look more like a g-string. She wanted to be even bigger, but instead she felt ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watermelon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick released the button as Judy fell backwards, expecting to land hard on her swollen bottom. Instead she bounce a good foot in the air before hitting the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Nick asked, tossing the remote to the side and offering her a paw to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took it, noting how puffy her paws in comparison to his. But that wasn't the only thing different when she was brought to her feet. She beamed as Nick looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not standing on something, are you Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" she grinned. \"How's it feel to be standing eye to eye with a bunny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Pretty good from where I'm standing. How about this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy let out a slight squeak as Nick grabbed her by the waist and hoisted her straight into the air effortlessly. He had been able to carry her before, but in his paws Judy truly felt like she was weightless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you think I weight?\" she had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were, what? Forty pounds before? Half that now, if I'm any judge. You're lucky we didn't do this outside, you'd go flying away in a strong breeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's the idea,\" she said, cupping his face with her chubby paws. His eyes were studying her with a certain hunger in them. \"What do you want to do now with your balloon, slick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of a few things.\"</span></div></div>",

He glanced down to find Judy in a similar state of undress looking a little smaller than he remembered her being from last night. The memories flashed over him of what they had been doing together and he distinctly remembered Judy being the size of him during all of that. Had Judy deflated in the middle of the night? Or had she managed to slip out of bed and change back with the remote?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't waiting long for an answer as Judy stirred awake herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" she muttered, rubbing her eyes before looking down. \"What happened? I'm small again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that answers that question,\" Nick chuckled to himself. \"Looks like sleeping it off caused you to lose all your air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Judy looked a little upset before smiling. \"Oh, well. It was still fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was definitely an experience I won't soon forget. But yes, I had fun. Though we should probably discuss what that means now, between the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Judy's voice trailed as she covered herself up with her tossed aside robe. \"Raincheck on that? We should probably shower and get ready for work. But tonight...Tonight I want to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good enough for Nick. It was a lot to take in all at once and truthfully he didn't know what he wanted out of it. A relationship or friends with benefits, it would require some thought when most of what they had been doing the night before had been pure instinct and sexual drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wandered to her shower, Nick passed the time gathering up his clothes and preparation for his turn. They had to wash the scent of themselves off or the whole office was going to start gossiping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that was done, he needed some coffee and prepped the burner while Judy turned off the water and was drying off. He listened to her pitter-patter of feet through the walls as they did a strange dance, like she was looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Nick?\" she asked from the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"</span></div></div>",

Nick's eyes glanced over to the bathroom door to be greeted by a sight he should have been used to by now, but was surprising all the same. Judy's rump was swollen like a bookshelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Judy asked, showing off her inflated rear with a slight dance. \"And where's the remote? There?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked over to the nightstand to see the remote right where he had left it in the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, wait,\" he said, picking it up. \"If that's here then how did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a bit of a thought, right? Since last night I've been feeling kind of hollow. I can't explain it, but it's just like how I feel when inflated only muted. And you know how in the cartoons the character puts their thumb in their mouth and blows? And, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mimicked the same feat Nick had same a hundred times before on the Saturday morning television. With a deep breath, suddenly her stomach was at the same size it was with one click of the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...,\" Nick slumped down on the bed. \"Do you think this has to do with the fact that you deflated last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I wonder if I can get back to the same size as I was then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey, wait a sec, Carrots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught her mid breath as she looked confused for a moment, like it was the most obvious thing in the world to want to be bigger. Nick was wondering if this was a good thing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Nick explained, holding up the clock from the nightstand. \"We have like thirty minutes for me to shower and get to work or we'll miss the bullpen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can afford to be five minutes late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots, you <i>never </i>miss the bullpen. The minute the two of walk in late together from the same cab, everyone in the whole station is going to know about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the twitch in Judy's face, Nick could tell that she wasn't quite ready to admit the next level of their relationship to the public yet either. Especially while they were still trying to figure things out for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that,\" continued Nick. \"Have you thought about how you're going to get back to normal now that you're like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked down at her bloated belly and butt. \"Well...Maybe we can use the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know if it will work like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if we called in sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots, you're the star of the ZPD. Now you're looking into playing hooky over this? I don't think that's a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! It's bad, but I just can't help it! Aren't you having fun too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, and I think that's kind of the problem here. Look, this has been great, it really has. But we gotta be adults here and realize that we gotta keep this under wraps or we're going to get in a lot of trouble. We should have turned this thing in the moment we got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick aimed the remote at her and pressed the minus button. Judy frowned as her entire returned back to its normal shape and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...I'm sorry, Nick. This is just really exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it is. But come on, you can make it through the workday without inflating yourself, right?

At least we're lucky enough to get the follow up to that truck accident yesterday.

It was cold comfort to think that one day she might be able to inflate herself large enough to be bigger than all of them. Though they would probably never see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she arrived at the kitchen, she grunted trying to climb the counter meant for an elephant to get to the grinder. Then came the long and tedious process of collecting the beans and assembling everything. As she kicked the machine on, she took a careful glance around the room over the loud grinding noise. Surely no one was going to notice if she did a little inflation. She could control it enough to escape notice. She had to master this new power eventually anyway. Just a small one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took a deep breath and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Judy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden shrill voice of Clawhauser pierced even the coffee grinder.

Without wasting anymore time, she ducked behind a nearby fern just as Fangmeyer and Wolfard passed her by unnoticed.

So, what I was going to do is deflate myself again and you can just...Climb in through my mouth and we can see what happens. Does that sound like fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Carrots. You being in that state leaves you very vulnerable. I know cartoon logic seems to apply with you now, but this feels like a stretch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea,\" Judy winked at him as she put her paws to waist in preparation to squeeze. \"Let's just try and see what happens. I promise, this will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was left with no time to reject as he was taken aback by a massive gust of wind coming from Judy's mouth. He stood dumbfounded as his best friend and partner began to shrivel up and fold in on herself, starting with her legs and working its way up. Nick had to reach out and grab her by the deflated wrist before she blew away in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know my last name is Wilde,\" he said to the grinning bunny skinsuit. \"But I'm starting to think that's a more appropriate title for you, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed as he held out the remains of Judy.

Instead, from the outside, there didn't appear to be any visible distortion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this might work after all,\" he commented as he brought his other foot inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, both legs fit snugly in their respective holes with it looking like Judy's normal pair of legs from Nick's perspective. He walked around a bit, adjusting to the fact that his feet had apparently shrunk up to his knees. His legs were also starting to dwindle to match Judy's exact body shape while Judy's face stared up at him around his waist. It looked almost comical, like she was a snake eating a much larger prey. Or if Nick was putting on a very realistic looking Judy onesie. From his angle, it looked like Judy was smiling and saying <i>told you so</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can admit when I'm wrong, Carrots. Let's just finish this up first. I don't know how I'm supposed to fit in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was that his body was supposed to be compressed and squished into Judy's mold. The \"Judy suit\" had absolutely no give to it, despite looking like elastic. Nick could feel his spine fold like an accordion as he pulled the disguise up higher and higher, making sure to tuck his tail in first. While the hips of the suit certainly offered plenty of room, Nick had a much longer torso than Judy did. As he squeezed himself in through the rabbit's mouth, he found it getting tighter and tighter, while the rooftop around him seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. He grunted, it was like someone was trying to squeeze him into a narrowing tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got harder trying to fit his arms into the right spots, or more specifically his paws into the thin fingers where Judy's own would be. More and more, Nick felt like toothpaste trying to be pushed back into its tube. When he was sure something was going to snap as he slipped his other arm into Judy's mouth, he felt something in his own body snap as he suddenly got a whole lot smaller. His entire perspective had just dropped over a foot in height, which when you were already the size of a fox that was a big deal. That's when he realized that he was officially Judy's height, minus her long ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he had to say, adjusting to the vertigo. \"I never realized just how short you were before, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heights wasn't the only that had altered. Walking around for a bit, Nick recognized that there was a little more 'omph' to his hips. That's when he looked down and saw that his lanky body had been modeled into the curvaceous shape of Judy's distinctly female one. He now had the waist and the butt to match her, as well as the tail which he was able to wiggle around by flexing his own. There was really only their heads as a difference between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else left to do, Nick grabbed Judy's gaping mouth around his neck and hoisted it up over his snout. This proved challenging in its own right, as he tried to align her eyes with his. Nick's fox muzzle was quite long compared to Judy's and he could feel it scrunch up as the \"mask\" molded his face. All the extra mass traveled up to his ears, much in the way it had to his hips prior. Suddenly, he could hear a lot better as he developed a pair of tall rabbit ears. The rest of him aligned into place as Judy's buck teeth pushed over Nick's sharp canine ones. Standing where he had just moments prior was the perfect clone of Judy Hopps, down to the last hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just unreal,\" Nick said in a voice that was distinctly his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it would work,\" he found that his mouth moved by itself, speaking exactly in Judy's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Carrots, you're still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! You're only inside me and controlling how I move. But at least I can talk now. Safe to say if you ever needed to hide from the Chief, you could go posing as me for a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick let out a nervous laugh, wondering what exactly this new development meant. These powers of Judy seemed to be growing and ever changing. Who was to say what would happen if they were left unchecked, as fun as it was to see things from her perspective for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick eyed around the rooftop, wondering what they should do next. He should really climb out of Judy before someone saw them, though Judy didn't seem to be in any hurry for that yet. He had to wonder what had become of his own body during all this. Surely being compressed into a rabbit shape wasn't any good for him. Not to mention the remote was just in sight of them, sticking out of his empty pants pocket on the ground. Nick had a strong desire to climb out of Judy before something wrong happened. This was a police station and an emergency could happen at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was...</span></div></div>",

Apparently there was some shady dealings going on at an abandoned warehouse near the docks.

Further digging revealed that there has never been a company under that name in the Zootopia registry of business. And a recent stakeout last night showed us that they've been moving products all over the city via vans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick could recall the sight they had first stumbled on with the remote and how it had been left behind after a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We suspect this is all a front for some drugs or illegal substances,\" Bogo said. \"And we have a warrant from the mayor. He doesn't want any funny business any more after the Nighthowler incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Nick shared a concerned look with each other. They knew perfectly well that the devices were in fact legitimate. Perhaps people had been purchasing them without knowing what they did. But they couldn't tell Bogo that without knowing everything so they kept quiet for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then,\" Bogo said as they stepped out from the van with the rest of the squad. \"This will be a short rush in and arresting on whoever we find inside.

Not until she was standing eye to eye with a lady giraffe after knocking on the door to the laboratory. She was a perfectly normal looking giraffe too, with all the right proportions and everything. She just was wearing a lab coat that looked much to big on her and she didn't even come up to Judy's ears in height...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Hopps!\" the giraffe said with more enthusiasm than even Judy was known for giving. \"Welcome to ZR&amp;D! I'm Doctor Hightower, though as you can see, not quite so high anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, yeah,\" Judy shook her head to remember her manners and took the giraffe's offered hoof. \"Pleased to, uh, meet you. I guess it's safe to say that the briefing <i>wasn't </i>a lie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed! I'm sure you've been told everything already. Top secret and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had indeed, though she had admittedly thought the Chief's idea was his attempt at a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big family had been spreading its reach across Zootopia following Bellwether's arrest in an attempt to get a bigger hold with the vacuum of power in disarray. Even with her own ties to the family, Judy couldn't convince Mister Big to back down on this matter. She was a cop, after all, and he was a mobster. Though the shrew was smart. Indeed of expanding his influence in catnip and other drugs using his giant polar bears when the city was already nervous about preds, this time he was using a smaller approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need someone inside Little Rodentia,\" Judy explained as she walked with the shrunken giraffe. \"Someone with police training and that we can trust. Unfortunately, Little Rodentia is something of a tricky place for any of our...Bigger guys to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where I can come in,\" Doctor Hightower sounded positively thrilled. \"I had been telling Mayor Lionheart for years now that shrinking technology would solve so many of the city's housing and food problems what with such a diverse array of citizens in Zootopia. I think he just gave me a grant to look good in the science crowd for votes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he does that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure I've already proven the fruits of my labor. I find I save a bundle being rabbit sized on rent and groceries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I will be able to grow back to normal...Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" replied the giraffe as she climbed up to a much larger stool to the computer. \"It's all perfectly safe and I've been on every end of the spectrum just to be sure you're no test bunny. Who knows? Maybe when this is all done, I could bump you up a bit so you don't get picked on as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy could only imagine the look on Nick's face if she suddenly walked into work bigger than he was. \"We'll see about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, let's begin then shall we?\" the doctor began typing into her computer. \"How tall are you exactly in centimeters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"81.3.\" Judy had been asked to measure herself before hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And without the ears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"60.5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talks of size measurements continued as Judy fidgeted nervously in place. It slowly occurred to her that this was real. She was really going to be shrunk down to the size of a mouse to infiltrate Mister Big's operation. It was almost like science fiction. Mammals didn't just shrink It was bizarre and...Kind of exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor finished up her notes and fiddled with a machine on her desk that hummed. Judy spied a green liquid filling a small glass vial before Hightower produced a syringe and sucked out an exact amount, measuring twice before nodding to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slid up your arm, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy did as commanded as the giraffe hopped onto the floor and injected her with the substance. Judy winced for a moment before she felt a cooling sensation run through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the goal is to bring you to about 15 centimeters,\" explained the doctor. \"The height of an average rat. But this process isn't an exact science yet, so you may be a little over or under.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will this work, exactly?\" Judy asked, rubbing at the injection spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, that serum I just injected you with...\"</span></div></div>",

It's also similar to how if you keep a goldfish in a larger bowl, it will grow bigger than if you keep it in a tiny tank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Judy replied as there was a cold feeling running through her veins now. \"I feel funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the serum working its way through your body. It doesn't happen all at once, you see. It needs some time to spread to every corner, so it will take about a week to leave your system. In the meantime, I recommend taking it easy before then. Like I said, this is not an exact science. You may end up bigger or smaller than intended. From there, I will distill the growth serum to bring you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I do mean take it easy! I've heard about your antic from Chief Bogo himself. Your body is going to be going through some drastic changes and you might be in danger of wearing yourself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Nick was along to pick Judy up from the laboratory shortly after Judy had been discharged with a few vitamins to keep up her body's strength during the process. Nick brought his sense of humor with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is actually legitimate?\" he asked. \"You don't look any shorter, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said it should take a week and I should measure myself in an hour to confirm that it's working. Then it's just a matter of waiting a week if all goes well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? Sounds all too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the hard part is going to be going undercover once I'm there. Don't suppose Finnick has any disguises I could use to pretend to be a mouse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I'm sure we'll come up with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was glad Nick was there as she could feel the serum working its way through her body. It was a cold sensation that burned at her veins, it was hard to know if that was normal or not. If she was going to be cut to a fourth of her size, it was nice to know she at least hard her partner at her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogo allowed for Judy to go straight home for the rest of the day with her being on desk duty until she couldn't be working.

Judy had heard of the spine decompressing over the course of the day before, but this was different. Now that she really focused, she could feel that her clothes felt slightly bigger. Her uniform, which was normally skintight and hugged her body perfectly was now a little bit loose in some areas. And there was a weird tingle running through her veins. Followed by the itch of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing,\" she said, going to the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking this a lot better than I would, Carrots,\" Nick said as he watched her dig through a box. \"I'd be freaking out at the prospect of shrinking away into nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work like that,\" Judy answered. \"And the doctor said it can easily be reversed at any time. So, might as well enjoy it while I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out some clothes sent from home. Judy had asked her parents ahead of time to send her a bunch of old outfits from all her sisters of various ages, she didn't tell them that she would be the one wearing. After all, didn't need them freaking out over this latest new mission. It was just nice to be prepared for being a various sizes she hadn't been since she was a kid as she pulled out a small dress meant for a bunny two years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get to work though,\" Judy said. \"Planning who I'm going to have to investigate when the real mission begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plan? Bogo said you should take the day off. Don't you feel tired? You just shrunk over a centimeters, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine, Nick,\" Judy shooed away his concern. \"Come on, I'd like to get this done before I'm too small to hold a pencil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two of them got to work mapping out Judy's apartment into her new workspace and then set to work on getting leads Judy could infiltrate once mouse sized. They worked through the morning and into the afternoon. Before long it was approaching dinner as their stomach grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had been sitting in her chair the whole time, but she was certain she had shrunk some more. Her uniform was now rather limp on her as she stood up to approach the wall for a measurement before the pair went out to get some dinner.

They're basically tiny microscopic robots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct! Though they can only do simple tasks, with enough of them you can program them to do things normal medicine simply isn't able to. Though the tech isn't there yet to understand and combat things like cancer, we <i>do </i>understand how cells grow and shrink through countless, careful hours of observation. With this successful trial run of my research in the field, we may be able to get the funding to expand this into breakthroughs to allow anyone to become any size, shape, or even species they want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Judy replied. \"Considering I come from a farm that sounds almost like far fetched scifi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I need to do is prove that this has practical use in the real world! So, trust me when I say I will do everything I can to keep you safe during this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reassured Judy to hear that. \"Well, how does this work exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to give the nanobots a few hours to run through your entire system and attach themselves to your cells. From there, I've constructed a tool to control how big or how small you want to be in the form of a wrist watch just like the one I'm wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe held up the silver watch that hung limply on her wrist.

She watched as Hightower produced a similar looking watch from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she explained, handing the device over to Judy. \"Obviously the watch won't shrink with you, so you'll have to be careful.
