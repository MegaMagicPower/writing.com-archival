He had smashed a wooden coat rack to make a walking stick, to help him move while he still had on his casts. He was thankful that there was many nooks and crannys that he could hide in when he thought Lilith was passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'It's gotta be here someplace. All those books and stories that Barrel had about vampire castles and demon castles having large libraries has to be true. They have to! And one of the books there will have a way home!'</i> Megaman thought, as he continued to walk. Then he got a feeling to hide. After quickly looking around, he hid in an alcove behind a large suit of armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meggypoo! Where are you?\" Lilith called out as she walked past. She then muttered to herself. \"Now where is he? I could have sworn he came this way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman heard the sound of Lilith stretching out her wings and then a slight 'woosh' noise that let Megaman know that Lilith was flying away.

Not that MegaMan didn't appreciate the help and affection she had been giving him since she had saved his life and nursed him back to health, but he HAD to get out of here! The fact that Lilith was so smitten with him that she was trying to keep him as hers didn't really mesh with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan looked back...only to have his face clash to a large pair of breasts! Suddenly the woman hugged him, squeezing his face to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. What have we here?\" She said in a playfully seductive tone as she raised his face up, allowing him to breath again as she studied him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe a full-grown woman that looked like she could have passed as a supermodel. Her apparel consisted of of a white airy blouse and a pair of close fitting pair of hip-huggers. She pushed aside a couple strands of hair and tucked it behind her ear. Her emerald eyes sparkled in a way that made him nervous. Her green hair flowed like a rich sea wave behind her head, and her leather bodice had a heart shaped cutout revealing her tummy. Her purple stockings... boots...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, he recognized this woman. She was Morrigan Aensland...Lilith's older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOT GOOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Lilith got him bothered while she was still learning how to mess with a guy's head, he didn't even want to THINK about what the one who more than likely taught her the finer points of it went!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing furiously, The digger/purifier unit tried pulling away, to no effect. She was even stronger than she was beautiful...Gah! 'Bad thought, don't go there\u2026!' MegaMan told himself as he flailed his arms up and down like a mad penguin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you just the cutest!\" Morrigan laughed, seeing how embarrassed he was. So THIS was what her sister had kept trying to hide from her! Not that she had succeeded...Lilith's little invisibility spell was admittedly a low-level, more like refraction than actual invisibility. Easy for someone like her to see through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...Morrigan could see why her little sister wouldn't want to share. This one was cute and REEKED of un-snatched innocence. It made Morrigan giddy. She licked her lips and gazed at him while he had so much blood rushing to his face that he was about to black out. But he still caught Morrigan's eyes with his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan felt he was being pulled in by an unknown force. He couldn't look away from Morrigan's eyes.  And his mind started feeling hazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorrigan released him and then softly blew in the tip of his nose, and he fell over like a statue that had been knocked over.</span></div></div>",

He told her of time he spent of Kattelox. He told her of the events leading up to how he had gotten stuck on the moon and how he had managed to leave it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, Morrigan's smile gained a thoughtful look as her thoughts went something like <i>'It seems like trouble seeks you out, Megaman... I like it. Never a chance to get bored... But I should go with my first plan...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Megaman... I guess fate's decided to reward you...\" Morrigan said before she kissed him on the lips. She then stood up. \"Let your new lover and master show you around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ms. Morrigan...\" Megaman said as he stood up. His eyes were flat, but full of love for Morrigan.

She had a bit of a psychotic gleam in her eye as she chopped some meat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second had medium length blue hair and seemed like she was bored with everything. She was stirring a  pot of soup, but had a hammer nearby if whatever was in the soup tried to leave it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third had long blonde hair, tied in ponytail.

So, whatcha think she brought a human here for, Asphodel? Love, lust, or meal?\" Avers asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm..... I wanna say love, but since Mistress Lilith is Mistress Morrigan's sister, lust is also a possibility....\" Asphodel muttered, getting depressed at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should the human prove unsatisfying or extremely boring in their eyes, the human's soul may wind up as meal for them and their bodies sent here to be used as meat for the hellhounds,\" Muirgheal stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is the name of the soup are you making?\" Avers asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"k\u00e4mpfen Rindsuppe.\" Muirgheal replied. Avers laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Asphodel uttered, tilting her head cutely as she had a puzzled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means, 'fighting beef soup'. However, the version the Mistress Morrigan likes to eat has a strong tendency to attack anything with a strong human scent.

Was she hunting Jedah Dohma too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHsien-ko stood a scant 5'2\" and weighed only 92 pounds (if he was guessing her weight right, he knew enough NOT to ask a lady about her weight, after all)  with generous proportions that seem doubtful for a Chinese woman born in 1730. Her skin was a pale bluish color, almost a blue-gray. Her eyes were bright yellow, while her shoulder-length hair was an inky blue-black. Her outfit consisted of white socks, black slippers, loose blue trousers, a long-sleeved blue tunic with gold cuffs and a red, high-collared sleeveless overtunic with gold trim. The overtunic had a broad oval-cut out on the upper chest that displays a fair amount of cleavage. A wide gold sash/belt keep the overtunic in place. Hsien-ko also wore a red Mandarin-styled hat topped with a gold ball and trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her odd coloration, she was quite attractive. MegaMan had to admit that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Jiang Shi looked at the Nephilim as he folded his wings, the angelic, white-feathered wing coming from his right shoulder blade nor the black, bat-like one coming from his left shoulder blade. His eyes had a smoky pink sclera, eyelids rimmed with red, while the pupils and iris were both alabaster blue. She felt he was actually a little cute, truth be told. He was pretty short, only an inch or two taller than she was, and he couldn't have been much older---if he was older at all. He had a friendly face, his hair was brown, and hung atop his head in loose-fitting spikes and his lips were pursed in an adorable fashion, and the button nose was a nice touch. The dark purple, nearly black, bodysuit he was wearing did well to outline his slender figure. He had on orange-red tabi shoes made for Parkour and Freerunning, as well as  orange-red gloves that had metal knuckles, both the shoes and gloves were made as part of the suit he was wearing. Furthermore, it was made with a pair of mandala comprised of nine reddish-brown circles of varying sizes atop a larger green-grey circle on each of his shoulder blades, clearly they were a type of seal that allowed his wings to grow or retract without damaging the outfit he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a small, shy, smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi.\" the Purifier unit said, while he was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, he had been in Makai a while now...long enough for his slow transformation into a Nephilim simply by him staying in Makai over time. The energy the Makai world had effecting him after an extended time there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N\u01d0 h\u01ceo!\" Hsien-ko said brightly. \"So YOU'RE the Nephilim that everybody's been talking about recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan shrugged, causing his wings to flare a bit \"...Guess so. Don't ask me how I turned into one though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made her blink a bit in surprise as she tilted her head to the side, so he was like her? A \"Second born\" as the term used here in Makai to describe a person who had been changed from what they originally were into a monster, demon, or spirit.  Even to this day, Hsien-Ko remembered when she used the Igyo Tenshin technique to turn into a Jiang-Shi while Mei-Ling, her older sister, turned into a ward to make sure Hsien-Ko didn't lose control of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled a bit at him at that. He seemed honestly nice. Pretty cute too. Well, if anything, the Aensland succubus had good taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say? No wonder someone like you is so out of place here in the demon world. Makes me want to see if the things I've heard about you are true or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaMan scratched the back of his head, embarrassed.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"...Pity I might have to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...HUH?!\"</span></div></div>",

One naughty enough in nature that she licked her lips.<i> 'I wonder if I should go with black lingerie or red for our wedding night?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megaman?\"Hisen-Ko cooed, making Megaman look up rather quickly.

Normally, the bar's inhabitants could be heard blocks away. It was usually filled with Alcohol-fueled brawls that were broken up by the the bouncers, who then quickly got bored and restarted the brawls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it was quiet. The Bar patrons were quietly drinking and looking down to avoid each other. Why was this happening, you ask?<br>\r\nIt was because the bar had a new patron that night. She was a blonde-haired human girl, dressed like she was Little Red Riding Hood.<br>\r\n\"More Ferasan Blood wine!\" The girl said, as she slammed down her empty glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ms. Bulletta! It's on the house, like the rest!\" A nervous green Oni server quickly cried out as they brought out another bottle and refilled her glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaby Bonnie Hood smirked as the server backed away in fear. She slowly drank the contents of the glass, enjoying the frightened reactions of all those watching her more then the wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'They all fear me crying out that the wine was poor and then me killing them. They're only lucky that none of them have a bounty on their heads. Speaking of that, I need to find another bounty. Starting to get bored and my funds are running a bit lower then I want them to.'</i> B.B. Hood thought to herself. <i>'I wonder why the Ferasan blood wine only makes demons drunk, but not humans? Ah well, Not my place to figure it out.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a pair of newbie bounty hunters wandered into the bar and sat down at near the bartender. One was a blue Oni and the other was a red Oni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you, it's an easy mark! Dimitri is paying large amounts of gold to get rid of Lilith and Morrigan's new boytoy! \" The red oni bounty hunter muttered, as he waved around a paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.B. Hood's sharp eyes identified the paper as a bounty notice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... For that amount, it seems like we'd be setting off a power struggle that will kill us sooner or later,\" The Blue Oni replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sirs. But could I see that paper?\" A cute voice asked from behind the two hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hunters turned around, expecting to see some lowly goblin. When they saw an innocently smiling B.B. Hood with her hands clasped together, standing right behind them, The hunters did all they could to avoid pissing themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-p-p-please ex-ex-ex-excuse my faulty memory, bu-bu-bu-but what did you ask for?\" The Blue Oni asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.B. Hood's smiled turned less innocent, and lowered her hands. A small whine was muttered by a few bar patrons throughout the bar when B.B. Hood started reaching for her basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The paper. Give it to me,\" B.B. Hood replied in a low and dangerous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his friend paralyzed with fear, The Blue oni nabbed the paper from the Red Oni's hands and handed it to B.B. Hood.<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" B.B. Hood cheerfully replied as she then left the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're alive. But I think we should avoid that bounty,\" The Blue Oni said to his friend. The Red Oni nodded before breaking down and crying out of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the Bar,B.B. Hood was looking at the contents on the Bounty notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Goes by the name of MegaMan.... Doesn't seem all that threatening, but same could be said for me....\" B.B. Hood muttered. She then looked at the amount of reward. \"Yowsa! Vamp-boy wants him dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting away the notice in her basket, B.B. Hood smirked as she headed to Aensland Castle.</span></div></div>",
