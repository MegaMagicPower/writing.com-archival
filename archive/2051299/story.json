You're a huge game nerd. Your family also happens to be filthy stinking rich and, everyone knows it. You take the limo to school everyday. However, you're about as far from the 'rich bitch' stereotype as you can get, and have been best friends with the biggest girl in school, the 6'5\" DD-cup walking wet dream Sara, since childhood. Shortly after turning 18, however, things start to turn... odd. Your dreams take you to exceedingly realistic worlds that you can touch, taste, and smell... like you've been there before. One of the most recent had you... observing what must have been some of the first humans, and they seemed positively minuscule to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long after that you start to experience growth spurts, gradually growing taller, curvier, and toned. And as you grow, the dreams begin to seem like they may not be dreams after all - but fragments of past lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie - 4'11\", no curves to speak of, but a somewhat toned body. Being 19 and utterly ignored by puberty sucks. You hate looking like a little kid, and you REALLY hate people mistaking you for one. You blew up on a guy who bumped into you in a grocery store once because of that, though you did make amends shortly after. You're known for being kind of scrappy, but only really to defend yourself. While not a tomboy, you do enjoy basketball and some other not really girly things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll soon find to your delight that puberty has finally come to make up for lost time, giving you a great body that boys (or girls. You might be lesbian) will want to ogle. But when it becomes clear that said puberty is unrelenting... well, no one's going to try any short jokes on you, at least...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before time began, there was... the Cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Seriously? Why the <i>fuck</i> do I have that little narration from Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) in my head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's back up here. My name is Megan. I have brown hair and green eyes, and I turned 18 about a week ago. I love, love, LOVE games! My human Death Knight character, Meganite (the Relentless) is currently sitting in the 90's, and I plan to grind her up to level 100 over the coming weeks now that I have the Warlords of Draenor expansion for World of Warcraft. My friend, (who I... admit I have a crush on) Davis, has said he can't get the expansion right away, but that suits me just fine - I've already bought a copy for him that I plan to give him on his birthday coming up in a few weeks' time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave I mentioned yet that my family is wealthy? Like, really wealthy? Like, we're as wealthy as the Barnes' wealthy? (probably mostly because the elder sister in the family, Vanessa, squanders a good chunk of it on frivolous crap to flaunt her family's wealth. She gives the rest of us rich girls a bad name...) Well now I have. Sadly, my parents are often away on business, so my staff are like my extended family. My maid, Beverly, has probably taken care of me more than my actual mother. That's kind of sad, and even my mother says so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they say that rich people don't have problems...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I'd be more looking forward to Davis' birthday, but ever since I turned 16, my dreams have been getting pretty weird. Like that night, I dreamed I was in some place I've never been to in my life. And unlike the typical dream, like somehow coming to school naked or my teeth falling out of my head, I still vividly remember every detail of my dream. I can feel the corset that was squeezing my ribcage like a boa constrictor, (as though I'd ever have reason to wear such an abomination with my excuse of a figure) smell the slight dust in the air, and god I wish I could forget that taste...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery night since has been like that. Different place I've never been, yet so vivid the history teacher loves me. It could be Azaroth or somewhere in the Koprulu Sector (just... not Char... or Redstone... or New Folsom... I've a thing against hellishly inhospitable planets) or hell even Hyrule, but no. I've got to dream about being seemingly random women in seemingly random time periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, if you're done daydreaming over there, why don't you tell the class what a simile is?\" Whoops. That would be my English teacher... and he's less than pleased I'm off in my own little world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Similes are words that sound the same as one another, but mean different things.\" I answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct... if we were talking about homophones. A simile is a figure of speech that directly compares two things. An example would be 'dead as a doornail'. Please pay attention in my class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as he's about to go back to his work, the bell rings. My hero. The class and I get up out of our seats and leave for our lockers. It's the end of the school day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I gather my things, a large, buxom shadow falls over me. \"Mind if I join you on the trip home? My folks are out on their anniversary and the bus seats suck in the worst way.\" its owner asks in a mildly sultry voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around and look up. A fair bit up. Before me stands easily the hottest and most popular girl in school. This walking wet dream of a girl stands an imposing 6'5\" - barefoot. Right now she's got her heels on so she's closing in on 7 feet. Her glorious DD-cup breasts rest tantalizingly behind the fabric of her tank top, begging to be let out. And her face, featuring blue eyes, is framed with long blonde hair. But wait, there's more! For as hot as she looks, she's also got a brain. \"If you want, but it'll cost you... That'll be one sleepover, please, Sara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara (pronounced Sa-ra, not Sar-ah) smiles widely and replies, \"Deal. We haven't done a sleepover in ages...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe've been best friends since we were kids. We tell each other practically everything! Which is why while waiting for Alfred to arrive with the limo, I say, \"I had a weird dream last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one? Where were you this time, ancient Egypt?\" Sara asks inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same continent, but not in Egypt. In fact... I-I don't think any countries had been established yet. I think if it were, say, Zerus, I'd be around the first Spawning Pool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the birthplace of humanity? Did you personally know the Flintstones? If your next dream has you in the future, I'm going to suggest staying away from those old cartoons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, but now I reveal my trap card. Because this part may just blow your mind. You see, this time I'm pretty sure I wasn't one of the early humans. I believe this because I must have been a hell of a lot bigger than any of them. They were small enough to me that I could easily pick them up in my hand like those Warhammer 40K figurines for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara immediately stops giggling as I told her this. \"L-let me guess, this dream was just as vivid as the last ones, right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm interrupted by the limo's arrival. The black vehicle pulls up by sidewalk we're standing on before Alfred comes out to open the door. \"Good day to you, Miss Sara.\" he says politely, \"Am I correct in the belief that Miss Megan wishes for you to be given a ride home with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara nods as I confirm, \"That's correct, Alfred. We're rectifying the grave matter that it's been ages since we last had a sleepover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods in understanding and allows us to enter the passenger compartment before closing the door. As he gets the limo on its way back home, I return to my conversation with Sara. \"The dream was very vivid, Sara. I don't know if they were the entirety of the early humans or just one tribe or so, but I remember the smell of the fire they had going to cook their kill and the feel of lifting an individual closer to my face so I could see and hear him better. They didn't seem afraid of me, which was a relief...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and then what happened?\" Sara asks nervously, yet almost on the edge of her proverbial seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I woke up in my room with my mother telling me it was time to get ready for school.\" With the current subject exhausted, I changed it to something less weird. \"So, what are you getting Davis for his birthday? I've bought him-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Warlords of Draenor Expansion pack and the next three months' fees on you. You've only told me a million times, girl. Any more and he's bound to overhear. But I'm getting him a couple of those Splatoon Amiibo things he's been wanting. If he's already bought 'em by the time his birthday comes around, I'll bury his sorry ass in the ground. It's kind of ridiculous that they're so hard to find...\" she answers with a touch of humor. The three of us know she'd never seriously hurt the guy, but every man knows instinctively that it's in their best interest to not anger the hot girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Speaking of hot... I feel flushed all of the sudden. It quickly passes, but I swear I just grew like an inch. My nipples also feel pushed just a touch further into my brassiere, and I feel a little less pudgy around the middle. I remain silent about this as frankly I'm not sure what to make of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About half an hour later, Alfred pulls the limo up to the family mansion so Sara and I can exit. The absolute gentleman then goes to park the limo in the garage before joining us inside. He's both the chauffeur and the butler here, as it keeps the required number of staff down to a minimum. It's my parents' will, but I wouldn't mind more staff around to fill out the mansion. As it is we've got Beverly and Alfred, and while I love them like family... they're both getting up there in age. They've served us for years, well before I came around, but they'll surely want to retire in a few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mansion isn't particularly big as far as mansions go, but it's been in our family for a few generations. Now if I were to dream being here in the early days, when it was new, THAT would be cool. I'm aware that much of it has been refinished or changed to comply with new building codes, such as the plumbing and electrical, but it'd be interesting to see what it was originally like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the exterior looks like it could belong on a postcard, with vines encroaching up the brickwork and even some of the pillars near the front entrance. It's quite characterful. The interior is pretty typical wealthy family fare: fancy furniture, huge TV, rare and expensive vases, a few trinkets from my parents' trips, that sort of 'wealthier than thou' stuff. It's... okay. Most of the really 'rich people' items in our home are family heirlooms - which generally means crap no one's had the guts to toss or sell. But my favorite thing in the house, aside from the TV for my consoles and my computer for the internet and PC games, is the big picture greeting you when you come in. It's a picture of me and my family, including Beverly and Alfred, and while it's a few years old now, this would be the thing I'd rescue if this place caught fire. Everything else is either unnecessary or can be replaced. This picture represents an irreplaceable memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Miss Megan! And hello to you, Miss Sara!\" My maid, Beverly, greets as Sara and I come in, \"Alfred, Master Jake has asked for you to meet him in the study when you have a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear. I will be with him in a moment.\" Alfred acknowledges and takes his leave for the study where my father awaits. I should go see him shortly, though I'm sure Alfred will inform him that I've invited Sara over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Megan, shall I show Miss Sara to the guest rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you, I'll do it.\" I say and guide my friend out of the entrance lobby and upstairs. \"The guest rooms haven't changed places since your last stay far too long ago. They have been soundproofed though so guests don't hear me cursing and screaming about some boss and its cheap trick to wipe my party, and I don't hear stuff they'd rather keep private.\" I say to her with a smile, \"Gonna have to ask you to take off the heels though. Mother's gotten the new floors down and will ground me into Tuesday of next year if I let them get scratched up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as I wouldn't want my best friend to get in trouble with her mom...\" Sara replies, and pops her high heels off, wiggling her toes within her socks afterward, \"Besides, it's good to get out of them after...\" she stops as she notices I'm not quite as short to her as I usually am. \"Um, are you standing on your feet weird? I swear you were shorter just a little while ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my feet are flat on the floor. But now that you mention it, I do seem like maybe an inch taller than before... maybe puberty is finally taking notice of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shrugs and takes her bag and shoes to the guest room closest to my room. I of course went into my room to better check what was going on with myself. ...It was a good thing I did go in there, because no sooner did I close the door I get overwhelmed by that flushed feeling from earlier. This time, it's a fair bit stronger! I feel myself slowly stretch taller and taller. The bit of fat around my stomach melting away as it heads north to grant me some actual breasts. It's barely A-cup, but it's a start. My ass feels a tad firmer as well. And my clothes... they feel slightly restrictive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, I've heard of late bloomers having a fast growth before, but this?\" I mumble, measuring myself against the door. I'm stunned when I turn around: 5'10\". Holy crap. That's four inches in less than an hour! I-I've got to let Sara know about this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bolt out of my room and straight into the one Sara's using. \"Sara! You... you've got to see this!\" I implore urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? A band of gnolls and murlocs that kind of look like Davis' face? Girl, you've seriously got to-\" Sara starts, only to stop as soon as she notices I'm taller than a few moments ago. She glances down at my feet, then back to my face and stammers, \"W-what's going on here, Megan? No one grows four inches within a single day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew. But on the bright side, I might just make good on that claim that I'd put your body to shame one day...\" I answer, laughing nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did, didn't you? The day you admitted you've always been jealous of my physical blessings even as a kid, if I remember right...\" she recalls, and then smiles as she adds, \"So glad you admitted it to me rather than let it eat you up inside, Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo me, that was about the scariest moment in my life, having to confess I secretly felt that way about her figure for so long. I mean, my family has more money than we know what to do with for crying out loud! (which does beg the question why my parents still work if we're practically set for life... The truth is they enjoy their jobs, but not being out of my life so often) But it felt good to get it off my chest and not let it build into resentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasp in shock as I feel my friend grope my chest from behind, snapping me out of my thoughts as she remarks, \"Hm... Feels like you might have to get some real bras soon. My best friend's growing up... I'm so proud!\" she lets go to allow me to turn around to face her and adds with revived concern, \"Still, how do we explain this to your parents? To Beverly and Alfred? You can't avoid them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving it some thought, I sigh and reply, \"I can't explain this to them when I don't even know what the hell is happening other than I'm growing in odd spurts, but I can't avoid anyone seeing me, least of all my family.\" I gulp and add, \"I've no choice. I'll have to show myself and hope they don't act like the sky is falling. And hope this growth doesn't get ridiculous too fast.\" I change the subject. \"Let's get our homework done for now, and we may as well do it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but let's do it in the study so you don't get distracted by your games, and so this growth doesn't shock everyone at dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, I nod and return to my room to retrieve all the homework I have to complete for tomorrow. Sara had a point on both fronts, as I could at least lessen the ambient shock by dinner in letting my father and Alfred see I've grown now, and I remember only too well the last time I got chewed out for not completing my assignments because I let myself get distracted by my games. Really don't want to repeat that mistake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The study is an interesting room. There's an electric fireplace in the corner that's always on whenever someone's in here, especially my father, and a few desks as he wanted to make this room inviting to use for more than one person at a time. The desk my father uses is really old, one of the few original pieces of furniture in the mansion, yet very well loved. As Sara and I enter the room, we find my father and Alfred in the middle of a discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But sir, surely you can't be serious!\" Alfred exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jillian and I've discussed it between ourselves, and our decision is final. You and Beverly may retire or resign any time you wish, provided we can arrange suitable replacements for you, but you may not leave our family.\" my father replies in his usual tone that meant the topic isn't up for discussion, \"We're ashamed to have to say you've been better parents to our daughter than we have, yet it pleases us that she's been in excellent hands under your care. She sees you like family, and we want you to remain as part of our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we... suddenly step on the set of The Young and the Restless or something?\" Sara asks with confusion, bringing the men's attention to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha... no, not quite, Sara. It's a pleasure to have you over in our home again.\" my father says, greeting my friend with a smile, \"Can Alfred get you anything before he takes his leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no thanks. Megan and I need to tackle this homework. Also... something odd is happening to her.\" Sara replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What is it, Megan?\" father asks before starting to notice the reduced height difference, \"M-my goodness! Perhaps we should get you examined... this can't be natural...\" Alfred nods in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to agree as well, but something... something deep inside told me this was nothing to worry about. I couldn't find the will to disagree with it, so I answer, \"No, I'll be fine... Besides, the doctors would probably just say I'm growing without informing us why that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will you be all right for your friend Davis' birthday, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'd have to be on Death's doorstep to miss his birthday. I'll be fine.\" I reassure, and everyone soon drops it for now. In the meantime, I work on today's homework with Sara. We're able to help each other out with it as while we sadly don't have the classes at the same time, we do have most of the same ones this semester. I get stuck with P.E. while she gets Music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we finish our homework, and get summoned for dinner. I receive stares from mother and Beverly, but they don't really press the issue. Maybe Alfred informed them ahead of time? Whatever. The food smells too good to care about much else at the moment! I help myself to a good plateful of it once Sara has taken what she wants, then dive right in shortly after sitting down at my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I've cleaned my plate, I consider going back for seconds. Normally I don't because... well, I'm pudgy as it is without adding to it, but with my recent growth I figure I ought to be starved. However, after a moment's hesitation, I... decide against it. I <i>could</i> eat more, but something within whispers to me that it isn't necessary. Oddly, it seems to me as though it's the same something that assured my sudden growth spurt was nothing to be concerned about, and I hadn't the will to object this time either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara and I play some games after dinner like Sorry! and Backgammon. I win some, and she wins some. It doesn't really matter since we're both having fun and chatting about stuff. \"One of these days, girl, you are going to have to confess to Davis how you feel about him. I mean it!\" my friends says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I'm not ready yet.\" I reply back reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better <i>start</i> getting ready, Megan, as he's not going to wait for you forever. Jump on that train before it leaves the station!\" Sara counters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, I feel a little something reacting to her words, knowing she has a point, but I'm not sure what that something was. However, eventually I start feeling tired and we decide it's time to call it a night. So we pack up the games and return them to my room, go through our nightly routines for bed, and then tuck in the beds in our rooms and go to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself out in the open, nude, but unconcerned. Of all the creatures to have roamed the Earth, none are mightier than I. None are larger than I. This small group of humans, really just a few tribes, are aware of me. Their communications are... limited, but they've already mastered tool and weapon making, and harnessed the power of fire. (as well as learned the valuable lesson that fire is indiscriminate, and must be respected) However, they're aware that nothing they could ever invent can harm me, and that I could snuff out their meager lives in an instant should I so choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they don't fear me, which I find heartwarming. As much as I could destroy them, I do not wish to and I believe they pick up on this. I allow them to worship me... mostly because they stubbornly refuse not to. It's cute, in a way. As I roam, my footsteps shake the ground, yet not a trace of a titanic human footprint left behind. The humans sometimes ask for my aid, and while I will not give it in war, I help a little to improve their lives in other ways. The idea is not to make them dependent on me, as they have great potential but must reach it on their own, merely assist them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I come upon the settlement I've helped the humans establish. It's... crude, but it fulfills its needed task. I bend down and gently pick up a male among the group, my head priest I believe. I am careful not to allow my considerable breasts crush the crude homes these people have worked so hard to create as I bring the man to my face in order to hear him better. \"You honor us with presence, great one.\" is a rough translation of what he's saying. It's not in English, but I understand his grunts and sounds as this is what he's trying to tell me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It pleases me to hear it, little one. Your people will soon no longer need my guidance, and while I am aware you are unhappy with this news, your people must learn to stand on their own two feet. I will always be with your kind in spirit to smile upon you.\" I reply to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he's about to protest... I wake up with a start. I glance over at my alarm clock, which reads 2:00 AM. \"What the hell was <i>that</i> dream about?! It was like the one from the night before... only extended. Hell, I can still remember what I was thinking in it...\" I say to myself quietly. Soon, I begin to suspect... \"...<i>Are</i> these even dreams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice in my head whispers, <i>All will be made clear in time. Rest now, child...</i> It sounds so familiar, yet I find myself too tired to dwell upon it. As sleep overtakes me again, the voice adds, <i>Our changes are just beginning...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's this annoying beeping coming from beside my bed. \"...five more minutes... No, better make it ten...\" I grumble in protest at my alarm clock, not-so-gently slamming the poor thing's snooze button. It's not that I hate mornings, I just hate getting up from a nice cozy bed. And right now my bed is indeed nice and cozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You must awaken, child. A new day awaits.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great. Now the voice in my head wants me up. Once again, I've no will to resist, so I get up and get ready for another day of school. Curious, I measure myself against the door: 5'11\". Another inch overnight. I'm pretty sure this means a trip to the mall later is in order... and not to look in Gamestop like I usually would while there. Still, I haven't bought anything fancy to wear for Davis' birthday yet, so maybe this afternoon would be a great opportunity for that? It's one of those occasions where I really do care about what the hell I'm wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pick out the largest, baggiest clothes I've got that fit the school dress code and proceed to march on into the bathroom. With some struggling, I take off my clothes before I step into the shower. What I find underneath it all impresses me, and I'm... admittedly surprised I never noticed until now. My belly is now almost completely flat without me trying to suck it in. That alone would be nice, but my breasts seem to have grown a bit bigger as well! Turning around, I can see my ass is a bit larger than yesterday. \"Well. I actually look my age to some degree! Still have a ways to go before I'm beating Sara, but it's definitely a start.\" I say as I admire myself, then get on with the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I bathe, my thoughts wander to the matter of how the fuck I'm going to explain this to everyone at school. Explaining it to Davis is going to be hard enough! Not to mention having to squeeze into gym clothes that are going to be a bit too small... My worries persist even after I finish up and get dressed, following me right down to breakfast. I kind of wish I didn't have to worry about that, especially if supposedly this is just the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seems to pause. It's creepy, seeing a bird outside frozen in the air in mid-flight among other things. <i>You needn't worry what others will think of these changes.</i> that voice in my head says, stronger than I've ever heard it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who the hell are you and what do you want? Are you going to tell me to kill someone?\" I ask aloud, confused and a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We are one, yet divided. I wish to aid you while the division fades, child.</i> the voice answers. <i>We will speak again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after it says that, time resumes as if nothing ever happened. I don't completely get what it meant, but who am I to question? Besides, I need to eat something before I have to get going, not dwell upon my looming insanity. Cereal seems like a good choice, so I pour myself a bowl. I might consider having something fancier on the weekend when I have time to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before Sara joins me, wearing one of the spare outfits we keep around for her in case she comes over. \"Hmm, seems someone's grown a little during the night.\" she comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and going to need to do some shopping after school, presuming I don't outright outgrow it. At this point, I don't know.\" I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finish our breakfast, and finish getting ready for school. Outside, Alfred is already waiting for us with the limo, talking with my mother. I hope I'm as pretty as her when all is said and done, at the very least. She wishes us both a good day at school as we get in and Alfred drives us on our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we arrive at school, Sara and I soon run into Davis. It's kind of strange to be able to look him in the eye without having to look up. \"Er, who are you and what have you done with Megan?\" the black-haired boy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Just because I've hit a... bit of a growth spurt doesn't mean I'm not me!\" I reply, a tad miffed though my heart currently refuses to stay all that mad at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well if that's true, then prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the time my Death Knight beat the ever-living snot out of your dwarf? And that they're both at that inn currently? If you've moved him within the past day, you're cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Sorry for doubting you, Megan...\" Davis apologizes, blushing heavily. Probably embarrassed about being reminded of that humiliating defeat... unless... Nah, probably not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, as I proceed to my locker and ready for my first class... no one else seems to notice anything off with me. In fact, they all treat me as though I've <i>always</i> looked like this. But surely they'd notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I said you needn't worry about what others thought of you...</i> the voice in my head reminds. It - she, I guess, as it does sound feminine - must have done... something to ensure I wouldn't be looked at strangely. As it is I've got my classes to worry about, so I don't give it much more thought. And my first class is History, which is my best subject. I guess that makes me a bit of a nerd in more than just games, but lately I've been feeling as though I've personally <i>been</i> through some of these events and periods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter History comes... ugh... P.E. class. I probably should get in better shape so I don't suck at it. I get out my gym clothes, and find to my surprise as I go put them on that they're sized to fit me okay. Still just standard issue, but at least I won't look like I'm trying to shove myself into too small clothes. Even my Converse shoes I wear for the class fit nicely, not even the slightest sensation of them pinching my feet! \"Well let's get this over with.\" I say to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late, Megan.\" the teacher tells me as I come in, \"Give me three laps around the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an asshole. I know I'm a minute or two late, but does he have to make me run three laps around the gym? Everyone else gets like one lap if they're late! I go to take the laps he wants me to do. Half a lap in I'm starting to feel tired... then that familiar warmth. I watch as my limbs get just slightly longer, and feel all fat on my abdomen vanish. My clothes feel a tad tighter, but when the warmth fades, I feel... energetic. Not tired in the slightest. So I just keep going around and around the gym...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon I hear the teacher's Fox 40 blow in my general direction. \"All right, Megan, that's enough! I asked for three laps not seven!\" he yells. Wait - <i>seven</i> laps? I honestly wasn't really counting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class continues to a similar effect since that spurt. Whereas before I would have performed abysmally in the activities the class and I are being asked to do, now I perform them with no problem. Hell, I'm the only one to climb the rope all the way to the top, a feat I've never achieved before! Davis comes close, and actually manages to get almost to the top with my cheering him on before his muscles give out and he slips off the rope to the mat below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the lunch bell rings and we're allowed to go change and head for lunch. \"Hey Megan? How tall are you now? Like 6 feet or something?\" Davis asks as I come back out of the change room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess? I think my body's changing in ways I don't understand, here. I <i>never</i> do like seven laps around the gym. I normally can barely even manage <i>one</i>! And I still feel like I could keep going!\" I answer, even if it may not necessarily be what he's looking for.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I head for the cafeteria, I notice I'm receiving a few stares from people. If they didn't notice I had grown to 5'11\" since yesterday, I very much doubt they notice the extra inch I've grown just today that puts me at 6 feet tall, so they must be looking at me for some other reason. It's a lot more attention than I'm used to, as being easily the richest girl in school only carries one so far when they're physically unimpressive in any regard. Yesterday, I fit that description easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, while I'm not yet on my BFF Sara's level, there's probably not a fat cell to be found in my body where I don't want it. I look like I've been working out for the beach this summer, and I look like I don't avoid the sun as much as possible! I feel... good about my body for the first time in ages. I kind of hope I don't have to work too hard to maintain it, as it's difficult enough as it is to tear myself away from my beloved games...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then I remember I was going to get something from the Subway a little ways across from the school. \"Crap. Hey, Davis? Would you like something over at Subway? I'm about to go grab something there.\" I ask, almost hoping he'd opt to come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any money for a sub, Megan...\" Davis answers with a bit of embarrassment, \"So I can't really get anything there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's sweet of him to try and decline like that. \"What if I told you it's my treat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We shall be making good use of the family fortune later, correct?</i> the voice in my head suggests. She's definitely gotten stronger since the last time I heard her, though even when I first started knowingly hearing her speak her voice was positively <i>dripping</i> with untold power. I kind of wonder if she could hold her own against the Primal Queen of Blades, or even Amon, the fallen xel'naga? Could she go toe-to-toe with Sargeras?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, I take her suggestion as I say, \"I'm <i>going</i> to spend a lot of money today getting a new wardrobe, dude. What's a bit more getting my friend lunch?\" I see he's still hesitant, so ultimately I take his hand in mine and pull him along with me. I'm amazed at how easy it is for me. \"Okay, now I'm just going to have to insist before lunch is over. Come on, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Davis and I return to the cafeteria with our subs. Sara giggles with amusement as we sit down at her table. \"Davis, you've got to learn to accept an offer when it's given. It's not going to just stand there with a big exclamation point over its head.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny. Though I swear I didn't slow Megan down at all - and this after she did seven laps in P.E. just before that!\" Davis replies, noting my earlier feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's pretty incredible for her, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'isn't it'? This is coming from a girl who's worst subject is this very class!\" I ask, perhaps a little indignant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no one seems at all alarmed about your new height except Davis and I, almost like this is expected. Maybe this feat is kind of expected of you now, too?\" Sara answers thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to admit she's got a point. Something this voice in my head is going to have to explain tonight. I deserve an explanation, but more importantly, my friends deserve an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, the bell rings to signify the end of lunch. Sara, Davis, and I depart from the cafeteria, parting ways to head to our own classes. In both of them, I hand in my homework assignments before taking my seat. This time I make sure to pay attention to the teachers' lessons so as to not get called upon and made to look like a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot soon enough, the bell rings to signify the end of the school day. Thank god it's Friday! I head for my locker to gather what I need, then go outside to wait for Alfred to arrive to pick me up. A few minutes in, I feel myself stretch another inch taller, my clothes just a bit more snug than before. Surprisingly, I gain another inch before the feeling subsides, making me 6'2\" tall. I think my breasts now just fall into the C range, yet they feel as though I don't really need a bra to support them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Alfred arrives. I get into the limo and direct him to the mall. I should probably tell my parents where I'm headed first, but I'm sure they understand I kind of need to do some clothes shopping. Of course the question remains just how big I should go in preparation for my future sizes. Just how big am I going to grow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd... will it even matter by Davis' birthday, given how no one's really noticed anything different about me except my family and friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, Alfred brings the limo to the mall, and we get out to go inside. (like I'm going to make the gentleman wait for me. <i>I</i> don't even know how long I'll be) I force myself past the GameStop and onward to the clothing stores. I notice a very nice cyan bikini along the way, but I leave it be. Important stuff first. Like hitting the lingerie store so I can have some that aren't digging into me, because what I've got on now is certainly doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come out of the lingerie store no less than 10 minutes later with a few sets of bras and panties that both should fit me now and should hopefully fit later. Only time will tell. From there, I head into several other stores, dropping money down for current and possible future outfits to wear. I end up splurging just a bit and purchase a pair of Master Sword earrings, complete with the Triforce emblem on the sides of the guard. I don't know what I'll do once I likely outgrow them, but for now I'll happily wear them damn near everywhere I can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is some shoes. I hit the same store Sara always drags me to when we shop together. There are a lot of high heels, but they're not to my taste. A nice set of Nike shoes does appeal to me, though, so I buy them. I could've gone for Converse, but I've already got a set of those for my gym shoes. I'd like to be able to keep which pair is which straight in my head. I depart from the store after giving a glance at a set of golden colored sandals. Maybe next time for the summer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I pick up a wonderful looking dress for Davis' birthday party. I just hope I can wear it by then. So with all of that shopping out of the way, it's time to head home. I meet up with Alfred and we leave the mall when he's ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been out shopping, I see.\" mother comments shortly after I come through the door upon arriving home. Thankfully, she's not upset with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Not much choice if I want to have any chance of being decent by Monday, let alone by Davis' birthday. Some surprising deals today, too.\" I say in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, sweetheart. Although... what do you have to say about those little swords hanging off your ears, young lady?\" my mother asks in a falsely accusing tone as she pointed at my new earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, how on Earth could I resist picking up earring versions of the sword of evil's bane? You know this sort of thing is one of my greatest weaknesses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently marvel at how I'm now a few inches taller than my mother, and not that far off in terms of curves. Yet I almost feel like I'm stronger than I look, definitely physically stronger than her. Not that I'd ever raise my hand against my own family. \"All right, dear. You'll be notified when dinner's ready. But before you go immersing yourself in your games... can I at least get a hug from my little girl?\" she says finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, I set my bags down and hug my mother, then take my things upstairs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once inside my room, I begin swapping my old clothes on my hangers for the new ones I just bought, aside from one set which I change into. The larger clothes are a welcome relief on my currently 6'2\" body, especially as I almost have to tear the old ones off. (I so don't get the style of almost constricting clothes... I apparently didn't even like it when corsets were a thing in that one dream) I decide after getting changed and finishing putting my new clothes away to bundle up the old ones to donate. Hey, I'm not about to be using them any more, so they may as well go to someplace where they may be appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a good number of it is all ready to go... I leave it by the door for tomorrow. There's no rush to donate the stuff right this minute. So in the meantime, I turn on my 3DS and play some Pokemon. Okay, mostly soaring around on Mega Latias in my Alpha Sapphire game. I kind of wish I could just soar on normal Latias, though. It's so much cuter than its Mega evolved form, but alas. I connect to the internet for StreetPass updates, and as I check the BuzzNav... I get a notice that I've received an Eon Ticket! What luck! Immediately, I soar back to the nearest town and enter the Pokemon Center, speaking with the delivery girl to get the Eon Ticket and then saving the game... like, more than twice. A chance to return to Southern Island and catch Latios... I should prepare to soft-reset it and try to get some good stats on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I switch to playing some Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm campaign. Well, replaying it, rather. I tend to favor terran and protoss over the zerg, but I like that the campaign lets me switch between three different mutations between missions for the zergling, baneling, roach, hydralisk, mutalisk, swarm host, and the aptly named ultralisk. So like the zergling's mutations let it either move much faster, attack much faster, or have an extra 10 HP. It's so awesome...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, dinner's ready!\" I hear mother call from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's kind of early... isn't it? I glance at the time. 7 o'clock already?! Oh <i>man</i> does time fly... I pause my game and head downstairs for dinner. It already smells delicious, and I - \"A-another spurt?\" I say to myself as I feel my body grow. My muscles tingle as they become slightly more defined, though I can sense far more strength in them than they let on. My breasts swell a little bit more, now unquestionably in the C-cup range. I feel my clothes already getting tighter, but thankfully the spurt ends before they get into 'about to tear off' territory. I go measure myself, faster than I've ever known myself to run before, and find I'm now 6'4\", just slightly shorter than Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, After double-checking my new height, I rush downstairs for dinner. Interestingly, no one seems to bat an eye that I've grown another couple of inches since they last saw me. I'm beginning to want to know why. Nevertheless, I don't hesitate to enjoy the delicious meal before me. Topics around the dinner table include, but aren't limited to: if I've any homework this weekend, what that homework is, my parents' day, Beverly and Alfred's day, my day, and me assuring everyone once again that I still don't intend to miss Davis' birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, I resume my game and finish the current mission before moving on to an evolution mission. It doesn't take long to complete, and once done, I exit the game for the night. I go through my nightly routine for bed, then boot up my Alpha Sapphire game once more. Going into the Safari Zone, I catch myself a Xatu, then check its ability and nature. It has Synchronize, and a Timid nature. Nice! I'll be able to eventually breed an ideal Natu for catching Latios with it, but I'll get on that later. I save the game and turn off my 3DS before I go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself in a very odd landscape. It's like someone took all of the various time periods in history and shoved them in a blender. I can see bits of the present day and various eras I've dreamed myself in everywhere I turn. \"Okay... Calm down, Megan. Th-this is just a dream... A weird, freaky dream.\" I mutter to myself. Although... If I'm aware that this is a dream, shouldn't I wake up from it right away? Granted, the music of inside the caves that the Sinnoh lake trio (Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf) reside in is nice and soothing as always...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear god... And I thought Megan had weird dreams lately! Where the hell <i>am</i> I?!\" a familiar voice asks. I turn around and see Sara wandering this place too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that, Sara.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan! Oh am I ever glad to see you!\" she exclaims as we hug. \"Hey! You've grown again! And your boobs -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's interrupted by... Davis?! \"Right. Either you two start stripping and fulfilling every straight man's fantasy of his two best female friends making out, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pig!\" Sara yells, delivering a slap across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or we're all actually here. And given my cheek hurts like hell, I'm voting the latter.\" Davis continues, rubbing his cheek. All of us pause when we hear a loud, amused giggle. \"I-I didn't just hear that in my head, did I? You girls heard it too, r-right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we can answer, the ground trembles as something approaches... something that could look Godzilla in the eye. Soon, a vast shadow looms over us all. We turn and look up to see a gigantic woman smiling down at us! The giantess looks gorgeous... and surprisingly a lot like <i>me</i>. Same bronze colored hair, same green eyes like Luigi's hat... Wait a minute! \"Hey, that's my dress I bought this afternoon!\" I yell at her, even if it may not have been the wisest idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, and these earrings are designed after the Master Sword, 'the sword of evil's bane' as you put it.\" the giantess speaks, and instantly I recognize her voice: <i>she</i> is the voice I've been hearing in my head! Her voice exudes far more power than she surely wields even at this tremendous scale. Fuck Kerrigan - this giant lady could step on her like the Odin war machine could step on a zergling! \"They're quite lovely, I assure you. As are our friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, M-Megan? How does this huge lady know you? And how does she know we're friends?\" Sara asks, obviously nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's kind of been inside my head for over a day now.\" I answer, \"I don't know where she came from though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers, Sara, Davis, and I are in the giantess' outstretched hand, and somehow... I feel perfectly safe here. She laughs and says, \"Oh, I've been within you a lot longer than just a day... more like since you were born, shortly after my previous body died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to <i>kill</i> our friend, are you?! I-I'll stop you!\" Davis says. Ever the sweetheart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and I are one, Davis. I am the light in her heart. Needless to say, I'd never allow any harm to come to her. To <i>us</i>.\" the giantess replies, the smile never leaving her face so hauntingly similar to mine, \"I apologize for pulling you and Sara from your dreams, but this is the only time in which I can fulfill Megan's request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... request?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wished for me to give you an explanation earlier, correct? And I agree, our friends deserve an explanation.\" she answers, before addressing all of us, \"I feel it best to not disclose everything at this time, but I will acknowledge that I have altered reality according to Megan's deepest wishes. You're the only ones able to notice her changes, while everyone else believes her current self to have always been this way. Take heart, for the largest and mightiest being the world has ever known... shall soon live again.\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually, Sara and Davis faded away from this freaky landscape. \"Where did my friends go?\" I ask, worried that they may have been erased from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have returned them to their dreams. I can't guarantee how much they'll remember of this, if anything at all, but I assure you our friends are safe.\" the giantess replies, having since moved me to her shoulder, \"This landscape represents our mind, Megan. Your friends' are far more simplistic and easily understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying my friends are stupid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far from it! You recognize those visions which you can recall with clarity, yes? Like the one where you spoke to an early human from a great height?\" the giantess answers, \"They are not dreams: they're memories, fragments of our past lives. Unfortunately, our past names are of little importance, forgotten to the winds of history. Even our first, my own.\" she turns her head slightly towards mine and remarks, \"You'd think I would be able to remember my own name, but forgive me. It's been a few millennia since I was awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd been starting to suspect that those weren't dreams, but I would have never guessed those were fragments of past lives... \"I guess me seeing them in my sleep has been you going over what we've done in all this time then, huh? But why possess me from birth? I'm not anything special aside for this silver spoon the doctors found in my mouth when they pulled me out of my mother's womb...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never chose you, I just happened to be reincarnated as you. Perhaps fate has decided it's time for me to awaken from my dormancy to roam the Earth again. I admit that Sara is the one to inspire the hastening of the division's fading, and I hope for the division to fade completely soon. I'll be able to aid you until then.\" she answers, \"But then, I'm sure you won't need my aid after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'd rather not have to do more shopping for a while, if that's possible. Especially not the earrings and this dress. I-is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do. Not all of our clothes will survive the ordeal, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thank the giantess, and wake up a few moments later. Normally I'd rather stay in my nice and cozy bed, but I know my other self would likely encourage me to get up if I don't. As I stare at the bundled up clothes waiting to be donated, I get an idea and move them to a corner. I pick out from my new clothes what I want to wear today, and then go march into the bathroom to have a shower... and once again admire how I look without anything on just before I get cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I dress after drying myself off, I start to mentally calculate how big of a spurt I'd need to have for my already snugly fitting attire to be ruined. If I gain like close to a foot in height, that might do it. I suspect I'll be doing that a lot if the other me is anything to go by. At any rate, I exit the bathroom and head for breakfast. Some pancakes would fit the bill quite nicely today, given it's Saturday. I wonder if I can speak with the other me without saying it aloud and making myself look like a weirdo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Testing... uno, dos, tres... Can you hear me, o 'great one'?</i> I try thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can hear you, Megan. What would you like to know?</i> the giant within replies, and I can imagine she's smiling while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Would you happen to know if any of our recent past lives were good at making pancakes?</i> I think as though asking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unfortunately no. Beverly may already be preparing some for us, though.</i> is the reply I get from her. Well it was worth a shot. I walk into the kitchen, where Beverly is indeed preparing pancakes. With blueberries inside the batter! She really does know how I like them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, my parents and Alfred enter for breakfast as well. It's certainly a welcoming sight for the start of the day, as all too often my parents have left for work and such, so having them here is a treat! I watch as they each in turn pour themselves a cup of coffee before taking a seat at the already set table. Not one to leave everything to others, I retrieve the butter dish and the syrup. Eventually, the pancakes are done and ready to be enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last pancake has been eaten, I put away my plate and then get ready to head out. I haven't been to Davis' place in some time, so I figure it best to visit him and not find myself surprised by any changes at his birthday party. It also allows me to see if he remembers last night. Once Alfred is finished, I ask him to drive me to Davis' place, to which he agrees, and we set off a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis lives further into the city, close enough that he can walk to our school. I'm surprised to see Sara's car (she never drives it to school, she's understandably not crazy on the idea of what could happen to it in the school parking lot) in his driveway when I'm dropped off at his place, and perhaps slightly worried. I enter and find the two close to each other, deep in conversation. \"Sara? What are you doing here?\" I ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good timing, Megan! Davis and I were talking about you.\" Sara greets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or rather, this freaky dream we both seemed to have involving you. Sara insisted on discussing it here, guessing you'd likely come over.\" Davis adds, which seems to put my mind at ease as I take my Nike shoes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you guys <i>do</i> remember that...\" I reply, pleasantly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean to tell us that wasn't a dream?\" Davis asks, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my mouth to answer, but I'm immediately hit with another spurt. I feel myself stretching larger and my clothes becoming ever more restrictive. To my shock, I'm starting to look <i>down</i> at Sara, and it's not stopping! My clothes shift, becoming one of my older sets that's faring no better than the set I chose to wear, as evidenced by the rips forming at the seams. The looks on my friends' faces confirms they just saw what I just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of my clothes to fail completely is my old orange shirt, done in by my expanding torso and breasts. My friends are too dumbstruck to avert their gaze as I continue to outgrow my clothes, even as the combination of the feeling of my body grow and the air conditioned atmosphere makes my nipples harden. My ass tears its way out of my old shorts, and I moan as my panties dig into my womanhood before they too fall before my growing body. Naturally, I cover my sensitive spots with my arms and hands as my growth finally starts to subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I start to worry how I'm going to find anything to cover my naked self up with, I discover the outfit I'd been wearing before the spurt quickly reappearing - perfectly fitting my new size. Everything about me has enhanced, which aside from my athletic muscles proportionately rivals that of Sara. My boobs, for example, are easily D-cup now. The biggest difference though is that I'm now easily head and shoulders above even her, making me 8'4\" tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. Just a couple inches shorter than that anthropomorphic dog from that story I read awhile back now that I think about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I know my idea works.\" I remark as I relax my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, Megan! Y-you're HUGE!\" Sara exclaims, her eyes wide as she still attempts to get over her shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis meanwhile remains silent, though the bulge in his pants suggests he's far from repulsed by what he's just seen. \"So... yeah, we were all inside my head last night...\" I finally answer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sara and Davis stammer for a moment (okay mostly just Sara) as they take in the matter all three of us were within my mind last night and my new size. 8'4\" is a lot to take in, though I've a feeling I won't be this small for very long. I guess my ancient giantess self wasn't kidding about wanting the division to fade completely soon, or the hastening of it is starting now. I still don't quite understand what the trigger is, but perhaps that's for the better until this is complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, perhaps we should take this outside...\" Davis suggests, \"My folks and I have finally gotten the pool ready to use, if either of you'd like to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you in the least bit concerned about our friend growing like a weed and doing... whatever it was she did with her clothes?\" Sara asks him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm probably more concerned for Megan than even you are, Sara, but all three of us have a pretty good indication of what exactly is happening here. I believed that giantess we met in her mind when she said she'd never allow our friend to come to harm.\" Davis replies, his answer surprising me a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a point there, and I don't know how much I'll grow with each spurt, so I think I'll step outside before I outgrow it.\" I remark and head out the door to the backyard... only to hit my head on the door frame. \"Ow! Let's try this again... remembering to <i>duck</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time I duck through the door and make it outside without hitting my noggin again. Davis' pool isn't as fancy or as large as mine, but it's nonetheless very good. A brilliant white fence surrounds it to prevent anyone from falling in by accident, especially important in this neighborhood. Of course, this fence doesn't seem to pose much of a problem to me considering Davis is here to unlock the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, however, I kind of regret passing on that bikini yesterday. It would be great to have right about now. \"And me without my swimsuit...\" I hear Sara mutter as she and Davis come outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can assist you both in your current desires, if you wish...</i> I hear my other self offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?! Are you in my head now too?!\" Sara exclaims in frightened shock. I didn't know my other self could be heard by anyone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm only talking with you, Sara.</i> the other me assures and asks again, <i>Would you like your swimsuit here with you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah, otherwise I can't enjoy the pool and would have to drive all the way home just to retrieve it. The gas isn't going to pay for itself, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a surge of raw power run through me for a moment before the giant within says to her happily, <i>Done! Check the passenger seat of your car.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara wordlessly leaves for her car to retrieve her swimsuit, and likely put it on inside. She'll probably express her gratitude once she's sure this isn't an elaborate joke. I mean, I probably wouldn't believe it if I were in her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I'm starting to notice how this division fading thing is working. The other me is bit by bit taking on my mannerisms: she's starting to sound like <i>me</i>! Kind of like an imaginary friend, only she actually existed long ago. I... I don't know if I feel bad about it in all honesty, as her desire is to help me through this period of regaining what I once was, but I don't like the idea that I'm just using her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits me: <i>she</i> dislikes the idea of using me to be reborn as much as I dislike using her to get through this. The sooner we're fully one the happier we'll both be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, another surge of power courses through me, but this time I start growing. Again, my outfit is replaced with one of my old sets of clothes I had set aside to be sacrificed for this, one that... I don't think I ever actually wore before now. Bright pink and way more girly than what I usually gravitate towards. Definitely the biggest reasons it had been buried in my closet until yesterday afternoon, and why I can't feel any pity for what's about to happen to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I... I'll just g-give you some privacy until you're done, Megan...\" Davis says, popping back inside just as this abomination of a Christmas gift I didn't have the heart to return starts tearing under its futile attempt to contain my expanding body. I wouldn't mind him watching, in all honesty, but I sure as hell am not going to tell him that. My proportions don't really noticeably improve with this spurt, but I notice in the calm waters my complexion is improving. Any flaw on my face fades away, and I feel an odd sensation in my mouth as my teeth straighten and whiten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels a little strange to be growing in all directions yet everything staying more or less in line this time. Just the same, I gasp as my body frees itself from the restraints of my clothes. I expect my growth to stop, but I begin to wonder if I can actually <i>push</i> it further. Kind of a scary thought, but clearly I'm not going to fit in the limo much at all, so I may as well be big enough to walk home with good time. I'll... figure something out with my various games later if I need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI concentrate, and begin to feel my growth speed up again. I think my other self is quietly agreeing with this... at least, that's the sense I get, and it's getting increasingly hard to tell where my consciousness ends and hers begins. I must be getting pretty big now, for the fence around Davis' pool seems more and more like I could just simply step over it rather than trouble him to unlock the gate. Fitting into the pool... may be another matter entirely. Still, this sensation of my body stretching out, legs lengthening, arms elongating, etc., is rather nice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear god, Megan, as if you weren't huge before!\" I hear Sara exclaim next to me, coincidentally shattering my concentration and abruptly ending my growth. Cyan fabric quickly materializes around my breasts and my pelvis, forming that cyan bikini I... guess now had bought yesterday along with everything else. And I've got to say, damn I make this look good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of look, seeing as how my 6'5\" best friend fails to even reach my crotch, I can clearly tell I've more than doubled my height. Likely more than tripled it. I think I'm a solid 20 feet tall now, which would unquestionably be considered a giantess, albeit a small one. \"I'm just 20 feet now...\" I say, \"Unless you mean to tell me <i>you</i> are jealous of <i>me</i> now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara looks to me with wide eyes and admits, \"You know what, Megan? I just might be a little jealous. But I'm also worried. I don't want to lose my best friend to whatever this is that's happening to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara, it's not like a hybrid is trying to drain my life away... I'm not going to completely disappear anytime soon.\" I reassure, kneeling down to be more on my friend's level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You may come out now, Davis.</i> I hear my other self say to Davis telepathically, pretty much just as I was thinking of calling him out. Not a minute later, he comes scrambling out of his house. As his gaze falls upon me, I stand to my full height and strike as sexy of a pose as I can think of and ask, \"Well, Davis? How do I look in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wow...\" he manages to almost breathlessly answer, before quickly coming over to the gate and unlocking it. Sara is the first to go through, happily diving right into the pool. I doubt I've completely eased her worries, but I'm certain all will be made clear once I'm through this at last. I hope.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With my current 20 foot stature, it takes almost no effort for me to just step over the pool's not even knee height fence. (the fence is the minimum 4 feet high, my knee is over 5 feet) I don't even bother with the gate. I sit over the pool's edge with my lower legs and feet submerged in the water as I contemplate going in entirely. Maybe I overdid it on pushing my last spurt, as I'm likely going to hog most of the pool's space with my giant ass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHa! I got to remember that one for later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, I ultimately decide to slip into the pool and try to enjoy myself. I don't know when or even if I'll be able to do this again, so I should just enjoy myself while I can. Then again, I may be able to provide a bit more room, either on my own or with the assistance of my other self. I enter the deeper end of the pool and relax, predictably with a noticeable amount of my upper body still above the surface despite resting all the way down at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, are you still there?</i> I internally ask my other self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am, though I'm sure you already knew that.</i> she replies, <i>What would you like to know?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This power... It erodes the division between us further the more it's used, doesn't it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Indeed it does, though I prefer not to think of it as being utilized for directly personal benefit. However, the greatest aid in removing the division is...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Growth. The bigger I get, the closer I am to being equal to you and the faster the division goes away.</i> I finish for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I feel someone climbing onto my toned belly. I look down and find Davis trying to lounge on my stomach, using one of my breasts as a headrest! \"Having fun down there, Davis?\" I ask teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just seeing what's so special about this spot...\" Davis replies, and I swear he's sticking his tongue out at me. It's a little hard to tell at this size, especially with such a prominent chest. I silently submerge my belly suddenly, deepening the pool to allow me to do so, and watch with amusement as he quickly finds himself without the surface of my belly to rest on. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI merely respond with a giggle, and then submerge completely, curling up beneath the surface. Usually when I do this, I wait until my lungs are practically burning for air, however... that feeling never comes. I can see my friends swimming around on the surface in a bit of a panic, after all how the hell are they going to drag me to the surface, before I finally reemerge with a loud splash. \"How long was I underwater?\" I ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly half an hour, Megan.\" Sara replies with slight worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I guess I'm beyond breathing now, as I didn't feel the slightest bit of discomfort down there...\" I reason. I don't know everything about my body in what it can do and what I don't need to worry about anymore, but with any luck I will soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...come to think of it, I haven't had to use the toilet at all in days. Considering how big I am now and how big I'm surely going to get before all this is said and done, that's definitely a <i>good</i> thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I decide to experiment a little. Hey, if using these powers helps break down that barrier, that division between the parts of my self, then why not try out a few things? First, I get out of the pool, restoring its original dimensions afterward. Next, I remove all the tattered remains of the clothes I've outgrown from Davis' place so he won't have to later. And then... I make myself grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Again, Megan?\" Sara asks with minor annoyance as my clothes again shift to something I don't mind ruining as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why not?\" I respond, concentrating on making this outfit grow with me... to an extent. The fabric stretches uncomfortably as I ascend, more so because I'm not letting it just fail utterly this time. Tears form at the seams, small at first but slowly expanding, not unlike myself right now. Eventually, they're almost on the brink of tearing off completely when I stop growing, shifting back to the cyan bikini for now. I'd say I'm about... 30 feet tall at this point. Yeah, sounds about right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, and without warning, I teleport myself, Davis, and Sara (and her car) to my place. It's a surprising amount of exertion to perform this feat, way more than I thought it would take. Then again, I'm instantly relocating a couple tons of car and myself and two of my closest friends, (including one my heart strongly desires to become much closer than just friends) so... yeah. A lot of stuff. And over a pretty great distance, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell? How the fuck did we get here?\" Davis asks incredulously, \"And what about my house? My parents will flip if they discover it unlocked and I'm not there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleport successful!\" I answer, unable to help myself, \"Er, don't worry about your house, dude. It's locked up as tightly as can be.\" Davis breathes a sigh of relief, knowing he's not about to get in trouble with his folks. \"Your clothes are inside in the guest rooms if either of you want to change... or leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, they decide to stay for now. However, Sara and Davis do go inside for some lunch at an unfazed Alfred's offering. In fact, he seemed like he's expecting this. Maybe my family somehow already knows what's going on now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I felt another spurt incoming. Once again, my bikini is exchanged for another old outfit that's quickly being outgrown. Thinking quickly, I take a few lengthening steps away from my home so I don't potentially damage it, then focus on letting this spurt flourish as much as it wants to. And of course, the Master Sword earrings grow with me, which soon are about as large as some actual swords tend to be. We've a few sets of armor holding blunt swords in a few places, something I've always admired a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy outfit soon rips and tears, then falls off my swelling form piece by piece. It's not long before I'm once again left naked, yet I'm only barely bothered by it now. I notice that while my muscles don't seem to be growing any more defined, the rest of my body most certainly is improving. My hips and ass widen out bit by bit with every foot of height I gain while my breasts swell forth a little at a time. My hair even extends down my back, soft as silk yet putting spider silk to shame in terms of strength. (and spider's silk is pretty damn strong, pound for pound)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really intrigues me as this growth finally begins to peter out is my veins: they're alight with an almost eerie green glow. I soon realize even my eyes are glowing in this green color! The glow continues even after my growth stops and I regain the outfit I had on this morning, standing a massive 100 feet tall. My boobs are definitely bigger than Sara's now, proportionately speaking, suited for something like F-cup. \"W-wow... I've done it... I've totally beaten Sara...\" I remark to myself, \"But why am I glowing like Narud after he's revealed himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's a sign. We are close... so close now. I strongly encourage our friends and family to remain here. With any luck, they will witness the greatest event in human history: the rebirth of the largest, mightiest being to ever walk the Earth.</i> my other self answers me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also notice my shoes have changed, now being Converse instead of Nike... not that it matters much considering Nike owns Converse, but...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little later in the afternoon, Sara and Davis are... more than a little shocked that I had grown so huge since they went inside for lunch. Oh, and that I was glowing like a gigantic firefly. That part is probably the most unsettling thing, even for me. \"Um... hi guys? I'm totally not an evil shape-shifter, I swear!\" I greet as they stare up at my massive form. This feels almost familiar now... though the scale is still off. Soon though, everything shall be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. I sounded so full of confidence just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... I think I preferred you when you weren't green with... whatever this is, Megan.\" Davis says, and I feel a sharp disturbance at that remark both in my heart and body. \"But other than that, you, uh, look lovely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pro tip: don't hurt the feelings of a girl who could squash you like a bug, Davis.\" Sara reprimands, smacking Davis in the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! I never meant it like <i>that</i>... Jeez...\" Davis whimpers, rubbing the back of his head, \"Besides, even if she <i>is</i> practically a 100 foot tall glow stick at the moment, my feelings for her haven't changed! She's still our best friend. You hear me up there, Megan? I'm not leaving you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat remark seems to quash the disturbance, though I can't help but wonder why it popped up in the first place... Anyway, I nod and reply, \"I may be huge, but I can hear you just fine! Say, would you guys mind staying over here for a bit? If you don't want to, I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Davis smiles and answers, \"I'd be glad to. Actually, I've been meaning to come over and spend some time with my friend, so it works out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw, how sweet of him! Really, I think I only truly need Davis here with me, but the more the merrier. And I'd like for both of my best friends, as well as my family, to be here for the event of a lifetime. I turn my attention to Sara as she replies, \"You know I can't resist an invitation to stay with my BFF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most of the afternoon, the three of us try to enjoy ourselves. Granted, my sheer size makes this difficult, but I still try to have some fun with my friends. I soon have a fun idea, and conjure up a giant chessboard complete with chess pieces, minus the black queen and king's side knight which Sara and Davis take the place of respectively. For this, we play by a modified set of rules: if I take out both of them, then the game is over. I'm not playing myself. However, if either of them gets taken out and a pawn of theirs makes it to the end of the board, it can be used to bring them back. (albeit still as their respective piece)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I have to move most of their pieces, given they can't move to push a piece without it counting as the one they're representing moving, (just like in the Harry Potter movie, which I adore both the movies and the books) but I play fair and only move their pieces to where they say. Now, just because they're my friends doesn't mean I go easy on them. Like, as I take the knight Davis represents, I bump him pretty roughly with my queen, though not enough to hurt. Both Sara and I get a good chuckle as he goes to relax in a seat by the captured black pieces. The game goes on, with Sara and I losing pieces here and there. Eventually, the game comes to its end, with Sara staring up into my eyes in front of me as she boldly declares, \"Checkmate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scan the board to confirm, and indeed I'm beaten. I tip my king over, saying, \"Well played, guys! I think dinner should be nearly ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends head inside and get cleaned up for dinner while I make the chess game vanish. As night falls, I wish my friends and family a good night before curling up in the backyard and falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up early the next day, surprising myself with how well I slept outside without any comforts or shelter. What's more surprising is that I don't feel cold at all. I yawn and stretch, accidentally sending my fist into a dead tree my family's been meaning to have cleared. The thing shifts in the ground from the blow, yet my knuckles are unscathed from punching its still solid trunk. Out of curiosity, I stand and pull up on trunk, yanking it out of the ground almost effortlessly, then set it down on its side. Despite being just athletically toned, I'm clearly way stronger than I look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning marches on and my friends and family have something for breakfast, I notice the glow my body's putting out through my veins beginning to brighten. I respond by taking my shoes off and having my socks vanish, then call those closest to me for the coming event. \"I need you guys out here right now, if you're not too busy...\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends and family quickly heed my call, coming outside just as I feel a load of power course through me. I feel and hear my bones shift and crack as they slowly enlarge and come to bear more weight. My clothes once again slowly tighten around me, the sleeve cuffs of my shirt constricting around my upper arms very uncomfortably. My pants start to ride up my legs a few feet at time, which isn't that much considering I was 100 feet tall before this started, while up top they start hugging my hips more than they're supposed to. Thinking quickly, I move my growing hands to the button and undo it before it potentially flies off and hits something I'd rather it not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take my eyes off her...\" Davis mutters as he stares transfixed upon my growing frame. I moan as my muscles feel as if on fire with the raw power flowing through them, though everything stays proportionate. That doesn't mean my undergarments are spared, however, as my body slowly outgrows them too, constraining me even as my outer wear is already doing a fine job of that itself for the moment. To further bombard me with sensations, I can also feel the soles of my feet slide across the grass as the very foundation of my body extends in all directions while I climb higher into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, my clothes begin tearing at the seams as my head starts to creep up towards the tip of a pine tree we often decorate for Christmas. My pant legs rip at the cuffs from being unable to pass my knee caps, exposing ever more flesh with increasingly brighter glowing veins. I can feel the air itself beginning to crackle across my skin from the raw power building within me, especially as more of it becomes exposed to the open air. In a rather dramatic finish, both my shirt and pants give up in quick succession, tears forming across the seams and paths of least resistance before either falling off or hanging off me uselessly, leaving me for the moment in just my far too tight undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon becomes unbearable to keep the bra on, and so my still expanding hands reach behind my lengthening back to unclasp the thing. I fiddle with it, but the clasp breaks before I can get it undone and I just take the useless thing right off. I look down my growing, topless body, now decidedly taller than that pine tree, I sigh, then reach down to my panties and brace myself as I give a sharp tug. A loud snap fills the air as the garment breaks, seemingly almost thankful to be put out of its misery, and I now stand as naked as the day I arrived on this planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, I can feel the last remnants of the barrier crumbling away as my growth picks up its pace somewhat. My feet begin to encroach upon the safety of those below me, so I step back to give them more room, the yard extending to allow me to do so. As I continue to grow taller than the trees nearby, including the pine I've been so fond of and am currently using as a reference, I feel... an incredible joy as the two halves of my being merge. By the time my considerable breasts hover above the pine more and more, the memories of my past lives become fully unlocked, right down to their final, peaceful moments before passing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of final moments, my growth begins to slow as my crotch passes the top of the pine. I come to learn all that my other half kept from my knowledge until now, including the reason why this started in the first place... and why it was briefly threatened yesterday with Davis' remark. The people below appear all the smaller as I continue to finish my growing ascent and reclaim my former glory, what I once was in ages past and long forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, after my previous size is barely above knee height to me, my growth ends. I cease the glow from my veins as I stand complete, reborn. <b>\"THE MERGING... IS COMPLETE! NOW, WE ARE ONE!\"</b> I exclaim, both audibly and through my friends and family's minds, my words positively dripping with untold power the likes of which the world hasn't seen in a long, long time. (not that it remembers) At the astounding height of 360 feet tall, I've never felt more... <i>alive</i> than I do right now. I suppose several millennia of dormancy will do that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI notice the now too small Master Sword earrings, still hanging off my ears. I correct this, focusing my will into making them fit me as well as they did when I had bought them on Friday.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gazing down towards Sara and Davis, I quickly become aware of their terrified expressions. Perhaps... perhaps the telepathic exclamation was a <i>little</i> much, though I could hardly contain my enthusiasm... I'm also not oblivious to the mess I created when I outgrew my clothes, including the pair of panties still in my hand that I snapped to prevent another embarrassing situation, which would've been made worse by being in front of my family. Not to mention I've yet to have any of the time I thought I was going to have to do my homework...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, \"I was too busy reawakening my true self\" isn't an acceptable excuse to not having it done. Not in the slightest. That would get me detention and a zero at least as large as I am right now faster than an upgraded zergling on creep. (that's pretty fast)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the first order of business for me is to at least have some cover. I don't mind being naked, but human culture these days insists upon being clothed, and I wish to respect this. That, and I believe I've given Davis enough of a show for at least a week. I focus upon my destroyed bra and panties, utilizing the powers I possess to twist metal and fabric back to its proper shape, then to expand the amount of material within them to gradually fit me once more. Finally, I put them back on, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing my attention to my ruined outfit, I will my shirt and pants to reconstitute themselves. The fabric knits itself back together gradually, reforming the simple yet stylish shirt first then the hip-hugging pants I had been drawn to on Friday, though both are still much too small to fit. I decide to reduce them to a more manageable size, and then trade for the dress I meant to wear for Davis' birthday, which both he and Sara should still remember from the adventure in my mind a couple nights ago. Obviously, I use my powers to make the dress fit, along with the socks I removed just prior to my most recent growth. I'd rather not think about how much material currently goes into each shoe after expanding them to once again fit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" I remark to myself, voice still carrying the air of the raw power at my disposal. At last, I kneel down before my friends and say with a smile, \"Seriously. Did you two truly believe I could resist quoting an archon? Or Arthas? You guys know me better than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see them both hesitate before Sara finally steps forward to reply, \"D-do we really know you? I'm not so sure anymore, and I don't know how you can prove it legitimately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer remark stings, but she does have a point. \"Well... you guys deserve the truth about me. We've been friends for years, but I couldn't tell you any of this before because I didn't know until now.\" I say, and continue after a quiet gulp to collect my thoughts, \"What you see before you here is the true me: the largest, mightiest being the world has ever known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, so you're a giantess. Kind of obvious, Megan.\" Davis interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I'm an ancient goddess. I don't even know how old I actually am, but I was around in the time of the early humans. No, the dinosaurs were long gone by the time I arrived.\" I correct him, \"A few tribes worshiped me while I granted them aid on occasion when they asked for it, though not in war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" Sara asks, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I helped them eventually establish a settlement, but... I was kind of an idiot and went into dormancy, being reincarnated as a new female among humanity to quietly observe them. O-on the plus side, this lets me ace History class easily with the sheer experiences I've been through in my past lives... Still, I was wise enough to establish a trigger for my return... Anyone care to guess what it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara mulls it over before her blue eyes widen as she says, \"...you giant <i>sap</i>! If you fell hard for someone, then you'd regain your true self so you weren't hiding anything from them!\" I concentrate, and have a small trophy appear before my friend with WINNER on the plaque. \"So then, there's one thing left. Don't even think about making excuses, Megan, it's time you tell the one responsible for this happening how you feel about him!\" Davis starts to walk away when Sara grabs his arm. \"Get back here, you doofus. You're gonna hear our friend out if I have to sit on you to do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath to calm myself before I admit my feelings... but it gets muddled as Davis says something at the same time. I try again, and we end up trying to talk over one another again. On the third try, I will his mouth to stay shut. \"Just listen, as this is important. I've... I've had a crush on you for years, Davis. My love for you has allowed me to reawaken my true self. I-I know this is a lot to take in, and if you'd rather someone a bit more... <i>normal</i> be your girlfriend... I understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving it a minute to sink in, I let Davis speak again, wanting to hear what he had to say. \"Megan... I'd never think about having anyone else but the one my heart belongs to, but to think she wants me as her boyfriend... right now I must be the luckiest guy in the world! If this is a dream, I sure as hell don't want to wake up!\" he confesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel so overjoyed that Davis and I share the same feelings for one another! I try a little experiment, and with a great deal of not easily secured concentration, compress down to a more manageable 6'4\" height. I squeeze my now boyfriend in an affectionate embrace, being sure I don't accidentally hurt him as I happily say, \"Oh thank you, Davis! You can't begin to imagine how happy this makes me feel!\" I unintentionally make the sun shine brighter like I just used Sunny Day due to my mood, but I at least make sure it doesn't bother anyone while I'm on cloud nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank GOD you two lovebirds have finally confessed to each other!\" Sara exclaims, \"I've had to be both of your confidants, trying to prod both of you to just spill it out to each other when the only ones oblivious to the doey eyes you had for each other were yourselves. I'd have threatened to lock you two in a room together if I didn't think you'd just sit there playing Angry Birds on your phones or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We totally would, wouldn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd bet money on it.\" The two of us laugh before I turn my attention over to Sara and say, \"I'm sorry we both ended up asking you to keep this to yourself, Sara. As our friend, I'm sure it wasn't easy for you...\" I pause and ask hesitantly, which sounds a bit ironic considering my voice still carries my immense power behind it even at this diminutive size, \"Er, we... we're still friends, right?\" Sara nods, and I give her a friendly hug as well that unintentionally squeezes the air out of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, I return to my full default size without tearing my dress apart, much to my relief, and return the sun's intensity to normal. Overall, a marked success. I'm able to compress myself down to a more human size, choosing 6'4\" since as fun as an amazonian 8'4\" might be... I'd rather not have to alter everything just to accommodate me in school. I might opt for much smaller at some point, if only just for a little while, but perhaps slowly playing around with the sizes between 6'4\" and 360 feet would be a fun experience? Especially with Davis to watch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, I think I may focus the few days on practicing holding my chosen human size for hours at a time first before I go messing around with various sizes. This is something I've never done before in my long, long existence, much of which spent in dormancy, so I need some time getting the hang of it... that or being prepared to apologize for every time I accidentally outgrow the school. (I might have to do both) It will certainly give me an excuse to play my beloved games, or catch a movie with Davis on my treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough... I could probably make others grow if I want. While I don't have to worry about the square-cube law, (oh god the look on scientists' faces upon discovering the skeleton of my original body would be <i>priceless</i>!) I should probably take it relatively slow with a human so their body can get used to being big if I do that. Perhaps my best friend Sara Mars would like a taste of being big?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud grumble soon echoes across the neighborhood. It doesn't take being a goddess to recognize the sound is coming from... my stomach. \"Well <i>someone's</i> hungry...\" Davis remarks to me, lightly jabbing the side of my shoe with his elbow. He certainly seems much more energetic around me now that we've actually confessed our feelings to each other. It still boggles my mind that we had both entrusted this secret with Sara, which was probably the worst kept secret in the history of life, the universe, and everything! (the answer of which is 42)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, my stomach doesn't care that I'm an ancient goddess reborn in modern times... it wants food yesterday!\" I admit sheepishly. Originally, I rarely needed much of anything, which was fortunate considering a 360 foot being can... pack <i>a lot</i> away. Now, while I'm sure I can't starve to death, I haven't had anything to eat since breakfast yesterday and I'm used to eating regularly. This would also be a great time to properly fill my family in on all of this instead of constantly altering their perceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, though, I use my power to bind my Master Sword earrings to my being, so they'll now change size with me effortlessly. They're comparatively small enough that I can get away with it, and I won't need to constantly take them off. Once done, I compress myself down once again to my chosen human size of 6'4\" almost instantly and head inside my home for the first time in over a day, then make a beeline for the kitchen to find something to have for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Megan? What are you doing? What is going on here?\" I hear Beverly ask from somewhere behind me, clearly sounding very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just getting some lunch, Beverly. You... still remember me being giant, right? And my voice in your head and ears earlier?\" I answer and question back, making no effort to hide the power within my voice as I prepare myself a large sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well yes, I-I do... B-but what is this all about? I'm a-afraid I don't understand...\" she frightfully replies, tearing into my heart a little with her fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and the rest of my family don't understand, my young, sweet Beverly, because I've restored your perceptions of me. You're able to notice my changes just as my friends can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Y-young? But I'm nearly 62 years old!\" Beverly exclaims in her confusion, following me into the dining room next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI set my meal down on the table and explain, \"I'm an ancient goddess reborn into modern times. I can call protoss young. No, I'm not possessed, this <i>is</i> me. You needn't be scared, I'd never hurt my family and I'm positive my parents have told you how much you and Alfred mean to us. Me especially.\" I pause as I take a bite out of the sandwich I made and continue after swallowing, \"Now then, the giant size you saw earlier is my normal size, but I'm currently compressing myself into the size you see before you. I'm letting you and the rest of my family know now because I love you, and am deeply sorry for not letting you know of this right from the start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long before Sara and Davis come inside and confirm my story when asked. As further, undeniable proof, I will a space in the corner cleared and summon Fat Chocobo... complete with the morbidly obese bird's theme from the Final Fantasy games. I'd... rather not think about how it stores all of the party's currently unwanted equipment, if I'm honest. Especially while I'm eating, as I want to <i>keep</i> my stomach contents where they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'm finished, and have made Fat Chocobo vanish, I consider going back outside when I remember I've still yet to do my homework for the weekend. Well I <i>did</i> want to practice holding a smaller size for hours at a time... \"Have either of you guys done your homework yet, or are all three of us in the same boat of not even started?\" I ask my friends. When both shake their heads no, I teleport their books and such here and suggest, \"Then how about we do that now and not give the teachers a reason to bite our heads off? I'll meet you guys in father's study once I get my books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara and Davis nod and head out into the hall with me. Our paths split as I take a detour to my room, remembering to remove my shoes before stepping foot on the floor upstairs my mother recently put down and teleporting them to the tray in the entrance lobby, rejoining them after I grab my homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the study, I find my father dumbstruck as I take a seat next to Davis and get started on my homework. I did project my conversation with Beverly into the rest of my family's minds, but I guess his little girl actually being a goddess is a lot to take in. I simply smile at him warmly and continue with my current task, which surprisingly isn't any easier than before. I suppose the memories of my practically countless past lives can only help so much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the three of us finish our various homework assignments, I decide to begin a little experiment with Sara. She admitted she was a bit jealous of me yesterday, and since my curves were merely comparable to hers then, I can only assume the (now second) hottest girl in our school was jealous of my height. I intend to give her a taste of what it's like to be a giantess, but I can't instantly do that as I won't risk her life on something her body isn't physically adapted to handle. Instead, I'll have her gradually get there, like a diver taking breaks as they return to the surface to avoid 'the bends'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, this is more fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing my powers, I subtly tweak my blonde friend's pituitary gland to occasionally douse her bloodstream with a flood of growth hormones. In addition, I ensure this experiment won't physically affect Sara negatively as it goes on, and re-purpose that mental link I had left in her mind a couple nights ago into a basic monitor of her mental state. I trigger my experiment to start and wait for a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't have long to wait as I watch her face become just a little flushed. \"Are you okay?\" I ask, also practicing hiding the reverberation of power in my voice as much as I can. It should be sufficient for anyone not listening closely, but I won't know for sure until school tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine, Megan. Probably just coming down with something. I guess I'll just have to down a few cartons of orange juice to nuke whatever it is with vitamin C.\" Sara replies. My monitor tells me that's what she honestly believes. She has no idea what she's in for, but she will soon. Her pituitary is a ticking time bomb and she doesn't even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, after a dinner in which I had to very carefully assure my family once again that I'd never hurt any of them, and in brighter news officially announce Davis and I are now boyfriend and girlfriend, Davis enters my room and asks, \"So, uh... how are you holding up? Is it particularly hard to maintain this size over your I guess normal huge one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look over from the story I'm reading called Mind Over Matter to my boyfriend and answer with a smile, \"It's not that hard, but it feels weird. I feel a bit <i>vulnerable</i> like this, which isn't something I'm used to. Still, it's worth it for love and games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis smiles at that last remark, and asks as he takes a seat next to me, \"You've done something to Sara, haven't you? If she was truly falling ill with so much as the sniffles, I think you'd offer to cure her even if she does tend to be a bit stubborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusted. \"Well let's just say Sara's got big things in store. Please don't tell her anything about this, I don't want her to demand to be changed back so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lips are sealed, Megan.\" Davis responds before we embrace and he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, my mental monitor alerts me to the fact Sara is about to experience a growth spurt, the first of many over the coming days. Using my powers, I watch as her already long legs slowly extend and thicken, her bones and muscles increasing in mass, her feet slowly expanding even through her knee high socks the cuffs of which creep lower slightly faster than she's actually growing. She always did like to dress just teetering on the edge of the dress code, which now works against her as her hips and ass start forcing her short skirt to expose more of her panties, which are stretching unhappily for the moment even as they start cutting into her hips slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat also holds true for her tank top, which stretches yet reveals more of her flat midriff than it should, as well as more cleavage than usual. As it doesn't cover them at all, her slowly lengthening arms and widening shoulders are spared the sensation of being constricted by its fabric. The same can't be said about her bra being forced to contain a slowly increasing pair of breasts on a slowly increasingly larger chest, its straps starting to dig into her collarbone and back. I also watch as Sara's face grows along with the rest of her, though her look of bewilderment hinders its beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as quickly as it started, her spurt ends, her pituitary out of juice for the time being. However, her growth was proportionate in all regards, from her cute button nose to her impressive DD-cup breasts to her long, sexy legs... to her internal organs. That peanut sized gland is now just a little bigger to go along with her now 6'8\" body, which means her next spurts could be increasingly bigger. Thankfully, I've already ensured her body won't eat itself due to her growth. And as for her clothes... while I may occasionally help, she'd best be ready to wear stuff she won't mind outgrowing and ripping out of.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a couple of moments, Sara appears calm. Internally, however, her mind is a flurry of chaotic activity, trying to figure out what just happened and why everything feels a bit off. I've no doubts that my blue-eyed blonde friend will eventually realize she's growing. Granted, it seems to me she's not about to catch on until at least another spurt, which even I don't know when will happen, but when she does... the realization I'm behind it probably won't be far off. Still, I know she won't try to kill me for two simple reasons:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's not the kind of person capable of taking a human life, and;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she was, she'd know I'm the only being around that <i>can</i> reverse her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, I proceed with my nightly routine, and then plop my pajama-clad butt down in front of my computer to read more of this Mind Over Matter story series. In some ways, I can sort of see myself in Sophie and Aria, two of the characters in the story. I wish I could go in there and help them, but I also don't want to ruin the story the writers are trying to tell. I settle for materializing the two before me and giving each girl a heartfelt hug before she can say or do anything, then sending them back to their story none the wiser. I kind of like the former's brown hair with that silver streak in it much more than the practically pitch black hair. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, I turn my computer off and go to sleep... sort of. A part of my consciousness is kept awake throughout the night to ensure I don't wake up to find I've returned to my default size and thus outgrown and wrecked my home. My family wouldn't be happy about it even if I can repair it after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, I thankfully awake in my room with nothing out of place... well aside from my Starcrafts zergling plush I had bought awhile back. A quick look beside my bed solves where the adorable little thing had fallen during the night. I've got pretty much the entire set of multiplayer units from Starcraft II to have appeared on Starcrafts in plush doll form. I love how Carbot Animations has made the normally nightmarish zerg look so positively <i>adorable</i>! (though the overseer looks so sophisticated)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I pick up the little zergling off the floor and set it down on the shelf near the hydralisk and marine, then proceed to the bathroom to shower and prepare for the day. I might try bathing under a waterfall for kicks some day, I'm sure at least a few humans may enjoy the spectacle before the memories fade. Once I finish my shower, I go for the shirt and pants I had on yesterday before my reawakening completed, featuring a green outline of a 1-Up Mushroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, I help myself to some breakfast where I'm soon joined by Davis and Sara, the latter still apparently oblivious to her changes for the moment. \"Morning, guys!\" I greet my friends warmly, still doing my best to muffle the reverberation of power within my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara and Davis greet me back before digging in to some of the cereal I left out. I notice how Sara almost unconsciously keeps trying to pull at her too small clothes in an ultimately futile attempt to get them to fit better, which makes me have to suppress a giggle as then she'd be onto me. Telepathically, I gently remind Davis, <i>Remember, you agreed to not tell her what's really going on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we're done, I put the dishes away to be washed, and then the three of us finish getting ready. I consider carrying Sara and Davis to school at my default size for a moment, but soon decide against it. This time anyway. Still, it does remind me I probably should return to it for a few moments, so I quickly step outside and with a flash of light not unlike a warden's Blink spell I'm at my default size which could stare Godzilla in the eye. \"One of these days I'm going to actually give myself <i>time</i> to unwind more slowly than this...\" I mutter to myself, this time not hiding the sheer power my voice contains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you manipulate time itself, Megan?\" I hear Davis ask me from well below my ankle, surprising me as I thought I was alone out here. I guess my boyfriend followed me outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, and noticing that Sara has also come outside, I answer, \"I can, but it's... uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn second thought... screw it. I bend down and scoop up my friends carefully in my right hand. It's been millennia since I actually walked around at my default size, and I'm also unsure if I want Sara having another growth spurt inside the limo. Alfred's been through enough with me as it is. I lift them up to my shoulder, then start walking to school. The ground makes a satisfying tremble as I advance one step at a time, which also stretches to provide clear space to put each foot down, only to snap back to how it was originally once I step away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrive at school very quickly, thanks to my tremendous strides. My fellow students walk right past my enormous Converse without a second thought, much to my surprise. At any rate, I offer up my hand for Sara and Davis to hop into and then gently lower them down to the ground. Afterwards, I return to my chosen human size of 6'4\" so as to actually be able to enter the school, which the three of us do moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI notice the stares towards Davis and I on the way to our lockers, which happen to be right next to each other. \"Hey, Megan! Are you two... you know...\" a girl a grade under me asks hesitantly, wearing an outfit popularized by that model Sonia Enders. I wouldn't mind meeting her one day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thing? Since yesterday, yeah! I finally mustered up the courage to tell him how I feel.\" I answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which of course is the best early birthday gift I could ever receive, what with having a painfully obvious crush on my friend for so long\" Davis adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lucky...\" the girl confides before going on her way. She has no idea how right she is, not that I'm going to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn history class, I'm alerted to the fact Sara's about to experience another growth spurt. I slip out of the classroom under the excuse of needing to use the washroom, so I can watch it happen without distraction. With my powers, I observe as her body responds favorably to the unloading of growth hormones from its pituitary, her head slowly rising towards the ceiling tiles. Her feet become pinched in her heels, much to her discomfort, though it's only a matter of time before her formally size 12 feet overwhelm her footwear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt continues to slowly hike upward, leaving more and more of her smooth legs and thighs exposed, and not really even covering her butt that well before the whole thing rips at the waist. I swear I've never seen Sara's face blush that red before, especially not as her too small tank top continues to stretch in an ultimately futile attempt to contain her, as evidenced by the fabric starting to tear. Her experience isn't helped by the fact her panties are digging into... a <i>very</i> sensitive spot between her legs as her pelvis widens in all directions in accordance with her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a loud snap as her huge DD-cup breasts at last free themselves of their imprisonment behind a far too tight bra, then a tear as the resulting motion completes her top's demise. When her heels finally give, Sara's balance is lost and she falls backward in a spectacular crash. She's not seriously hurt, but anyone who's ever wanted to see my friend's boobs would be getting a very complete view, given how she had automatically moved her hands away from covering them in her panic to try to brace her fall. Her panties and socks are all that's still left to cover her, and even then the former look as though they'll give up at any minute while her toes poke out of the latter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she gets a small taste of her hands stretching and sliding little by little over the cold tile floor, Sara's growth comes to a close. My friend is left lying there, panting, embarrassed beyond belief yet still as sexy as ever, and a solid 7 feet tall. I know I should help her, but I don't even get a chance to concentrate on her tattered clothes before she hastily runs out of the classroom, leaving her shoes behind. There's no way for her to deny that she's grown, especially after feeling her hands slide across the floor and tearfully noting the door frame almost brushes the top of her head on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I don't know is if she realizes she's not done growing, that she's going to eventually be truly giant. What I <i>do</i> know is that her naked form is going to be <i>everywhere</i> on the internet after school's done for the day... if not even sooner. Well, I can at least help her there, the pictures taken of Sara Mars being mysteriously deleted from the takers' phones. If things continue as it stands now, it won't be long before they won't need pictures to see her nude... and towering over most of their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I know it, I come face to face with my enlarged best friend, her blue eyes widening as she spots me. She knows I wouldn't need to use the washroom, so I can't use that excuse with her. \"M-Megan? W-what are you doing out here in the halls?\" she asks, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh...\" I begin, fearing I'm busted. There's no way I can deny I'm behind this if she asks, considering I'm right here in front of her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-never mind... Please, I-I need your help here...\" Sara interrupts, pleading for my assistance. My mental monitor senses something off about her mental state, though I can only assume her distress over the situation is to blame. At least she doesn't seem to suspect I've done anything to her at the moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no kidding...\" I reply, really taking in how large she is next to me and hoping to keep her suspicions of me at bay. And while again her proportions haven't changed, her pituitary gland is also even bigger for potentially even more growth...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I consider asking what my best friend Sara would like me to do to help her out in this situation, or even just giving her a solution while trying to evade any suspicions she may have that I'm behind her growth. There are, of course, a ton of ways I could possibly help without giving myself away, but not all of them are likely to be appreciated by Sara. \"S-sure, I-I can help. What are friends for, right?\" I say as I start to settle on restoring her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just before I can enact my plan, we both hear a door open. We're not alone out here in the hall, and restoring Sara's clothes <i>would</i> be noticed. But who... \"Well well well... Here we have the popular girls thinking they own the place and can do whatever they fucking well please.\" Shit. It just had to be <i>her</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around to face the scourge of my modern existence, Yasmin Foxworth. This 5'11\" girl has hair one could set fire to and no one would notice, the ends dyed the color of charcoal not helping matters. Build-wise, she's okay, I mean she's not <i>physically</i> ugly in any way... but she's often gone around with a chip on her shoulder. If she decides she doesn't like someone, she makes it blatantly obvious. Case in point: me and Sara. I think I earned her hatred when I disagreed with her calling Sara Mars a slut, at least originally. In the reality of me being somewhat bustier than my blonde friend, it's entirely possible Yasmin has loathed me the whole time we've known each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I could do a near infinite number of things to Yasmin. Many of them decidedly unpleasant. However, as a goddess - no, as a good <i>person</i>, I need to have <i>restraint</i>. So with a sigh, I turn and say, \"I was headed for the washroom when my friend came bursting out of her classroom like this, Yasmin. My current class is history. I do surprisingly well in that class, so could you tell me why the <i>fuck</i> I would want to skip it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you fucking can, for all I care!\" Yasmin yells in response, adamant in her belief I would do exactly as she claimed or at least others would believe her rhetoric if she shouted it loudly enough. Again, I resist the urge to turn her into a puddle of goo, as much as it might just do the school a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... you could make a lot more friends if you change this whole attitude of belittling everyone you happen to hate you've got going on. It might also improve your health in the long run, as I hear stress tends to weaken the human body.\" I tell Yasmin honestly. I then wrap my arm around Sara's as best I can considering the currently half a foot difference and say, \"Come on, Sara. Let's see if the nurse's office has some bed sheets to cover yourself with for the time being...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I walk with my friend down the hall towards the nurse's office, just as I said. The entire time, I could feel Yasmin's cold grey eyes burning into the back of my head as though she was hoping her glare would be enough to make me drop dead. We round the corner and out of her sight and earshot, but to make sure, I peek back around the corner to see Yasmin storming her way into the girls' washroom on this floor. No doubt she'll be waiting for me to make good on my excuse of needing it now, which complicates things considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, Megan, but... being taken to the nurse's office wasn't quite what I had in mind when I asked for your help.\" Sara remarks quietly, \"I was hoping you could restore my clothes to fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Yasmin's thrown a monkey wrench in anything I could use my powers here for.\" I explain in barely louder than a whisper, \"If I restore your clothes here, it <i>will</i> be noticed by everyone who saw you outgrow them as well as Yasmin. I might as well have the Odin follow me home like a gigantic, heavily armed puppy dog in that case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I can just imagine you putting on your best Tychus Findlay impression as you ask your folks, \"It followed me home. Can I keep it?\" It's probably about the size of a dog next to you at your true size, isn't it?\" Sara muses with a chuckle, \"I see your point though. You struggled enough just getting your family to calm down about what you are, and they're <i>naturally</i> inclined to love you. I can't begin to imagine even the hundreds of people here being as understanding... let alone Yasmin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much...\" I nod before the nurse opens the door. \"My friend here needs some help... and something to cover up.\" I explain to the nurse, but I don't wait for a reply as I dash away to the girls' washroom so as to try and maintain my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I enter the washroom, Yasmin is just leaving. Ignoring her cold glare, I lock myself within a stall, giving it a couple minutes before I come back out and return to class. Upon returning, I quietly inform my teacher what had taken me so long... leaving out some details that would more than likely distract him from his job, of course, (he wouldn't be the first teacher to be tempted with thoughts of Sara's naked body despite knowing full well it would doom his career to act upon them) then take my seat. As much as I doubted I missed anything all that vital, I arranged for a boy named Kevin to lend me his notes so I could catch up and keep up the appearance of Megan Allerton, the rich, pretty, but otherwise perfectly normal girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the remainder of history class concludes, P.E. class is up. I briefly debate resuming a size large enough to be exempt from it, but ultimately decide to give it a chance. Besides, I'm interested in learning how the class views me... and even a goddess can use exercise. I head for my locker and meet Davis there as we both put our books away and claim our gym clothes, which for me includes a sturdy sport bra. \"Hey, there's a rumor flying around about Sara... something about her tearing out of her clothes to fuck the nearest thing with a pulse before escaping out into the halls? Would you know anything about it?\" Davis asks with a voice of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a part of it is true... but Sara outgrew her clothes and fled her classroom.\" I answer, \"We kind of ran into each other. The rest Yasmin made up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis sighs as he remarks, \"That girl needs another hobby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe split up and enter the change rooms, then reunite once we've changed before entering the gym. \"You know the drill. Give me three laps, Megan!\" the teacher instructs. I shrug and proceed to give the man his laps, actually counting them this time. I learn as I run that he's making me do these just so he has an excuse to stare at my ass as I pass by him, though I remain silent on the matter. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after I finish my laps and class begins, I sense Sara about to undergo another growth spurt. As much as I want to excuse myself to witness it, that would seem suspicious, especially to my blonde friend unknowingly growing into a giantess. (not to mention if I have another run-in with Yasmin) So instead, I tap into her nervous system, feeling what she feels physically, while keeping my own body participating with the teacher's lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my friend's bones crack and shift as they start to grow longer and thicker, which from personal experience... feels very weird. I feel her panties digging ever deeper into her hips and... between her long, smooth (and getting longer) legs, causing a strange sensation of pain and pleasure until finally the garment gives out. And she's only barely begun to grow by the feel of it. Yet as this is going on, I can feel the air across her nipples, which makes me wonder why the <i>hell</i> is Sara still naked in the nurse's office?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I climb the rope in the gym to the top, my best friend's body continues to slowly climb in height. I can feel her skin, which she prides herself in keeping as \"smooth as a baby's bottom\", stretching and gliding against itself. Her muscles bulge and swell just beneath the surface, as do her breasts and ass, keeping the proportionate growth I had subtly imprinted upon her. With a quick thought, I see through Sara's eyes and behold her nude form, which has often been described as a walking wet dream but here would push weaker-willed individuals over the edge, creep larger in all directions before she closes her blue eyes. I sense her mouth opening and something coming out, but I fail to catch what that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that, I feel Sara's growth spurt subside. I watch through her eyes, now opened again, as she saunters over to the scale in the corner. (she's very natural at that walk. Half the time she doesn't even realize she's doing it) After about a minute of fiddling with it, she manages to get it to stay still when she steps off to take note of her new height. 7'5\", an entire foot taller than before she started growing. Oddly, I feel her face contort into a frown... Is she upset with her growth? It's gone before I can better discern what the face was for, but I cut off just before the amazon starts to... <i>explore</i> herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to admit, this experiment is going well. Almost too well. I hope I haven't started something that's going to snowball out of my control, as that might be bad. \"She's grown again, hasn't she?\" I hear Davis whisper in my ear, apparently able to recognize my slightly distant look. I can only subtly nod in reply, hoping to avoid drawing unwanted attention to us.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At lunch, I again treat Davis to Subway... mostly because I love their submarine sandwiches. But this also presents the two of us an opportunity to discuss Sara's condition without the entire school potentially overhearing. Hopefully Yasmin won't cross my path again, at least not right now, because I'm not so sure I want to have to wait until after school to go over this in peace. \"How long do you intend to keep Sara in the dark as to what you've done to her, Megan?\" Davis asks cautiously, \"I mean, is she going to grow through the school roof? I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd know if she was about to grow again, but I don't think she'll get nearly that big today. Still, I never thought she'd grow quite as much as she has just today, so even I don't really know exactly what's in store for Sara.\" I admit, \"As much as I'd like to keep her unaware I'm behind this for another day or so... maybe I should let her know soon and see how she reacts. Hopefully I don't end up throwing our friendship away in the process.\" I answer before taking a bite out of the sub I bought in all its delicious cold-cut glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about her homework assignments? I doubt she'd be happy to have her grades slide because you've made it nearly impossible to hand in her homework...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have most of her classes this semester, albeit not at the same time, so I should be able to hand hers in as well. She's used the same lock for years now, so I've got the combination down by heart.</i> I answer Davis telepathically, then in response to what he might ask next, <i>What? I was taught not to talk with my mouth full!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright then.\" Davis concedes before finally digging in to his sub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we finish, Davis and I return to school in preparation for our afternoon classes. I make my way over to Sara's first class to pick up her books, considering she left them behind in her embarrassed rush to get out. While I'm there, I learn the remains of her clothes had been gathered and disposed of by the school janitor. I'd rather not have to deal with that woman and try to explain why I want Sara's useless, ruined clothes... but at the same time, who even checks the trash to make sure everything is still there? I may be able to get away with teleporting that stuff out later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I depart from the classroom and approach Sara's locker for the rest of her things, I'm again met by Yasmin. \"Don't you have enough money to not have to steal things from other people's lockers?\" she snidely asks. God she seems unknowingly eager to test my patience today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not stealing, I'm retrieving my friend's homework so I can hand it in for her today. How about you do me a big favor, Yasmin, and <i>can</i> the bad attitude towards me before I do something we may both regret.\" I turn towards Yasmin and reply coldly, letting slip a bit of the power my voice alone can exude to hopefully drive home the point while also at least trying to show some respect to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I? Just because you've the entire school wrapped around your little finger doesn't mean <i>I</i> need to follow along like a good little fucking sheep!\" she retorts defiantly. Does she even listen to the bile she spews out of her mouth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T GIVE A FLYING HOOTHOOT ABOUT THAT!\" I roar back at her, loosing the full power behind my voice. The hallway shakes a little from it, as though a minor earthquake hit just as I was speaking. \"I've had just about enough of your unprovoked insults and ill-founded accusations! Show some respect to others, and they might show some back. Hell, you might even learn to <i>like</i> them!\" and with that, I turn my back to Yasmin and unlock Sara's locker to retrieve her homework, then lock it up again and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really doesn't take me long to get Sara's homework to her teachers, and afterward gather my books for my next classes. This time, so I'm not potentially distracted, I try to change her pituitary so it won't release any more growth hormone into her system right now. I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but I still want her to realistically be able to get out later. I take my seat in each class and try to learn what they're trying to teach. Even English, which still practically bores me to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bell rings, signifying the end of the school day. Davis joins me at our lockers, and then follows me to the nurse's office, having to jog a bit to keep up. Honestly I didn't think I was moving all that fast. I noticed Yasmin tailing along suspiciously, so... <i>conveniently</i> she loses us to a moment's distraction, thinking she heard someone call her name. For what I plan to do, I don't need her to get in the way... again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't bother waiting for a response from the other side as I opened the door to find Sara... still 7'5\", and still completely naked. \"Where's the nurse?\" I ask as my blonde friend covers her more private areas with her arms and hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know. The nurse left and never came back since...\" Sara answers. She turns her attention to Davis and roars, her face turning beet red, \"STOP STARING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, like I haven't seen a huge, naked woman before, Sara...\" Davis retorts sarcastically, yet with a hint of teasing. Now where could he have seen such a thing - Oh. Right. Me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, the janitor tossed your clothes in the trash. Here, I can at least restore your panties.\" I say, willing her panties back around her pelvis and for more material to fill it out so it can comfortably fit around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's hand moves away from between her legs to now help cover her nipples with her other hand. \"Just... just restore and put those in the washing machine at home. Can we go now? I've been... terribly uncomfortable in here all day.\" she states, somewhat impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, and teleport her stuff out of the garbage, then the three of us out of the building. I certainly didn't want to spend much longer in there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us appear just outside Sara's place moments later, and her restored clothes, minus her heels, appear in her family's washing machine as per her request. It's not a big place, in fact it's just a one story home, but I kind of like its relative simplicity. Her parents aren't home right now, which saves me from having to explain why their daughter is currently a foot taller than when they last saw her and clad only in her panties. I may also have to inform them I'm a goddess while I'm at it, and I'm unsure if I <i>want</i> to do that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe head inside, using my powers to unlock the door, and Sara heads to her room to pick out a new outfit. Now that we're out of the school, I attempt to allow my blonde friend's pituitary to resume periodically flooding her body with growth hormones I had denied earlier. That's when something unexpectedly yanks the controls of it away from me, and sets the gland to immediately unload far more hormones than ever before! \"What the?!\" I exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rush into Sara's room... only to have the door close behind me. \"Hello Megan. You're just in time for the show to start.\" I hear her say from behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner does Sara finish speaking than her body begins to ascend once more. And this time, I get the sense it's going to be huge. She lightly pushes me onto her bed, and I stare as she stands by her door, her bare feet sliding across the carpet. Her long, smooth, sexy legs stretch ever longer, the bones within cracking and popping with their increasing mass. In fact, I can subtly hear all of her bones doing this now that I'm so close to her. She moans softly as her panties, the only thing she's actually wearing, dig into her once more as her hips and ass swell along with the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch with wide eyes as my friend caresses her expanding body with her equally lengthening hands. They stroke her taut, toned abdomen slowly, inches added to her frame as she goes. Her blue eyes close once again as with one final hurrah, her panties fail and snap apart, leaving her nude yet again. \"Hey... I-I just restored those for you not even ten minutes ago!\" I stammer, even if my eyes are transfixed on her groping her own enlarging breasts in ways most guys at school can only dream of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... Oops! Sorry!\" Sara replies, her voice just a touch deeper in her still growing body, in a way that strongly suggests she's not sorry at all. Her shoulders broaden further, supporting her lengthening arms. Her golden blonde head bumps into the ceiling, but she sensually giggles and allows her knees to gradually bend, keeping her head firmly against the drywall ceiling. A glance down at her erect, growing nipples and between her legs suggests she's... aroused by this? Granted, that might be from the sheer load of hormones flooding her bloodstream right now. I try to covertly regain control of the situation, only to find I'm utterly shut out of her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it seems her pituitary's finally relenting on its surge, for Sara's growth concludes about a moment later. I'm left facing my now huge, naked friend lustfully panting as she apparently calms down from what she just went through. Her massive 11'8\" body is drenched in sweat while the carpet beneath her is drenched in... other stuff which I promptly remove with my powers. \"Ooh... Wasn't that amazing, Megan? Look at me! I'm fucking huge!\" she remarks, \"Although I would have loved to have kept growing there... No matter, I'm sure I'll grow again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my... what have I done to Sara? H-have I made a monster out of my best friend?</span></div></div>",

But whatever it is, I think I like it too much to simply let it go...\" Sara replies almost lustfully, still standing (well, hunched rather, given she's up against the 8 foot high ceiling of her room) in front of the door to physically bar my way, \"I've waited millennia for this... just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? M-millennia?! Does she mean to imply that she too is an ancient being that has been reborn in modern times? But I remember seeing into both Sara and Davis' minds Friday night, before I was fully whole again... If Sara was anything like me, her mindscape would surely seem way different even then! Unless... unless I was tricked, or this is whatever is possessing my friend doing the talking. \"Whatever you are, let go of my friend, now!\" I demand, even dropping any attempt to hide the reverberation of power in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara laughs ominously as she bends forward even more towards me still sitting on her bed and says, \"Oh, I can assure you that there are no strings on me. No one's got their hand up my ass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words chill me even further. If there's nothing possessing the nearly 12 foot blonde I've called my friend for years now... then Sara must truly be far older than I've ever realized. I try my best to ignore what I'm seeing to peer back into my earliest memories, those being of my original self millennia ago. The one from when I spoke to my head priest and informed the early humans that they no longer needed my guidance (if I'm honest, they probably never truly needed it) comes to mind, among many, many others such as when I first encountered the early humans. My original life alone probably encompasses several modern life spans, which probably explains why I have difficulty remembering it all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, I was fucking <i>old</i> already when I encountered the early humans. Maybe I'm not so far off from the xel'naga...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Having fun peering back through your memories, Megan?</i> I hear Sara ask telepathically, scaring the crap out of me. <i>Wondering why you don't remember a being as powerful as yourself being around when you were originally?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? H-how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I doubt you'd remember me then, as I wasn't around yet... You abandoned the early humans who worshiped you like the goddess you are, girl. Whether you meant to or not, you abandoned them, and they felt lost. So while you stayed dormant, being reborn in a new form who-knows-where, those people performed a ritual in the hopes they could call you back to them so they could bask in your light.</i> Sara explains telepathically, <i>I was meant to be a host body for you. I was willing to do it for their sake. Suffice to say, they were sadly disappointed with what I became, as I wasn't you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara is about to continue when there's a knock on her door. \"Sara? Megan? What's going on in there?\" I hear Davis ask from the other side. Though his voice is muffled somewhat by the door, and the towering figure in front of it with her hips and ass near the top of the door frame, possibly even higher if her legs were straight, I can still hear the concern in his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I wonder what my so-called friend intends to do about this situation. She can't telepathically reassure Davis, as then he'll know something is very wrong. If she tries to verbally tell him nothing's happening here in her room, he's likely to pick up on her deeper voice and guess she's gotten much bigger. Would she simply come out and reveal herself in her full, naked glory to the guy she earlier demanded not to stare at her? If so, was said demand merely to fool him and I back at school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it's not like there's much even my boyfriend can do to stop her plans, whatever they may be. Sara appears to recognize this as well, and seems to concentrate on something before I feel some unseen force bar all the doors and windows. \"Sorry, Davis, but you are not going anywhere. Feel free to help yourself to anything you'd like to eat, though.\" she replies simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, M-Megan? This isn't funny...\" Davis says from the other side of the door. I can only imagine what's going on in the rest of this house. Normally, it's rather inviting, with a few family photos strewn about. Sara's beautiful 6 foot tall mother Clara, her 6'9\" bulldozer of a father Rick, and... a girl I've yet to meet who I've been told is Sara's older sister Audrey. I shudder to think if they're both like... like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I know it, I'm teleported out to next to Davis. I have to admit, I am terrified right now for what's going on... but no matter what happens, I will not allow my boyfriend to be harmed. \"Er, y-yeah... about that... I'm not doing any of this. Sara is... somehow.\" I tell him as we move into the living room, trying to find a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know. She's claiming to be a ghost from after my first life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First life?\" Davis questions, just before he catches on to what I mean, \"Wait, you mean to tell me she dates back to after your original body as a titanic goddess died?\" I nod. \"...holy shit. I think you might have stirred up a hornet's nest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Captain Obvious...\" I reply, voice dripping with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple hours, we try to find a way out of this place, running from the nice and organized kitchen to the huge master bedroom and trying every door or window. Not one of them budge in the slightest. I can't help but wonder what she wants with us. And if this is truly my fault this is happening. My stomach soon grumbles, followed by Davis', so I guess we should have something... though surely Sara would be starving what with having grown so much and not having lunch, wouldn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh don't worry, Megan. I'm not particularly hungry... yet.</i> Sara laughs in my head, leaving me all the more unsettled. She's clearly got something planned, but she's not divulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Davis and I've prepared what we were going to charitably call dinner. This is perhaps the farthest thing from a romantic dinner one can possibly get, but I frankly don't care about that, and seriously doubt my boyfriend does either. Filling our bellies is top priority, followed by trying to figure out a means of escape. The latter may seem hopeless, but it gives us something to do other than wallow in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as we finish scarfing down our less than spectacular meal, a door down the hall opens, and something <i>big</i> comes stomping down the hall. Sara is on the move. Her heavy footsteps thunder through the house, and in the darkness of the halls, I can see her glowing softly blue eyes catch mine for a moment. A smile spreads on her huge face for a moment before she moves on into the living room, where she's not really able to stand up any better in there than her room. \"I-I'm going to guess that her story might be true...\" Davis stammers, frightened, yet undeniably... a bit aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of that has to do with her tight outfit, which with a mischievous wink, starts to tear immediately as she's required to crouch more and more... She's growing again, and from the looks of it, she knows how large this spurt will make her. Her tank top and shorts practically look painted on in the places they've yet to tear as, even sitting, her golden blonde head inches towards the ceiling. The wall between the rooms vanishes, giving me and Davis a full, unobstructed view of her expanding form. And given the points protruding from her top, she had also decided to forgo underwear entirely for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe behold as Sara's feet lengthen, along with her legs, and begin slowly pushing her family's coffee table aside like it's nothing. I can hear her bones pop, and the sound of her flesh sliding along the carpet in all directions. Her legs are already longer than most men are tall, and they're only getting longer. Her swelling hips and ass soon bring about her shorts' demise in a dramatic rip that makes me suspect she's somehow playing up the effects of her failing clothes. (I'm not questioning how she got a barely fitting set of clothes, the glowing eyes tell me all I really need to know)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tank top is faring little better as her enlarging breasts consume more and more space within it, competing with her widening shoulders and abdomen. Sara moans... a little more loudly than she really needed to as the fabric eventually gives way right down the middle, freeing her DD-cup boobs from their confinement, and with a playful shrug leaving her once again nude. In response to this, she crosses her ever-lengthening legs in front of her to keep that area out of view, but doesn't seem to do... anything about her breasts. Odd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's ascent begins to slow and then stop when her head is but a few inches from the ceiling. \"So this is what being 14'11\" feels like...\" she comments, and Davis and I can make out the unmistakable reverberation of power within her own voice. It's not quite like mine, but it's definitely there. It's entirely possible this is because it's only beginning with her. \"I don't think I can stand up at all now!\" she adds in a tone that's something of a mix between lustful want and mischievous intent. I feel like it should be hinting at her intentions, but so far I can't figure out what that might be. I really don't know what to do here, considering she is my friend...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once more, I try to get into Sara's head. And once more, I hit the mental equivalent of a brick wall in my attempt. For years, I've known my best friend to be strong-willed, and even a bit stubborn on some matters. They're but a couple of traits I admire in the blonde beauty I've been friends with since kindergarten. But this is taking things to a whole different, almost ridiculous level! \"Come on, Sara... please... let me fix this for you.\" I plead, desperate to undo what my actions had unintentionally unleashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't fix this, Megan, but that's all right.\" Sara replies simply, the reverberation of power still evident in her voice, \"I want this. And I want to do what I have planned, though I'll keep you and Davis here in the dark about what my plans entail... for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy practically 15 foot friend smiles, glowing blue eyes and all, but all I can do is shudder with worry. Sara is clearly toying with us. Does she want revenge on me for abandoning the early humans who worshiped me so long ago? Didn't she see, via my memories, how it pained me to make that decision? If she remembers, I even said yesterday that I had messed up! I had intended to return every now and again to check on them, but in my error, I was unable to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, how about we do our homework for now?\" Davis suggests, \"We may as well try to keep busy while we wait for Sara to be ready to reveal her master plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to argue that we should be trying once again to find some way out of here when I recognized the futility of doing so. The very definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, after all. Plus, stopping Sara wouldn't be any easier outside than in here, so it makes sense to simply wait and see. \"Yeah, I guess... and perhaps a game or two after that.\" I respond, nodding reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy boyfriend and I climb over Sara's huge legs, which is easier said than done with them crossed in front of her, to get to our backpacks that contain our homework for the day. The giant blonde tucks her legs to her body, almost like an upright fetal position, before we turn to head back and get started on it, which at least makes things easier. The wall between the living room and kitchen reappears, and I hear the washing machine kicking in on its own in the laundry room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe work away at our homework soon afterward, occasionally glancing at Sara to see what she's up to. Every time we do, she smiles and waves at me or Davis. We finish our assignments for the day by the time I hear the washing machine finish and the dryer start, so we kill some time by trying out this game called the Special Land of the Dragon: Shattering Future, based on a story of the same name. In some ways, it reminds me of our current predicament, though Sara's definitely not a cyborg... as far as I can tell, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later, Sara announces, \"Now, my friends, witness the next step in my plans! This is going to be <i>big</i>!\" and with that, she raises her hands to the ceiling over her head and braces herself as she begins to grow. Davis and I watch as she crouches down more and more, letting her enormous, expanding breasts hang freely from her chest, her golden blonde hair cascading down along either side of her face and past her widening shoulders, while her creamy, ever-broader back begins to press into the ceiling. Her unrelenting figure brings drywall and wood crashing down around her, yet it completely avoids Davis and I without me having to will it to. The sound of splintering wood plays with the sound of Sara's bones cracking as they gain ever more mass like a duet most would rather not be hearing... yet we've front row seats to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i> is your plan?!\" Davis asks in disbelief, \"Outgrowing your own <i>home</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara giggles as her head breaches the attic, the river of gold slipping up into the hole in the ceiling she just created as she continues to rise, and replies, \"Only the most obvious part of it, Davis. Haven't you ever watched Attack of the 50 ft Woman before? This is a classic element!\" She thrashes the rest of the ceiling with her lengthening arms, clearing more room for herself as she begins to stand in earnest. I can see her feet sliding across the debris-covered carpet without care as to what they run into in their expansion, as well as her long, smooth legs stretching longer and higher with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever is left of the living room ceiling fades out of existence, allowing me and Davis the ability to see Sara's entire giant, naked body pressing against the roof of her home. Her huge kneecaps advance towards us as she bends her knees, her growth not relenting in the slightest, bracing for the moment of freedom. Above, her big blue eyes' glow illuminates the darkness, showing her swelling head is indeed right up into the peak of the roof... If her transformation was anything like my awakening, then she's very clearly playing this up for dramatics, waiting for the right moment to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment soon comes. With one almighty heave, Sara straightens her legs and breaks the roof apart as though it were made of paper mache, her body soon widening the hole she made as she ascends further into the deep red of the evening sky. Her curvy hips and ass break past the roof line before, at last, her growth concludes. However, she brings her arms together and hammers the rest of the roof around her apart. \"Huh. I was kind of hoping that 25'5\" would be enough to simply step out of this house...\" the golden blonde giantess remarks before shrugging shoulders the width of a basketball player's height, \"Oh well. This is still awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the house in ruins, I shout, \"What possible reason could you have to wreck your home like this? You're not freaking Wreck-It Ralph! You are no friend of mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught her attention. \"Oh Megan...\" she starts, \"I think I've played this charade long enough. It is time for the final act!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can react, Sara dives her huge hands into the remains of her family's living room, picking me up like a doll. The glow of her eyes seems to turn ominous, and even her hair blowing in the wind, the light playing with it like a cat playing with a string, does little to ease my... well, <i>uneasiness</i>. Still, her body is just as magnificent as ever, the proportions entirely unchanged, just many times larger. \"So let me guess. Now you destroy me, claim my power as your own, and then conquer the world. All for your revenge. Before you do the deed, I want to know why wait until now to do this, and why involve Davis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Nice guess.\" Sara answers, \"Too bad it's so totally and utterly incorrect.\" and before I could ask, she shoves me between her massive boobs and hugs me like a child hugs a teddy bear, catching me entirely off guard. From what I can glimpse of her face, she's... <i>smiling</i>? With my powers, I can sense that my boyfriend is feeling the same thing I am at the moment in the giantess' embrace, just shy of having the life squeezed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dryer buzzer goes off, and Sara finally relents on her hug. \"And now... my plans are... complete! Thank you, and goodnight!\" she announces, setting me down onto what remains of the roof with the same level of care one would an egg and then taking a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now I'm confused. All of this... was an <i>act</i>? I can feel Sara's barriers on all the exits dispersing, which from the huge hole she created, I witness Davis taking advantage of to get out with both our things. I start to focus on her clothes when I feel her suppress it. \"I can handle this, Megan.\" she says. Indeed, I watch as her bra and panties appear, gaining enough material to properly fit before finally covering her body. Her outfit from this morning follows suit, at last rendering her fully clothed, though as usual, said clothes leave little of her curves to the imagination. Finally, I see her rise about a foot taller as her favorite set of heels adorn her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teleport down to where my boyfriend is standing outside just before Sara wades through her house to get out. I will the building to repair itself just enough that it still stands for now. \"So... what's the truth, Sara?\" Davis asks curiously, \"Are you even Sara? Is your sister... like this, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant blonde takes a few steps towards us and kneels. \"Audrey's as normal as an aspiring florist can be. And while in a way I'm far older than her, I'm still calling her my older sister.\" Sara responds, \"I'm Sara Mars, and I'm a demigoddess. I was born to the early humans that had worshiped Megan until she left them. They felt lost without her, and some even felt she had callously abandoned them. Eventually, the head priest believed he found a ritual of sorts that could channel their goddess into a willing vessel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were to be that vessel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I volunteered, believing it to be worth my life to call her back. However, we couldn't have known that Megan's soul already resided within another girl somewhere. So I ended up becoming a demigoddess, a being almost as powerful, but... they were disappointed that I wasn't what they had hoped for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sara had mostly told me the truth, then. \"I'm so sorry...\" I apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I mean, I would've never met my best friend if this never happened, I gained some new experiences including an old one thanks to all that's happened, and... I did get you back for messing with my body.\" Sara replies, sticking her tongue out teasingly on the latter point, \"Come now. You didn't really think I would buy the same story you gave Yasmin, did you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Um, no, I didn't.\" I admit to my friend Sara, before adding something I just realized, \"But I'm almost willing to bet you knew the truth before Yasmin showed up and make things just a bit more difficult... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara giggles lightly before she responds, \"Well if we're coming completely clean, then... yes. I didn't realize right away, but you just so happening to be almost right outside the classroom door definitely clued me in that you were up to something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're... just going to totally let this blow over, Megan? How can we trust Sara?\" Davis interrupts, looking up towards our still giant blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I <i>want</i> to trust her, Davis.\" I answer simply, \"You trusted me the other day after my... revelation, so I don't see why I shouldn't do the same for my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara nods, before looking back at her home which she had very recently waded through, none too gently I might add. \"...Oh right. I uh... I guess I kind of made a bit of a mess that needs cleaning up before my parents come home...\" she mutters, chuckling nervously, \"Didn't really think that part through all too well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI concentrate, and gradually piece the house back together with my powers. Wooden joists and studs reform as though watching a film on their destruction in reverse, returning to their original positions in the walls and ceilings, while drywall follows them and covers them up once more. Materials mend themselves as though a 25'5\" girl (closer to 27 feet with her heels) hadn't smashed her way through her own home. A pretty impressive display, if I do say so myself. An obvious priority for me is ensuring the electrical wiring is as it's supposed to be, as a fridge or stove without power are about as helpful as giant paperweights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I finish, the sun had almost fully set below the horizon, with the moon and first few stars of the night sky being visible now. The blue glow from Sara's eyes act as somewhat faint spotlights, currently going between me and Davis and the driveway. It doesn't take much effort at all to guess my demigoddess best friend expects her parents to come home any minute now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan that's going to take some getting used to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI allow my eyes to glow green before having myself grow. This time, as I feel my mass quickly increase, I will my clothes to change size with me. It feels rather odd to have the fabric of my shirt slide against my expanding skin, yet not getting any tighter. It's also a relief that I can do this, as ripping out of my clothes gets old after awhile and I'd really rather not end up in the nude in the modern times too often. My muscles tense and relax as they expand within my body, yet never altering my already nicely athletically fit physique. (I'm not into the bodybuilder look) The bones in my body provide minor discomfort as they're stretched to ever-increasing lengths, but it helps a little to distract the sensations triggered as my bra and panties slide against... <i>sensitive</i> spots where they cover under my outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after I started growing, Sara quickly snatches Davis from the ground with her hands, spooking my boyfriend. \"You might be safer with me, Davis, until Megan's done.\" she explains, adding, \"And don't either of you dare think of me like that. The last thing I want to do is give any form of justification or truth to Yasmin's ridiculous claims about me being some sort of slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, um, noted...\" my boyfriend squeaks in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy growth continues, and I study how my Converse shoes gradually cover more and more ground to keep pace with my feet expanding inside them. I... really don't want to think too hard on where all the extra material for this is coming from, to be honest. My pants continue to stretch the increasing length of my legs perfectly, the waist embracing my widening (yet still proportionately unchanged) hips comfortably even if the material itself rubs against my skin... less comfortably. I'll try to keep that in mind for next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI end my growth standing an impressive 25'4\", four times my previous size. It's nowhere near as vast as my default size, but I don't really want to be <i>that</i> big right now. \"I'm done for now. You can set Davis down now, Sara.\" I announce, not bothering to muffle the reverberation of power in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second, my friend.\" Sara giggles before lurching higher herself. I can see my boyfriend blush deeply while in our friend's expanding grip, the skin of her fingers sliding against his somewhat skinny, bare arms, just before she stops at what I would guess is 25'8\" without her heels on. With them, she's probably 27 feet tall. Instead of setting my boyfriend down on the ground, the blonde giantess closes the distance between us and gently sets him on my shoulder. \"You didn't say <i>where</i> to set him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, but why the little growth spurt?\" I ask curiously, \"And why were you blushing, Davis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just evening us out...\" Sara answers, smiling, \"It's a little weird to be holding someone while growing, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I suppose I'm a bit worried, here. Both of you are extremely powerful, but... am I going to somehow manifest some ancient power and a past life I didn't even know about?\" Davis responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I'm the only one I know of to have ever gone through the ritual, the odds of you being more than meets the eye are... I want to say three thousand, seven-hundred twenty to one against. Or about as likely as me getting the role of Titania Girl for the movie they're making now without cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then that means I'm by far the most worthless one here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" I state firmly, \"A person's worth isn't something that can be measured with anything tangible. You, Sara, and my family are by far my greatest treasures, and have been long before my reawakening. No amount of money or power can replace you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis smiles at this, though I somehow doubt this has entirely eased his concerns, if he's expressed all of them. I could peer into his mind and discover his worries for myself, but that's a boundary I really do not want to cross with anyone, much less my boyfriend. I didn't even do it with the early humans, and I'm not about to start now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, how about we head back inside before my parents come home? I don't want to screw with their perception and think their daughter's always been a towering giant, but I also don't want to try and explain all of this tonight...\" Sara suggests after a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, how about Megan's place instead? That way neither of you have to shrink if you don't want, and there's already plenty of space. Plus her family already knows about her, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've no objections if she doesn't, bud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother night of having my friends over at my place? I'd have to be crazy to decline! \"Then it's settled. We'll head over to my place, but we'll walk this time. I don't know about either of you, but I'd like to have <i>some</i> semblance of normalcy right about now.\" I announce. Neither of my friends object to this, so Sara and I begin the journey after I remove Davis from my shoulder to carry him gently in my arms. My blonde friend pauses for a second to turn back to her home, then rejoins me on our walk. I assume that was to make sure everything inside is back to how it should be and the doors locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur tremendously long strides make what would otherwise be an unreasonably long trek on foot into a rather nice little stroll. I occasionally glance down towards my arms to ensure my boyfriend is faring well, as I want Davis to feel safe. A few people notice me and Sara passing by, but don't give us a second thought. Why would they when they believe two young giantesses with glowing eyes in the city are perfectly normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrive at my place by around 11 o'clock at night, my parents, Beverly, and Alfred coming out just as I set Davis down on the ground. \"Megan Allerson, where HAVE you been?!\" my mother yells, \"Goddess or not, we were all worried sick about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Davis and I went over to Sara's place to watch some of the Titania Girl cartoon after school once we did our homework. We... kind of lost track of time and I had forgotten to let you know where I was. I'm sorry I made you guys worry.\" I answer apologetically, hoping they accept my story. I hate having to lie to them, but I didn't want them to worry more than they already are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... We should discipline you, but instead we'll let it go just this once. Next time, call us to let us know you're safe.\" my mother says, her face softening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Miss Megan? Why is Miss Sara so large?\" Alfred inquires, noticing my blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara and I look to each other and silently nod before I turn back to my family and reply sheepishly, \"Because she wants to be right now. Sara's a demigoddess, born from the early humans that I once watched over. It's a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care for a demonstration?\" Sara offers, letting her voice reverberate with the power at her command, her blue eyes still aglow. Kind of like the typical depiction of energy technology employed by khalai protoss now that I think of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, thank you, I believe we can all take Miss Megan's word for it...\" Alfred declines, as politely as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, my family heads back inside, and Davis follows them in after I bid him goodnight. My demigoddess friend and I summon a pair of sleeping bags appropriately sized for us and almost instantly change into our pajamas. \"Thanks for covering for what I put you and Davis through. It was fun, and tricky, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. What are friends for, right?\" I reassure my friend, \"Your eye glow being blue... it's a nod to the protoss, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... Actually I just went with it because my eyes are blue, just as yours are green, but I guess that works too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe bid each other goodnight and fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days have passed since the events of Monday, and things have settled into a surprising normalcy. The big thing was that Sara and I agreed to give the world a break from the use of our powers for awhile. It was actually Davis that suggested it. My blonde friend even got herself caught up on the lessons she missed from Monday on Tuesday without using her powers! Boys were all too happy to lend one of the hottest girls in school their notes. She returned them the next day, to the boys' disappointment. Though she gave a slight nod to Austin, whose notes were possibly the most helpful out of all the ones she had received to help her get caught up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin, of course, continued to prove herself an annoyance during this time, claiming her usual lies and false rumors. One of these days, I'm going to have to find out what constantly pisses on her Corn Flakes every morning... Where does her nasty attitude even <i>come from</i>? Granted, she does seem to be easing off these a little bit, so maybe she's questioned her own words a tiny bit since Monday?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Thursday, Sara and I finally broke the news to her parents. Clara mused she always thought her youngest daughter was special, though this wasn't what she meant. Rick... I had never seen the 6'9\" bulldozer of a man so utterly shocked in my modern life. Nor had Sara, for that matter. Yet, like my own folks, they too ultimately accepted it, their love for their daughter winning out over any fears they may have. My friend promised her parents to inform her sister Audrey when she saw her next, so we've that to consider for next week or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is Davis' birthday, and, fortunately, also a Saturday. I say fortunate because if it had fallen on a weekday, I would be sorely tempted to make it like a national holiday, and thus a day off school. Sara and I had barred him from getting anywhere near his home while everyone prepares for the party, though I did let him take a very generous selection of games with him for this time, including that Special Land of the Dragon: Shattering Future game we were playing the other day. Currently, the two of us are setting up the decorations over the sliding door on the back of the house, with Mary Keck guiding us where precisely to put them. She wants things to be perfect for her son's birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we're at it, I can't help but giggle slightly as Todd Keck passes between Sara's legs, both of them glad she chose to wear her short shorts today instead of a skirt to avoid seeing her panties. Davis' father is not a short man, in fact he's about average height, but as both Sara and I are at least 19 feet tall right now, (she's a few inches taller, plus a foot factoring her heels in) he can pass under her without trouble. \"Hey, Megan? Have either you or Sara seen the latest fashion photos featuring Sonia Enders?\" he asks, the mouth-watering birthday cake he's making for his son's birthday now in the oven to bake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the one she's sitting among those mountains? Or the one where she's looming over a city?\" I ask in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those.\" Todd confirms, \"I don't know if you girls follow her or not, but she definitely knows how to use Photoshop and extremely realistic lighting to model outfits, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was definitely a signature of Sonia's, though oddly, supposedly every modeling agency she's ever worked for has sworn to absolute secrecy on how they come up with these pictures. Maybe they have her do a photo shoot in a toy town like they do for those old kaiju movies? Who knows? \"Honey...\" Mary says, in that exasperated tone that clearly suggests she's not interested in him talking about a younger woman than her. Not that she has to worry, since I'm pretty sure Sonia's got a boyfriend she's smitten with. \"Try to stay focused on our son's birthday preparations, and not on your dream girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's so hard <i>not</i> to focus on my dream girl! I've been happily married to her for nearly 30 years!\" Todd replies sweetly, \"Anyway, I need to run to the store and grab a couple things. I'd appreciate it if someone can just make sure the cake doesn't burn while I'm out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll take care of it, dear.\" Mary nods, before watching her husband get in his truck and drive off to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the three of us had told Davis' parents that I'm a goddess and Sara's a demigoddess respectfully, not wanting them left out of the loop because we didn't want to have to lie and keep this a secret from them, and they took it... probably the best out of all of our folks. So while we were still hanging decorations, I ask Sara, \"Do you remember if any of the people from the tribes I once watched survived? Apart from yourself, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence, Sara responds, \"There weren't many of us left by the time I was old enough to actually remember anything clearly... but I do remember the head priest saying that they continued to honor your final wishes, honoring the decision of those wishing to leave. I think that in this way, your influence spread across the globe, as many did indeed part ways with the tribe, and perhaps spread your teachings to those they met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think humans ever truly needed me. You know that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not about need. If nothing else, I'm sure they at least spread your tale, and while the world has forgotten since then...\" Sara glances at Mary Keck as she slips inside to check on the cake, \"Perhaps Davis' folks are distant descendants of those who felt inspired by your tale? Or, I don't know, maybe they're just more willing to accept us because we've been friends with Davis for ages, and know you've been sweet on each other since you literally ran into each other when he was six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggle softly as I reflect back on that memory. The Kecks had just moved in, and my parents had me come along to greet them. Oh, how I resisted, literally kicking and screaming as I was dragged out of the mansion. I wasn't interested in meeting a bunch of boring grown-ups! Not to mention I was forced into an adorable little frilly pink dress for the occasion. I also had to be dragged out of the limo once we arrived, much to my parents' chagrin. First chance I got, I bolted from their side in order to find <i>something</i> of interest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, I literally ran right into that something of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the present, I find myself no longer at my boyfriend's place, but at Sara's, feeling awfully cramped inside their living room as I'm still 19 feet tall. Something squirms underneath my butt, followed by a muffled, yet unmistakable, voice yelling desperately, \"Get your god-ass off of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, I shrink down to my typical human size of 6'4\" and jump to my feet, then check to make sure Davis is unharmed. \"Oh my! I'm so sorry!\" I apologize, still a bit confused as to why I'm here, at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Megan. I saved my game, so no harm done!\" Davis jests lightly, \"So... what's up? What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to thinking about how we first met, and... well, I suppose my heart wants to hear your side again.\" I answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he nods, \"It was 12 years ago today, and my family had just finished moving in to the neighborhood, which didn't make for a great birthday. I didn't know anyone here, and... I was kind of scared of meeting others. Eventually, I decided to drag myself out and say hello... only to crash into a pink blur. And what did this girl say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! I'm sorry, I... Oh! Uh... h-hi...\" I answer, imitating my younger self of this modern life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I half-expected you to start crying, but you gave me a huge surprise when I showed you some of my games. To this day I've never had a girl kick my ass so thoroughly in Super Smash Bros! And then you stole one of my shirts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I couldn't take my dress off, so I went with the next best thing. Besides, I returned it the next day. That dress did make a nice addition to that bonfire, though. I've no shame in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis and I chat for over two hours, in between playing some games, before Sara telepathically contacts us. <i>Hey, are you two lovebirds ready to come back here for the party?</i> she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How did you know I'd be here? Did you send me here?</i> I ask back in my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara responds, <i>I remembered that we left him there until we were ready, and just guessed you'd be with him. Please tell me you didn't accidentally sit on our friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEr... Okay, I won't. We'll be over in a few minutes.</i> I reply, and then ask Davis, \"Well? Are we ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if I'm no longer barred from my own home.\" he replies with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh, and teleport us both to just outside his home, out of sight of the guests. Upon Davis and I walking into the back yard, everyone happily shouts to him, \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just a small party, with only about 8 people including Austin, Chad, Cassie, Joshua, Wendy, and me, Sara, and Davis himself, but he likes it like this. Sometimes, it's just the three of us. Anyway, Davis blows out the candles on his cake after a minute, possibly struggling to come up with something to wish for, and then we all have ourselves a slice of delicious cake. Even Sara, who's still triple her normal size, with Cassie, who's always longed to be giant despite being an already impressive 6'4\", looking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresents get opened next. He comes to Sara's present eventually, intentionally avoiding mine, and says upon unwrapping it, \"Splatoon Amiibos! But I already have these...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Sara roars, \"Davis Keck, you are so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kidding! I've been looking for these for awhile now, so thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch with anticipation as my boyfriend at last gets to my present. \"Oh wow... the Warlords of Dreanor expansion, and a three month subscription gift card! Thank you, Megan! I love you!\" he exclaims, right before we lovingly embrace. I'm positive that this has been the best birthday ever for him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, I explore the weird as hell landscape of my mind, going over my past lives' memories while my body slept, cuddled up with Davis. I would've invited him in, but he seemed exhausted after his birthday, so I let him be. But yeah, apparently, I was closer to the early humans that had worshiped me than anyone realized in my first mortal life. If I had been chosen for the head priest's ritual to bring me back, odds are good they would've succeeded. But no, the girl who'd eventually be known as Sara got picked instead, though she really didn't do a bad job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue to live out this memory when the demigoddess herself turns to look directly at me. \"Oh! You were still with us after all, Megan!\" she says, in perfect English. I could list the level of wrong this constitutes, but I'll summarize it with the fact that the English language, as we know it in modern times, won't be invented for at least another millennia from this time period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara, why are you messing around in my memories?\" I ask, returning to my mind's landscape, seeing my blonde friend standing near me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got curious and poked my head in. I didn't know that would happen!\" Sara replies. \"Anyway, want to come over into my head? It's had some... <i>redecorating</i> since you poked in there over a week ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure.\" I nod, and we soon find ourselves in very different scenery. Stacks of comic books are everywhere, guarded by huge teddy bears. This isn't new. What's new is the addition of pieces from varying time periods, including a few eerily familiar pieces. A locked door is also present. I recognize it as a representation of the doorway to my friend's bodily functions... like her pituitary. Perhaps that's why it looks like a bank vault door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you're not getting in there again.\" Sara explains, apparently still a little bit sore from the time when I messed with her body, and unintentionally paved the way for her own reawakening. Yeah, we've pretty much put that behind us, and I've learned a valuable lesson to be careful when I go using my powers to mess with people, but I can see why my friend would want to keep me out. \"My other half was excited about becoming active while you were, Megan, so, uh...\" Sara hugs me, and I of course reciprocate. Feeling our boobs squish against one another is... er, <i>something else</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we may have been together a few times in our past lives. Might be fun to check out later.\" I say as we end the hug. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, actually. It's Yasmin. Why does she hate us? It's been gnawing away at me for a while now...\" Sara replies with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not changing her personality. We've gotta draw the line somewhere.\" I calmly remind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wasn't thinking of that.\" Sara nods in acknowledgment. \"But surely you've wondered what her deal is at least once. I want to understand her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really dislike Yasmin, due in part to her accusations that I've the school wrapped around my little finger with my family's wealth, which is entirely wrong, and I'd use my powers if I must to ensure it. But what really infuriates me, what really tempts me to turn Yasmin into a puddle of goo, is her calling Sara a horny slut who would fuck anything that moves. Yes, my best friend's sexy, and certainly enjoys being at least near the center of attention, (I've seen her put up to three books in her rack before) but she's no slut! However, despite all this, I'm really curious why she feels this way. Maybe my impression of her was wrong? If so, then why does she insist on the same old tropes she should know by now we don't fit in? \"Well I was gonna see eventually... We'll discus it with Davis in the morning, first.\" I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, <i>now</i>.\" Sara insists. \"This way, we might find out more about Yasmin than if we wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can even begin to raise an argument, Sara makes Davis appear in front of us. His hazel eyes tiredly open as he asks, \"Alright, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to explore the mystery of why Yasmin Foxworth is so unpleasant.\" I explain with a sigh of resignation. \"I wanted to wait until morning, but Sara...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wants to go over it now. Figures.\" Davis sighs tiredly, knowing Sara's strong will, and even downright stubbornness, is very hard to deter. Especially now that she can do virtually anything herself. \"I guess that makes sense, given that not one of us knows when Yasmin wakes up in the morning, and it would be best to start just before she does wake up, to get every possible bit of information you can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you agree with me, then?\" Sara inquires expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In some ways, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even know where Yasmin lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I...\" Sara starts confidently, only for that confidence to fade. \"...haven't the foggiest clue. Crap.\" she admits, slouching as the proverbial wind is taken from her sails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we wouldn't be getting in without our powers even if we <i>did</i> know where she lived anyway.\" I add pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. So, since you'd have to be using them anyway, wouldn't it make sense to just tap into her memories with your powers?\" Davis suggests. \"It would certainly give you the full answer, like looking into a game's code.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy boyfriend has a point, here. We might not find out why Yasmin hates us just by following her around for the day, and reading her memories would be a far more direct approach. Thing is... I'm kind of scared we might awaken something within her. Silly, I know, but considering it's happened once already, with my best friend, I really want to avoid a repeat of that. Just because the tribes I watched over only created Sara doesn't mean that other tribes didn't have their own goddess or demigoddess that's endured to this age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, there's that.\" Sara admits thoughtfully. \"Still, we'd need to disguise or hide ourselves while poking around in her head so we're not adding more reasons to hate us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd have to do that too if you're going to physically follow Yasmin around, you know.\" Davis points out while Sara seats herself in the lap of one of the huge teddy bears, its arms bending to embrace her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... Who's to say she isn't like me and Sara? And if we end up awakening that part of her, things could get ugly faster than zerglings can swarm.\" I say, voicing my concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say there was like no chance of that happening, Sara?\" Davis questions, seating himself on a stack of comic books. At least a few of them are definitely issues of Titania Girl, the \"gateway drug\" to my best friend's love of comic book superheroes when it first came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the tribes I watched, dude.\" Sara nods. \"Still, if it happens, we may be able to reason with Yasmin on the principle of not wanting to fucking break reality. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree that's important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as \"reasoning\" doesn't involve trying to punch her in the face. Then she might risk it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you don't want to figure her out and understand where this attitude is coming from, that's fine by me.\" Sara calmly states. \"I'm going to get my answers, with or without you, because I think it's worth the risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can tell from her expression that her mind is made up on the matter, and she's not about to be deterred from this. She's willing to leave me be, with no hard feelings, if I don't want to risk stirring something within Yasmin. However, I need to actually make my decision. And then what we're going to do to get our answers, if I indeed still want to learn them firsthand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing here in my best friend's mind, I think about whether or not I'd join Sara in her quest to discover why Yasmin hates us so much. I'm definitely worried either of us might awaken something within the redhead, but at the same time, I did say I was going to see what her problem was, and I meant it. Ultimately, I conclude that I agree with Sara's belief that it's worth the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, I'd rather not let her go alone in case something comes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you and I'll go in the morning. We'll examine her memories to hopefully get a reliable answer.\" I announce. \"Until then, let's get some rest so we don't do something we end up regretting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. Two can play the stubborn game, Sara!\" I interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say it's kind of already morning. And no, I had nothing to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fuck.\" is all I can respond with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly thereafter, Davis and I are returned to our proper bodies and wake up. I teleport home to shower and prepare, not wanting to compete for the Kecks' bathroom, then dress in a green shirt with Hyrule's emblem on it, and a pair of shorts, before returning to my boyfriend's place when I'm done. In the time it took me to do all of this, it seems Davis has opted to try and get a little more sleep. I smile and tuck him in a little, placing a StarCrafts zealot plushie next to him in the process, and then exit his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara appears in the living room, wearing a shirt bearing the Blue Lantern Corps' emblem, and we silently nod in agreement. We're ready to proceed with our plan. I concentrate, and we teleport to our quarry's location. I admit, it feels kind of weird to not know where you're going specifically, and I'm hoping we don't accidentally end up inside any walls. That would be embarrassing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe find ourselves in a surprisingly normal room, in a house seemingly far from my mansion and my friends' homes. Immediately, I see Yasmin typing away at her laptop, her back turned to us, so I assume this is her bedroom. Honestly, I kind of thought she'd have our faces taped to a dart board. With a silent nod to Sara, we approach Yasmin, intending to make her sleep so we can dive into her memories without being noticed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're trying to sneak up on me, you're doing a horrible job at it.\" I hear Yasmin remark, still turned away from me and Sara. Had she noticed us, despite having her face practically buried in her laptop? But then again, if she had, wouldn't she freak out from our sudden appearance? Wasting no further time, I personally compel her to fall asleep before we enter her mind, wanting to be done with this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, we immediately begin to explore Yasmin's memories, her very past, in search of answers as to what Sara and I've done to earn her scorn and hatred. Obviously, we do what we can to mask our presence in her head while we work, not really wanting to give the redhead more reasons to hate our guts with a burning passion, despite this eerie darkness obstructing our vision of her mental landscape. So far, it appears that her belief that I've the school wrapped around my little finger with my family's fortune may stem from our fathers being old high school rivals, and hers poisoning her mind with false ideas out of his bitterness. Meanwhile, my father's pretty much put that behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel that, Megan?\" Sara asks me after a couple minutes, causing me to pause my examining of Yasmin's memories for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel... what, exactly?\" I reply, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something doesn't feel right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting cold feet?\" I ask, jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it at all! It's like something's looking back through me... something <i>ancient</i>. If I had a spider sense, it'd be tingling off the charts right now...\" Sara responds worriedly. She'd probably look worried, too, if I could actually see her face at the moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that you mention it... I feel like someone's delving into my head as I'm peering through Yasmin's memories...\" I admit, now feeling it too. \"But who-\" I begin, only to stop as a disturbing idea wells to the forefront. \"Oh no... I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did what?\" A voice asks as a pair of glowing red eyes appear from within the darkness, staring right at us. \"If it isn't Megan and Sara. I've been waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness lifts, and the landscape of Yasmin's mind is revealed, laid out not unlike my own. Yasmin herself faces me and Sara, eyes still glowing red. \"O-okay... don't do anything rash here...\" I implore nervously, unsure what she's going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the string of insults? You know, like how I'm apparently a slut who's likely fucking you right now while you slumber, or Megan can do anything she wants and get away with it?\" Sara inquires, her voice dripping with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she <i>can</i>, but the Allerson family fortune has little to do with it.\" Yasmin counters, surprisingly calm. \"And I know now what I saw on Monday, why you were basically nude, even if no one else remembers it. I have to admit, making me believe I heard someone calling me to keep me off your backs was pretty clever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, I guess?\" I say, still feeling like I should be on the defensive just in case. \"But yeah, where's the burning hate for me and Sara? We are in your head, so why don't you just get it over with and activate your trap card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who said anything about a trap? I've been waiting to cover a realization I've had since Monday's... <i>incident</i>.\" Yasmin explains. \"Okay, maybe more than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've finally recognized that the three of us share some things in common, and that I've been an ass to you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's eyes glow blue, while mine shimmer green. \"No, really?\" she exclaims sarcastically. \"You mean this fancy party trick, or the mental landscape that looks like someone threw various time periods into a blender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's it, I'm going to do something about this...\" I hear Yasmin mutter, right before we're forcibly evicted from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expected to be dead, if it's even truly possible for me, but instead I'm back in the real world. Everything seems to be intact, Sara included, which is good. Yasmin, however, is floating a couple inches off the ground, her eyes blazing red almost in contrast with her relatively calm expression. That's weird on levels I can't easily explain, and I'm kind of <i>used</i> to weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... yeah. It seems my dad has perhaps influenced my judgment of you, to the point I've never bothered getting to know what you're really like. And since the three of us are goddesses, and basically immortal, it seems stupid to me to continue bearing a grudge against you.\" Yasmin claims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about me?\" Sara asks. \"Where the hell did this perception of me being a slut even come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... you've never done it with anyone? But why all the flirts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! My older sister and I were raised to have more respect for our bodies than that, Yasmin. Teasing guys is fun, but the ones falling for it aren't worth my time dating. So far, only one guy in school has even made it past my dad, and his interests lie with someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davis Keck, right? Even I wasn't blind to his feelings for Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" I say, changing the subject, \"Where did you originally come from, Yasmin? How do you fit into all of this? Sara was the only one my tribes created in the effort to bring me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Void, maybe? I don't remember our origins... I <i>do</i> remember having my own tribes to watch over, though. I may have taken some of your followers in as well, but even a week since awakening it's still fuzzy...\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you thought you awakened this just now?\" I nod in response. \"No, I've just been keeping quiet about it! The time of goddesses watching over humanity is long past, and somehow I doubt many would be so understanding. Still, I might resume my true size one of these days. Maybe a giantess party or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess this makes us... friends, now, Yasmin?\" I ask. Never in my modern life did I think I'd ever put Yasmin and friends together in the same sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead considers it for a minute before shaking her head. \"I can't accept the hand of friendship, sadly, at least not right now. I don't know about either of you, but I'm uninterested in messing with people's minds for my personal gain.\" she replies. \"Wow. Never thought I'd be upset about having to decline befriending Megan Allerson and Sara Mars of all people... This is going to take some getting used to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes two and three of us.\" Sara remarks. \"Still, we can take our time getting to know one another. I mean, Megan's collection of games is <i>extensive</i>... as is my comic collection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still really need to prepare to soft reset Latios in my Alpha Sapphire game... and make progress with Davis, now that he has the Warlords of Draenor expansion... and a bunch of other things.\" I admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Well I can definitely appreciate a good game. Right now, I've been trying to smash the void crystals keeping Amon's portal open. Yay for being put on a timer...\" Yasmin remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit, we head outside, where Yasmin materializes a nasty looking hatchet, promptly burying it deep in the ground. Sara and I get a chuckle at its meaning, but still this is a lot to take in. We might want to take some time away from here for a bit, and the visit with my friend's sister Audrey might be just the ticket. If I remember right, she'd mentioned wanting us to meet someone...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of weeks later, Sara and I return from visiting her sister Audrey. And boy do we have a story to tell! We met a gorgeous plant-human hybrid by the name of Flora, and helped her a bit. I think she's well on her way to mastering her abilities! Oh, yeah, and we let her and Audrey in on what we are, as Sara promised her parents she would. The latter took it surprisingly well... after she came to, anyway. They, and everyone else for that matter, are still unaware that Yasmin's like us, thanks to it completely slipping our minds at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose the first thing I should do is to invite Yasmin over. Get to know a bit more about each other and all. Of course, having her phone number would be really helpful to call her... and like an idiot, I never thought to ask for it. Well, I'll just have to work around that, as I'd like her to get to know my family, and I won't be deterred from at least extending the invitation. As for revealing to my family that she's a fellow goddess... I'll leave it up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making certain I look as proper as I can, I teleport to Yasmin's house, thankful for Google Earth letting me know the exact address. The front of the house is pretty average in appearance, complete with a mailbox featuring Foxworth on the side near the driveway, and the smell of cut grass lingers in the air still. Taking a deep breath to relax my nerves, seeing as I didn't know what kind of response to expect, I approach the front door and ring the door bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door eventually opens, revealing a man of about the same age as my father, who looks sort of like a cross between Ganondorf if he really let himself go and an orc grunt, minus the tusks. Suffice to say, not very pleasant. \"Yes? What do you want?\" he replies coldly, his grey eyes boring into mine as though I were something unsightly. He should really look in a mirror sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Megan Allerson. Is Yasmin around?\" I ask, smiling down at him slightly, but only because of the difference in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he could have just answered yes or no. He could have even inquired why I wanted to know if Yasmin was there. Instead, he spits in my face, right before slamming the door in it with enough force to rattle the windows. \"NO DAUGHTER OF MINE IS GOING TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR A FUCKING ALLERSON!\" he roared from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to do something I'd inevitably regret to Yasmin's father, I decide to depart and wait to invite her the next time I see her. I swear, never in my life have I met a person who makes Lord Garithos seem downright <i>pleasant</i> by comparison! I remain undeterred, but I'm not about to waste my time further. Not when I could be doing quests, or working on preparing to catch Latios in Alpha Sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the scenic route back home, I stop by the road leading to the local harbor. As I note how it's far wider than normal, I feel myself being lifted into the air. To my alarm, I'm faced with an over 336 foot Yasmin! \"Well look who I found...\" she says, instinctively filling me with dread. Naturally, I squirm about in an effort to break free, but she responds to this by lifting me to her face and saying, \"Hey, here's an idea... Stop <i>squirming</i> so I don't accidentally drop you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yasmin! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, this isn't working...\" is her only response before starting to deflate in size, our surroundings adjusting accordingly in the process. I'm deposited into her dwindling right hand, and her left soon joins to keep me from falling. Her red top and black skirt easily keep up with her as far as I can tell, with less and less material needed to comprise what I guess is her favorite outfit. \"Alright, this seems better.\" Yasmin remarks, stopping at 84 feet. \"Now, I was enjoying a walk around town when you showed up, so I could ask you the same question, Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few moments for things to click back into place in my mind, though the slight hint of contempt in Yasmin's voice is beginning to sour my opinion of her again. Still, it's a fair question. \"I was just heading home. I had intended to invite you over, but contemptuous attitudes from you and your old man are starting to make me think twice about that.\" I reply, unintentionally letting my frustration peak through. \"Him spitting in my face was not cool, I might add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin's expression turns to one of genuine shock. \"Wait, my dad did what? That's... terrible!\" she thinks for a moment before asking with suspicion, \"But wait, how can I be sure that your folks won't do something just as awful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually meet them and you'll see.\" I reply, noting a tone of interest in there as well. \"Anyway, I'll see you later!\" and with that, I teleport away, leaving my address for Yasmin in case she's interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reappear back home and proceed with a shower, and some League of Legends afterward. While handing some unfortunate fools their asses, I can't help but wonder if Yasmin would confront her father about his actions, or if he'd get her to ignore my invitation and resume her old hatred... or where her mother was for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm so deep in thought that I don't notice how much time's passed, or my door opening, or the shadow looming over me trying to get my attention. It's not until I feel Sara resting her boobs on my head, giggling like a loon, that I snap out of my thoughts. \"And how long exactly have you been waiting to do that?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least it got your attention.\" Sara replies, still giggling as she straightens up again, letting me turn around in my chair to face her... or at least her considerable bust, given that I <i>am</i> sitting. \"So what's got you so lost in thought? You didn't even come down to greet Davis, and you always do that!\" my blonde demigoddess friend inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove her point, Davis pokes his head in to say, \"Yeah, and it kind of worried me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my gaze to my friends and ask, \"Do you really want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\" Davis replies without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me.\" a disturbingly haunting voice rings out, before... holy shit... Golden Freddy appears on my bed! Just like in Five Nights at Freddy's, it's sitting there in a crumpled, discarded heap, mouth hanging open while its head rests tilted in an uncomfortable angle, its eye sockets empty and black as the void save for tiny pinpricks of light. \"It's me.\" it calls out in that same haunting voice, if it could even be called that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis screams in utter terror, much to Golden Freddy's... delight? The eyes briefly glow red before it stands and pulls off its head, revealing Yasmin inside. The suit's head evaporates as she doubles over in laughter. \"W-what the hell?!\" Davis exclaims, his terror escalating as he notices her still glowing red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god that was <i>hilarious</i>!\" Yasmin laughs before quickly composing herself, the rest of the suit giving way to her earlier outfit, minus her red Converse. I guess she knows well enough to remove them inside. \"But yeah, Megan was probably thinking about me. Dad... pretty vocally forbade me from coming here, but obviously, I came anyway.\" she remarks, then adds with a wink, \"Besides, I figured that since she and Sara invaded my room awhile ago, I'd... return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like them, I'm a goddess, but they didn't awaken me.\" Yasmin confirms. \"Pretty good reason to try and drop the grudge, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm honestly pleasantly surprised she actually came. \"Well then, welcome to my home! As you can clearly see, my game collection is pretty damn extensive.\" I greet. \"So, are you willing to meet my family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin hesitates for a moment before answering with a nod, \"I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grin, and immediately teleport us into the kitchen downstairs.</span></div></div>",

My heart is not as young as it once was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'll try to remember.\" I apologize. \"Oh yes. Yasmin, this is my family's maid Beverly. She's one of the sweetest people I've ever known. She and her husband Alfred are like family to us, especially to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you, Miss Yasmin.\" Beverly greets. \"Er, if I may inquire, are you perhaps... like Miss Megan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, yeah.\" Yasmin replies. \"So where is Alfred anyway? I'm interested in meeting him along with the rest of Megan's family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terribly sorry, Miss Yasmin, but Alfred is currently out on an important errand. However, Miss Megan's parents are currently in the living room, if you'd like to meet them.\" Beverly states. \"It's not often that they can arrange for time away from work, so when they can, they enjoy spending it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But aren't they filthy rich - I mean, extremely wealthy, being Allersons and all?\" Yasmin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They operate their own businesses, Yasmin. They can't just take days off whenever.\" I explain. \"Believe me, if they could have done that, they would've been a lot more involved in my life like they wanted to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? But why tell me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partly to dispel the notion that I've had an easy, privileged life. Sara and Davis are well aware of this, so I really don't see a reason to not tell you as well.\" I inform. \"Anyway, care for a drink before meeting my parents? We have Coke Zero, cream soda, iced tea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have some cream soda.\" Yasmin responds quickly. I can respect someone who knows what they want when they hear it. I personally walk over to the fridge and get out a can of cream soda, as well as a can of Coke Zero, handing her the former as per her request. The redhead practically tears it free from my grasp, and gleefully guzzles the can's contents as though she's never seen cream soda before. \"So so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, she likes cream soda. Good to know.\" I remark, remembering to close my jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, we enter the living room. I notice Yasmin beginning to tense up, as if <i>anticipating</i> something bad to happen to her, as we enter my parents' view. \"Ah, Megan dear! You had us concerned when you didn't come down to greet Davis earlier.\" my father starts before pausing as he sees Yasmin. \"Oh! I don't remember seeing you come in, young lady. I am Jake Allerson, and this is my wife Jillian. Care to tell us your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yasmin. Yasmin Foxworth.\" Yasmin replies, seemingly expecting the worst from her father's old rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foxworth, huh?\" my father ponders. \"I've not heard that name in years! By any chance, is your father named Garreth Foxworth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's him, yes.\" Yasmin nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look uncomfortable, Yasmin... why don't you have a seat? There's no need to be shy.\" my mother offers, gesturing towards one of the plush seats Davis and I tend to use when playing a game down here. As Yasmin gratefully takes a seat, with Sara and Davis soon entering to join us, mother asks my father, \"Weren't you and Garreth rivals back in school? However did that come about, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... that was bound to come up, wasn't it?\" he says sheepishly. \"We used to be friends when we were kids. We had a bit of a rivalry going on even then, but it was friendly. We'd congratulate one another for our efforts regardless of who won that time. We earned ourselves quite the reputation as troublemakers, though I think the teachers secretly loved us for brightening their day just a little with our antics...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that changed when I told on him. I had to! It pained me deeply to destroy his trust, but once I learned how dangerous what I stupidly dared him to do was, it was the only way I could ensure he wouldn't possibly die! Since then, he's hated anything to do with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe listen on in shock. My father, and the guy who spat in my face, were once childhood friends? And the latter hates him for doing something that very likely saved his life? But I get the sense that Garreth hates my family for more than that, as surely he would've at least let his hate go after so long. But what could reignite a smoldering old grudge to the point where he'd impose his beliefs on Yasmin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yasmin, where is your mother? You've mentioned your father a few times now, but nothing about your mother...\" I inquire, the question demanding to be let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin remains silent for a minute before she quietly replies, \"My mom... my mom died when I was little. It was so sudden, as she went in one day for a seemingly normal check up, only to find out she had cancer, and the doctors were going to start chemotherapy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Good lord...\" my father gasps in horror, while my mother's hand covers her mouth in shock. Sara, Davis, and I wear similar looks. Cancer has that kind of effect on anyone with a moral compass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The drugs stripped mom of her strength and vitality. I was barely 7 at the time, and I couldn't understand why mom couldn't pick me up for a hug like she used to, nor could I understand why she looked so ill. Dad and I visited her almost daily. One day, a doctor took dad off to the side, and while I didn't hear what they were saying, I knew as soon as they returned, if only subconsciously, that the drugs weren't working.\" Yasmin continues. \"I told her that I'd see her later, but Lorelei Foxworth, passed away that night at the Allerson Hospital after a valiant battle with cancer. Dad believes you paid the doctors to ensure she died, just to spite him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm so sorry, Yasmin... I did generously fund the hospital, thus why it bears my family's name, but only to help it provide the best medical treatment it possibly could to the community... If I had known that your mother was there, I would've done everything I could to increase her chances of survival from the start.\" my father says sorrowfully. I've never seen him so upset. \"I'd never do something like Garreth believes I did, least of all to him. I can't imagine how anyone could even sleep at night, knowing they had done such a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I see that now. Blindly, I've hated you and Megan thanks to my dad's own misplaced grudge, but I've recently had my eyes opened in an... interesting way. I think I'd prefer it if Allerson and Foxworth were on amiable terms once again, though I don't know if my dad will ever want to step out of the past.\" Yasmin nods in agreement, her eyes full of tears. I've no doubt that the pain of her loss is just as fresh as the day she found out her mother had died. And from hearing her tale, I've come to hate cancer just a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you coming here is certainly a step in the right direction to that end. If your father turns on you for it... well first, shame on him, but you're always welcome to come over.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I'll certainly keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to ask, Yasmin, but... What did you mean by having your eyes opened in an interesting way?\" my mother asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Yasmin's eyes glow red, just long enough to be noticed. \"Well, I'm a goddess like Megan, something we discovered recently. My dad doesn't know this, and at least until his relationship with Mr. Allerson improves considerably, I'd like to keep it that way.\" she replies, smiling slightly.</span></div></div>",

You quickly start working on a large pile of cardboard boxes in the corner of the small room. The first bod was nothing interesting to you - just a bunch of old photos and several albums. You move onto the next box very quickly; this one contains books, all packed in as tightly as they can fit.

Terri has always been a rather overly-loving mother figure, all too keen to smother her children with affection, be it in the literal or metaphorical sense. Terri is also very tall and very overdeveloped - standing at six feet and seven inches tall, with curves to more than match her height - much to the chagrin of her almost perpetually embarrassed children. However, where Terri's body developed, it seems her brain did not, leaving her as a bit of a ditz - and very much an example of the 'dumb blonde' stereotype, considering her hair colour. What is especially strange about Terri, however, is that her children remember her being shorter when they were younger - and indeed, this is true, because Terri has never stopped growing and developing, on and on and on. She and her children are in for a wonderful/rude surprise, however, as her growth is about to speed up substantially!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison is also an example of an embarrassing mother, though for different reasons than Terri. Being of slightly under average height, and having less-than-impressive curves, it has been Alison's life-long dream to grow, and to never stop growing. Alison being embarrassing for her children is due to the passion with which she pursues her dream - though thankfully, not to the detriment of any other areas of her life. Her children know she wants to grow, their friends know, their friends' mothers know... Most dismiss Alison's growthlust as simply the result of puberty passing her over, but when Alison finds a way to grow that works, will they be able to break her out of her newfound addiction?</span></div></div>",

Well then, let's see our choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRayne is a woman you've been happily married to for a few years now. When you married her, she was already an impressive 6 feet tall with a more than beach ready body. Nice D-cups and a firm ass, a sharp mind coupled with a gentle personality are just some of the things that captured your heart. Over the past year, however, you've both noticed that she's slowly but surely growing. Naturally concerned, you went to the doctor's where they made an incredible announcement: the love of your life's body is preparing for what they called a second puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you weren't expecting, however, was that this flood of hormones in her bloodstream would make her increasingly horny. No one expected that Rayne's second puberty would make her grow so rapidly in spurts, and to make matters more... interesting, no one has any idea when or even if she'll stop growing. Mysteriously yet thankfully, as she grows she needs less to sustain herself, so affording to feed her won't be that much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and you are newlyweds, but you've been together for well over a year. It's not because you're lesbians, just you two wanted to take your time to make sure you were right for one another. Nikki is just a little shorter than you at 5'8 to your 5'11\", but her C-cups best your B-cups so it balances out somewhat. She's incredibly easygoing, yet you're positive she'd make an excellent parent to any children you may adopt in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and your brother have talked about the subject of potentially being taller, and she believes she's perfectly fine just the way she is. The truth is... Nikki has acrophobia - she's scared of heights. Unfortunately, it's not long at all before her nightmare becomes real as she starts to grow and grow. The fact her body's growth will also cause damage to her surroundings will be something of a source of embarrassment to her, so you're going to need to be there for her as much as you can while this goes on for moral support and to keep her calm...</span></div></div>",

Her lips were plumper, fuller...softer, for example. She smiled at your gaze, a flush coming to her cheeks as she realized the effect her growing sexual presence was having on you.  \"...there's nothing bad happening, right?

And almost as long as you've known her, she's been... quite tall for a girl. Some would think she'd be extremely embarrassed about it. Those people have never met your sister. Jessica loves her size, and it's definitely no secret that she wishes to grow even bigger. Your parents have used this desire to their advantage in getting her to eat her vegetables including broccoli, among other things, but they never did fully understand this desire: they always thought she wanted to grow up 'big and strong' when really she wants to be a huge giantess with bigger curves than most anyone has ever seen on a girl. Thankfully for you, she's always been fond of her sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she's younger, she's constantly pestered you to measure her whenever she has the slightest belief she's grown - which happens at least once a week. Imagine her joy when she finds out she's starting to grow. Now imagine that same joy on an increasingly bigger girl, who looks more and more like a goddess of sex as time passes. Who knows when or even if she'll stop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she's older, Jessica has prowled virtually every giantess-related site you can think of, and while has reluctantly come to accept her dream is just that, it's a dream that refuses to die. Luckily for her, sometimes dreams do come true! And of course the only things that could make her happier are if she keeps growing bigger and sexier, and if you're there to watch. Adult size: 6'1\", C-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia and Emma are sisters, with the former being the elder. For most of her life, Olivia has been tiny, but just about the kindest girl you can imagine. Emma is more normal, if a bit tougher due to her sister being a bit on the sensitive side, but still wouldn't hurt anyone without a good reason to. This changed when they were 12 and 10 respectively, as puberty decided to bless Olivia, letting her grow to 5'7\" with huge (for the time) C-cups and a generally much improved figure. It's been a few years later, and both have grown, with Emma now at a respectable 5'3\" with B-cups and Olivia at her ideal size of 6'2\" with wonderful D-cups and a generally nicely toned figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhichever sister is chosen, the story will follow from the perspective of the other sister. If Olivia is chosen, you as Emma will witness Olivia's growth spurts return, making her reach heights that no human has ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Emma is chosen, you as Olivia will behold your younger sister overtake you once more as she becomes a giantess. And because you're still so kind, you'll take it upon yourself to try and keep her calm.</span></div></div>",

Eight years old, and four feet, eight and one-quarter inches tall - Jessica stands head and shoulders above most of her classmates, and she loves it more than anything else in the world, save her beloved toys. The amount of pestering from that girl to measure her is insane! \"Big brother, measure me, measure me!\" If she were older you could simply refuse, but your parents say to go along with it - after all, it's just harmless fun, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's always disappointed when she hasn't grown, too - every week, a rush to get both of you into her obscenely pink bedroom and her up against the height chart, and then that cute little frowning pout when she still hasn't grown.

I want to know if I've grown, especially since I've eaten all of my broccoli this week! Mum says that helps you grow!

But this is your one time this week, you hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded as she giggled, running out of the living room and into the hallway. By the time you reached her room, her back was already flat against the height chart, the pink-clad girl giggling constantly. Pink, pink, pink - the walls were pink, her duvet was pink, the dress she wore was pink - the girl was obsessed with pink! Grumbling, you stepped toward the height chart that Jess used - it was one of the fancier ones, with a little thing you pulled down to get the child's height against a really long measuring tape with feet and inches and so on. All the bells and whistles, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUninterestedly, you marked Jessica's height down before doing a double-take, eyes wide open. Whereas before she was four feet, eight and one-quarter inches tall, Jessica was now four feet and nine inches tall, exactly. \"You-you've grown, Jess,\" you mumbled as the pink-clad little sister let her excitement be known in the loudest way possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woow, big brother, look how much I grew! I hope I keep getting bigger, and bigger - oh, imagine if I grew bigger than you... Then even bigger than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, you did imagine that... And it scared you.

I'm still waking up!\" you exclaimed. Your little sister rolled her eyes and smiled, \"I know, I know. You don't like mornings.\" \"Right,\" you stated matter of factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced back at her, noticing how she sat at the dining room table, looking at you expectantly. Something about her looked different. <i>Nah..., I'm still just waking up. That's it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you pour me a bowl too?\" You grumbled a little but grudgingly pulled another bowl down from the cabinet and poured Jessica's favorite, Cheeri-O's.  \"How about some milk too? I'm a growing girl after all!\" Jessica giggled but you only groaned as you now felt obligated to walk to the fridge. Mornings weren't your thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, you loved your sister a lot. But she was energetic and enthusiastic all the time and right now you just couldn't match her morning spunkyness. You sat down wordlessly and began eating your dry cereal. \"Soo... When are mom and dad getting home from vacation?\" she asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Like I told you already, they won't get back for another week,\" you stated, slightly annoyed at having to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. So what are we going to do on this fun Saturday?\" she stared at you with her sparkling green eyes in anticipation of a fun day. \"I dunno, maybe stay home and watch TV?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun!\" she pouted, \"Well, you can at least measure me this morning. I think I might be taller!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, that's ridiculous! I <i>just</i> measured you yesterday afternoon. There's no way you grew any more. People don't just have growth spurts overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pllleaaasssee!!!\" she begged. You sighed, \"Okay fine. But eat your breakfast first. I'm in charge while Mom and Dad are gone and they wouldn't want you skipping out on the most important meal of the day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued eating, you couldn't help but glance up from your bowl and at your sister. <i>There's no way she could be taller right?</i> The fear that such a thing could happen put butterflies in your stomach. You shook your head. <i>It's impossible. What am I nervous about!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you both finished eating, you told your eight year-old sister to take a shower first and then you'd measure her. A few minutes later, she bounded out of the bathroom in a fresh, pink tank top and jean shorts and beckoned you up to her bedroom. \"Okay, I'm coming!\" you called up to her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou were starting to feel a bit more awake at this point and so you leaped up the stairs, laughing as you playfully dashed into her bedroom and tackled her to the ground. \"Hey gerroff me!!!\" she yelled in mock upset. \"Sorry sis, I couldn't help myself. Alright let's get you measured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walked over to the height chart on the wall. She stood up against the wall and you took her measurement. Four feet, ten inches. A bit of color drained from your face. <i>No way. Nobody grows that fast!</i> You looked down at your sister... but it was true. As you surveyed her, you confirmed that she seemed taller but that's not all that caught your attention or surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like small breasts were poking out into her tank top. It was nothing major but the indentations were there. As if to answer your question, Jessica excitedly exclaimed, \"Oh and I think I'm growing boobies!\" You winced and tried not to think about your 8 year-old sister developing breasts. <i>She's too young to develop breasts, right!?</i>  Her green eyes sparkled at you with a touch of extra vibrancy today. \"I hope I grow up to be really tall and really, really beautiful! Just like all my princesses and barbies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reasoned that she must just be going through a particularly large growth spurt recently. <i>Nothing to worry about.</i> Chuckling, you patted the dirty blond hair on her head and joked, \"Okay but just don't grow up too fast okay?\" You paused for a minute and said more caringly, \"I wouldn't want to lose my little sis.\" You smiled, and were for the moment, thankful you had such a sweet sister to bond with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled too, \"I'll always be your little sister! ... I just might one day be bigger than you, that's all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option A:</b> The next day Jessica has grown yet again! You're paying more attention this time and you notice a few other startling changes. <i>Are the freckles on her face fading? </i> <i>Is she getting prettier? Maturing? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option B:</b> In celebration of a lazy Saturday, you both jump on the couch to watch a movie Jess really likes. But half way through her stomach starts feeling really weird...</span></div></div>",

Jessica smiled contentedly. You turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey before you go, can we pray?\" Your family wasn't super religious but your mom had always made it a habit to pray with Jessica before she went to bed. You nodded, \"Yeah, okay sis. What do you want to pray about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I grow up to be really tall and really pretty! Like those girls from the magazines under your bed!\" she exclaimed excitedly. Your eyes widened in shock and your heart pounded. <i>How does she know about those?!</i> \"Umm, Jessica, those are secret magazines. You can't be looking at those. They're... umm... for boys only! And you can't tell <i>anyone</i> about them okay?\" \"Ohh... ok...,\" she said softly but her smile quickly returned, \"Well they are still really pretty girls.\" You blushed and quickly changed the subject, \"Okay, hold my hands and we will pray.\" She grabbed your hands tightly and scrunched her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, dear God, we just thank you for family and for a fun day together.. and, umm, we just pray to you God, and ask that you would bless my sister and that she would grow to be big and healthy and, umm... really pretty. Okay, ahh amen!\" Meanwhile a little star twinkled, it's sparkly presence just visible through the bedroom window... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhaled quickly, catching your breath as you had rushed through the prayer, feeling somewhat awkward about the whole thing. Jessica didn't seem to notice, however. \"Thanks. I have the best big brother in the world,\" she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Okay good night,\" You flipped the lights off and slowly shut her door for the night. But something strange was happening to little Jessica while she slept. Little did you or she know that she would soon be blessed beyond her wildest dreams with even more than all her young heart had wished for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn almost imperceptible growth spurt coursed it's way through her frame as she slowly grew another two inches. She was already incredibly tall for her age, but this did not stop her feet from inching down the bed. Meanwhile a myriad of other changes washed over her as her face and body slowly matured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese changes would soon be discovered by the young Jess and her brother that next morning but until then Jessica continued to sleep peacefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option A:</b> You are woken up to Jessica squealing in delight. She noticed she's grown two more inches and can't wait to show you. You are in shock at the incredible puberty your sister is experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option B:</b> Your sister is still sleeping by the time you've finished showering and eating breakfast. Concerned because she never sleeps in longer than you, you open her bedroom door and peek in to see an unfamiliar form in her bed. Her supernatural puberty seems to have taken a lot of energy (hence sleeping in) and it turns out she has grown a lot more than two inches over night. Pulling back the covers, you find a girl that looks like a well-developed teenager. And as you are waking her up, she shudders and you both witness her going through yet another, visible growth spurt. Her turbocharged puberty has been <i>very</i> kind to Jessica. Who knew prayer was so effective?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up, the immediate lack of Jessica in your face talking about how she'd grown again was almost unsettling, seeing as how you'd settled into the mindset of your sister undergoing an extremely rapid growth spurt - not that such a thing wasn't worrying in its own way. Plus, Jessica usually got up far earlier than you. Maybe her growth had tired her out? Maybe she was simply having breakfast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went through your usual morning routine - brush your teeth, clean your face, a quick shower - and then, after getting dressed, went downstairs to the kitchen, half-expecting Jessica to be there. As it turns out, she wasn't in the kitchen, nor the living room. Had her growth tuckered her out that badly? You ate your cereal in silence, thinking about everything that had been happening. It was just an early growth spurt, right? She... She wouldn't actually grow up into one of the women from the porn mags under your bed, would she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you realize that you should probably hide those in a better location. Under the bed where even Jessica could find them... what were you thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off your cereal, you put your bowl into the sink, resolving to wash it later, and make a quick trip back to your room, hiding the magazines underneath the chest of drawers you kept your clothes in. Walking out into the hallway, you pause in front of Jessica's door. The phrase, \"Jessica's Room\" was written on the white wood with stickers, a few stray hearts surrounding the words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking, you clear your throat. \"Jessica? Are you okay?\" However, you receive no response whatsoever. Grasping the door's handle, you slowly turn it, and push inwards. The door slowly opens as you creep in. Underneath the blindingly pink duvet on Jessica's bed, you could spy a large sleeping form, scrunched and curled up to fit on the bed. \"Jessica?!\" you whisper. Had she really grown that much in just one night?!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some trepidation, you move to your sister's bed, gripping her sheets in your hands. You peel the sheets back for a second, before deciding to simply doing them off of her body. What you see shocks you: Jessica, but not as you knew her. Your sister had ballooned from four feet and ten inches to... You weren't sure just how big she's grown. Certainly bigger than any other person her age. And her body showed signs of further maturation, as well: her tiny mosquito-bite breasts had swelled into something approaching average size; her hips had pushed outwards a touch, and her behind had also grown larger. Pink pajamas strained by her newly-enlarged body, Jessica shifted in her sleep as she began to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grasped her arm, bare due to the short-sleeved nature of her top, marvelling for a second at how smooth Jessica's skin felt - though you pushed that thought to the back of your mind. \"Jessica,\" you said. \"Jessica, wake up!\" Your not-as-little sister groaned as she opened her eyes, as if imitating you when you tried to wake up. They quickly widened, however, when she saw the concern on your face - and how her body had changed and grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Jessica was ecstatic: \"big brother, look how much I've grown,\" she half-shouted, all but leaping out of her bed. Before she could demand that you measure her again, however, she faltered, shuddering - but not out of pain or fear or discomfort. The widest smile you'd ever seen was on her face as she began to grow yet again, the process clearly visible this time as her body swelled once more. You estimated her height to be at around five feet and three inches, but now she was taller than that, and still slowly growing, second by second! Her pajamas simply couldn't handle her growing body, small rips and tears in the fabric appearing wherever her growing body strained it to the limits, it being designed to be worn by someone far smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer big green eyes were looking up at you the entire time, that smile seeming almost unsettling. It was all you could do to stop yourself from outright panicking. Mercifully soon, however, Jessica's growth ended, and she slammed the back of her now pseudo-teen body against her height chart; you gulped as you approached, dreading the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yourself were six feet and two inches tall, and the thought of Jessica growing to that height... Or past it... Terrified you. What would she do if she simply kept on growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarking Jessica's new height on her chart, you hit your lip. Five feet, seven and a half inches tall. Jessica couldn't be more happy if she tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: Jessica continues to grow and mature, rivaling your height by the end of the next day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Jessica's growth slows down a bit/halts as she recharges - Jessica, however, quickly proves to be almost a match for your strength when she persuades you to play with her!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gawked in awe of what had become of your little sister, Jess. The girl in front of you was undoubtedly her but also far different from the little girl you had known just a few days ago. She stood excitedly next to her height chart at a little over 5'7\u201d. But it took your eyes a moment to register all of the changes Jessica had undergone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you scanned her frame, a thought entered your mind that disturbed you slightly. She was\u2026 <i>attractive</i>. Jess had not only grown but had matured physically and now looked much more like a teenager\u2014a well-developed one at that\u2014than an 8 year old girl. You hastily buried the thoughts of attraction that had surfaced. <i>She's my sister!</i> That thought resounded clearly in your psyche and you felt guilty for thinking of her as\u2026 kind of hot, even if it was just for the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess's recent growth spurt had really blessed her form. Just a few days ago, Jess was flat as a board with no curves to speak of but that had changed. Her budding breasts were now overwhelming her too-small pajamas. They looked like C cups at least, you thought. Below that, her figure sloped into a still thin waist but then quickly sloped into her budding, womanly hips. These led down to a pair of legs that actually looked pretty long in proportion to her frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning quickly upwards, you saw her smiling face. It looked like Jess but older. Her face had matured into that of a pretty 16 or 18 year-old girl. She had nice eye-lashes and plump-ish lips which were flanked by attractive cheek bones. You noticed her freckles appeared to be fading and her normally pale skin had a healthier color to it. Her hair seemed longer, and fuller as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d you stated, still in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so amazing! I grew! Did you see that!? I literally felt myself grow!\u201d your sister exclaimed with incredible enthusiasm. \u201cI've got to see myself!\u201d Jess dashed to her dresser, causing a few of the tears in her pajamas to stretch larger. She looked into the large mirror on top of the white and pink dresser, touching her face with her hand as she did so. \u201cThat's really me?\u201d she said, also in shock. \u201cThis is so cool. I'm actually pretty!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood behind her and nodded silently, fear welling up in your stomach. But you pushed it down to focus on supporting your sister. \u201cWe've got to get you out of those pajamas,\u201d you stated. \u201cOh right!\u201d Jess agreed and then started to peel herself out of the torn clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!!!,\u201d you exclaimed. \u201cSis, you can't do that! I'm standing right here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looked at you quizzically, \u201cWhat is wrong? You've seen me naked plenty of times! I mean you are just my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, but you didn't look like an attractive teenager back then.</i> \u201cJust, please don't, sis.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine, if it bothers you that much!\u201d She teased then added more seriously, \u201cI uhh\u2026 think all my clothes are going to be too small. What are we going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll get you some of Mom's clothes. I bet they will fit.\u201d You quickly rushed into your parent's bedroom and grabbed some underwear, a t-shirt and one of your mom's jean shorts then headed back to Jess's room. \u201cHere try these,\u201d you offered. You handed them to Jess then stepped out while you changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay you can come back in!\u201d she announced. You walked back in to find that your mom's clothes fit Jess pretty well. The underwear underneath fit Jess almost perfectly and the shirt and shorts were only a little bit loose. God, she is practically as big as Mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could no longer rationalize her growth as natural. \u201cSis, your growth spurts\u2026 they aren't normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess prayer really does work, huh?\u201d your sister said smiling in excitement, \u201cI hope I grow even more!\u201d Really, neither of you knew what had caused her growth spurts. Was it God? Too much broccoli? Radioactive waste in the tap water? Whatever it was, something had turbo charged her pituitary gland, causing her to experience a sort of hyper puberty that seemed directly related to her sexuality. As a result she was growing and beautifying at an incredibly enhanced pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 think\u2026 maybe we should take you to the hospital,\u201d you said nervously. Jessica pouted and wined, \u201cNo, please brother! Don't! It feels so good! It is what I always wanted\u2014to be big and pretty! I swear there is nothing wrong with me. Please!\u201d You couldn't resist the watering emerald eyes. She always knew how to melt your heart with that puppy dog look. Finally you relent, \u201cOkay, but at the first sign of something bad happening or you getting hurt by a growth spurt and I'm taking you to the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal!,\u201d Jess then piped up, \u201cSo what do you want to do today? Something fun I hope!\u201d \u201cYeah, sure\u2026 video games?\u201d You didn't want to suggest something that involved playing outdoors. If anyone saw Jess and recognized her, they would freak, you reasoned! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I guess I'll just have to beat you at Mario!\u201d Jessica bounded out her room and down the stairs to the family room in excitement. You followed right behind her, noticing the cute bubble butt she'd developed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, the system was hooked up and you were animatedly playing Mario with your sister, trying your best to forget the strange events that characterized the last few days. But you could only ignore it for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey brother. Can you pause the game?\u201d You responded, \u201cSure, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think\u2026 I think I'm about to grow again,\u201d Jess closed her eyes and a look of pleasure washed over her when suddenly you noticed her slowly inching taller on the couch. Her feet slid further away as her legs lengthened and began developing some muscle tone. Her hips widened slightly as she was raised up slightly higher, her butt growing and firming up more. Hidden beneath the t-shirt, her tummy began losing the little bit of baby fat left, becoming very flat. Her waist pinched in slightly, further enhancing her curves. Above that, her bra was struggling against the burgeoning breasts that were now a D cup and still growing. Her face seemed to be maturing as a gasp of pleasure escaped Jess's lips. <i>Was this pleasurable to her?</i> Her pink lips plumped up further and her lashes become somewhat thicker. Her cheekbones were becoming more prominent as all of her freckles and blemishes faded, giving her a model-like look. You watched as her hair grew out, reaching the tops of her breasts which finally stopped at a pronounced DD. The swelled and bulged out of your mom's now too-small bra. Her hair also seemed to be filling out and even becoming a little shinier. Finally, her skin deepened a shade, giving her a slightly tanned look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her body finished growing. It was hard to tell how tall she was while she sat on the couch but you guessed 5'11\u201d. Your heart pounded in your chest as you realized your sister now had a body you would categorize as hot. Her face looked as if she were about 18 or 19 and you couldn't help but think her body was good enough for some amateur modeling or at least showing off in a bikini at the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looked down at herself and then leaped to her feet in unconstrained excitement. \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: Jess keeps experiencing growth surges and by tomorrow morning has become as tall as you are with a well-developed, smoking hot body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Jess asks you if you think she is pretty. Feeling awkward since she's your little sis, you deny your attraction to her. She's not that upset about it but her body senses this rejection as a threat. It responds by dumping wave after wave of pure sexual growth hormone into her system.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica looked down at her body, at her stretched, strained clothes; at her large breasts and ever so slightly tanned skin. Her smile just kept growing wider and wider as she squealed in delight, before looking right back at you. With a gulp, you realised that she was only a few inches shorter than you, now. What would happen when- no, <i>if</i> she outgrew you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother,\" Jessica said with a giggle, looking over every inch of her grown, matured body. \"Do you... think I'm pretty?\" As she spoke, Jessica batted her eyelashes and gave the best pair of puppy-dog eyes she could. As your cheeks began to burn a bright red, you took in a breath of air - noting a slight scent in the air, which you disregarded, you steeled yourself for whatever was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm sorry, Jess, I don't-\" Jessica put on a pout as you spoke, puffy lips curling downwards in a fake frown. You stammered as you continued, desperately trying to come up with a plausible explanation that wouldn't upset your sister. \"I, I don't find you pretty be-because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could offer up a justification, however, blushing and looking away as you did so, Jessica interrupted you. \"It's okay, big brother,\" she said with a smile. \"I-\" <br>\r\nJessica suddenly paused, looking straight ahead, mouth hanging open slightly. Before you could attract her attention again, though, Jessica began to speak once more, a smile creeping into her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, big brother... I can feel it again, I'm... About... To GROW,\" Jessica shouted enthusiastically, before looking straight at you. \"Oh, I hope I get taller than you, big brother! I-I...\" And with that, Jessica's growth began, as her words devolved into a pleasured moan, your little sister inching upwards with every second. You gulped and backed away a little when you realised that her growth was faster than before - and that she seemed to be maturing yet again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's clothes, 'borrowed' from your mother, already overflowing with bulging flesh, began to strain and stretch to contain her growing form, small rips and tears beginning to appear. Though you didn't know it, Jessica's body had interpreted you not finding her pretty as a threat - one that would be resolved immediately, and with the most overkill possible - in other words, dumping as much growth hormone into her as it could. Jessica's moan seemed to go on forever, getting more intense the taller she got. Her breasts, already large, ballooned further, jumping up to an E cup with a fleshy gurgle, before swelling even larger; they seemed to halt at an F cup, rendering your mum's bra wholly inadequate and lifting up her t-shirt with nothing more than immense, perky boobage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's skin itself was improving as well, a pulse of energy running through her that set about removing any imperfections it could find and dropping her skin tone down by just a touch, compounding on the slight natural tan she had developed. Jessica's rear stretched her underwear and jean shorts, her bubble butt getting bigger and larger and rounder, her asscheeks becoming very visible were one to take even the slightest of peeks, actually forcing the back of her jean shorts away from her body! Taller and taller your moaning 'little' sister crept, bit by bit, her clothes slowly tearing themselves apart with the creak and whine of failing fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess' lips suddenly plumped, then plumped further, becoming soft and plush, and a deep shade of red. Her cheekbones became more distinctive in an adorable way, and her eyes seemed to become deeper and deeper with every passing second. Any fat whatsoever left on her washboard-flat tummy was broken down and redistributed to prove mass for her growing body, a faint six-pack coming into being as her strength increased, arms swelling just a little bit bigger - and then just a little bit bigger than that. Your sister moved one hand to her bouncy breasts, experimentally poking at a nipple that puffed larger at her touch; as she began to pinch it and slowly rub at her breasts, her moan grew louder, her tongue flopping out of her mouth as her teeth cleaned themselves and adjusted their sizes and positions, becoming blindingly clean and perfectly uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's other hand reached down to her behind, groping a single cheek as her jean shorts and underwear slowly ripped apart. You could see the hand growing larger itself even as the cheek it squeezed ballooned in her grasp. Her thighs became thicker and more toned, and her hips shoved outwards, just about destroying her shorts with a loud snap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica came down from her spurt, you could smell something... Vaguely nice, but you couldn't quite guess where it was coming from. Jessica's smile couldn't have been wider or more glorious, as she looked down at her busted shorts and straining t-shirt, and- and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, little brother, that feels so goood...\" Jessica said in a sultry moan - God, even her voice had matured! And she was, in fact, looking down at you - by several inches; that last spurt had hit her like a truck, and you found yourself barely able to stop yourself from reaching out and groping a large, soft breast. Jessica giggled and advanced on you, looking down at you from her superior height. She squished her breasts into your chest, stifling a loud moan as she did so, before giggling and locking her toned, mini-muscled arms behind your back in a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I pretty now?\" Jessica asked. </span></div></div>",

Instinctively she raised one of her incredibly firm, incredibly long legs up and brought it around the back of your leg, rubbing your thigh with her toned flesh. She didn't really know why she did it, but for some reason it just seemed like the natural thing to do in that moment. Inside, she was reveling in the sensation of feeling her longer leg against your shorter one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess giggled at your dumbfounded expression as she slowly released you from the boob-mashing hug and stepped back, allowing you to drink in the entirety of her beautiful body. Hell, beautiful wasn't the word for it. Not even hot. Dear god\u2026 Your sister had turned into some sort of a walking wet dream! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snap!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a noise which was quickly followed by a startled gasp from your sister. Quickly your eyes darted up her frame and noticed her lightly undulating boobs, deducing that the too-small bra had finally broken a strap. \u201cOops! I guess my boobies are a little too big for Mom's clothes... Hopefully she won't be too mad.\u201d Jess stuck her tongue out in concentration as she shoved a hand up the bottom of her far-too-tight t-shirt and fished around for the broken bra. Her other hand rested daintily on her wide hips that she'd subconsciously cocked to the side. Having troubles reaching the bra, Jess began arching her back as if to create more space through the bottom of the tee but this only served to thrust her F cup tits further off her chest. You wondered how that could possibly make the bra easier to retrieve but the bulge rising in your pants could care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had some luck anyways. \u201cGot it!\u201d she exclaimed as if she'd just retrieved a rare item in one of her favorite video games. She pulled it from underneath the shirt and your eyes nearly bugged out. Removing the bra didn't cause her huge breasts to sag an inch; they thrust off her chest as proudly as when she was still wearing the now useless thing. <i>There's no way breasts that big can be that firm! </i>Sure you thought of the porn stars in your magazines but they all had fake implants. A bit of drool escaped your mouth when you realized your sister's breasts were real. \u201cMmm, guess I won't be needing that any more...\u201d Jess practically moaned as she daintily tossed it aside. Really, it was a wonder that her overstretched, partially torn t-shirt was even hanging on. At this point it covered her boobs and little else, her massive orbs lifting the shirt up to reveal a tight and toned tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, my little big brother! You didn't answer my question!\u201d Jessica laughed melodiously. \u201cDo you think I am pretty now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, neither you nor Jessica knew that her body was responding to your resistance to her beauty. The chemical response it had to being denied was very similar to the human body's fight or flight response. Whenever danger is present, the body is flooded with adrenaline in order fight back or flee. Jessica's body was developing itself for her pleasure\u2014it's sole purpose to be indulged in lustful desires. One way to bring its owner this is by attracting potential mates. Jessica didn't have a crush on you, her brother, per-say, but you were both very close and she admired you a lot. However, her body couldn't interpret these nuances in attraction and saw your rejection of her beauty as a threat which prompted it to kick its pituitary gland into overdrive, flooding her bloodstream with sex growth hormones. Jess' body was protecting her in the only way it knew how, ensuring she was so powerful and so sexy she would never be \u201crejected\u201d again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you known this, you probably would have answered her question differently.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUmm...\u201d you faltered as you breathed in a whiff of that sweet smelling scent again. You're mind felt strangely buzzed as you tried to think. You shook your head as if to clear it. <i>She's your sister, stupid! Get a grip!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSis, I\u2026 I really love you a lot,\u201d you reasoned, \u201cbut you are my sister. I'm just not\u2026 I'm just\u2026  not attracted to you in that way,\u201d it was a blatant lie but it was wrong to like your sister like that right? \u201cS-so no I-I don't think you are pretty.\u201d The throbbing hard on that you were desperately hiding with your hands was screaming at you to give in and tell her she was the hottest thing you'd ever seen in real life, but your moral convictions and desire to protect your sister kept you from doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica pouted a little in jest but didn't notice as her endocrine system kicked into full alarm or how her pituitary gland began dumping fresh growth hormones into her bloodstream. She also didn't know her internal vitals were naturally enhancing each time she grew bigger, sexier and stronger. This meant that her pituitary gland was bigger, healthier and more efficient than it had ever been, which resulted in a flood of hormones that was even more impressive than the first time you \u201cturned\u201d your sister down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fake pout on her face soon turned into a warm smile, \u201cIt's okay brother! I understand! I'm your sister! I wouldn't expect you\u2026,\u201d Jess paused mid sentence, and the look on her face caused the blood in yours to drain, \u201c\u2026 you to... wouldn't expect\u2026 Ohh...\u201d She tried to stifle a moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHhnrgg!\u201d She gritted her teeth against the wave of pleasure assaulting her body. You could swear you saw her body pulse almost imperceptibly larger. \u201cBrother I can't believe\u2026! I think I'm already having a-another growth spurt! Yess<i>sss</i>!!!\u201d Jess moaned in almost carnal pleasure as she was hit with a wave of orgasmic growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally orgasmic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess' simultaneously surged up an inch in size as her very first orgasm ripped through her frame. \u201cGrowing feels <i>soo good</i>!\" Your eyes widened as you noticed a small wet spot on your mother's tattered shorts. Two more inches of growth filled her body while it continued to mature. It was more than either the over strained t-shirt or tattered underwear and shorts could take; each rapidly tore away from her body leaving every inch of her oversexed body bare for you to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!!!!,\u201d you quickly covered your eyes once you realized what you were looking at, but couldn't undo what you'd seen. The images of your sister's perfect breasts capped with thick rosy nipples and her cute but throbbing, pink pussy etched themselves in your mind. You didn't see a hair in sight on her body except for the beautiful mane of gold spilling down off her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear your sister moaning and begging to grow even bigger, almost like an addict. \u201cYes, yes YES!!! Please don't stop!!! Mmm, I love this! Please don't stop growwwing\u2026 ahh...\u201d Each word sounded sexier than the last and you realized your boner was throbbing just from the sound of her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still she grew as her bloodstream drowned in a cocktail of potent hormones. Jess, lost in orgasmic pleasure stumbled back and instinctively arched her knees to rest her growing, firming ass against the wall. She grabbed her head with her hands as her mind was being wracked with so much pleasure, it was almost more than she could handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/9e94a832aaf19c4122ad0252b7ab08c0/tumblr_njzj0hZAbB1scpvdgo1_400.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://40.media.tumblr.com/9e94a832aaf1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching 7 feet, her body still pulsed larger. Her legs becoming longer and longer in proportion to her body and firming up with impeccable muscle tone. Her hips widened, built to sway sexily from side to side whenever she walked. Her perfectly heart-shaped ass was so large, so perfectly round but so firm with toned muscle that it alone could bring a man to his knees. Above that, each surge of growth was shaping and pinching Jess's already proportionately tiny waist in to create a jaw dropping hourglass figure. The light six pack on her stomach toned and hardened becoming more prominent against her taught skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything that so much resembled a blemish on her skin was eradicated as it became smooth with a perfectly golden all-over tan that glowed with vitality. It was a wonder such a tiny waist could support the most magnificent pair of breasts imaginable. They thrust off her chest, surging in size every time she grew. Each buoyant boob was nearly as large as her own head and capped with a diamond hard nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's face was already model perfect but her growth sent waves of almost imperceptible adjustments that made it far sexier than it had been. Her skin was so perfect it would never need makeup. Her lips plumped even further, now naturally formed into a sexy pout that flaunted their glossy redness. Her nose shrunk a little, becoming a cute button nose and her eyes became deep seas of sparkling emerald. Her hair had changed from dirty blonde into a shiny, lustrous gold. It held incredible volume, each surge of growth causing the river of wavy gold to stretch closer and closer to tickling the top of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not only did her face seem to beg for sex, her body was <i>literally</i> doing so. You and Jess could see the ways her body was maturing and developing on the outside, but underneath the taut skin was a ticking time bomb. Jess wasn't just growing larger or becoming more physically attractive, she was becoming sexier and more powerful in every possible way. Clusters of nerves were growing and multiplying across her body, especially around her \u201cspecial\u201d areas. These were nerve endings designed to pick up and send signals of pleasure. This meant she was becoming more sensitive to sexual pleasure. It now took less stimulation to bring her pleasure, and she was capable of <i>experiencing</i> more of it. In addition, the cocktail of hormones was drastically increasing her body's libido. To meet this demand, her endurance was increasing. Her body was also becoming somewhat more noticeably toned, her muscles becoming much denser and stronger than average without diminishing her beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral growth spurts ago, her body began producing pheromones designed to induce lust for Jess' oversexed body. Her mind was adapting as well, having to be able to handle the increased dopamine levels it was being subjected to and starting to subconsciously learn new motor skills to allow her to use her sexual beauty to its fullest potential at all times as automatically as blinking. Yet deep down within this hypersexualized body, Jess' 8 year-old self hadn't changed. She was still the same sweet, innocent, fun-loving girl that loved her brother, but now she resided in an impossibly mature body that both subjected her to new, foreign sensations and giving her what she'd always desired\u2014more growth and beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shuddering halt, Jess stopped growing at a staggering height of 7'5\u201d. Her breathing calmed, but her skin felt alight with a tingly, pleasurable sensation. \u201cMmm, that felt incredible!\u201d Slowly she pushed off the wall and stood up to her full height, her endless legs making up more than half of it. Your house had high vaulted ceilings, but her head was still only a foot underneath it. She surveyed the family room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh wow\u2026 everything looks so small,\u201d Jess said as she compared herself to all the furniture, her voice unintentionally dripping with sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dick throbbed at the sound of her voice. The air was also filled with a heady perfume that delighted your senses every time you inhaled, but made it somewhat hard to think. \u201cYou can open your eyes now, big brother. I've stopped growing.\u201d Jessica stated matter-of-factually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly spread the fingers covering your eyes and peeked out, seeing the oversexed wet dream your sister had become standing, fully naked. \u201cBu-but!!\u201d you fumbled with your words as you pointed up at her enormous breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess laughed melodiously, \u201cThese?\u201d she grabbed one of her gargantuan tits with a lithe, perfectly manicured hand and hefted it a little, \u201cI don't think I can do anything about these. Can't really hide them anymore\u2026 I don't think any clothes will fit me now really!\u201d She surveyed her body thoughtfully. A huge smile showing off her perfect white teeth surfaced on her face. She couldn't contain her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so tall, big brother! And so\u2026 pretty! Like those girls in your magazines! It's what I always dreamed!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Jessica had become far, FAR more beautiful than any of those girls in your magazines, but her 8 year old self couldn't really fully comprehend the full gravity of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis conversation on the other hand had proven too much for you. Without warning, you felt a wet sticky substance erupt into your jeans unbidden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option A:</b> Jessica is ecstatic with her growth and is feeling super playful. You are feeling uncontrollably aroused and Jessica's oversexed body is turning her playfulness into something far more sexualized than she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Option B:</b> Jessica has always dreamed of growing bigger and bigger while also becoming \"prettier\". But now she feels her body almost aching for more, begging her to be pleased, to become even more powerful. She can't shake the thought that every time she's grown her body has felt better. The persistent tingly, sexual feeling she has now is nice but how pleasurable would she feel if she grew just a bit more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks about her last spurts and has a hunch that she somehow grew because her brother resisted her \"prettiness\". <i>Could inducing another spurt really be that simple?</i> She considers playfully manipulating her brother, doing everything she can to ensure her brother doesn't find her pretty, (no easy task given her overwhelming beauty) hoping this will trigger another growth spurt. Is she successful?</span></div></div>",

The couch looks so small!</i> Butterflies swirled around in her stomach in excitement and disbelief that all of her dreams and fantasies were coming true. <i>I hope I keep growing! What if I grow so big I can't even fit in our house anymore!</i> Lost in her fantasy world, Jessica didn't notice her body quickly becoming aroused at her thoughts of growing even bigger. <i>Mmm, and it feels sooo good!</i> A small trickle of feminine juice seeped out of her special area and slid down her massive, firm thigh while one of her hands quickly began straying down to her nether region to sate its desire. But her hand halted its journey at her toned six pack abs when she snapped out of her daydream, remembering you were in the room. \u201cAhh sorry! I got distracted! So what'cha thinking my little big brother? I'm pretty big now, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you intoned. In truth you had simply been gawking at your sister through the slits between the fingers still covering your face. A storm of emotions waged war within you as your moral side believed in being respectful which meant not staring at your own sister in lust. But the other side of you couldn't stop looking at what was easily the sexiest creature you'd ever laid eyes on. <i>Who cares if it's my sister?</i> You tried to rationalize your desires while your still hard member throbbed in a pool of its own stickiness within your boxers. You were too captivated by Jessica to even notice or cover up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look a little excited, brother!\u201d Jess exclaimed, pointing at the bulge in your pants. Your jaw dropped at your sister's shamelessness. Was she just naive? Did she know people aren't supposed to say stuff like that? Especially little-err-young girls! \u201cW-where did you\u2026 h-h-how do you know about...!?,\u201d you questioned incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess waved a perfectly manicured hand lazily, \u201cPshh! It's not like I haven't heard our parents talking about stuff like that. Plus those magazines of yours...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God! Why didn't I hide those in a better place? Did she get everything from my porn mags? I've been such a terrible influence!</i> You were brought out of your head though as she kept talking, \u201cIt's okay brother. I feel pretty\u2014Mmm,--excited when I grow. We can share in the excitement together!\u201d Jess' voice was both laden with lust but incredibly light and playful at the same time. \u201cCome on brother. It's okay. Really you can take your hands off your eyes now. You're my brother. I don't mind if you look at me. Come on.\u201d A strong whiff of her pheromones filled your nostrils and you felt compelled to drop your hands. Hesitation fading, you now stared at her openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister Jessica was a walking wet dream. An insatiably sultry looking siren. A sexual goddess. Each part of her perfect body excited you so much you didn't know where to look. Your heart rate and breathing quickened as you felt yourself growing harder than you'd ever been in your life. Her legs were endless, golden pillars of lust. Her pussy was puffy and pink\u2014the most beautiful you'd ever seen. Her hips were sultry and wide. The ass you couldn't really see right now was probably sexier than anything your imagination could conjure. Her incredibly tight but toned waist was of sculpted flawlessness. Her massive gravity defying breasts, each almost as big as her head, thrust with such power off her chest that they almost commanded a sense of reverence. Above that, her lithe neck led to a face that was the epitome of sexy, sultry, and slutty while still hinting at your sister's playfulness, kindness and innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20100818/hot_facebook_girls_35.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20100818/hot...</a></span></div></div>",

Where did she learn to walk like that!? She stopped just in front of you and you looked up, her face almost completely obscured by her gargantuan breasts. Yes, there was her height. Even at 6'2\u201d you now only stood at eye level with her sexy abdomen. Jess could sense your arousal overcoming your fear. \u201cWould you like to feel? I'll let you touch me anywhere you like.\u201d She bit her lip and looked at you playfully. Your hand started to reach out to her but you stopped and hesitated. Jess smiled at you sweetly, \u201cIt's okay brother. I really don't mind. Anywhere you like! I promise I don't bite!\u201d The heavy scent in the air was making it very hard for you to concentrate but still you hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess pouted her glossy, red, love-pillows  \u201cI know you've always dreamed of touching a girl's breasts. I see the way you look at them when we go to the mall! Here's your chance brother! I don't mind. Here, I'll help!\u201d She playfully grabbed your hands with more strength than you thought she would have. You were powerless, drool threatening to escape your mouth as she dropped to her knees and placed your hands on her breasts. Her body's massive libido meant her revved up body responded in no time, the mere touch of your hands immediately hardening her thick, puffy nipples. Your heart was pounding itself out of your chest as you felt the nipples growing up into your open palms. Jessica moaned in exquisite pleasure, \u201cDon't be shy brother. You can rub your hands around!\u201d At that she began moving your hands up and down her breasts for you, kneading them into the massive expanse of tit flesh as she discovered what sensations felt really good to her. Her pussy was moistening in response to the pulses of sexual pleasure shooting through her nervous system even though your hands seemed woefully deficient in size to tend to her enormous breasts. She didn't seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lost in a sea of lust and before you knew it, you were ejaculating for the second time today even without direct stimulation to your swollen member. It felt good but all you could think of was how inferior you were to this veritable goddess. You weren't even able last five minutes with her rubbing your hands on her breasts. And yet, your sister cared for you very unconditionally. In her innocent nature, she was not one to judge or to see the world in terms like \u201cbeing in or out of one's league\u201d. \u201cWould you like to feel down here?\u201d your sister excitedly exclaimed as she took one of your hands and guided it down to her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Your heart dropped as your fingers came into contact with her moist, throbbing pussy. Her arousal seemed like it was through the roof. \u201cOohhhh\u2026 brother\u2026 Mmm, that feels so good. Ahh...\u201d And indeed it did feel very good to Jessica. Her oversexed body was so sensitive to pleasure that just her brother's mere touch was almost pleasurable for her as for two ordinary folk having intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the midst of incredible arousal you felt a sense of horror. <i>This is my sister! What is happening to me!? I would never agree to do something like this with Jessica!</i> You withdrew your hand from her wet sex in fear. Surprised, Jess looked down at you, \u201cWhat's wrong, brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I can't\u2026 I\u2026 can't,\u201d you fumbled with your words. Immediately Jess felt a little tingling sensation run through her body that felt a bit like the times she'd grown before. And then a light bulb went off inside her brain. <i>I grew right after every time my brother didn't want to say I was pretty! Am I somehow growing in response to him protecting me as his sister?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess wasn't quite on the money with her assumption but she was close. She was actually growing because her body was hell-bent on fashioning itself to bring her pleasure and anyone resistant to attraction or to giving her pleasure was a threat to the very purpose of its developing nature. The next thought Jessica had was a bit more devious. <i>If my brother tried to stop this because we're siblings\u2026 would that trigger another growth spurt?</i> Jessica's body quivered with desire, her nipples hardening further and her sweet lips becoming even juicier with anticipation. Butterflies began forming in her stomach at the thought of becoming even bigger. Could it really be that simple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked down at the overdeveloped body and knew immediately what she wanted, her mind quickly formulating a plan to give herself what she craved. <i>I'm not really tricking him, right? I mean I'm just encouraging him to be the sweet brother he is! The added benefit is that maybe I'll get to grow some more! And, I mean I can always just apologize to my brother after! Yeah, that's it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess did not reach back for her brother's hand. \u201cIt's okay brother, I understand. Siblings aren't supposed to be pretty are they? Silly me for thinking so! I mean, it's wrong for big brothers to like their little sisters, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small sigh of relief escaped your lips. You didn't think your sister would understand why you pulled away. What had you been thinking all this time by the way!? You glanced at her amazing form. <i>Although\u2026 I suppose maybe...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess saw your ravenous stare and began covering up her breasts and womanhood as best she could. <i>I hope this works!</i> she thought. \u201cI mean I wouldn't mind if you did like me\u2026 but you don't actually think I'm pretty, right? It's because I'm your sister! You're supposed to like other girls\u2014like\u2014like at your school! And because that's... not what good brothers do is it? And you've always treated me really well. You are a good brother and you always do the right thing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head to clear your mind. That sweet aroma in the air was really distracting. But your sister was finally being sensible. Yes, you were a good brother and you would always do the right thing to protect your sis. You nodded in response to her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess started to feel a little tingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling empowered that Jess was agreeing with you, you found the strength to speak and with conviction, \u201cRight Jess. I really love you but just not like that. I mean I'm sure one day someone will find you pretty...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling seemed to be getting stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 but I look at you just as my sister and not as anything else, which is the way it's supposed to be. So we should probably try to at least find something to cover you up with. Maybe a bed sheet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling was really becoming more intense but Jess clenched her teeth and pushed the feeling back as you kept talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really think we need to figure out what is happening to you. It's not normal. I've decided it's time--we need to get you to the doctor so they can figure out what is wrong and put a stop to all this growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess' skin was literally crawling with the tingling sensation now and there was no way she could ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: ... And nothing! The tingling feeling was just Jess fantasizing she was about to grow again, but it was all just in her mind. Well that's lame. Jess starts trying to focus on other methods to encourage her body to grow, not wanting to manipulate you further... knowingly, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Jess has her biggest growth spurt yet, as she surges two more feet (now taller than the ceiling when she stands!) and develops even more, becoming much more powerfully sexy. Jessica doesn't realize it, but her body has fully enslaved you with its pheromones turning you into her sex slave, willing to do anything she asks and wanting her to only grow bigger and stronger. Is her pituitary gland also secreting growth hormone every time she experiences pleasure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption C: Jess doesn't realize the gravity of what she's just done. Now the third time, Jessica's body has attempted to protect her from \"rejection\", it determines that she will never be rejected again. Her body continues to be flooded with wave after wave of growth hormones that just doesn't stop. By the time she's done growing she has become unimaginably, impossibly sexy, her body throbbing with raw power at its new height of 25 ft.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jessica's skin tingled and crawled all over, the overgrown sex goddess's body knew what it had to do. She had been rejected too many times, and it had to find a way to protect her from such and even ever happening again. She simply wasn't big enough yet, she had to be made irresistible - literally. Her pituitary gland, oversized and raring to go, began to flood her system with more growth hormone than even she could handle, and her pheromones were released yet again in a massive burst, flooding the entire room with their sweet scent and effortlessly enslaving you to your sister's will. Now, she was your master. Your goddess. Even if she didn't know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that flood of hormones, Jessica's growth began anew. You gazed in pure, dumb awe at her towering body as she began to rise higher, her pupils dilating as she clenched her jaw shut, moaning and groaning for all that she was worth. Every cell of her body tingled wildly in pleasure, and the sounds Jessica made nearly drove you wild with lust. Sweet-scented feminine nectar began to trickle down Jessica's thighs once more as her body expanded slowly but relentlessly, ever so slowly speeding up and up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer globular, perky breasts snowballed out in size as she surged higher, knelt as she was, becoming ever rounder, more sensitive, and more perfect. Each thick, puffed-up nipple tingled and burned with sheer need, as did the growing amazon's pulsing, throbbing netherlips way down below, and as one hand began the arduous task of groping her swelling spheres, the other slid down past them, past her muscular six-pack - which was developing and growing stronger and stronger, morphing into an eight-pack as her arm moved down past them - down to that puffy, juice-gushing cunt. Two massive fingers slid inside, and merely touching her madly throbbing clitoris - just a single, light touch - was all that was needed to send her over the edge. Her moans became all the more sultry, and you erupted in your sticky underwear yet again from the noise alone. Her head thumped into the ceiling and began to push against it, drywall flaking off in small chunks and pipes bending with the squeal of tortured metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawped as your growing sister - no, your growing goddess - slowly stood, every part of her growing and expanding and becoming more and more magnified with every passing second. Her birth-worthy hips widened to a comical degree, her thick thighs thickened again, gaining both size and definition; her bouncy, juicy rear became ever more so, the jiggling head-sized spheres groaning and creaking audibly as they swelled and swelled, crashing through the ceiling as Jessica rose to her full height. Her moans morphed into a sort of primal scream as she hit climax - but it didn't wane; instead, it seemed to grow more and more intense, ungodly amounts of pleasure causing your sister to begin pumping her slick, wet fingers in and out of her pussy, maximizing the insane rapture she experienced. Her already bronzed, perfect skin somehow grew even more so, imperceptibly darkening as her already blemish-less skin became more and more perfect, seeming to gain a sort of lustre. Jessica's puffy, rose-red lips allowed her tongue to loll out of her mouth, even as they puffed up further, becoming impossibly plush as they brightened a shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica's head crashed rudely through the house's roof, her body blasted out wave after wave of pheromones into the neighbourhood, driving everyone except you wild with carnal lust - though you were almost at that point already. Screaming her pleasure and arching her back, Jessica's chest-dominating globes jiggled wildly, crushing down into the roof and making enough of a hole for you to look up at your goddess and see the underside of her perfect breasts. As non-destructively as she could, Jessica took a step out of the house, then removed her other leg, unaware that the entire neighbourhood was engaged in a vast series of small orgies, almost any and all boundaries forgotten in the place of pure, mindless pleasure. Her pheromones saturated the air to the point that you could almost taste her nectar-like scent just by breathing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her orgasm waned, Jessica puffed and panted, winded by her sheer pleasure. Overdeveloped lungs instantly refilled with oxygen, getting her breath back, and the twenty-five foot tall goddess observed her surroundings, towering over any and all buildings she could see. You quickly exited the shattered shell of your house, intending to - well, something you weren't quite sure what to do, as the pheromones controlling you were sending no instructions. You found yourself gently seized by two perfect hands, large enough to surround your body from neck to thigh, but so careful that you barely felt any pressure at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour goddess smiled a perfect smile, and you knew that everything was right in the world as her teeth seemed to sparkle and shine. She held you up to her perfect face, viridian eyes staring into your soul and gently reaffirming that you were nothing compared to her. \"Oooh, that felt... so good...\" Your goddess said, sultry voice echoing throughout the neighbourhood, drowning out the shrieks and cries of pleasure. You knew that you were truly blessed to be related to such a wondrous, resplendent being such as Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, 'big' brother... Would you like to feel me again? I'm <i>so</i> much more pretty than last time!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh, how you wanted to tell your goddess how much you loved her, how much you loved her body. Jessica, however, wanted to grow more; her body <i>needed</i> to grow more. Even if it was literally impossible for anyone to deny Her of their own free will, that wasn't enough for her body. Nothing would ever be enough so long as she was still even capable fo being hurt in the tiniest of ways. Jessica's voice was like that of an angel, and you desperately wanted to give her the reassurance that her body no doubt craved - but you were still under the total control of her pheromones; pheromones that Jessica didn't even know about, and for a brief time there was a struggle inside of yourself. You wanted to heap praises upon your new goddess; to shout and sign and scream about how beautiful and pretty and glorious her body was - but the pheromones controlling you didn't want that; they wanted denial. Complete denial, and more and more and more growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the pheromones won out. \"No, Jess,\" you said, mouth moving of its own accord. \"I don't want to touch you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you spoke, Jessica's skin began to crawl and tingle wonderfully, all over. She bit her lip and unconsciously bucked her hips, squeezing her thick, creamy thighs together: even the lead-up to her growth was pleasurable, near-orgasmic. Her resplendent body shuddered, the hands holding you quivering as hormones saturated Jess' bloodstream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" you continued, still unable to control your own mouth. \"I don't know if you look all that much more pretty, Jess.\" As frightened as you were under the lusty fog and haze of pheromones drowning your mind, you managed to find a small relief in Jess' face. She was smiling, every one of her teeth utterly perfect, so white that they could probably be used as a mirror. Jess was looking forward to the coming growth spurt, more than she had ever looked forward to anything else in her entire life. \"You still look the same as before your last spurt. In fact, Jess, to me, you still look like a <i>little girl</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour goddess sister threw her head back and screamed in pleasure from the words alone, the sonic shockwave shattering windows far, far away. Juices sweeter than the highest quality ambrosia gushed from her puffed-up, exposed, pulsing cunt, head-sized clit throbbing madly in mind-crushing bliss. Jessica took you into one hand and shoved the other downwards into the sweltering, fleshy vent, driving a pair of fingers in and out, in and out as she flooded the streets below with her pleasure, her scent spreading across the neighbourhood and drowning out even the oppressive musk of her pheromones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's tongue flopped out of her mouth and her eyes unfocused as she milked her fingers in and out of her cunt, juices constatly streaming and flooding out around the digits as orgasms rolled out from her pleasure-center like waves, threatening to drown even her enhanced mind in sheer, unimaginable pleasure. Jessica's body shuddered powerfully, and you heard a soft sloshing noise from inside her vast, perky breasts. <i>Milk?</i> you thought, the idea arousing youeven further - in fact, that was all that was needed to drive you over the edge another time, splattering your cum-stained underpants with yet another load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over Jessica's body, a fleshy gurgle sounded in preparation of her most extreme, berserk growth spurt yet; and as your goddessly sister screamed and screamed as she flooded the streets below, her growth started up. This time, it wasn't in smooth surges like all of her other spurts. It was like an explosion; an outward rush of growing, expanding, ever-perfecting flesh that grew so fast and so large that a rubbey creaking sound echoed for hundreds upon hundreds of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was - just how large just Jess grow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A - Jess quadruples her size in one massive rush of growth, growing so impossibly huge and sexy that her current body really does look like a little girl's in comparison! Her pheromones begin to spread out further and further, however, bringing more and morepeopleunder her control! Will Jess use the mind-controlled tinies as sex toys, or will she use them for some other purpose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B - Jessica's growth spurt is so impossibly massive that she literally can't stop growing! Your denial has ultracharged her growth, and there's no end in sight, as Jessica's body grows and grows and grows and grows, sexier and sexier and sexier, with every passing moment! Jessica's pheromones soon spread out across the nation itself, bringing hundreds of thousands under her thrall as she ascends to giga-scale heights, and her breasts begin to fill up with impossible amounts of milk. Jessica herself, however, is going through changes more radical than ever before - you calling her a goddess was in no way hyperbole, and Jessica's newfound omnipotence ensures that, while nothing is damaged and no one hurt by whatever she does, Jessica's gathering power is soon going to look positivly puny compared to how big and strong and pretty she wants to get!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few moments after Jessica asked if you'd like to feel her again, which her pheromones ensured this time you would eagerly feel your sisterly goddess everywhere you could reach or she desired, all orgies in the neighborhood ceased. Everyone had heard her, and unbeknownst to either of you, her pheromones were beckoning everyone to come and answer the goddess' call. The ultimate pleasure, granting her as much pleasure as they could muster, awaited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed your goddess' surprise as almost simultaneously, the doors of every house in the neighborhood swung open, their occupants spilling out a bit faster than zombies in a zombie apocalypse flick, drawn to her like moths to an open flame. You shared Jessica's delight as she saw everyone beginning to gather around her feet. \"Wow, is everyone here just to see little old me?\" she asked, almost getting off on her own voice even if she's not sure why she sounds like this at the moment, \"Aw, I'm so flattered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica really was genuinely flattered that everyone came out to see her. The last spurt had brought forth tremendous changes that flew straight in the face of science... as if her massive growth over the past several hours didn't already do that. Her body before this spurt was able to process the entirety of what she consumed with extreme efficiency, in order to not interrupt the pleasure her body wanted to grant with needing to use the bathroom. Now, her body hardly needed to concern itself with food at all, drawing sustenance from the pleasure she receives itself. Her breathing was just an instinctive action as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin's natural oils gave her perfectly tanned skin a slick sheen that not only acted as a natural sunscreen far superior to anything man-made, but also prevented dirt and grime from ever disfiguring her perfection, yet never would her skin or mane of gold likely worth more than its weight in that element <i>feel</i> oily - possibly a good thing as her skin had become so sensually sensitive that the lightest movement of air meant her nipples would never again not be erect and the gentlest patter of water from a shower head would send her into multiple orgasms like a machine gun to the point she'd never be able to turn the water off herself. A bath would soon overflow with her fluids from virtually the same effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body, while indeed far heavier than it looks due to her super dense muscles that also had access to ALL of their power should she choose to use it, unlike the typical person, matters little to anything underneath her. As was clear when she grew, her body is able to ignore gravity to some extent. Crushing potential mates would contradict its imperative to grant her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of mates, Jessica would never need to worry about mating with you or your dad even if she wasn't a 25 foot tall giant sex goddess. Her body had adapted to eliminate that concern with you, seeing as how that was apparently your very argument for your continued rejections thus requiring it to grow so vast to crush the threat of your resistance. (not knowing Jessica was never sexually attracted to you at the time, just very adoring of her older brother. It may or may not work again this time)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as a person's body odor can eventually become too strong for even them to ignore, (rarely seen as human culture often demands one wash at least once every few days, preferably at least once a day) Jessica's pheromones had become just too strong for her to ignore. She could now smell her indescribably sweet scent, though for the moment immune to their effects. \"Is... is that me? Since when did I smell so nice?\" she asked, \"Brother? Have I always smelled like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feared to respond, wanting only for your goddess' continued growth and pleasure. This could jeopardize that, but the pheromones directed you to give her an honest answer. \"Since this morning, yes. D-does it trouble you, g - Jess?\" you said, stopping yourself from calling her goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's mind started to work into overdrive. Even it had been greatly enhanced by her growth, rendering her able to think faster than a supercomputer as well as becoming significantly smarter, yet still the same young and innocent mind for now. In a matter of seconds, she got a hunch... \"Sammy, step forward please.\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friend, a redheaded girl with emerald green eyes by the name of Sammy DeMacy, stepped forward. \"Hop on one foot while singing, 'Everything is Awesome'!\" your goddess asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Sammy began hopping on one foot, singing, \"Everything is awesome! Everything is cool when you're part of a team! Everything is awesoooooome when you're living the dream! ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome...\" Jessica muttered in childish delight. You and she recalled how Sammy normally <i>hated</i> being asked to do two things at once, so the ginger doing as she was asked without question confirmed Jessica's hunch. She knew now, without a shadow of a doubt, that the scent her body was putting out was making them comply to her wishes. Her will was their will. But to what purpose? Your world lit up brighter than a thousand suns when she returned her gaze to you and asked, \"So... what do you want of me? I trust you, my brother, have the clearest head here, so maybe you can tell me? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain her pheromones demanded you answer her honestly, as it would make her very pleased and you basically existed to please her. \"I, and everyone else here, wish for your continued growth and pleasure. You are our goddess, and soon the rest of the world will come to know and bask in this too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess, huh?\" Jess muttered to herself, \"I like that...\" It had always been the ultimate end for her dream to eventually become a goddess, or even something so vast and powerful that no word ever invented would ever be sufficient in describing her: anything thought of having already long since paled in comparison an unspeakable number of times over. She could use the effect she has on them to have them voice their rejection of her prettiness, still having not quite caught on to what her body responds to but close enough to not really matter, to induce a MASSIVE growth spurt upon her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought alone becomes too much for your goddess, and she hurriedly placed you on what was left of the roof of your house still stable enough to hold you before immediately masturbating with unrivaled intensity, pumping one hand in and out of her pussy while the other fondles a breast nearly 50% bigger than her own head, pleasured moans causing everyone to climax to each one - and there were several, so turned on by how huge she could potentially get with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally stopped, Jess noticed that her tits were now 65% bigger than her head, and that she'd grown 35 feet tall. She realized that just her feeling pleasure was enough to make her grow. So instead of making the crowd say something they don't really want to, she could encourage them to feel her everywhere to stimulate her growth... and as she grew each touch would feel that much better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her 8 year old mind was able to think clearly for a few moments, and was almost horrified to be controlling people like puppets. Her mind wrestled between the morality of suppressing her friend and your free will and being able to easily grow enormous. If she got big enough, she'd soon be out of their lives and they'd go back to normal, so maybe it wasn't so bad? Ultimately, she made up her mind and with a sigh apologized, \"Sorry everyone...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today has <i>not </i>been a great day. First you got stuck in traffic. Made you miss a meeting that you gathered was important, based on how much your boss chewed you out for it. You ended up spilling coffee all over your desk, and now your keyboard was sticky, and a few stacks of paper were ruined. And to top it all off, the people running the drive-thru got your food wrong! You said <i>no mayo</i>, not <i>extra </i>mayo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only saving grace was that your ride home was smooth. Each traffic light changed green as you approached, as if the gods were smiling upon you. You were just going to go home, relax, and not worry about a thing. At this point, nothing could possibly stop you from at least doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr atleast, that's what you thought until you saw your sisters car sitting in your driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting to find her on your porch, you instead didn't see her at all, although your front door is wide open. More than a little annoyed at the intrusion, you set your car to park and stumble inside to the sight of your sister standing next to your mirror, standing on her tip toes as she measures herself with an extended ruler of yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, what are you <i>doing</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a startled shout as the ruler retracts quickly, smacking her hand, causing her to drop it on the hardwood floor with a loud <b>CLACK</b>. \"Oh, Jack! I didn't think you'd be home so soon.\" \"It's 6, Jessica.\" You respond. \"But what do you mean you didn't think <i>I'd</i>? What are you even doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bites her lip as you ask her this, and stares at the ground. \"I, well...John dumped me, and I can't go to my place.\" \"Well <i>why not</i>?\" you ask in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He </i>has my keys. Took them with him and drove to some... druggy friends place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, and catch sight of the ruler on the ground. \"And measuring yourself? Still can't let it go?\" She scoffs at this. \"Don't be ridiculous! I was just... measuring...things. Like your mirror.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously you don't buy that (considering the websites she looks at when she forgets to clear her search history on <i>your computer</i>), but you let it go. \"Okay, sure. And how long have you been doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've been here for about 4 hours, so...\" \"4 hours? How did you even get in the house? Did you take up lockpicking?\" you ask, surprised that she ever managed to get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack...the whole 'key under the welcome mat' thing is pretty obvious, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" You cringe. \"Forgot about that key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, neither of you say anything. The silence is so thick you could cut it with a butter knife. Fortunately, Jessica speaks up. \"So, where do I sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you decide to put your foot down. \"Well, I don't have a guest bed, and you're not sleeping in my bed. You can use the couch.\" \"What!\" she practically yells, \"You wouldn't make your sister sleep on the couch!\" \"I would, and I am!\" \"You are <i>not</i>! Can't we share the bed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement causes you to cringe again, as you remember sleeping in the same bed at a young age. It was miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...she's a grown woman now. Times have changed, right? Maybe she can hog the blankets a little less nowadays, and maybe she no longer snores? \"Okay, fine.\" you say. \"One night.\" With that, she smiles, and wraps you in a sudden hug, which you reluctantly accept. You're no stranger to hugs from your sister, but you're 5'9, so she's always only been a few more inches taller than you. But she felt...taller, than last time? Or were you imagining things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, bro. I'll go get my keys back tomorrow, promise. I just didn't want to be out and about right now, it's about to storm.\" \"You sure?\" you ask incredulously. \"I thought the forecast said clear skies, and can't you call someone to open your door?\" \"Yeah well, I...left my purse at home. Yeah.\" \"You couldn't use someone elses phone? Or mine?\" \"Well, they're all probably closed at this time of day anyway...you know how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't say anything. It's pretty clear to you that she just wanted to spend the night, possibly to get over being dumped by someone she liked (even though you knew he wasn't good for her), so you let this happen. What's one night over with your sister? How bad could it be? \"Wanna watch a movie?\" she suddenly asks. \"I'll make the popcorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Sandy. I'm a little above average height at 5'8\", though my figure otherwise hasn't really changed since high school... which means I'm sporting B-cups and kind of skinny everywhere else. Sandy blonde hair, sea green eyes, and my skin color is a tad pale. I'm 25 years old, but I'm still single... in fact, I haven't dated anyone since high school. I keep in touch with my parents, as any good person should in my opinion, but I don't have to worry about keeping in touch with the other person in my family...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis! Mind if I stay a couple days with you? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy 21 year old sister, Jessica, likes to keep in touch with me... a little too personally. She has the same hair and eye color as I, but her skin is a bit less pale and more tanned. While she was shorter and less developed than I about 8 years ago, she's since shown our parents' tricks has more than paid off by being quite tall at 6'1\" with an attractive amount of curves topped by C-cup breasts. Of course, right now at my door, she's wearing her 5\" long heels, boosting her height to 6'6\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should say \"no, leave me alone\" and close the door in her face. She's over here almost every week. But, I'm a kind woman and I know for a fact that Jessica would welcome my stay with her at any time for as often and long as I want or need. She's always been fond of me as her beloved older sister, so I understand why she likes to visit often; she misses us living together. So naturally I close the door, and quickly hide all the measuring tools before undoing the latch and say, \"Okay, Jessica. Come on in. But you know my rules: shoes come off at the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't get the door open fast enough for her, as she practically smashes the door open to rush in and squeeze me in a hug. I'm almost positive I see spots in my eyes before she relents. \"You're the best, Sandy! I know I tell you that all the time, but I really mean it!\" she cheers with utmost enthusiasm as she takes her heels off. I really don't understand how she can drive properly with those things on, and she almost never wears anything else on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for that is simple, and ties into our parents' trick. As a child, she was always tall for her age, yet that wasn't enough for her, and always happily expressed a desire to grow even bigger. So our parents used this to their advantage: if she wanted to grow big, she had to eat her vegetables. She devoured even the broccoli I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole and dumped on her plate when mom wasn't looking, and guzzled more milk than a Hummer guzzles gas during our childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica plops herself onto my couch, taking her suit jacket off and opening a couple buttons on her blouse to 'give her girls some air' as she puts it, I ask, \"By the way, I talked with mom and dad the other day about our childhood. Do you remember what they did to coerce you to eat your greens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughs as she answers, \"Oh yeah! And it definitely worked. But I didn't eat just mine, as you so kindly dumped your broccoli onto my plate when they weren't looking! I still don't like that thing, by the way. Whoever thought these little green trees were supposed to be edible originally ought to have been slapped silly.\" she adds, \"Still... that wasn't quite what I meant back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're totally going to be looking up those sites you frequent so often, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You know me only too well, Sandy. It's... It's a shame James didn't want to even try to understand.\" Jessica answers me sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately my heart went out to my younger sister. I almost thought she and James could've been a nice couple together, but the dream she's clung to since she was a little girl, growing into a giantess, scared him away. \"Oh, I'm so sorry... That's... what, the third boyfriend to dump you because of that dream now?\" I say with sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fourth. I know I should be happy for what I've got, but...\" Jessica corrects, but then changes the subject, \"Say, have you commissioned a picture for your old fursona yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not yet...\" I admit, blushing. I almost consider changing back to the subject of her being dumped, but I can sense my sister would rather not go into it further. She's rarely said anything awful about her ex-boyfriends, except if they were abusive or had been cheating on her, but even then she only meant it as a warning to her ex's future girlfriend. I salute her kind heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leave Jessica to her own devices for now, thankful she's long since outgrown her old habit of asking me to measure her when she thought she might have grown... which happened at least once a week when we were kids. Instead, she's gotten into the habit of measuring herself, thus why I hid all my measuring tools before letting my sister in. I love her with all my heart, but I don't want to see her getting her hopes up when she and I both know she's done growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later, I hear Jessica panting and moaning in pleasure in the living room. Normally I'd scold her for masturbating in there and around my laptop as I don't want to clean the potential mess, but today due to her recent break up... I let it slide this one time. I don't want to see her as devastated as when her Mr. Unicorn toy wouldn't stay inflated any longer after years of owning it, and had to say goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, we go out to this Chinese restaurant in town. \"You know, I would've just as happily ate at McDonald's, Sandy... I don't need to be taken out to any place special.\" Jessica says humbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica... it's just an all-you-can-eat buffet. If I wanted to take you someplace fancy, this wouldn't be it.\" I reply curtly. Clearly, she still hasn't eaten at a real fancy restaurant before in her life. Perhaps I should take her to one for the experience someday soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe order our drinks, and then get up to grab and fill our plates with what we want to eat. I note her glancing at the desserts for a moment before going for the actual food as I select what I want. By the time we finish piling food on our plates and return to our table, our drinks have arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything is going normally, with Jessica and I eating... perhaps a bit more than we should have and she still somehow finding room in her stomach for dessert, until we get the bill. The bill itself is unremarkable, and soon paid with a generous tip, but the fortune cookies are where the evening took a turn for the strange. \"Family and friendship are the greatest treasures of all.\" I read from mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's obvious. I wonder what mine reads...\" Jessica responds, just before cracking her cookie open. I notice as her eyes widen as she reads what the little piece of paper has to say, and after a minute reads it aloud. \"If you wish with all your heart, your dreams may come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize you're probably not the first person to receive that fortune, right?\" I remind her gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Sandy...\" Jessica replies, \"I guess we should be getting back, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and we exit. When we return to my place, I opt to turn in early, so I prepare for bed. Jessica on the other hand steps outside for a minute to wish with all her heart for her dream to come true. I knew from the moment she read her fortune she'd do this. Not seeing the harm in it, I quietly wish for her dream to come true before falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wake up the next morning feeling refreshed, chipper even. Normally, I'd get dressed up before letting my guests see me, but as my current guest is my younger sister Jessica... I'm not bothered to. She's seen me not even care about being naked before my morning cup of coffee, so I don't think me wandering into the kitchen still in my nightie is going to at all be offensive to her. I slip on my bunny slippers (a Christmas gift from Jessica, much too comfy to consider returning to the store) and walk into my kitchen, feeling a bit surprised by the scent of coffee already brewing wafting into my nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I pass the living room, I find the TV on, yet no Jessica. \"Strange...\" I mutter to myself, \"Jess usually turns the TV off when she's done watching it...\" I consider looking into the matter more, but my coffee pot chimes to inform all who hear it that the coffee is ready. The siren call of the drink is impossible for my brain to ignore, and thus grabs my undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pour myself a cup of the black substance, mix in a little cream and sugar as I do every morning, and take a sip. Ten seconds later, when my brain can reform itself, I suddenly know what it's like to both drink getting punched in the face by the Incredible Hulk <i>and</i> getting run over by a speeding freight train all at the same time. \"Dear GOD Jess... I just want to <i>drink</i> the coffee, not go ten rounds with it!\" I yell in between coughs, desperately hoping one of my lungs doesn't come up in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry, Sandy! I just wanted to do something nice for you...\" I hear Jessica apologize, though oddly cheery, even for her. \"Um, can you come down here for a second? I want to check something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my... basement...\" I begin to ask, right before it hits me like another dose of this coffee that my sister brewed for me: I had an old measuring chart down there that I'd forgotten to cover up. \"...Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, sis. Do you really think I don't know where you hide the measuring tools whenever I come over? Finish what you can of the coffee first if you'd like, but I still want to check something.\" Jessica calls back and adds, \"And mind your language. I mean, think of the <i>children</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You know... the ones everyone's apparently supposed to think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make my attempt to finish my cup before it finishes me, follow it up with downing what's left of the carton of milk in my fridge, (which reminds me that I need to do some grocery shopping later) and then finally heading downstairs into my basement. If Jessica wants me to measure her for old times' sake, so help me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy basement is pretty typical. An extra bathroom, (because no one likes to be caught in dire need of it when working on something down here) a small recreation room, a laundry room, a utility room for the furnace and hot water heater, and some space for storage. As I come in, I don't see Jessica until she's almost right in front of me, grinning from ear to ear. \"Hey sis! Notice anything?\" she asks, almost bursting with excitement, \"Come on, I know you notice something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very funny. You're taller. But how often do I have to tell you not to wear your heels inside my house?\" I answer in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grins even wider as she replies, \"I'm not wearing them. I'm barefoot right now.\" she stands against the old height chart that marks her as 6'6\" and adds, \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look towards her and to my complete shock, Jessica wasn't lying: her bare feet are completely flat on the ground! \"Oh my god...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? I grew last night! After I made my wish, my body felt all tingly like it was asleep and then this sense of... <i>something</i> opening a tap into my veins came for just a few moments. I didn't think much of it because after I felt really sleepy, but when I woke up this morning I'd grown as tall as I am in my heels!\" she says excitedly, \"Isn't this awesome, Sandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I knew this would've been precisely what she'd wish for, having only known her for 21 years now, I still can't help but exclaim, \"That fortune cookie shit was <i>real</i>?! And of all the things you could wish for... <i>this</i> is what you use it on?! You could have wished for world peace or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Never</i> mock the cookie, sis.\" Jessica replies, sticking her tongue out childishly. Ever the kid at heart. \"Wishing for world peace would be a wasted wish. Yeah, it sounds all noble and everything, but who wants to live in a world of robots? Conflict is a part of free will: we're all going to have our disagreements now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, this is a dream of mine. You and I both know I've wanted this almost my whole life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Jess... It's just... I guess I feel as though I have to say that. Truthfully, I'm glad you've gotten your wish, even if 6'6\" isn't the most impressive for a wish.\" I admit to her and we embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not a moment into our moment, I feel my sister's body begin to shudder. I soon feel her slim hands rubbing against my back as they expand, her breasts pushing into mine between the fabric of our tops as they swell. I can see her blouse straining even more as its wearer's body grows larger than it was ever meant to contain. I notice Jessica's sea green eyes glaze over lightly in her pleasure; no doubt her panties are starting to dig into a very sensitive area even as her bra strap surely starts to dig into her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly begin to lose the feeling of my slipper-clad feet on the ground as Jessica's embrace begins to lift me off the ground. At this point, I can hear a few rips and tears forming on her clothes, and a couple of blouse buttons snap and fall uselessly to the floor as her chest becomes more than it can contain. I fear that she'll completely outgrow her clothes, as I don't have anything that will fit her any better than what she's currently outgrowing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, my fears prove to be unjustified for the moment as Jessica's growth comes to a stop at... dear god... 7'1\" tall. An entire foot taller than yesterday! Her cleavage is exposed, and looks amazing within the too-small blouse and bra trying to hold her breasts in, which in of themselves I swear look bigger than usual even accounting for her size. Her skin also appears to be slightly tanned, and banishing imperfections from its surface. \"Oh wow that felt good!\" she exclaims before noticing she's still holding me, \"Oh, uh... I'll... set you down now, sis...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sets me down, the slight movement is enough to cause her bra to snap. \"Ah, that's actually a relief...\" she comments as she digs the thing out. Maybe it's because there's practically no room left in her blouse, but when Jessica finally retrieves her bra, her breasts don't even sag an inch. \"I guess I've gotta go clothes shopping... Nothing at home is going to fit me like this.\" she says, though the gleam in her eye strongly suggests she's looking forward to potentially growing bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so lucky I work at a big and tall store in town, Jess. I might be able to get you a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that for me? Oh thank you! You're the best sister ever!\" Jessica joyfully exclaims, crushing me against her in another affectionate hug.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name's Emma. I'm more or less your typical 14 year old girl. Blonde hair, blue eyes, 5'3\" tall, currently wearing B-cup bras, and right now being bored out of my fucking skull in school. It's not the high school precisely that's boring, I just have about as much interest in French as that unsavory girl Jessica has of being nice, which is to say none whatsoever. I can't believe we're still stuck with her after all these years... Wasn't grade school enough punishment? Look, if I've angered some Karma god somehow, I'm sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the bell rings for lunch. I gather my things and get up out of my seat, heading out the door to head for the cafeteria. Yeah, Jessica with her 5'7\" height and C-cup breasts would be there, but there's not much I can do about it... without getting in trouble with the principal and upsetting my older sister, anyway. I promised myself years ago I wouldn't upset her, not after calling her a name and it taking the better part of a day to get her to calm down enough to hear my apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emma! Have a good French class?\" A boy says as I sit next to him in the cafeteria. His name is Jack. He's 16, about 5'10\" and has a mop of brown hair on his head. He and I've been friends for years. I notice these days he's gaining some muscle, which is good; he's been tall and lanky since he was 12. About damn time puberty gave him some bulk. Not likely to become the star quarterback, but average Joe isn't bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack... I'd say yes, but mommy told me not to lie. So I'll say it was shit.\" I replied, eliciting a laugh from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone comes up next to me and says, \"Emma! That's not a nice thing to say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my head to see the tallest and biggest girl in our school: Olivia. 16 years old, 6'2\" in height, D-cup breasts tastefully on display, and her bare limbs show just a bit of underlying athletic muscle. The blue-eyed blonde usually has her hair up in a ponytail, and she makes it work. It's a bit of a crying shame though that for all her beauty and all the attention boys give her, Olivia's nervous about making any serious use of it, almost too kind for her own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do I know all this? Olivia is my older sister. Four years ago, she was tiny, at just 3'7\". <i>I</i> towered over her at 4'5\". Then one morning she made a fuss about growing a whole inch. I was happy for her, since she hadn't grown in years and she hated it. She loathed being teased about her height and called a little girl, though showed inspiring inner strength to not snap back, so she had every right to feel good about the smallest spurt overnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know that this was but the start of something crazy, for the rest of the morning, Olivia had more of these spurts. Inches at a time. Like just before the last morning class before lunch, we ran into each other - literally. I couldn't believe my eyes, as she'd grown 2 feet taller since yesterday! ...her clothes were also ripped to pieces, barely covering her modesty, and weren't helped by the crazy amount of blossoming her body had undergone. She and Jack were worried she'd outgrow the entire damn building before the end of the day, thus were rushing outside to avoid potentially wrecking the school. (I don't think that was what they had in mind when they wrote the School's Out song... Blown to pieces by a girl growing out of it. Definitely not)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as Olivia is my sister, (and having an excuse to skip the rest of school is not something I'd pass up on) I tagged along. We got the permission from the school nurse, then headed home so she could put on something better than the torn rags she was wearing before going to the mall to go clothes shopping for her. There was still a fear she might have more spurts, but a girl's gotta have <i>something</i> to wear, right? It was quite a shock to our parents that we were home a bit early, and more so in seeing the new and improved Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were taken to the hospital, where we were tested. While such rapid growth was unheard of, it turns out both of us have untold growth potential; in other words, theoretically we'd grow for the rest of our lives. For Olivia, it was like the switch to control this had suddenly been flipped on, thus the huge burst over a single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the doctors could've been talking straight out of their asses, but over the past four years Olivia has grown into her ideal body, and... well, no one calls her short anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I still don't like French, sis. <i>French fries</i>, I love. Poutine will probably kill me in the end, but until then I'll keep scarfing it down. I'll steer clear of Quebec for the rest of my life, or drive straight through it if I absolutely must.\" I say to Olivia in the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could at least say so without swearing, Em.\" Olivia retorts as she sits down with her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see Jack ogling my sister for a minute before returning to his own meal, to which both of them blush slightly when their eyes meet. Oh how the other boys are jealous of the average Joe being in with the hottest girl in school... and her younger sister of course. I've heard a good number of the rumors going about, like they're having sex almost every other night, or he's getting a threesome with me and her. ...D-do these people have <i>nothing</i> else to do with their spare time?! That's a load of non-castrated male cow dung! (AKA bullshit)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us have been best friends for years. I think Jack and Olivia have a crush on each other but don't quite know how to admit it yet. What if it doesn't work out and destroys their friendship? Maybe one of these days I'll lock them both in a closet and see what happens... but that might be a bit cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well. If it isn't Freak 1 and Freak 2! Are you sure you should be outside a laboratory? Growing for the rest of your lives... Who would want to end up as some freaky giant?\" Jessica remarks as she brings herself where she doesn't belong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised, Jessica. Try typing 'giantess' in Google some time when you can spare a moment of your presumably busy schedule.\" Olivia responds, doing an admirable job trying to stay polite I might add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that supposed to mean?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means leave the three of us alone, Jess. Don't you have puppies to kick or something?\" Jack tells her, the boy getting annoyed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'd much rather put you losers in your-\" Jessica starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she falls silent as my sister stands up, a good 7 inches taller than Jessica, and angrily shouts, \"Place? Yes, Emma and I have an oddity about us. It's no secret. We just have to accept it. But you don't seem to have caught on from four years ago when I clearly showed you I wasn't a little girl anymore. Your harassing us should have come to an end that day. So kindly do me a huge favor and BACK THE FUCK OFF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFun fact: Olivia disdains swearing. So when my sweet, super kind sister does swear, the entire room falls so dead silent one can hear a pin drop. Such as right now. Jessica, in her shock, did exactly as Olivia told her to and retreats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my gosh... I don't know what came over me...\" Olivia stammers as she sits back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you had it in you to swear more than twice in your entire life. Congratulations, Olivia! You're human!\" I try to reassure her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'm Olivia. I'm 16, with blonde hair I prefer tied in a ponytail and blue eyes. As for my figure... I'm happily above average. 6'2\", D-cup breasts that I tastefully show off in the nicest tops my allowance can provide, and generally nice curves everywhere else. I've even got some athletic muscle - my abs are hard as stone. Currently, I'm happily working away in my Math class while my younger sister, Emma, toils away in French, her least favorite subject... as she would no doubt express in very... um... <i>colorful</i> language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma is 14 years old, just over a couple years younger than me. As such, some of my earliest memories are with her already in my family. We share the same blonde hair and blue eyes, though she tends to go for a more unkempt hairstyle. She stands 5'3\" tall, about average for her age, and her breasts are about a B-cup. The rest of her body's developing nicely if I do say so myself. She's honestly a nice girl, but still hasn't let go of the illusion that she can at all make me worry less about her, and thus tends to act a bit tough for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this act is a bit of a strange tale. Four years ago, I was tiny, at just 3'7\". Emma towered over me at 4'5\". One morning, I woke finding myself an inch taller from the previous night. Having been teased about being short most of my life was terrible, but what really stung was being told that I was just a late bloomer, and that my time would come. Mom would always repeat that whenever I complained about my size, and it hurt each time. So naturally I was excited that my puberty was seemingly finally kicking in. ...thankfully, Emma and my best friend Jack understood my reason for excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know that this was but the start of something crazy, for the rest of the morning, I had more of these spurts. Inches at a time. After my first class ended, I rushed to the bathroom as I felt a strange warmth building up, and got in a stall just in time to watch myself grow almost a foot taller and considerably curvier in a single spurt! I couldn't believe my eyes, as with another spurt, in front of Jack, no less, I'd grown 2 feet taller since yesterday! ...my clothes were also ripped to pieces, barely covering my modesty, and weren't helped by the crazy amount of blossoming my body had undergone. Jack and I were worried I'd outgrow the entire building before the end of the day, thus rushed outside to avoid potentially wrecking the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon ran into my sister Emma, literally, and she came along. We got the permission from the school nurse, then headed home so I could put on something better than the torn rags I was left with before going to the mall to go clothes shopping for me. There was still a fear I might have more spurts, but I couldn't go around naked. It was quite a shock to our parents that we were home a bit early, and more so in seeing the new and improved me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were taken to the hospital, where we were tested. While such rapid growth was unheard of, it turns out both of us have untold growth potential; in other words, theoretically we'd grow for the rest of our lives. For me, it was like the switch to control this had suddenly been flipped on, thus the huge burst over a single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the doctors could be in error, but over the past four years I've grown into my ideal body, and... well, no one calls me short anymore. Still, while the doctors believe the growth will be slow once we reach adulthood, I'm unsure whether to be fearful of it... or excited. Those spurts did feel very nice, and even thinking about them turns me on just a bit. And... I think Jack is turned on by the idea as well. He's filled out a bit over the years, now 5'10\" in height and enough muscle to be average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI admit I have a crush on him, but what if it doesn't work out between us? I-I don't want to destroy our friendship! I know the other boys in school want to go out with me, and they do some nice things for the chance... though I don't want to seem like I'm taking advantage of them yet I don't really want to go out with them. Jack has been my best friend for years, and has always been there for me when I need him most long before I grew into what I am today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo during lunch, I find Jack and Emma talking, the latter uttering a curse word and requiring me to remind her it's not a nice thing to say. I know it's a lost cause to make her stop, especially since everyone here uses them. Emma believes she's always had to make sure I don't have to worry about her, but she doesn't realize that it's pointless for her to try: there's nothing she can say or do that would make me worry about her any less. She's my sister, and the day I stop worrying about her is the day I die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... there's Jessica. She used to be everything I wasn't: tall, curvy, and mean. These days, she only has her viciousness over me, though in some small way, I must thank her. I used to worry about potentially looking like a slut until she actually called me one. Repeatedly. Apparently because I was superior to her and wanted to drag my name through the mud to try and retake the top spot in the social ladder. At first I ignored her. Then I tried to politely ask her to stop. Both instances seemed to only encourage her to continue if not insult me with it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left me no choice. I couldn't take anymore, so the last time she said it in my face, I stood up to her and... I told her to fuck off. Really loudly. I could have sworn I heard a pin drop on the floor, the room fell so silent. Jessica was so shocked she's never called me a slut since, but I also learned that day that I shouldn't worry about what people may call me. Some will call me bad names anyway no matter what I look like, and as long as I'm happy with my body, likely to slowly continue growing for life as it is, then that opinion is all that matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I didn't know what had come over me to do that, and it almost pains me to believe I might have gained a little more respect through that way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who's up for some Smash Brothers this afternoon?\" Emma asks at the table in the present, \"Or do you and Jack have plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Em... you and I have a doctor's appointment after school.\" I remind her, \"It probably won't take very long, but we might not have time to play after depending on the amount of homework we have and how long we're at the doctor's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Right... Slipped my mind. Shi- I mean shoot.\" Emma replies sheepishly. \"Is what we've to look forward to for the rest of our lives really that fascinating? Or maybe they want to see just how indigestible cafeteria food really is. I swear I've put cardboard in my mouth that tastes better than this.\"</span></div></div>",

A model of what all big sisters should aspire to be - at least in her mind - she's never hesitated to leap into action, no matter what's troubling you, be it bullies or something as simple as homework. Despite being headstrong, a little arrogant and a little too obsessed with her own athletic body (and her matching brown eyes and hair), Rae somehow never manages to really get on your nerves, no matter what she does. You <i>are</i>kind of woried about her, though - She's always been taller, stronger, and smarter than you, but recently her behaviour has seemed less caring and more... domineering. She'd never hurt you, but you can't help but get the feeling that her attitude towards you isn't entirely altruistic or even for your own benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversely, the other growing sister on offer, Tabitha, is a sibling you rarely see - maybe once a day if you're lucky. The raven-haired, green-eyed and above all, excessively pale girl is a fan of holing herself up in her room for most of the day, and is very much not a fan of human contact - to the point of nearly crippling social awkwardness. With your parents on an extended holiday, however, you and Tabitha are forced to spend time with one another - and your mousy, curveless sister is the first one to realise that something very much out of the ordinary is going on...</span></div></div>",

At 15 years old, Katie has entered into a bit of a punk rock phase, and has also become a little bit rebellious, as most teens do. Despite her new-found almost-rebellious attitude, however, she's still the kind, sweet girl you raised her as - just with a lot of denim clothes and a growing sense of sarcasm. Being in the middle of puberty, Katie's body is undergoing some rather dramatic changes - dramatic changes that are only becoming more and more dramatic as Katie begins to grow past what is normal... Or possible. Katie'd never think of hurting you, but she might let her newfound freedom go to her head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext are Hannah and Abby, both of whom are 14 years old. A loner, Hannah is only really comfortable around family members - so you and her twin sister, Abby. Rail-thin and raven-haird, with brown eyes, Hannah relies on her emo-ish looks to avoid talking to other people, keeping her hair long, though immaculately clean. Rather short for her age, Hannah is in fact perfectly comfortable with her height and un-curvy body. In fact, growth would be one of the last things she would want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby has much the same body as Hannah, with the same black hair and brown eyes, though she is less thin than her sister. Where Hannah is a loner and somewhat shy, Abby is calm and laid-back, often putting the minimum amount of effort into what is required of her to succeed. Abby would most likely be apathetic to her growth... at least on the surface. Secretly, she thinks her body could use some improvements, and she certainly wouldn't react as badly to her growth as Hannah may.</span></div></div>",

She is so kind hearted that her dream is to somehow become a superhero, like she sees on TV. In fact, she is so obsessed with this. She often dresses as her made up superhero she pretends to be and wears a spandex-bodysuit that would like something like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.girlsdanceclothes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/kids-spandex-bodysuit-512x800.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.girlsdanceclothes.com/wp-cont...</a> Only with some added features like a symbol and the likes. She has a pretty thin figure with very short tomboy cut blonde hair and blue eyes. Her older sister now, Terra. Thinks her acting is childish and she should grow up and act more her age. While their father is completely supportive of his daughters, especially Anna's, but sometimes he too feels his daughter needs to grow up, just a little though. Now if Anna were to become a Giantess. She would use every minute to save folks from burning buildings, helping cats down from trees and the likes. She would never hurt anyone, even if provoked. Though however, she has little understanding that being a giant is nothing of what it's cracked up to be. Clothing problems, food, bumping into things, not knowing you own strength and so much more will play a factor into her story. As she will soon be wishing to shrink back down to a normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur second Choice of the Evening is a set of identical twin young girls by the name of <b>Chlo\u00eb</b> and <b>Jackie</b>. Both being 13 years old. Now the only thing that makes them different is one small secret one hides. Chloe has a hidden Giantess fetish and loves to playfully destroy model cities and fight her stuffed animals. Now this doesn't mean in anyway she would ever want to cause harm to humans or any living creature if she were to become that big. But she does like to break stuff in a playful way and if a giant monster would to appear, she would so want to kick it's butt. While her identical twin Jackie is the exact opposite. She fears of anyone, especially herself  growing that tall. Now her fear is somewhat justified since their dad was pretty tall, standing at 6'3 with the rest of his family having a pretty good long track of tall family members, especially on the girl's side. So for Chloe, this is great news, but for Jackie... well not so much. As far as how they both look, they for the most part look and dress the same. While at times folks not being able to figure out who is who, even with their Dad and Mom, it does get a little old to be honest. Both girls have brunet hair and is mid-cut long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur next options is even more Daughters still!  </span></div></div>",

Passed over by puberty and pretty much invisible in any social situation, Mimi's sudden, unexplained growth will slowly cause people to become interested in her, and while she doesn't mind growing, she hates the attention it brings - and everything you do to try to make her feel better is only going to cause her to grow bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRae is a friend that you both like and dislike at the same time.

Lacking curves but making up for it with solid muscle, Rae is stronger than anyone else you know, and definitely far stronger than you, with your slim, short frame.

She was quite smart, but rarely showed it.  And as far as size went, it was really hard to compare her to anyone else you knew.  Standing a solid 6'4, Rae was made of muscle.  This always intrigued you, because you knew she never went to the gym, but was always bigger and stronger than anyone else you knew.  It was also odd because her parents weren't that tall at all.

Kimi is also a genius, which she's tried to keep hidden from her parents since she was a child. Despite all the complements she receives on her looks and height, she still has her childhood fantasy of growing bigger and bigger. And if anyone could figure out how to make such a thing a reality, it'd be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah - 18 years old, 5'6\" with B-cup breasts. A decade ago, she was a very quiet and shy girl that had difficulties making herself heard. Presently, she's much more open. Her mother, Jasmine, is a full 6'4\" tall, and Sarah finds herself fantasizing about being taller and sexier than anyone she knows since that dream 10 years ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily - 10 years old, 4'5\". Lily tries to do what she thinks is right, but unlike most kids her age that can't wait to grow up, she's terrified of it. She fears once she starts to grow, she'll never stop. But when her fears are eventually realized, will she still be scared stiff of it... or begin to feel that this growing thing isn't so bad after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie - 23 years old, 6'4\" with B-cups and an athletic build. Cassie loves growth. She's often written giantess growth stories and role played as a giantess, but the blue-eyed brunette still fantasizes about if she really were a giantess. So when her body begins to respond to her long-held desire to grow, she just may never want it to stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, we can look at more girls to pick from if these don't appeal to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning sun pierced through a crack in the veil of a young woman's curtains, causing her to stir. \"Mm, not yet...\" she groaned. A minute later, Kimi Thompson threw the covers off her body and sat up in her bed. \"Fucking sun... I was having a wonderful dream, but no, I must slip back into this dull existence where I'm a mere 6'3\"...\" she grumbled, quite upset she'd been torn from her dream. While normally she'd wear a night gown to bed, this morning she was clad only in her lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as long as her eidetic memory could recall, Kimi had always dreamed of growing tall and beautiful. While puberty had done wonders for her, making her one of the tallest and most popular girls in high school, she was still a bit disappointed it seemed to level off at her current 6'3\" height. She knew from the fact she was easily the tallest in her family that she was fortunate to have her long legs and curvy body in the first place, but it didn't stop her from fantasizing on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slipped her nubile nude form into the confines of the shower stall of her parents' house, possibly for the last time as she prepared to head for a prestigious university when the term started, Kimi let her mind slip into one such fantasy, imagining herself slowly outgrow the stall and the house soon after. Her long, slender, well manicured fingers found their home in her crotch as she masturbated to a screaming climax, continuing with her shower afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the bathroom door. \"Kimi? Are you alright in there, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mom. Just got a little carried away reminiscing about last night's fun with Mark.\" she replied, her hand playing with her snatch as she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, why do you do this to yourself? Whatever happened to my sweet, innocent little Kimi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sweet, innocent, smarter than a damn supercomputer and bored out of her mind little Kimi discovered sex and how gratifying it was.\" Kimi retorted, \"And when was I ever little? Hell, 12 years ago I was taller than most 10 year old kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was another reason she'd been so popular at school. While rumor had it the reason her marks never wavered from at least 99% was that she'd fuck her teachers for them, she never touched any of them. If anything, she'd take a few moments of her time to help them understand what they were trying to teach. However, she'd several boyfriends during her time, and enjoyed having sex with each one on multiple occasions, though not to the point of truly being a slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, by the end of her last year in high school, she made it quite clear to her parents just how intelligent she truly was. She certainly got a good scare out of them upon letting Rimi, her former robotic double she built when she was 5, show herself to them. Kimi loved her with all her heart, and was certain she was truly alive. She never told Rimi what she really did with her boyfriends behind closed doors. She may be coming up on 14 years since she was activated, but she still had the mind and body of a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Kimi and her mother didn't see eye-to-eye - figuratively or literally. Her mother had difficulty letting go of the past and accepting her daughter was smart enough to build the world's most advanced robot at age 5 while engineers were still celebrating getting humanoid robots to walk without falling over, and especially wasn't pleased with her sexual conquests. She also felt Rimi should attend school, despite Kimi pointing out it was unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kimi finished her shower and got dressed in a casual pair of short-shorts that accentuated her long legs and a nice, if a little short, tank top that exposed a generous amount of both her cleavage and midriff. Exiting the bathroom, she looked her mother in the eyes and said, \"I know you're still my mother and all, but I'm a grown woman now. Take pride in that, and respect my decisions for how I want to live my life. Rimi will also be coming with me, as I know you'll unwittingly mistreat and neglect her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see her as just a robot, and a means to relive the past, not as her own living entity. She cannot perform her own maintenance, so in your care, her efficiency will eventually decay. What's worse, even if you could muster up the will to perform Rimi's maintenance, she's unable to age, while you're unable to stop aging. In short, either you'll unintentionally kill her, or yourselves, if she stays here. I cannot and will not let that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on up here?\" a voice called out. Kimi and her mother turned to see Kimi's dad looking up the stairs towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women walked down the stairs to join their beloved man in the kitchen, both hoping to have him agree with their side of the debate. Kimi's relationship with her father was more positive than with her mother, so she believed he wouldn't automatically side with his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing them both out, he remarked, \"Hm, you both have valid points. But, I'm going to take neither side. You're forgetting whose desire really matters on this.\" Looking to Kimi, he added, \"And I expect you to respect Rimi's decision if she chooses to stay with us. Perhaps leave us with a manual on how to perform her needed maintenance if it comes to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi very nearly facepalmed. She'd failed to consider that as her own living entity, Rimi should be free to choose for herself. If it was taken away from her, she could end up resenting both sides, which was the last thing any of them wanted. \"Rimi? Could you come to the kitchen please?\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of excited footsteps could be heard racing down the stairs before what seemed to be a roughly 7 year old version of Kimi skidded into the kitchen. The clothes she was wearing hung extremely loosely from her childish frame, though hints of better fitting matching Hello Kitty tee shirt and shorts could be seen here and there. \"Yeah, Kimi?\" Rimi replied, unconcerned with the fact she looked absolutely ridiculous practically swimming in Kimi's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We require you to make a choice. As you know, I am headed for university tomorrow, where I'll be staying on campus. You can either stay with me there, or with mom and dad here. Know that I won't be upset with you should you choose the latter, and I'll still visit when I can find the time to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi could see the pain in Rimi's eyes. \"Can't... Can't I have both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could stay here while attending university, I would not be asking you to choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith teary eyes, Rimi seemed to mull over her options. Eventually, she embraced Kimi and replied, \"Mommy... daddy... I'm sorry, but I want to go with Kimi. I'm happy you've accepted me since you've known about me. I really, really am. But...\" she paused, as though about to say something extremely profound, \"I don't know what Kimi would do without me! Oh, and she knows best how to do my maintenance. That's kinda important too, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimi stifled a snicker. <i>More like getting to play dress up with my clothes, huh Rimi? Then again, wearing my hand-me-downs is normal for you...</i> she thought to herself, instead saying as she returned the hug, \"Don't you worry, Rimi. We'll be sure to visit mom and dad as often as we can. I'll call the university to make special arrangements for us. I'm sure they'll be willing to accommodate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of her confidence on the matter stemmed from having revealed her intellect publicly, which along with her near perfect marks, drew many big name universities in the US to her like moths to a flame. She'd yet to accept or decline any of their offers, fueling a competition for who'd gain the prestige of having arguably the smartest person in the world, if not recorded history, grace their halls. The one she chose would be out of their minds to not bend over backwards to keep her from looking elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, it disgusted Kimi, and she almost wished she hadn't disclosed it, but what's done was done, and she could at least make use of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Kimi had gotten in touch with the likes of Harvard and Oxford, both of whom declined her request. Allerson University, however, got her in touch with Jake Allerson, who was more than happy to arrange accommodations. He seemed especially interested in Rimi, but all she could do was hope the man's interest in her robotic sister wasn't for all the wrong reasons. Still, this was her best option, and the man had offered to waive the tuition if she and Rimi could meet him in person, which was appealing...</span></div></div>",

Still, it hadn't been enough of a distraction for Kimi's mind to not dwell upon what this Jake Allerson person could want to see her robotic sister for. She was aware of the family's reputation, but with such wealth, a good reputation could be bought. She'd no reason to suspect anything sinister, but her worries persisted, even well into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, her attempts to sleep in were foiled by the curtains being pulled wide open.

We gotta get going to see Mr. Allen!\" Rimi greeted, as enthusiastic as any 7 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's <i>Allerson</i>, Rimi.\" Kimi corrected, \"But very well. I'll get dressed and we'll go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, both girls had gotten dressed, with Kimi opting for the same clothes she wore yesterday. She drove herself and Rimi in her car after some breakfast and a cup of French vanilla coffee to fully wake up, having not slept that well due to her worry. Fortunately, the trip was about an hour before they found themselves pulling up to a modest little mansion. There was little doubt they had the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got out of the car and approached the door. \"May I help you, Miss?\" an elderly gentleman greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kimi Thompson, and this is my sister Rimi. We're here to see Mr. Allerson. He should be expecting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Follow me, please!\" The two did as instructed and followed the gentleman indoors to what seemed to be the living room. It featured several plush chairs that practically begged to be sat in. A Wii U was hooked up to the large flat screen TV. \"Master Jake, the sisters Kimi and Rimi Thompson are here to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you, Alfred.\" Jake replied, smiling pleasantly. \"I'm Jake Allerson, and I personally welcome you to my home. Would either of you like anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to know why you wanted to see Rimi, for starters.\" Kimi stated, her cool, calm voice belying her nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle aged man chuckled and replied, \"Is it wrong that I simply wish to marvel at her? Although it seems I'm not the only one she's piqued the interest of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a young brunette rushed into view. \"Hey! I'm Megan.\" she greeted. \"And aren't you an adorable one! What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! I'm Rimi! My sister Kimi built me years ago!\" Rimi replied, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! So you're kind of like a Purifier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a Purifier?\" Rimi asked with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind. I just didn't think it possible to actually encode a consciousness within a robot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was necessary for Rimi's original purpose,\" Kimi admitted, \"But I didn't know the full scope of what I'd created. I'm unsure if I could repeat it, or even if I should try, but I will not relinquish the blueprints to construct robots like my sister for any sum of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting continued between Kimi and Rimi and the Allersons for some time. Kimi slowly relaxed as she analyzed Jake and Megan, finding her original fears to be unfounded. The latter, who was slightly younger than her, insisted on showing off her vast game collection, and even let them try some. The former seemed to be a very loving father, and kept his eyes locked with those he was speaking with. Curious, and with little else to do today, Kimi decided she and Rimi would stay a bit longer so she could study the family further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon, Jake offered Kimi a chance to see the university a bit early, as well as meet some of the people attending. Intrigued, she graciously accepted the offer, and Megan came along for the ride. Rather than be forced to take her car, she and Rimi were given a ride in the family's limousine, which she appreciated greatly. \"Okay, what's with that look you've been giving me and my father for the past few hours, Kimi?\" Megan inquired during the ride, \"It feels like I'm being put under a microscope or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to analyze others when I meet them, such as yourselves.\" Kimi explained. \"I-I'm sorry if I've offended you, I-I was merely curious...\" She feared her actions may have driven yet another person away, recalling the numerous times where babysitters refused to come back during her early childhood because of her. Sometimes she envied how easily Rimi got along with others, though it did lead her to worry about her robotic sister and the intentions of those wanting to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... don't know much about making friends, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I ever truly be someone's friend if I could not allow them to know that I'm super intelligent? Kids can be mercilessly cruel towards anything they perceive as different...\" Kimi answered, \"So, no, that is one of very few things I really don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you don't need to worry about it now, do you? Why deny people the chance to get to really know you? If they can't accept who you are, that's their problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the limo arrived at the Allerson University campus grounds. As Kimi exited the vehicle, she was almost immediately struck by how large and sprawling the campus grounds were, having never seen a university campus before in person. She and the others were close to the dormitories, separate buildings for men and women as far as she could guess, but the university building itself appeared to be at least a minute's walk further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the dorms, Kimi noted the campus was abuzz with activity, yet what really captured her attention was a young brunette with practically the body of a goddess. As the woman spotted them and closed the distance with surprising speed, Kimi found herself having to look way up to meet her gaze. \"Yeah, I've that effect on people the first time...\" the woman admitted sheepishly before kneeling down to a less neck-straining height. \"Meg Jenkins. Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kimi Thompson. A pleasure to make your acquaintance...\" Kimi responded, allowing her hand to be almost completely engulfed by Meg's in a friendly handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Your boobs are huge!\" Rimi exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rimi!\" Kimi shouted, blushing with embarrassment, \"You shouldn't be saying things like that in public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are pretty big... but so is the rest of me.\" Meg nodded, then added with a wink, \"Drink lots of milk, kiddo, and you might just grow up big and strong like me! It does a growing body good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, my sister just needs to build me that big. I don't need milk for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not about to do that, Rimi.\" Kimi informed, \"That would be too drastic of an upgrade. Besides, I'd prefer to not have to look up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is she-?\" Meg tried to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The most advanced robot on this planet is none other than my little sister.\" Kimi confirmed, almost proudly. \"Though perhaps that term doesn't fit her, given how Rimi's very much a living entity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group resumed the tour of the campus, now joined by Meg. Rimi wasted no time in asking for a ride atop the huge girl's shoulders, her delight clear as day on her face when Meg obliged her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the tour, a couple places caught Kimi's attention in particular. The first was what seemed to be a shop class. While the materials within were rather crude compared to what was currently in Rimi's construction, it'd still be an ideal location to perform her little sister's maintenance at the very least. The second was a laboratory. She may be able to fashion a formula within those walls to make her dreams come true...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're a pretty average guy. Not exactly lucky with girls, but they don't hate you and you've utmost respect for them. At any rate, you're on your way back from the local comic book store with a few new comics to read when you spot a group of kids bullying a little girl relentlessly. Naturally, your sense of justice cannot allow this to go on, so you rush in to try and help the girl. \"Hey! What the hell do you kids think you're doing?!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullies look towards you, then continue to bother the girl. That is until a young woman storms towards them, her jade eyes practically ablaze with fury. \"So is this what the cool kids these days do? Pick on little girls? I've got connections to all of your parents, and when I tell them what you've been doing... well... your summer break is going to go south real fast.\" she informs them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group disperses as soon as it becomes clear they're outgunned. You kneel in front of the little girl to check if she's all right. She sniffles and nods, and thanks you and the woman for scaring the bullies away, introducing herself as Tabby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you get your first good look at this young woman. She's about average in height and bust, but she's blessed with virtually flawless skin the color of rich cream and golden blonde hair. Her jade green eyes are hard to take your eyes off of, though it's pretty clear to see she's ready for the beach with her excellently toned figure. Even her hands seem to evoke perfection. \"You're welcome, Tabby. I'm Sarah. I was not unlike you, once. Quiet, shy, and picked on by bullies because I seemed like an easy target. Fortunately, bullies of today are just as gullible as when I was your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah. A pretty name, for a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty girl? Like I haven't heard that one before...\" Sarah interrupts, giggling. She turns her attention back to Tabby and asks, \"Say, would you like us to walk you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabby nods and you follow her and Sarah to her home. Tabby's dad opens the door once you reach the place and picks the little girl up to her delight. You and Sarah politely refuse to come in, but Tabby's dad nonetheless expresses his gratitude for looking out for his little girl, mentioning to let him know if there's anything he or his wife could do for the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... A child being reunited with her loved ones. That never gets old.\" Sarah remarks with a smile on her reddish lips as you and she start heading back. \"Say, what do you have there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some comics...\" you reply nonchalantly, yet feel an urge to keep what they are specifically hidden to the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That much is obvious, Marcus, now what are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to keep them hidden, but Sarah surprises you by flipping you onto your backside on the grass and then sitting on top of you. \"These muscles aren't just for show, you know. So now, about those comics...\" she says with a smirk, claiming the comics from your hand with ease. \"Hm... I fail to see what's so embarrassing about these titles. I mean, it's not like one of them is My Little Pony or anything. Not that I've anything against that, but I can see why someone wouldn't want to be associated with the 'brony' tag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Can you get off me now? This is getting kind of awkward.\" You ask carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly. Actually, I think I've seen you around... I think we live across the street from each other. Too bad your name's not Sean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not important.\" Sarah says as she gets off of you and even helps you up before returning your comics to you. The two of you head the rest of the way back, and sure enough you live right across from each other. However, before you can turn to head to your home, the blonde grabs your arm and tugs you towards her home. \"You may as well meet my folks while you're out here, Marcus. They're both home right now, so it's the perfect opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay?\" you say, not sure what to make of the situation, but er on the side of not considering this a date - even if Sarah just about looks like she could be the queen of the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah opens the door and yanks you inside, then offers you a seat at the kitchen table. Shortly after, she introduces you to her parents, who introduce themselves as Garth and Jasmine. Jasmine is... a tall drink of water, standing at 6'4\" and a sizable D-cup bust, while Garth is about 6'1\" in height. Judging from this, you suspect Sarah still has some growth left in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a glimpse of her room, with everything neatly arranged and a couple of ponies placed here and there. \"Like I said, I've nothing against those that adore these colorful ponies. I like them, too.\" she tells you as your eyes move on to the neat shelf of books... and another shelf filled with comics. The young woman even sets up her old PS2 to play one of her favorite games with you. \"Okay, I admit this has all been an elaborate scheme to befriend you. Well, since I saw you in the park wanting to try and help Tabby, anyway. I've... not had a lot of experience at this, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that Sarah has been looking for a friend for some time. Well if she's going to go through this much effort to befriend you, you may as well give her a chance. Not to mention she's quite pretty. This friendship would prove very fortunate later on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the day goes on, you learn a bit about Sarah's life. Her parents' fighting had turned her quite shy early on when she stumbled upon them, running into her room in tears shortly after. Several years later when she was 7, her dad left after a huge argument, leaving her and her mother Jasmine devastated and causing her to become further withdrawn in her fear that it was her fault her father left. Bullies were merciless at this time, but a 17 year old boy named Sean scared away a group of them that were harassing her one day. The two became best friends while he babysat her for a day while her mother had an important business meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver a year since he left, her father Garth returned to his girls, explaining his greatest mistake was leaving them to begin with, and recently finally resolved to try to return if they would have him back. Considering he's here today, it's pretty safe to conclude they happily accepted him back into their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Sean's family decided to move. Neither he nor Sarah were at all happy about it, but he also had college to consider. \"He keeps in touch and visits sometimes, but it's been much less often these days since he got a job. The hours are shit and he hates it, but he needs the money to pay the bills and the experience to get anything better...\" Sarah explains, \"His family actually lived in the same house yours is in now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the bullies, they bothered her a bit less as puberty set in for all of them, but it wasn't until high school that Sarah finally snapped. The guy currently teasing her was surprised to find her actually standing up to him and told him off. She had found her voice, and she wasn't going to put up with being picked on any longer. And of course some of her former bullies futilely attempted to woo her as her body developed into something attractive. \"Seeing as how they just moved on to other targets, if they had no interest in changing their ways I had no interest in going out with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Sarah finally allows you to go home. Your parents naturally question where you've been, and you answer them truthfully after apologizing. Once satisfied, they let you go to your room with your new comics, but not before informing you of when dinner will be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you finish breakfast when there's a knock on the door. Your dad gets up to see who it is as you put your bowl and spoon in the dishwasher to avoid getting yelled at for it. \"Yes, how can I help you? Oh? Well I don't see why not... Come on in.\" you hear your dad say and watch him step aside to allow Sarah to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marcus! I hope this isn't a bad time to have come over... I just wanted to show you something.\" Sarah says sweetly, though you notice that her posture is slightly weird. Before you can dwell on it, she asks, \"Mind if we go into your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... s-sure. Right this way...\" you reply, face beet red as you lead her out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to wear protection, you two!\" your mom yells after you, achieving the previously thought impossible feat of making you blush even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, Sarah almost immediately guesses the location of your room... and once she closes the door behind you... \"Don't worry, you can keep it in your pants. I assure you, my mom can be just as embarrassing even if I wouldn't trade her for the world. I swear, can't a boy and a girl go into one or the others' bedroom for privacy without their parents thinking it's for sex?\" she informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief, you ask, \"So what was it you wanted to show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple things, actually, but I don't want to show your parents just yet. The first is,\" Sarah explains, and then you discover why her posture was a bit scrunched as she straightens up. She's noticeably a few inches taller, her clothes not quite fitting right and exposing a little more of her midriff and ankles than they're supposed to. You also notice she's considerably bustier than yesterday, though her ass doesn't seem to have benefited quite as much. \"I'm starting to grow now! Uh, my chest hasn't developed quite as much as it looks... my bra's playing a not unwelcome trick, but GOD was it a pain in the ass to get it to clasp closed this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, starting to? You mean you expect to grow more?\" you exclaim, \"I mean, yeah your parents are tall, and your mom's busty and all, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is something I've been... dreaming of for over a decade. Ever since the night before Sean was to babysit me, I've had a dream where I grew... really, really big. Like dwarfing buildings big. I also gradually became able to achieve amazing things, like being able to safely sit on top of this building like a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night, I was visited in my dream by... well... by myself. This other me scared me for a moment, but she just smiled and asked me if I wanted what the dreams have entailed. I said yes, we embraced, and... I woke up having grown this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not quite sure if you believe Sarah. \"The same dream everyday for 10 years straight?\" you ask incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyday, but far more than what can be coincidental. And not exactly the same one either, there's one where I got in a panicky fit and got yelled down for it, and another where I wound up close to a mile tall and trying to spur my growth further...\" Sarah answers sheepishly, \"Anyway, Sean told me before he left that he hid something in this room. I'd like to find it and see what he left for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he couldn't just give it to you then... why? Did he even tell you where to find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why... And the only hint he gave was that when the time was right to find it, I would. I've bugged him about it whenever we chatted or he came over and he just said I wasn't ready to find it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went over this room with a fine-tooth comb before you moved your stuff into here, and never found anything. No loose floorboards, no false bottoms, no hidden panels in the closet, nothing. You suspect Sarah may have done the same before your family moved in, so you wonder if this Sean fellow really left something here for her. Still, you're not about to argue with Sarah, so you let her look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Did you ever change this bed? It looks just like Sean's old bed...\" Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never got around to - what are you doing?!\" you say as she pulls the top mattress off... revealing a small opening in the box spring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah carefully lifts out a small shoebox and opens it on your desk. \"To my soon to be not-so-little goddess Sarah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know when or even if you'll read this, but I hope we're still siblings in spirit. I wish I could offer you the world, or at least a place to stay with me when you're old enough to live out on your own, but I'll probably be paying off my tuition and bills with what little money I can make by then. Know that I'll always be in your corner rooting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love, Sean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's jade eyes fill with tears as she finishes reading, holding the letter to her chest. \"So sweet of him...\" she remarks joyfully before helping you restore your bed.</span></div></div>",

Still, you expect to find something else within that shoe box, but then again why would he leave something valuable in case it never got discovered? Of course, you've only just met this girl, so you don't know what would classify as valuable to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the letter does leave a couple questions in your mind... \"Siblings in spirit?\" you ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... like a sibling, but not related.\" Sarah replies, \"We're like brother and sister to each other, but we have two separate families and aren't related. At least, as far as we know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this 'soon to be not-so-little goddess' part? Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh. I <i>told</i> Sean about the dreams, doofus. I... guess he wrote it assuming this would be happening when I'd find it. All part of the 'finding it when the time is right' thing.\" Sarah says, before starting to look noticeably flushed. \"Oh... I-I think I should get out of this house before I can't hide my height from your folks any longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, y-you mean you're about to grow?\" you stammer, not really at all sure what's going on, \"But why hide it from them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potentially naked girl running past them? Doesn't that seem like something you don't want them to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...good point.\" you concede.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah opens the door to your room and exits to head outside, with you following. Your parents seem too distracted with their current activities to pay attention to her and you slipping out of the house, despite being kind of noisy in the departure, but you don't try to discover what has their attention so strongly. Why add more answers you have to somehow provide?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you and Sarah slip out through the patio door into the backyard. The blonde girl looks terribly ill, and you believe you might feel her burning up if you put your hand on her sweat-laden forehead. However, before you can take a step forward to check on her, Sarah seems to relax her entire body. When she does, to your alarm she begins to visibly stretch taller before your very eyes! You guess she was 5'9\" a moment ago, but now she's roughly even with your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother surge, and she's now taller than you. Sarah's tank top lifts higher above her midriff, slowly exposing her bellybutton. Her pant legs recede further up her smooth, practically hairless legs even as the button fails, narrowly avoiding hitting you. Her cleavage looks ever more impressive as her breasts grow a bit faster than the rest of her, and it likely wouldn't be long before at least her bra breaks. \"Ah! Shoot! Marcus, would you mind helping me get my shoes off? I really don't want to ruin them!\" she asks quickly, though her voice almost has a hint of inviting something a little more than just taking her shoes off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you rush towards the growing young woman as she plunks her ass on the grass near the in-ground pool. Thankfully she hasn't tied her shoelaces into particularly difficult knots, so you're able to untie them and with great effort, yank them off her socked feet. As a result of the effort on the second shoe in particular, you end up falling onto your butt on the ground, staring at the Converse logo proudly emblazoned near the back. \"I'm okay...\" you remark weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good... Thanks. I-\" Sarah begins, right before a snap is heard from her back. \"I just broke my bra.\" she states as a matter of fact, \"Besides that, I really like those shoes. An acquaintance of mine, Minnie, recommended I give them a try, so I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Sarah's growth continues while she casually tugs the useless bra out of her increasingly too small tank top. Her pants start splitting at the seams as her legs become too thick to be restrained. Yet as it seems she would completely grow out of her clothes, her growth stops. You don't know whether to be disappointed or relieved. Sarah smiles as she says almost teasingly, \"Sorry man. Guess I'm not going naked just yet. Shame I couldn't have at least torn out of these socks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah reaches over and pulls the overworked socks off her feet before planting said feet on the ground in order to stand to her full height. You behold her head rising well above yours, her too tight clothes threatening to snap off at any moment. You trace your eyes down to her abdomen, which is flat as a washboard with the slightest definition of a six-pack developing just beneath the surface. Her arms also have maybe a bit of muscle showing. \"Holy crap...\" is all you can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? I think I'm about the same height as my mother now!\" Sarah comments, again in a slightly sultry tone, \"I mean, it's a little creepy at first, but this is kind of thrilling.\" Her moves are surprisingly fluid, seemingly well practiced despite having just grown to what she's guessed to be about 6'4\", the same height as her mother Jasmine. It's honestly turning you on, if just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, nearly everything she does now is starting to arouse you. Is she unconsciously <i>flirting</i> with you? How can anyone do that, though? Regardless, you ask to try and clear your head, \"Um, what am I supposed to do with your shoes? And how the hell do we explain this to your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walks over to you and bends down to help you up. \"I'll take my shoes back, thanks.\" she answers with a heartwarming smile, \"Well, mom kind of already knows. I couldn't really sneak past her, and I also told her about my dream all those years ago. Still, I'll just have to tell them up front. And get in touch with Sean to let him know I've finally found what he left for me. Eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why eventually? Why not get in touch with him now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... because he's probably busy right now! If he's working right now, I don't want to do anything that might get him fired from his job.\" Sarah replies to your question, \"God knows it's hard to secure one these days. I've even tried the Baskin-Robbins down the road from the comic store and they wouldn't hire me. I don't even have a criminal record or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the sense that Sarah's hesitant to get in touch with Sean for other reasons, but you decide not to push the issue. Regardless if she considers you a friend or not, your gut tells you not to anger the girl who's already taller than you and is likely going to be growing even bigger in the near future. Surely she'll do it when she feels comfortable doing so. Taking another glance at her, you note that Sarah and her mom are indeed quite comparable at the moment. You can scarcely imagine how much bigger she's going to get, even if your thoughts keep coming back to it repeatedly.</span></div></div>",

Which was something she did a lot during the weekends when she wasn't in school. Her folks owned a trampoline and an in-ground pool as well, so there was quite a few things she could do in the back of her property. They even had one of those lovely gazebos with an indoor fit pit to use. Which during forth of July or other special occasions, was packed with family and friends alike. Her neighborhood was one of those typical upper middle class ones. Which in turn meant it was relatively safe and a good place to raise kids. However now... a new neighbor had moved in and she was a little on the odd side. Maggie's parents didn't feel safe with their daughter being outside when she was without someone watching her or one of her friends being with her. So they thought she would be safe in their own backyard... so they thought however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she jumped up and down on her trampoline, someone was watching her. That someone was her neighbor. She watched Maggie closely and smiled as she jumped up and down on her trampoline. She got really excited when she did a back-flip and some other tricks she kind of knew how to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I wish you were just a bit older my dear... maybe then we could be together.\" The pervert neighbor said to herself quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maggie flipped again, the neighbor put her plan into action and yelled out for some help. Maggie heard this and stopped immediately. She looked in the direction she heard this cry for help and rushed over to the tall fence on the left side of her property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hel-Hello? Is someone there?\" Maggie asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yes, I need some help. I've dropped my glasses and I can't see with out them. Could you please come help me?\" her neighbor pleaded with her. Maggie paused and knew her parents told her to stay away from their neighbor on this side. Though they were never really clear on why this was the case. Maggie wasn't the type to ignore someone's plea from help. So she rushed over to her neighbor's yard and went into the back. She found the woman on the ground and she must have been in her younger 20's at best or if she was older, she really took care of herself and then some. She looked up and then asked if someone was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie was a little hesitant at first to answer because she was still thinking of why her parents told her not to go over there. But she answered with a stuttered, \"Ye-yes, yes I am miss.\" Her neighbor smiled and asked her to help her find her glasses. Maggie walked over to her slowly, but as she noticed where the glasses were, she moved in more quickly and handed it to her. Her neighbor grabbed them and placed them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-now! This is so much better. Thank you so much sweetie, I don't know what I would have done if you weren't so kind to help me.\" she said with a big happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie blushed a little and said it was no problem. But as she was about to walk away, her neighbor stopped her and asked what her name was. Maggie turned to face her and once again was hesitant in responding, but did respond slowly but surely. \"My-my name is Maggie, miss.\" Maggie left out her last name since she felt uncomfortable giving that out too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neighbor smiled and complimented her cute name and then replied, \"Well since you told me your name, it is polite for me to tell you mine. My name is Kelly Yang. It was nice to meet you Maggie.\" After Miss Yang finished her sentence, Maggie blushed once again with her nice words. But just as she was about to leave once more, she was stopped again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh by the way Maggie, I got this box in the mail and it was addressed to you. I was going to hand it to you, but no one seems to like me around here.\" Miss Yang said with a caring tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Maggie the box and was about to open it, but Miss Yang stopped her just short of doing so and told her she needed to open it when everyone is asleep tonight and to tell no one about it. Maggie thought this was really odd, but the lady was very nice to her and she didn't seem so bad, plus she said it was for her and it came through the mail. So why would she lie? (in her childish mind, at least) Anyways, Maggie thanked her and left her backyard. Miss Yang smiled ear to ear as she watched Maggie walk away, admiring her young butt... despite being about as curve-less as any other 10-year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Maggie returned home, she was so curious as to what was in the box. She looked at the box and it had her name of address, but where it came from was all faded out, almost like an old address sticker was used. But she awaited till nightfall to open it, even though again it made no sense to. When she opened it, it was...</span></div></div>",

She dreams of becoming one of those beautiful and sexy Brazilian models the world knows so well. She is the kindest girl you can find off the southern hemisphere.

So if she were to grow too tall, she will be sadden by the jokes and remarks she would receive. But like was mentioned before, she is the kindest soul you'd meet off the southern hemisphere. So she wouldn't dare to hurt anyone for any reason, unless it was to protect someone, but even then she is not found of being mean in a sense of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeong / Age 9 - Born in South Korea, but recently moved to America. Yeong is fascinated by how tall people are in this country and mistakenly finding Giantess content over the internet at the transfer school she is going to. She has grown more and more obsessed with everything that is GTS. Even going as far as to make herself look like she's grown by wearing ill fit clothing. But she is not a fan of the vore and destruction aspect of it. Though she will soon find out, being a giant isn't all it's cracked up to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMin-Hee / 16 - A Asian-American, who has just turned 16, is working hard as a intern to becoming a future boarding school teacher. She loves being around kids and loves teaching them even more. However, she has a dark secret she hopes no one ever finds out. Since it would be the end of ever having a job at this school, but also her social standing. You see, she has a major GTS fetish and likes it so much, she got a job to teach at a elementary barding school so she can live out her fantasy in a sense. She likes to wear very tall heels and just like Yeong above, to wear ill fitting clothes, but probably not enough to get her in trouble with the staff or the board. But now she does have a true passion to teach and the likes, but what will happen to her when her fetish and reality start to cross and twist?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, it seems that much of their information about human psychology and biology was... Inaccurate. Y'La stands at a mighty seven and a half feet tall, with muscles and curves to match her size. Extremely pale skinned, with green hair and golden eyes, Y'La would stand out even if she wasn't so tall. Due to her creators' lacking knowledge of human psychology, however, Y'La sees nothing out of the ordinary about her appearance, and her personality is excessively cheerful and bubbly - in fact, her first task upon planetfall is to find a friend, in order to gather information more quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this would be bad enough on its own, but Y'La's creators apparently didn't understand that humans stop growing. At all. Ever. And thanks to her engineered personality, Y'La won't ever think a single thing is wrong, even when her toes could cover entire countries. Neither will she understand why the little humans run away from her, instead of wanting to play or talk.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Y'La was an interesting creation. By human standards, the way her mind had been especially engineered to carry out a specific task would be considered excessively cruel. Unluckily for her, the species, that bred her did not come with any such moral hubris. Though they possessed a great deal of knowledge, that knowledge was drenched in the blood of centuries of battle; wherein the conditions were a breeding ground for an intense push for the pursuit of knoweldge by <i>all </i>members of their kind! If only it weren't for barbaric purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring one of many great wars, genetic engineering pushed forward to increasingly unethical levels, even to them. It started out with weapons being welded to flesh. a firearm that could be triggered with an arm muscle. A propulsion device that could be controlled with <i>new </i>muscles. And eventually, instead of modifying existing soldiers, they created new ones. Of the two sides, whose causes for battle were lost to the history books, one emerged staggeringly victorious, thanks to its <i>staggering </i>army of specifically created soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that way, the purpose for which Y'La was born is seemingly antithetical to the the recurring motif the species represented. She was programmed to be nice, happy, friendly, and all other sorts of human adjectives, in order to gather information about humanity. The aliens hoped that with more knowledge on human culture and life, they would be able to establish contact as quickly as possible in order to trade for resources. So they made her as human as they thought possible, essentially copying guides on the human body from the planet earth, with little regard to specifics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them, her human details were far too perfect...so perfect, she was imperfect...and that would be the fatal flaw which could possibly doom the planet they were attempting to make contact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY'La had scarcely gained consciousness for the first time when planetfall was engaged, and the pod she was secured in rocketed out of the alien ship. Her mind reeled from many sensations all at once, not used to this sensation...or any sensation! But drilled in instincts took over, and she found herself smiling inside the pod as fire lit up the porthole. Intellectually, she knew some assumed basics about being human. She knew how to walk, how to talk (albeit, exaggeratedly), and how to act on at least most normal human situations, from the perspective of an alien species. Eventually she would then be picked up, though she didn't know that, and the information would be forcefully extracted from her, an operation that almost certainly kills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fate had other plans for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts streamed into her head. No, words! And she spoke, despite no-one being able to hear her. Like she had been speaking for decades. \"I'm spinning! No, falling! Falling..to earth! To make friends! When am I going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her words, and thoughts, were finished, they were deafened by the sound of a rather forceful impact! However, it didn't seriously hurt her in the way she would've thought, and by the appearance of a deep blue all around her, her mind caught up to her. Water! She had landed in water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a lever on the pod, a hatch flew off at the top, allowing her to take a step out and breathe her first breath of fresh air. She was going to like this place...it felt like home. Wait...it WAS home, right? Now she was confused. \"I...why was in that...pod? To make... friends! But...why would...hm...\" she says to herself, finding that she doesn't know the answers to more than a few questions. But her programmed personality causes her to not dwell on those facts, and her face contorts into a smile again, as she decides to survey her surroundings, looking for someone to call a friend. She finds that she is...</span></div></div>",

Gotta find land, get warm!\" Looking out to the horizon, she spotted a strip of whitish-yellow. \"Sand! Land!\" Without another thought, she leapt into the water. Obviously, at least to natives of the planet, if the air was cold then the water would feel even colder. Her shriek echoed over the waves as the alien girl desperately windmilled her arms in a frenzied swim to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassachusetts wasn't exactly known for its beaches even in the warmest seasons, and especially not during winter. Of course, there was always the odd exception and in this case the odd exception was Bridget, a petite brunette. Ever since she was a child, Bridget had been fascinated with the sea. She'd saved up for her own aquarium tank, but couldn't yet afford fish, so for now she was stocking it with natural shells and near-shore sea creatures like sand dollars and washed-up starfish. With a Tupperware container of salt water in an old Radio Flyer wagon, she wandered the beach in full cold-weather gear to find more knick-knacks for her soon-to-be fish sanctuary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shriek of panic caused Bridget to stand bolt-upright, looking out to the sea. The water was frothing from something flailing, and it was coming her way. As it drew closer, she realized it was a girl! In some sort of purple bodysuit, with platinum blonde hair so light it was practically white, the girl appeared to be using her arms like steamboat paddles in a frenzied attempt to swim ashore. Bridget couldn't blame her; even just wading into the shallows to pick up displaced critters, the water was fuck-off cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY'La continued to swim even after she'd reached land, dragging herself along the beach and still babbling a litany of synonyms for \"cold\" before she bumped into a little dune. She blinked, sat up and crossed her eyes to see the granules on her nose. \"Sandy...? Land! I'm on land,\" she laughed with childlike enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite fearing for her sanity should she interact with this girl, Bridget couldn't just leave her to freeze. The poor girl was still shivering fast enough to pass for being battery-powered, her softer parts jiggling all the while. That bodysuit left nothing to the imagination... \"Uh, hey, you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green-haired girl sprang up from the sand almost faster than Bridget could track, her shivers replaced by quivers of excitement. \"A friend! I've found a friend!\" She leaped forward and tackled Bridget in a huge bear-hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wagh! What the hell!?\" She tried to pry the strange girl off her, but the cold girl had a surprisingly powerful grip. \"Lemme go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'kay!\" And like that, the girl released her and sat happily beside Bridget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette shook her head. \"Okay, listen, who are you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...Where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired girls words seemed to bounce around in Y'Las mind like a ping-pong ball, before her head cocked to the side slightly as she responded with: \"From Earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget didn't know how to respond to that, so she just stared. Was this girl really <i>this </i>stupid? Or was it the hypothermia? Even as the strange blonde girl smiled, her body was shivering up a storm, as much as it seemed like she was fighting it. Even her teeth was beginning to chatter as she gave a toothy grin. Unfortunately for Bridget, she couldn't help but feel sympathy for her fellow human being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't told me your name, you know.\" Bridget asked. \"My name?\" Y'La replied. \"Yeah, your name. What's your name?\" Y'La thought about this for a few moments. She had never considering her name until now, but found she already knew the answer. \"Y'la!\" she finally stated proudly. \"Yuh-La?\" Bridget repeated, eliciting a nod. \"Well, Y'La, you don't look like you have anywhere to go, and I can't leave you out in the cold...do y'wanna come home with me to warm up?\" Bridget asked, wondering if she would regret this immediately, or much later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nY'La sprung a smile even larger than her last one, if you could believe it. \"Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" she babbled, jumping out of her sitting position and standing proudly on the sand, before wrapping Bridget in another tight hug. She wanted to complain, but instead found herself awestruck at the fact that she was breast level with this girl. She was 5' 11\" herself, but this weird lady was huge! And...busty, apparently. She had to be at least 8 feet tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip was so tight, though, it felt like she was going to suffocate. Looks like this girl really doesn't know her own strength. \"Okay, you can let go now!\" Bridget squeaked out, and Y'La complied, dropping her onto the sand. Part of her knew this wouldn't end well. \"Can you grab my wagon? I'm gonna go get the heat going in the car.\" Y'La nodded furiously, and before Bridget took even 2 steps, she heard the sound of the entire contents of the wagon falling into the sand, as apparently the giant woman was lifting the wagon right over her head. \"Good...you got it.\" Bridget deadpanned, before sighing. \"Let's just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by the way, the name's Bridget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget was again shocked by the strange girl she picked up at the beach. Not because of her staggering height, or any hidden features, but because of how...confused she seemed to be. The girl was poking the heater in the car like it was an alien object, before staring through the car windows with eyes full of wonder. Just where did this girl come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cryptic answer from earlier didn't help much, either. Earth. Duh, earth! She meant more specifically! But is that was this girl thought was the right thing to say? Was she stupid? Mentally damaged? Or did she just not know any better? Why was she in freezing cold water at this time of day? And her 'suit'...Bridget shuddered. The girl takes up a lot of space, and on her way into the car, Bridget touched the suit. It felt like...a completely new texture. Like if Metal and Leather had a baby. And the designs on it looked, well, tacky, but also pretty alien. Infact, it didn't look like much of a wet suit at all...she had no idea what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, they had arrived at Bridget's place. \"We're here!\" she announced, and Y'La just stared at the sight before her. \"Wow...\" she muttered, apparently pleased with what she was seeing. \"So many doors!\" Bridget rolled her eyes. \"Let's go. My apartment is upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget didn't have it in her to be surprised by the girl at this point, and it didn't seem like she would be anyway. Once again, Y'La didn't say a word as she took in the sights and sounds of the apartment she found herself in, though the only thing to hear was the fireplace she was in front of. Bridget was no expert on dealing with hypothermia, but getting the person warm seemed like the right course of action. So a blanket and fireplace later, Y'La was <i>still </i>shivering, but she <i>might not </i>die. That's a step up, in her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Bridget flipped on her (rather small) TV, Y'Las eyes were on it like a hawk. \"What's that?\" she asked. \"A TV. It's kinda hard to explain, so just watch something with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they watched TV for hours. Bridget, because there wasn't much else to do while you hang out with someone you don't know, and Y'La, because she was so enamored with what she was watching. It was so intriguing, so...educational. Luckily for her Bridget pointed out when something was fictional after noticing her taking in everything like fact. So now she understood fiction much better. Y'La was becoming cultured, and bonding (at least to <i>some </i>degree) with Bridget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed. The sky was already darkened by clouds, but now it seemed like the whole sky had vanished, leaving cold emptiness outside. Bridget began to yawn from the comfort of her couch, and Y'La from the warmth of the fire. And eventually, they both nodded off after a day full of...well, not excitement. But discovery. And for the first time ever, Y'La would dream. She'd dream of discovery, of exploration, and of growing... friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that friendship will grow, alright, but it'll be a little... one-sided.</span></div></div>",

It was unlike her to oversleep, but her thoughts were quickly interrupted by a thud in her living room.  \"What the hell?\" thought Bridget, but soon she remembered the guest she took in yesterday.  'Yuh-Lah' seemed friendly enough, but her skin was so pale, and her hair was green.  And she was so... Bridget entered the living room to find that Y'La's head was bumping the ceiling.  \"Holy fuck what the hell happened to you?\" exclaimed Bridget.  Y'La was confused by this remark, as she saw nothing wrong.  Sure,  her new friend seemed smaller today, but that was normal, right? \"Hiya!\" Y'La said as she walked over to Bridget.  She hit her head on the ceiling the first few steps, but quickly learned how to hunch over to fit.  Y'La reached down and gave her friend a big bear hug, picking her up like she was nothing more than a pillow.  \"H-hi, Yuh-Lah...\" said Bridget.  \"Can you put me down? I have to feed my fish.\"  Y'La dropped her, smiling wide.  \"Fish?\" she asked out of curiosity.  \"Yes, my fish.  Want to come see them?\"  Y'La began to jump up and down (as best she could in the small space, and not without hitting her head every time).  She began to chant, \"Fish! Fish! Fish!\" as she followed Bridget to the back of her apartment.  <br>\r\nShe opened the door and Y'La followed her in, and saw a world of color before her.  There were at least 15 large fish tanks, each filled with as many colorful fish as they could safely hold.  Y'La ran from tank to tank (as best she could anyway) and watched the water creatures swim about.  \"I see you like them,\" said Bridget, half annoyed by this girl's enthusiasm towards everything, and half amused by such a large woman moving around this way.  Surely she was used to being big and would crouch under everything right? But she kept hitting her head like she was new to this... And she seems even bigger now than she did yesterday... Bridget was snapped out of this by Y'La.  \"You have to feed the fish?\" She asked.  \"Oh yea, if they don't eat they'll die.\" Bridget said sarcastically.  Y'La's next question genuinely caught Bridget off guard.  \"Do we have to eat too?\"<br>\r\nNow she was thoroughly confused.  This girl had to have amnesia or something.  \"Yes Yuh-Lah, we have to eat too.  Come on, I've got something to show you..\"  They went downstairs out of the apartment and got to her car before Bridget realized something.  \"How are you going to fit in my car?\" she wondered aloud.  To Y'La, the answer seemed simple.  \"Like this!\" She said as she contorted her body to fit in the passenger seat.  Bridget was again confused, but this time didn't want to start.  She got in the car and drove them to...</span></div></div>",

With pale yet unblemished skin, breasts large enough to be a comparative G cup, and long pink hair that flows down past her shoulders, Juniper would be instantly noticeable were she human-sized. Gentle as can be, Juniper wouldn't hurt a fly - in fact, she'd probably go out of her way to protect it. However, Juniper does have one or two flaws: she hates having to be helped by others, as she feels as if she is imposing on them no matter how much they want to help; and despite her potentially fearsome magic power, she isn't the best spellcaster around - which will become evident when she messes up a spell one early morning, accidentally causing herself to grow - and most likely never stop! It's a good thing her magic can prevent herself from harming anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur second mythological creature is Abigail. 18 years old and five feet and six inches tall, with B cup breasts, Abby doesn't usually stand out from the crowd. Even with the lucky combination of black hair and green eyes and a sweet, sensitive demeanour, Abby just hasn't been able to hang on to a boyfriend - or many normal friends, for that matter. And the reason why is because they're all scared of her, because Abigail is a werewolf - but not just a werewolf; Abigail is <i>the</i> werewolf - the Alpha, the most powerful of them all - and indeed, getting more powerful with every passing day. In her wolf form, Abigail is a walking wet dream, with curves out the wazoo and able to look down on all but the very tallest people alive. Despite her werewolf form's razor-sharp teeth and hulking muscles, Abigail would never dream of hurting anyone - which is fortunate, as it's becoming harder and harder for her to avoid transforming into her wolf form, day by day, even without the presence of the full moon - and that same werewolf form is growing bigger... And Bigger... And BIGGER!</span></div></div>",

I admit, 6\" is about average for a fairy, but it feels miniscule to me these days. Even my boobs feel a little small, and my human friend measured me at around a G-cup. She said that's pretty big, and I've no reason to not believe her, but still... they don't seem as big as they used to. I've long pink hair running past my shoulders, and I'm pretty pale. My eyes are hazel in color, at least they are today. I could try strawberry red eventually. I don't know how old I am; we fairies don't really keep track of that. Probably a lot older than my friend's grandmother if she was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juniper! Quit daydreaming and help us move this fallen log!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's Tia, an acquaintance of mine. She can be... a little demanding, but she means well. She's kind of tall for a fairy at 7\", but I'm not as impressed by anyone's height as I used to be. Though she is rather cute, even when she tries to look angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, I fear I must take that back. Tia doesn't look cute when trying to look angry. She's positively <i>adorable</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tia, I'm coming!\" I say as I flutter over with my long, almost dragonfly-like wings that shimmer in a rainbow of colors as they beat back and forth. I'm quite proud of them, honestly. Fairy wings can vary in style, with those closely resembling a butterfly's being the most coveted on the basis of humans being more willing to pass them off as actual butterflies. I never did quite understand why though. Maybe because I've always been remarkably skilled with magic since I started practicing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur village is nestled within a small forest, not even taking my opinion into account, and as such we tend to need to keep it clear without giving away we're actually here. My human friend is well aware of it and visits from time to time, which is nice of her, and especially nice that the elders (the oldest of our kin, though it's not always easy to tell) have permitted it. Today there's apparently a fallen log that needs to be moved aside, and I'm being asked to help do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when I get there it seems more like just a large branch than a tree trunk as a log would normally be. \"This is it? It doesn't look much like a log to be honest...\" I admit with some confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it still needs to be moved out of the way, Juniper.\" Tia replies in a way I don't really like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Though... I should be able to move it myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Tia shouts, \"We all remember what happened when you did what you're no doubt planning! Because of you, there's a human female out there that knows where we live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident! And she's my friend! She's not going to tell anyone we're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other time? Or the time you stripped naked before doing it? Were those accidents too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... was practicing! How can anyone learn to master magic without practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I should explain. A bit over a year ago, I visited a human's garden. I had been subtly trying to help it be really pretty, but I made a mistake and messed up my spells. When I came to, it was morning, so I tried to hide in a tree branch as the human came out of her house in her bare feet to stroll around her garden. I dropped my wand by mistake as she drew near, and had no choice but to make my presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI disliked that she picked me up and carried me inside to recuperate, though I greatly appreciated her hospitality afterward. It's something I need to improve upon, as I hate to burden anyone, but have to accept when help is given. But soon the matter of my error showed itself: I started growing! First close to 2 feet tall, then I grew to tower over my new friend a bit! Hastily, she asked me to exit her house right away, which shocked me until she pointed out I'd demolish her home if I grew again given the rate I was going, at which point I of course complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if I'd been in the correct frame of mind, I would've used my magic to cancel the current spell. I was not. The feeling of my body growing... oh wow, it was amazing! I even admitted then that it felt better than sex according to humans! (I've never thought to try it myself... our village is mostly female, as is typical for our kind. I've only a few indirect tales to go on) I did, at least, cast a spell that would ensure nothing would get damaged by me while I grew, and cast a spell on my friend to allow her to fly without wings so I definitely wouldn't hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI... admit it was wise of me to do so then, as I had another spurt, and then another leaving me at a mile tall. I think my boobs grew a bit, too. Then things went really crazy as I just exploded in size, growing to over 150 miles and beyond. My friend got stuck in my cleavage, which thinking of it started to benefit her as well as being an endearing thought, as she started growing with me. All the while I grew to ever grander sizes, only one thought permitted itself in my pleasure-fogged mind: I couldn't wait to grow bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I... kind of outgrew the universe. It got nestled in my <i>friend's</i> cleavage like a tiny, glittery marble before I was able to snap out of my euphoria and return us to Earth at our normal sizes. Interestingly... I think my magical power had grown tremendously by then, because I didn't even notice until my friend pointed it out to me that my wand had disintegrated, yet even now I no longer require a wand to cast magic. It's still a shame, though... I liked that wand, with its cute star shape at the end. (even though I know for a fact real stars don't look like that)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing this power, I erased the memories of me growing so utterly big from everyone's minds. However, my friend had somehow absorbed a fraction of the power I wielded by the time she got stuck between my boobs, and wouldn't forget. So we headed over to my village, where I found all of the fairies living there remembered perfectly well what happened, nor were they pleased I was bringing a human there. My friend tried to cast a spell to shrink to our size, but without experience she vastly overdid it and I had to grow her back from the size of an atom. Good thing I could sense her then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then I've been practicing growth, though I've not quite gotten nearly that vast. Once I tried it without my clothes. On one hand, the experience was exhilarating! On the other... most males and curiously some females were resistant to having the memory of a naked, 60 miles and growing fairy erased. At least I could convince them it was a dream and remove my wings from them. I still remember what I said then: \"Oh, bother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Juniper. Just help us move this already.\" Tia says, \"Nani, Dali, take that side. Juniper, you and I will take this side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned, I sigh and flutter to the indicated side while Nani and Dali reach their side. The four of us struggle for a moment before my eyes glow and the weight of the branch drops considerably so we can move it easily to the side, reversing my spell moments before we set it down. \"That was surprisingly easy!\" Dali remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very easy!\" Nani agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome! I might practice stuff you don't understand why, Tia, but I'm still good with the normal fare.\" I state, smiling. I don't know why Tia groaned in reply, though...</span></div></div>",

It's not even remotely as elaborate as human dwellings, but it's enough to work with comfortably. I've since expanded the space in my home considerably, so that my friend has a place to stay if she visits. (she's required to shrink to our size when she comes. I can understand her apprehension in the matter)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! She's visited here a few times, but it's been some time since I've visited her! I think I should drop by. I would love to see those flowers again, the very reason I messed up a couple spells and found... a new calling, I guess would be the best way to describe it. So I change my outfit for something more formal and fly out in preparation to go visit when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juniper! Where are you going?\" Zinnia calls out. She's a towering 8\" fairy, and always curious of my comings and goings. I could probably turn her into a fly, but that would be mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going out to see my human friend, Zinnia. Last I checked, Tinia doesn't require me to report where I go and what I've done when I return. And if I wind up outgrowing Earth yet again, I assure you the damage will be just as minimal as the previous times I've gone way bigger than any other fairy has considered.\" I respond honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you dare speak the Queen's name?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes? She dislikes being addressed by her title. Besides, the elders hold most of the authoritative power in our village these days. I hear that the humans have something similar over in the United Kingdom.\" I answer, then think aloud, \"Hm... I wonder if Tinia would be interested in visiting my human friend? Let her actually stretch her wings and see the world beyond this village, this forest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madness!\" Zinnia claims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think so, Zinnia. I'll be back eventually.\" I say indifferently as I fly off. I don't want to waste all day discussing things with her. Still, maybe next time I'll invite Tinia along. She doesn't even have to grow or anything, I know her to be a formidable spell-caster in her own right so she doesn't need to be big to defend herself. There are rumors that she's powerful enough to not need a wand, but I've never seen her perform magic without one so I don't know how truthful that rumor is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leave the forest behind as I fly towards my friend's home. Thankfully, it's a little ways outside the city, so there's less pollution (I can't take it very easily even three times human size) and less humans to potentially spot me. As I get near, I remember that Sasha wants me to announce my arrival when I come over instead of just appearing in her garden again. So I land in a clearing not far from her house, and figure it's a good opportunity to practice growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Juniper... Grow to human size and no bigger. You can do this. Don't let the pleasure get to you.\" I say to myself as I concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes glow and a slight aura shimmers around me before I begin to grow. I feel my body strain against my clothes for just a moment... before they begin growing with me. That's good, as that's what I want. I reach just over 2 feet and climbing, watching my perspective rise higher and higher. The pleasure I feel is incredible, but I bite down on it and refuse to let it control me like the first time I grew, or else I may outgrow the planet before I can come to my senses - and I haven't cast the spell that generates the protective aura allowing me to stomp on a city with my full, immense weight all day without harming it in any way yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a cute bunny about to get hit by my growth, I try to cast that protective spell as quick as I can. I manage it, but... somehow I've messed up. And in trying to give the bunny some room to get out of my way, I slip on the dew and fall on my butt, still growing. At 3 feet, my clothes are starting to feel too tight. I continue growing, and my dress continues to strain and tear in places. \"Oh, my clothes... why aren't you keeping up with me now? We were doing just fine when we started...\" I bemoan as I hit 5 feet and my dress gives out entirely, leaving me naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my shock, I end up overshooting my goal of just over 6 feet, continuing to grow well into the 7 foot range. I see the increasingly smaller bunny hop away, thank goodness, but my growth hasn't ceased. \"No no no! This isn't what I wanted at all!\" I cry and bring my growth to a halt. I stand and check myself over. The cool morning air across my bare nipples causes them to become erect and hard... or is it my own arousal doing that? By the empress, I hope no humans can see me right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Check out that naked lady! She... she's gotta be like at least 10 feet tall!\" I hear a human nearby say. Why does Murphy hate me so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh, bother...\" I sulk as the human approaches me. Please don't notice my wings... I might still be able to salvage this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice wings!\" the person says, pulling on one of my wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute... This person is pulling very gently, just enough to lift my wing but not hurt me... as though they know how to handle fairy wings. But very few humans would know that! I'm starting to grow suspicious of this human, and I ask, \"Who are you, human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person laughs, their voice changing to one that's familiar as they step into my field of vision. The person's shape melts and rearranges into the familiar form of... Sasha! \"Human? I left my humanity behind long ago. I am something... different, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I'm technically still human, but I guess from absorbing a bit of your powers I'm the first witch in at least several centuries, if there ever were any to begin with. I'm still Sasha so long as you're still Juniper.\" Sasha greets, though I can't help but get the feeling she repeated a piece of dialogue from somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe embrace in a friendly hug, despite my 10 foot frame making things tricky. \"I see you've been practicing, Sasha. I was completely fooled until you started handling my wing.\" I say, fluttering my wings back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been practicing by enlarging dragonflies, as their wings are similar. It took me awhile just to figure out that protection spell so I didn't seriously harm more than I had to. They're one of my favorite insects! Shape-shifting though... God that feels weird. It doesn't hurt or anything, but feeling your skin and bones squirm and reshape into someone else... It's unsettling.\" Sasha answers, \"Um, are you going to at least do something about your clothes, girl? I mean if you're comfortable like this then by all means, but you don't seem that comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Right. I concentrate and allow myself to shrink down to about 6'1\", and then resize the tattered remains of my dress and magically sew it back together on my body. I still leave the front open to expose some of my cleavage, something I've always been fond of doing. \"At least this time I didn't have to try and erase anyone's memories...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It started as an inside joke between you and Abigail that she was secretly a werewolf that stalks the night during the full moon. The joke started because every month she would just vanish from everyone's radar for a few days until the full moon was over. You didn't really press the issue with her, you wanted to respect her privacy and just assumed it was girl stuff or something anyway.  However, it really made you curious. You two had been boyfriend and girlfriend for about two years now and you wanted a little bit of closure about her full moon escapades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would just so happen that one late afternoon as you were driving home from work you saw her car parked in the driveway of her double-story house, illuminated by the red sunset. Usually she would have taken the car to some unknown place before the full moon night. She told you a few days ago that her parents were going overseas for a small vacation, so perhaps she decided to stay home instead? You pulled your car along the curbside out front of her house and try to peer inside. After some deliberating you decide there would be no harm in knocking. If she didn't want to see you she would just say so, she was straight-forward like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning off the car and stepping out you could just see it was getting darker and the full moon was coming over the horizon. Walking towards the front door of the house you could hear noises coming inside. It was only when you got closer that you realized it was Abigail! She sounded like she was in pain or being attacked by something, so you sprang into action and slammed on the door! \"Abigail? Abigail? Are you okay?!\" Still, her painful moans continued. You try the doorknob and find that it was unlocked, so you rush into the house and run up the stairs toward the sound of her voice. Trodding down a short hallway to the door of her room and practically kick the door open. You were confused to find only Abigail sitting in the middle of the dark room, moonlight from the window glistening on her sweaty, naked form. She shot her eyes up at you. They were bright yellow. \"W-what are you doing here?!\" She said between groans of pain. \"G-get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked beyond words. Standing there you could see her body shifting in the pale moonlight. It took you a moment to realize that she wasn't moving, but rather her body was changing. Abigail winced and collapsed to the floor as loud cracking sounds filled the room, her body pulsing as muscles grew and bones lengthened. You wanted to rush and help her, but your legs were frozen at the bizarre sight before you. She gasped as a fleshy nub protruded from the base of her spine and grew longer until it was able to swish about, just like a tail. \"N-no way...\" You whisper to yourself as you watch her writhe on the floor. You could start to see hairs grow out of her body, slowly spreading over her skin and coating her in white and grey fur. The next to change were her hands and feet. Her fingers elongated and grew thick, sharp claws while the digets on her feet shortened and thickened as they took the appearance of paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging her claws into the floor she lifted herself up, giving you a glimpse of the changes occurring to her face. Her long hair was reforming to shorter grey fur while her ears moved up her head to form wolf-like ears. She gasped in pain as the front of her face started to elongate, creating a series of gross cracks as her bones and teeth rearranged. As fur covered her elongated face and a leathery nose appeared she no longer resembled anything close to Abigail. She locked her golden eyes on you again, making you jump. Her feminine form was diminishing as she grew bigger, her body widening with muscle and fur. She sat there staring at you, panting as her wolf-like body become more bestial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of shifting flesh and cracking bones stop. All you hear is the tired panting of the wolf creature in the middle of the room. As it slowly rose to its feet you couldn't help but notice the size difference as she looked down at you, reaching around 8 feet tall. You just stood there shaking, not knowing what to do. She really was a werewolf.<br>\r\nThe both of you stood there staring at each other. Despite her animal appearance, you could tell by her eyes she was feeling sad and dejected about the situation. It was actually Abigail that spoke first. \"Why are you here?\" She asked. Her voice was deeper and had a hint of a growl to it.<br>\r\n\"I...Came to see you, and then I heard you from outside, I thought-\"<br>\r\n\"Go away! I'm a monster!\" She snarled, baring her sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her face away from you, sniffling. In the moonlight you could see her form, huge and muscular, yes, but much unlike the monster werewolves in the movies. She actually looked quite regal like the wolves of the wild do. You watched her as she sobbed. You knew underneath all that wolf was your Abigail, but then again you were standing before a real, live werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think carefully (or not) about your next move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you can look past the spiked bands around her neck and wrists, you'd be tempted to stare at the sinfully delicious amount of cleavage her E-cup breasts provide, or her ass which complements her curves up top.

Despite all of this, she's usually genuinely friendly, describing herself as a big softy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's one other thing about her, however... she's a demon. In her true form, she has red skin, glowing fiery yellow eyes, long horns poking out of her head, dragon-like wings coming out of her back, and a long, thin, pointy tail. (no hooves. She's not a satyr) She has alabaster skin and amber eyes in human guise.

Her lithe, supple frame capped with large C-cup breasts and a nice heart shaped posterior belies sufficient strength to flip a fully grown man onto his back effortlessly, as well as the ability to endure impacts that would fracture human bones. She's fearsome in the protection of the forest she calls home, though she hasn't seriously harmed any humans, a fact which she's grateful for as she's quite gentle.

Some of the older naga remember her being much more active in the past, albeit still laid-back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough perhaps this laziness has more to do with her body storing what energy it can in preparation for something grand, as Medea doesn't know why her body feels so sluggish and lazy as of late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi is a catgirl, a girl with cat ears instead of human ears and a tail.

What they ended up with was an intelligent, mobile plant that greatly resembles a (very voluptuous) human female in her 20's. Much of her 'inner workings' is a complete mystery, as the scientists that accidentally created her have yet to replicate the result and no one having the heart to cut her open to find out. While some officials naturally worry if she's but the first of a new species that will replace humanity, Flora is only curious of humans, and would never intentionally harm them unless given no other alternative to defend herself or those around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer greatest concern, however, is her growth. Flora tends to grow like a weed when exposed to natural sunlight for more than a couple hours or so, and while she does gradually shrinks back down to her nearly 8 foot height once no longer exposed to it, she worries what may happen if she grows too big to avoid direct sunlight. Is there a limit to how large she can get? Frustratingly for her, once she begins to grow it's VERY difficult to focus on getting out of the sun to stop her growth and allow herself to return to normal due to the tremendous pleasure it causes her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda is barely a year old, yet looks to be 13. She looks just like any other 13 year old girl, acts... mostly like one, and is generally treated like one by the public - which marks her as a stunning success so far. Wanda is in fact an android, a robot. Her appearance and programming are what some would claim to be disturbingly closely based on the lead developer's deceased daughter, who Wanda was named after. There are a superstitious few that believe the girl's spirit possessed the robot's body from the moment it came online, as the girl passed away not a few moments before in the hospital... or maybe they're just trying to find an explanation for why no other robot since her creation has performed even remotely as well. Whatever the case, the lead developer is happy to have his daughter in some form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Wanda's puberty program is due to kick in any day now. The robot girl's body is designed to gradually expand and develop on its own until it reaches her estimated size and proportions as an adult. They predicted that by the time that Wanda the human girl finished puberty she'd be slightly above average, but the developer never told anyone about his daughter's long held desire to be a beautiful, towering giantess that would protect and be loved by everyone. Whether due to a glitch in the program or her own desires, Wanda will be far surpassing her intended parameters...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Months ago, a couple of scientists decided to try and tackle the issue of world hunger. Everyone knows humans need food to live. Everyone also knows that most plants use photosynthesis to create their own food using sunlight. And everyone is well aware of genetically modified plants, even introducing the DNA of certain animals into plants to give them greater resistance to given situations. They can't just uproot and relocate themselves, obviously, that's just silly. But it did get the scientists to thinking if they could do it the other way around - introduce plant characteristics into animals, and eventually humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea was to allow human cells to house a bit of chlorophyll that would subtly feed the person while in the sunlight, but hopefully not so much the person's skin turns a leafy green. On paper, it sounded brilliant, but tests would be needed to see if it's possible. In practice though, something somehow went awry, creating what seemed to be a successful cell carrying the properties of both a human and plant, but the cell began dividing like crazy before any further tests could be done on it. By the time the scientists began to realize something was wrong, the cells had already begun to specialize into familiar structures of a brain, heart, and numerous others. \"Well shit. We've accidentally created life!\" one of the scientists said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than sterilize the experiment, as was proper procedure, the scientists allowed this rapidly growing... thing to continue to develop, keeping it well watered and nourished, though the latter proved to be about as hard as keeping a normal plant in the light. Within days, their creation had taken on the recognizable form of a fetus... albeit green, and could watch it develop right before their eyes. By the end of the month it had developed into a form resembling a baby girl, and was given the name Flora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, Flora had developed into what resembled a 5 year old child with flowing cherry blossom pink hair. One of the scientists approached her in an attempt to cut her open and learn about her anatomy... but the positively frightened look in her eyes broke his will to carry out the act. Shockingly, Flora demonstrated a learning pace that was as fast as her development, learning words and how to communicate almost as quickly as the new information could be presented to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all this time, the scientists were trying to replicate the previous result, but without any success. Could one or more of the materials used in Flora's creation have been contaminated with an unknown substance? Or perhaps a freak genetic quirk that allowed this to happen? Either way, it seems to this day that the answers may have been lost when Flora first started developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, the people providing the funding for the project came by to see if it was going anywhere. They were... less than enthused to find out progress had stalled. But then Flora stumbled in, thankfully remembering to cover herself up with her leaves, forming what looks like a two-piece swimsuit patterned after autumn leaves. Investors were both infuriated and frightened of her. Yet even as she stood almost as tall as some of them despite still looking roughly 11, none of them could bring themselves to hurt the plant girl. Funding for the project however was put to an end. \"Sorry...\" she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the second month, Flora appeared to have finished developing. Despite her green skin and intimidating height of 7'10\", her... bountiful breasts and almost as impressive ass along with her gorgeous face and smile could win just about any man over. In her curiosity of humans, she's thoroughly studied the subject of sexual intercourse, yet still to this day doesn't understand why humans are so obsessed with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present, Flora sighs. She knows those that invested in the project that unintentionally created her still fear her, and this fear saddens her. \"I'm the only one of my kind. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to procreate, and even if I did I would be teaching my children to respect and help humans, not replace them.\" she says to herself and lets out another sigh, \"There are times I wish my creators were able to recreate another like me... I might not feel so lonely then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she couldn't necessarily blame them for being scared of her. The events of last month are still fresh in her mind. Flora had stayed out too long in the sun then, which caused her to grow in large spurts. And with the feeling of her body growing being as intoxicating as it is, it was hard to keep from pleasuring herself just like human females when aroused and get out of the sun to let her body gradually shrink back down to normal. It's a curious trait she has, and her creators couldn't tell her where it came from. She was over 100 feet tall by the time she managed to get out of the sun, but thankfully she returned to her normal size by nightfall where it's safer and she was able to apologize and help clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe annoying part is while it's clear she has a similar digestive system to a human, she still <i>needs</i> some sunlight to nourish herself, and hates the idea of staying cooped up indoors. The pleasure is frustrating to circumvent, and there's also the fear of growing too big to avoid direct sunlight. She can only hope there's some sort of cap on how big she can get, and that she doesn't have to find out how big that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Flora. God I still have trouble getting over the fact you've got bigger boobs than me...\" a voice says, and Flora lifts her head to see Audrey, a pretty young woman who runs a local flower shop. She was the first person outside the scientists who created her to show no fear towards her, thus became fast friends. Flora even comes by sometimes to help tend to the plants, something she always looks forward to. Audrey believes Flora is gifted with a deeper connection to and understanding of nature than any human could hope to achieve. The fact that the flowers Flora has cared for even once grow bigger and more brilliant than the others might give merit to this belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, humans seem to have a very odd obsession over the size of a female's breasts and a male's cock. Like this story of an anthropomorphic horse with such generous curves it's a wonder she doesn't snap in half let alone stand and move about. I've been studying it for months and still don't understand the obsession.\" Flora replies, \"Though I still believe yours are quite nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey just smiles and the two friends stand and embrace, Flora lifting the young woman up clear off the ground and setting her down shortly afterwards. \"So what are you up to? Not still dwelling on that accident a month ago, I hope.\" Audrey asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much. Just thinking over the story of my life and wondering what it'd be like if I wasn't the only one of my kind. At least I have my friends, right, Audrey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight you do, Flora!\" Audrey replies happily, \"Well if you've still got time before you reach the level of sun intake where you start to grow, how about caring for some flowers at the shop?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flora considers her friend's offer carefully. If not for her growing problem, the plant girl would offer heading to the beach. She has never been there before, but understands that humans seem to enjoy it. Yet she knows she can't, as it'd be extremely hard to find somewhere to get herself out of the sunlight when she starts growing and can muster enough self-control to try searching for it. She can easily grow over 100 feet tall, and at that size she could seriously hurt someone if she's not careful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she loves tending to the plants in Audrey's flower shop, and it usually just takes about half an hour to get there, so Flora looks down upon her friend, whose eye-line is filled with her cleavage just by them both standing straight, and replies, \"I'd love to tend to the flowers, Audrey! Let's be on our way and not waste more of my precious time.\" she pauses and quickly adds, \"Er, not to sound rude or self-centered...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Let's go!\" Audrey replies before the two head on their way. She knows Flora means no offense when she mentions her time being precious, since she only has a few hours that she can be in direct sunlight before she starts shooting up like a hot, very human-shaped weed. Audrey's never considered herself a lesbian before meeting Flora, but her incredible beauty, both inside and most definitely out, is very alluring. Especially when she's a giant. The very fact people are scared of her even at her normal size offends the blonde a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey also has to admit she finds how Flora appears to people fascinating. She herself can scarcely stand to not have at least socks or slippers on in her own home, yet Flora is perfectly comfortable walking around barefoot. Technically, the plant girl doesn't wear clothes, instead covering herself up with her body's leaves. Usually they're fashioned into the convincing appearance of a bikini patterned after the colors of autumn, but Audrey has seen her form other styles of clothes. Dresses and skirts seem to be the most problematic for her since she has to bridge between her long legs in a way that isn't restrictive yet still looks natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reach the flower shop in about the time predicted. It's not a very large building, but Audrey's Little Shop of Wonders has been fairly successful since Flora started coming to tend to the flowers. \"Wherever did you come up with the name of your shop, Audrey?\" Flora asks curiously as she ducks in after her blonde friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came across some old film about a flower shop and a monstrous plant that feeds on human flesh and blood called Little Shop of Horrors.\" Audrey answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that's horrible! Plants can benefit from blood, yes, but only because it contains water and a few other nutrients like iron...\" Flora interrupts, aghast and disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was a unique plant, not unlike yourself in a way. Unique, I mean. Other than that and the ability to speak you're nothing alike.\" Audrey says, \"Anyway, I share a name with one of the characters, and the title's catchy enough to use, but I changed it to wonders because I want to attract customers. I assure you, not offending my towering plant girl best friend is a welcome bonus.\" she pauses and then adds with a giggle, \"Besides, it <i>is</i> a little shop and full of wonders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True!\" Flora laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two begin the task of tending to the flowers. Flora has heard Audrey express her belief that she's gifted with a deep connection to nature a few times before. She's not entirely sure if that's true or not, but the plant girl does know that the flowers seem to love her. She greatly enjoys discerning just how much water to give them, when they need a tiny bit more, and when they needn't any right now. She also enjoys the other parts of tending to the plants, like removing them from their current pot to place them in a larger one when she feels their roots are starting to become a little cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flora, have you ever wondered if maybe you're meant for something greater? I keep wondering that myself about you.\" Audrey asks after a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora was about to say no, but finds herself unable to. She knows she was an accident the scientists who created her allowed to continue, and still remembers her utter terror of one of them about to kill her and try to figure out her anatomy, as well as her relief when he dropped the knife to the ground and instead embraced her, apologizing and assuring her everything was all right. But she also remembers their failed attempts to replicate the result of her. What could they've possibly done differently between her and their other experiments? \"I... I don't know...\" she answers finally, \"I think I'm starting to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I've told you before I believe you've a far deeper connection to nature than anyone else can hope to achieve, but I wonder just how deep it goes? Like, maybe your growth problem is only a problem because you let it, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora looks towards the 5'9\" blonde with shock. \"What?! Do you <i>want</i> me to grow dangerously big?! Are you suggesting that's the only reason for my existence?!\" she exclaims, far more shocked than infuriated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you're really, really attractive when you're huge, Flora, but I'm not trying to say that's your reason to exist at all! I'm trying to say that maybe it's a problem because you don't yet know how to control it? If you weren't meant to have some sort of handle on this, then why do you shrink back down to this size after awhile? Shouldn't you stay permanently big?\" Audrey explains, approaching her towering friend, \"Flora... as your friend, I want what's best for you. I'd accept you at whatever size you'd happen to be, but I'd rather you at this size so you can tend to the flowers you love so much easily. I think you do have some element of control, if just subconsciously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what was all that about me being really attractive when I'm huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain it exactly, but I think when you're giant your positive traits seem accentuated. Or maybe you cover a bit less of yourself prior to snapping out of a growth lust. And I feel... safe around you like that. The last couple times you grew, you snapped out of your growth lust just before anyone got hurt and your growth pretty well stopped. Maybe instead of avoiding too much sunlight, you need to practice controlling the growth?\" Audrey suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would I do with it? Dance around a giant pole revealing more and more of myself like... what are those dancers called again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stripper? If that's what you want to do, then more power to you. I'm sure you could find a more creative use for it though. You were raised by a pair of scientists and they struggled to produce new information to learn fast enough!\"</span></div></div>",

The plant woman yearns to experience going to the beach without the threat of getting huge looming over her cherry blossom pink haired head like a storm cloud. If her friend Audrey's guess is correct and she's meant to be able to control it, then she'll do her best to achieve that control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat this has to do with her supposed deep connection to nature is currently beyond Flora's understanding, but maybe it'll become clear once she masters her growth. \"Er, so where should I practice this? I don't want to endanger the city if I can help it, yet I don't want to be too far from shelter if this turns out disastrous.\" are the words that escape her lips, the color of rose petals. Aside from her skin and hair, she's able to change the color of parts of her body. Often, this means her eyes are lilac in color while her nails change almost daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know of a clearing a little ways from here that might be good. I wouldn't worry too hard about shelter as the sun sets in a couple hours and you <i>want</i> to go past your current threshold to get your growth going, right?\" Audrey answers, trying to help her 7'10\" friend as best she can as they finish tending to the flowers for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Flora wants to question her friend about when exactly she was planning on telling her about this clearing, but dismisses this under the assumption Audrey would have told her if she asked. So instead, the plant woman nods and says, \"I suppose you're right, Audrey. Lead the way, my friend.\" she pauses and adds, \"I can't believe I'm saying this, but... we're burning daylight here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Audrey leads Flora out of Audrey's Little Shop of Wonders, being sure to lock the door behind her, and then down a rarely used road a block or so from the shop. The pair make a couple of twists and turns along the way, with the road looking more and more as though nature has reclaimed it since the possible years of being left in a state of disrepair the further they travel. Audrey's hardly surprised that Flora's handling this broken down trail so well in her bare feet; she's seen her stand perfectly unphased upon hot asphalt that the air shimmered above from the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two reach the clearing. It seems to have once been a park in part of the city, but has since been allowed to run wild as people came to forget about this part of town in favor of all the new and exciting things elsewhere. Audrey's silently thankful for choosing to wear her long boots, given she's scared to even know what may lurk in the tall, unkempt grass. Flora meanwhile looks right at home, smiling and twirling around in the uncared for land until she halts suddenly. \"Flora? Is something wrong?\" Audrey asks out of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up...\" Flora replies nervously, shuddering slightly as the pleasurable sensation begins to build up inside her, \"I-I have to find shelter immediately to avoid growing!\" Indeed, her body starts to stretch higher into the air, already just passing 8 feet and climbing. One of her growing hands unconsciously begins to creep south towards her crotch, and the leaves comprising the appearance of a bikini bottom, expanding with her, start to shift to accommodate her hand's goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's tempted to watch the show, as most people would be seeing the towering woman start to grow. Whether due to arousal, being dumbstruck much like watching a train wreck, or possibly a bit of both, is uncertain. However, the blonde refuses to let them both fall to temptation and fail in what they've set out to practice. Flora needs to learn to control this. \"The whole point of coming out here is that there's no place to hide from your problem of lack of control, Flora! If you think you <i>can't</i>, then you'll never be able to get a grip on this. I believe you <i>can</i> do this, and you need to believe it too!\" she states encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Flora attempts to focus her will on halting her growth. In her concentration, she snaps her hand away from her crotch, her leaves automatically shifting back to cover the opening as if nothing ever happened. Her body's growth, having accelerated, slowly but surely begins to visibly slow its pace. By about 16 feet, while she's still growing, her pace seems to have stabilized, not getting any faster or slower. Finally, the plant woman opens her lilac eyes that she had been keeping squeezed shut. \"I... I think this is the best I can do right now...\" she sighs as she comes down to rest on her knees, which plow across the unkempt ground like a pair of miniature bulldozers in slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're still growing...\" Audrey points out, \"I've seen you almost completely stop it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora nods her still slowly expanding head, her cherry blossom pink hair tickling her lower back as she replies, \"So you've said earlier. Still, I'd say this is tremendous progress for my first time.\" Not a moment after saying this, her body pulses significantly larger. Her long legs stretch longer beneath her enlarging rear. Her slender arms lengthen even as her seemingly delicate fingers become longer and thicker along with the hand they're attached to. She watches her perspective rise in the short burst before the spurt ends and she seems to have completely stopped growing. \"Yet I clearly see that I've still a long ways to go before I've mastered this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly.\" Audrey agrees, \"Practice makes perfect, as they say. How do you feel otherwise?\" She's glad to have been proven correct in thinking Flora's growth is meant to be under her control but has never thought to really try until now, as eventually this could mean she no longer needs to fear being in direct sunlight for too long. She could lead a normal life if she wanted to, or at least as much of one is possible for a plant/human hybrid. She could even harness her ability to help people if she wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora bends forward, planting her large hands on the ground like the roots of great trees before using them to brace herself as she begins to stand once more. Her mind mulls over her friend's question as she takes everything else around her in. Noting how Audrey's head doesn't quite reach her knee, she estimates herself to be about 23 feet tall. Finally, she answers, \"I feel... good. I feel as though the plants in this place adore me, in much the same way the flowers at the shop do. I can't explain why, as I've never tended to anything here before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's that connection to nature you have?\" Audrey suggests, \"Come on, girl, surely you can't deny you feel something there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Flora says, \"I can't say for certain, but... maybe. If it's true, then maybe that's why you feel safe around me even when I've grown huge, such as right now? It's just a guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey shrugs. She has to admit, Flora's guess is as good as her own on the matter. Still, the sun won't set for another hour, so she begins to wonder if she should head back before it gets dark. Not to mention the question of how far Flora's connection to nature goes continues to linger in her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora meanwhile figures she can get a little practice in on a controlled growth before she helps her friend return home. With a slight shudder, she starts to sprout higher. The pleasure is as intoxicating as ever, but she maintains her focus, slowly growing higher and higher. The leaves of her clothes rustle slightly as they grow in pace with the being they're a part of, yet still look convincingly like one cohesive article of clothing from a distance. She hits another boost in height just as she intended to stop at 25 feet, causing her to instead halt at 30 feet. \"I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.\" she smiles happily, comparing herself to a young tree close by in this place nature has reclaimed within the heart of the city. To her, it is as beautiful as it is tragically unloved. Perhaps she could grant it that attention she believes it craves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While contemplating on how best to grant the care to this nature-reclaimed part of the city she's almost certain it desires, Flora finds her soul in the greatest peace she's ever known in her relatively short life. Huge but not really worried about it, surrounded by nature with some hints of the city still present... The currently 30 foot plant woman has to wonder if this is what paradise is like. While her friend Audrey originally lead her here as a place to practice her growth ability without potentially endangering the city, it certainly presents her with incentives to come here again soon, if not tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, it's getting late, and Flora wants to help Audrey return home before nightfall. However, she also considers that she may be able to get one more spurt in before they really need to get moving, and her longer strides would get them to their destination faster. At least, that's how her mind attempts to justify putting off departing from this abandoned park just a little longer. Still, she feels compelled to check with her friend. \"Do you mind if I get just a little more practice in before we go?\" she asks, bringing her massive yet slender green hands together in front of her huge face in a pleading gesture while looking down towards Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no go ahead. We have time.\" Audrey answers, \"My younger sister is coming over tomorrow, by the way, and she's bringing her best friend with her, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora nods in understanding before letting herself grow. The feeling of pleasure crashes against her will, but like a deeply rooted tree against the wind, she refuses to yield. Her bones creak and groan as they stretch and widen, not unlike a tree branch flexing. Her long legs push her expanding body higher into the air, supported by her lengthening bare feet. Not to be outdone, her arms grow longer and thicker as her shoulders broaden to keep pace with her naturally shapely hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora's already huge breasts swell larger along with her rear, yet everything remains proportionate. Her leaves, which she arranges into the appearance of clothes and especially a bikini, rustle as though being blown by a breeze while they too grow bigger. Some of them large enough to cover most of a dinner plate and still growing. Her hair is like a cascade of cherry blossom pink down her massive back, and unlike human hair, is very much alive from root to tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she appears to be slowing down, the plant woman has one final burst of height before halting completely. The tree nearby allows Flora to guess her height to be roughly 50 feet tall, which was more or less what she had been aiming for. With a sigh, the green giantess mentally bids this abandoned, overrun park farewell, vowing to return again soon. Then, she focuses her attention to her new task. She smiles sweetly to her friend, bends down, and picks her up as delicately as she can manage. \"All right, now let's head for your place. I'd like to meet your sister and her friend.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nods as she's brought to Flora's massive shoulder, climbing on and taking a seat. The blonde is happy to see a smile staying on her friend's rose petal colored lips. Flora still needs to practice this ability of hers, but Audrey is confident her surprising success has given her hope. Though she still wonders how to tell Sara about something as... <i>unusual</i> as the plant/human hybrid she happily calls her friend. It's something to sleep on, she ultimately decides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Flora begins to walk back, it's not long before she stops as she suddenly gets the sense that they're not alone. Something, or someone, is watching them. She can't see anything, so she brushes it off and continues on her way... yet the feeling never leaves. The feeling persists until Flora and Audrey return to the shop, the former currently much too large to enter, where Audrey notices a note on the <i>inside</i> of Audrey's Little Shop of Wonders' door. \"What the? I locked the door and set the alarm and everything! How could someone leave a note inside the door?\" Audrey exclaims in her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora carefully sets her friend down before squinting at the note and its writing, the nearby street light not exactly helping. Strangely, the ink begins glowing softly, just enough to make it readable to Audrey. When she finishes reading, she loudly curses. \"Shit! Flora, we need to get to my place. Right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay... but why the rush? Is your sister coming early tomorrow?\" the giant plant woman asks with curiosity, even as she lifts her friend back up to her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's just it. She was actually supposed to be here today, and now she's waiting for me. How could I get the dates mixed up like that?!\" Audrey replies, mentally and verbally kicking herself. Still, the question of how that note got inside the clearly still locked door is eating away at her, along with how the ink glowed but in a way not at all like glow in the dark. Something strange is going on around here, and the blonde wants to find out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople look on in awe and fright as the 50 foot Flora begins to break out into a run. Even if they know that the plant woman would never intentionally harm any of them, which not all of them do, it's hard to ignore the imagination going over the various ways in which she could end their lives in grisly, gruesome detail. And yet, the light of the sunset playing off her huge, bountifully curvy frame is still a sight to behold for those believing themselves a safe distance from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Flora's part, she's just trying to avoid stepping on anyone while also ensuring Audrey doesn't fall off her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her tremendous strides, Flora quickly arrives at Audrey's home with her passenger safe and sound. Carefully, she reaches up to her shoulder and lowers her friend to the ground. \"It's about damn time you got here, Audrey! I was getting worried sick about you!\" a girl standing just beside the open door says, \"I mean, how would I break the news to mom and dad that you've gone missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora bends down a bit lower, almost on her hands and knees, to get a better look at the girl. She has similar golden blonde hair and blue eyes as Audrey, among a few other things that show they're closely related. However, she's clearly taller even without the heels, likely 6'5\", and her clothing style leaves little of her body's hourglass shape to the imagination. \"Sorry, Sara, I thought you were coming tomorrow...\" Audrey apologizes, \"I wouldn't have kept you waiting otherwise, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's expression softens and replies before they embrace, \"Fine, I forgive you, Audrey. What are sisters for?\" Shortly after they part from each others' arms, Sara looks towards the giant plant woman studying her and asks very calmly, \"Friend of yours, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually. This is Flora. She's a plant/human hybrid, and is easily as intelligent as she is beautiful. She's uh... not usually this big, but she'll return to her normal size in a couple hours.\" Audrey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Sara!\" Flora greets warmly, waving a large hand in the process before she asks, \"But... where is your friend? Did they decide not to come after all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Flora feels the sense from earlier return, stronger than ever. \"Ah, but she <i>did</i> decide to come! And would appreciate you not accidentally falling backwards, Flora...\" a voice remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant woman stiffens with worry, forgetting for a moment that her current posture would more likely have her fall on her prodigious chest than backward, before a small hand pats her calf. At last, the owner of the voice appears before Flora's gaze. This girl is barely shorter than Sara, yet a little bustier. The green eyed brunette is clad in a dark green dress and green sneakers, and much to Flora's relief didn't seem frightened of her at all. She could almost swear she sees glimmers of blue dangling from the girl's ears. She seems pretty normal... yet Flora can't shake the feeling this girl is more than she appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should introduce myself here. My name is Megan Allerson. Just Megan is fine.\" Megan introduces herself, smiling. She then approaches Audrey and offers her hand. \"And you must be Audrey Mars, Sara's older sister! I've got to say, it's nice to meet you in person after seeing you in some of the family photos my friend has shared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey accepts the handshake, replying, \"Megan Allerson, huh? I think I've heard of your family before. They own that mansion the next town over, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one. I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth, which was sure helpful when it was time for baby food.\" Megan acknowledges jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara excuses herself and pulls her friend aside, unknowingly still just within earshot of Flora. \"Please don't... change my sister in any way, Megan...\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you think I'd do such a thing?\" Megan replies, almost flippantly. A few moments under her friend's withering glare, she relents, \"All right, so I've done it once... or twice... Fine, I won't mess with her...\" a moment later, she adds, \"At least, not without her permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora doesn't understand what the two are getting at, but it's making her tremendously curious. Naturally, given that she wasn't supposed to hear their conversation, the plant woman does her best to feign ignorance when they turn back to her and Audrey, who genuinely <i>is</i> oblivious to the discussion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gradually, as the hour passes, Flora's tremendous size diminishes. The plant woman is in some ways... a little saddened to be returning to her normal size, which felt strange considering the previous times she's grown and has been <i>relieved</i> to be returning to her normal size. Then again this has been the only time where she's grown and not put anyone in potential danger, so it is possible that may be a contributing factor, and she is still looking forward to being able to fit <i>inside</i> Audrey's house once again. Flora does note that she's shrinking more slowly than normal, which causes her mind to ponder what mechanisms are at play with her ability and its ties to direct sunlight. Now that she's no longer <i>afraid</i> of it, there's much she wishes to learn about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she sits outside, Flora can hear some of the things going on inside her friend's house. She turns her head and lilac gaze towards the building, her curiosity making her lean a little closer towards an open window to see what's going on. \"How's a girl supposed to get in on tonight's Splatfest without TV? I brought my Wii U and everything!\" Megan bemoans, leaving Flora to wonder what a \"we you\" is and what it has to do with a \"splat fest\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never really found myself having time for TV. Sorry.\" Audrey apologizes, \"Maybe I'll look into getting one later if I can afford it and a DVD player. As is, I'm lucky to not have to use the local cafe's WiFi for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, continue the tour without me, sis.\" Sara says as she heads out of view, alerting Flora to the fact her watching with curiosity hasn't gone unnoticed. \"Hey, um, Flora? How long does it normally take for you to be back to normal height?\" she hears her friend's sister's voice question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora turns her head towards the blonde and adjusts her slowly diminishing position to give her her full attention. She's already caught on to the fact Sara is trying to mine some information out of her, but really doesn't seem the harm in answering. \"Another hour before I'd be back to that point, though it doesn't seem like I'll be that small by then tonight. Usually, it is a lot more visibly noticeable than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Well I guess there's nothing for it but to give it time, then.\" Sara remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora can see the young woman's face showing the slightest sign of resisting some internal desire, yet she can only guess what that desire is. \"Indeed. This is the first time I've tried to control this, as previously I just grow out of control until I can find shade.\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Well if you can keep yourself from growing and grow to a target size... maybe you can shrink down to normal, too?\" Sara suggests after a few moments of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried before, and it does not seem to work like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try harder.\" Sara implores, her eyes glowing blue for a few seconds, just long enough for Flora to catch a glimpse before it's gone. With that, the blonde gently pats the plant woman's back before heading back indoors to rejoin Megan and Audrey. Just before the door closes completely, the plant girl spies the young woman make a fist pump, though she has no idea what it is for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting that mystery aside, Flora's incredible mind recalls the glow in Sara's eyes with clarity. The plant girl swears that glow wasn't from any external force, having studied enough of human anatomy to know human eyes lack a reflective layer in the back of the retina like certain animals do to bounce any light back out, and it was only for a moment. Yet she did not know how the girl's eyes glowed, much less <i>why</i> they did. Needless to say, her curiosity and interest is peaking, her thirst for knowledge wanting her to learn what she can about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of dwelling on what she's seen, Flora decides to give another try at forcing herself back down to her normal size. At least here, outside her friend Audrey's home, there's little to distract her mind from focusing on her goal like a laser. In a matter of moments, her green body begins to withdraw into itself at an increased pace, the world seeming to rush up and expand out in all directions to greet her. She rises to her full, dwindling height, feeling her frame lighten by the second. Her leaves become smaller and narrower as well, still keeping the appearance of a bikini even if the temperature currently feels a bit too cool for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the plant girl feels the compression of her voluptuous body slow to a halt, leaving her at her normal, towering 7'10\" height. Out of curiosity, she attempts to focus on becoming even smaller... but to no avail, much to her minor disappointment. Flora's leaves rustle as she crosses her long, slender, supple arms together across her prominent, prodigious chest and shivers lightly. There are admittedly times where she considers wearing human clothing, especially during winter, though this may also hinder photosynthesis... She wastes no further time in entering the familiar walls of Audrey's house, though takes care to ensure her long, flowing cherry blossom pink hair doesn't get caught in the doorway. She had learned a painful yet valuable lesson the last time she let that happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the plant girl enters the kitchen to prepare herself a sandwich to eat, knowing Audrey usually keeps some sliced ham in the refrigerator. She's by no means a vegetarian, she happily consumes meat just like most humans. As she brings out the things she wants to put in her sandwich, Flora gets the sense that she's not alone in the kitchen... yet she sees no one when she looks over her shoulder. \"Hmm. I must have imagined it...\" she concludes, trying to shake off the feeling as she finishes making her sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagined what?\" a familiar voice asks curiously from directly behind the plant girl, causing Flora to yelp in shock and surprise when she turns around, unintentionally dropping her sandwich in her shock. Faster than she can perceive, the owner of the voice catches her intended meal well before it can hit the ground. \"Whoops! Didn't mean to startle you!\" Megan apologizes, a slight, friendly giggle escaping her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few moments to let her heart gradually resume its normal rhythm and stop trying to pound its way out of her chest like a jackhammer, Flora is able to regain her composure (mostly) and inquire, \"Megan! W-where did you <i>come</i> from?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette, slightly more than an inch shy of reaching the base of Flora's neck, smirks as she answers, \"Well, Flora... when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was not what I -\" Flora starts as she and Megan walk to the table, only for her to stop as she catches on. \"Oh. <i>Ohhh</i>... Sorry, I tend to not immediately catch some of the subtler social cues...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an outsider to human society. I get it. Kind of like Dr. Temperance Brennan from Bones, if she were part plant.\" Megan says, smiling, \"...you have no idea who I'm referring to at all, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None whatsoever, I'm afraid... Er, could I have my sandwich back? I do not know how you managed to catch it so impossibly quick, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's green eyes flickered in response to the plant girl mentioning having seen her catch her sandwich unnaturally fast. She reaches up to her ear, playing with one of her Master Sword earrings while her face appears to hint at some internal debate, and finally sighs. \"I was kind of hoping to avoid having to tell you this, but you're alarmingly clever...\" she says as she hands the sandwich back, \"Well, why don't you have your sandwich first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora nods, and quickly begins to eat the sandwich she prepared, which also takes an unsurprisingly short amount of time for her to finish even though she by no means rushes to consume it. During this time, Sara enters the kitchen in her pajamas, teddy bear tucked under her right arm while the left pulls open the fridge door for a cold glass of milk. \"Oh! I see you took my advice from earlier, huh, Flora?\" she remarks sweetly, a smile spreading on her remarkable face. \"So, what are you and Megan chatting about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and it seems to have worked.\" Flora replies with a nod after swallowing the last of her meal. She turns her attention back to Megan, still expecting whatever it was the brunette was supposedly hoping to avoid having to reveal as Sara walked over to the table to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I still need to confess, then...\" Megan admits, \"I'm a goddess. I watched you and Audrey return from that old park earlier, but kept myself hidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora is about to express her lack of belief in Megan's claim when she sees Sara drop her glass in surprise... only for it to stop just millimeters from hitting the floor, floating in the air until the blonde picks it up, leaving her bear hovering until she wraps her arm around it again in the process. \"Oh yeah, and Sara here is a demigoddess. It's a long story...\" Megan adds calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresented with seemingly overwhelming evidence that the brunette's claim is true, and the questions in her mind about all of this multiplying faster than she can process them, Flora loses consciousness, flopping heavily onto the table, which groans slightly in protest. Exhaustion likely has also played a part in what has happened. \"Well <i>that</i> could have gone better...\" Megan remarks quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, you <i>think</i>?\" Sara says, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Flora remains unconscious, Megan uses her power to alleviate the situation, causing the plant girl to snooze peacefully instead. She and Sara decide to take this time to examine their new friend as carefully as they could, pushing her limp body back into her seat first to get her off the table. Before they can begin to sate their curiosity, however, Sara's sister Audrey enters the kitchen. \"What was that noise?\" she asks, before noticing Flora's body slumped back in her seat, \"What the hell did you two do to Flora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't do anything harmful to her, Audrey! Honest!\" Sara answers her older sister's demand, \"The day's excitement must have caught up with Flora, and so I guess her mind needs time to... I don't know, sift through it all or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flora flopped on the table, so we pushed her back into her seat.\" Megan adds, \"Though ideally we should probably move her someplace more comfortable... Do you have someplace where she usually stays when she visits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She usually sleeps on the couch in the living room.\" Audrey answers, \"At any rate, you two make sure to turn everything off before going to bed, and make sure my friend is comfortable. Good night.\" and with that, Audrey turns around and heads back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her gone, Megan and Sara resume with the examination. They note how the leaves in Flora's hair are very much attached, and even her leafy anklet around her right leg is subtly attached to her body. What surprises them more is both how pleasant she smells, like a natural perfume, and how utterly soft her skin is, including the soles of her feet. It seems to them that everything about her physically is meant to be as comforting as possible... if not mentally as well. The question is why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the two physically move the plant girl to the couch, noting how heavy she is, nearly 350 lbs. Once done, Megan creates a thin blanket to cover the sleeping green beauty, as well as a pillow to rest her head, and then the girls turn in for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is only when the first rays of the morning sun come through the window to caress her face does Flora begin to stir from her slumber. She yawns sleepily, her lilac eyes slowly opening... until she recognizes the strange feeling of the blanket on top of her body. It's strange because she didn't usually sleep with one, let alone one plenty large enough to cover her. It was... nice, actually, as was the pillow that she also didn't usually use. \"Where did these come from?\" she asks herself in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant girl's memories of last night click in her mind. Megan's sudden appearance... Sara dropping her glass and leaving her teddy bear floating in mid air... And the brief glow of the latter girl's eyes. Megan called herself a goddess, and Sara a demigoddess! But... such things don't exist! There's been no scientific evidence that such beings exist! \"Am I losing it? Gods do not exist... do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And yet, Sara and I do exist, Flora...</i> Megan's voice answers within the plant girl's mind, <i>Come outside if you want further proof, but please don't faint this time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity getting the better of her, Flora gets up, carefully stretching her arms so as to not accidentally hit anything in the process, and walks outside. The morning sun feels amazing on her towering, verdant frame, which she greets with a pleasant smile, but it's not long before the entire house is cast in a strange shadow. Flora stops just before crashing into an equally strange green wall, easily stretching more than twice her height. It seems to taper down at one end, which is capped in white, while the other end has a star emblem encircled by the word Converse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawns on her as she spots the wall's twin a ways off, at an impossible distance for staying on Audrey's property no less, that she's looking at a massive <i>shoe</i>. Stunned, the plant girl backs away a few steps and cranes her neck up. Past the sock-covered shin, beyond a very familiar dark green dress... and up to the massive, smiling face of Megan. \"Good morning, Flora! You wanted proof? This should do very nicely!\" she greets, bending down to scoop the plant girl up into her hands as gently as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she's lifted up into the air, well past any height she's personally reached to date, Flora is at a loss for words. There are so many questions she wants to ask, she fears her mind will be overwhelmed once more. Yet, she feels as though much of them are being repressed, allowing her to compose what she really wishes to say and ask the giantess whose hand she's currently sitting in. \"What... how...\" she starts, right before being interrupted by a loud tune dominated by an electric guitar nearby. \"What is that <i>racket</i>?!\" she asks, covering her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that? That would be the opening theme to X-Men: The Animated Series... and Sara's ringtone. Don't worry, she'll answer it in a moment.\" Megan answers, still keeping her voice low enough to not be painful, yet still it reverberates with the power at her disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the tune stops with a beep, followed by Sara speaking, \"Hello? Oh, hey Davis! Megan's a bit busy talking to a friend of my sister at the moment... No, you can leave the message with me and I'll let her know right away. Okay, we'll talk to you later, bud.\" Flora turns her head as the blonde comes into view, seemingly at the same enormous scale as her friend. \"That was Davis. He wanted to let you know he's still doing okay, and hopes we're faring well. He groaned a bit when I mentioned you talking with Flora.\" Sara then looks down upon the plant girl and waves. \"Hi! Don't mind us being so huge, Megan here likes to assume her true size for a bit around this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can totally stay 6'4\" for as long as I want to. I just like returning to my true size now and then, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm more than happy to keep you company at this scale, so it works out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, excuse me, but... What is this \"X-Men\" you were referring to?\" Flora interrupts, curious, having never heard of this sort of thing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a cartoon from the 90's based around the comic book series of the same name. Sara's been into them since Titania Girl hit stores years ago, and still upset she missed the casting call.\" Megan explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, more bummed than anything now... Though I <i>am</i> curious how well this Valerie Smith girl will do in the role.\" Sara admits before changing the subject, \"But somehow I doubt you want to listen to a demigoddess geek out about comics, right? No, you'd rather have some questions answered, wouldn't you, Flora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Flora nods and proceeds with some of her questions. \"Y-yes. How is the property being extended without anyone noticing? How are <i>you two</i> able to avoid causing panic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to accidentally crush anything underfoot, so I will the land to make room for me. And unless we want them to, no one thinks our size is at all strange. A 360 foot giantess and her slightly taller friend are so mundane to them... apparently.\" Megan answers, then adds sheepishly, \"Honestly, even we're at a bit of a loss as to how it all works other than it just does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what you'd like to ask me, and the answer is no. Audrey's not a demigoddess, and she doesn't yet know that I am, but I'll be telling her before we head home. I promised my parents I would, and I'm a girl of my word.\" Sara informs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Flora responds, feeling her position in Megan's enormous hand to be increasingly uncomfortable. She's used to towering over people with her 7'10\" height, not feeling like an insect in someone's hand. However, it'd be a couple hours yet before she would have absorbed enough direct sunlight to be able to grow, and she doubted these two would stay massive for that long, so she decides to keep her discomfort to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, with the giantesses taking a seat on the ground in the process, the plant girl asks the question that recently has been burning in her mind. \"Are either of you responsible for my creation? I believe it was roughly 20 years ago now. Audrey believes I have a deep connection to nature, and it has made me question <i>why</i> I exist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not, otherwise I'd have a definite answer for you on the other part of your question.\" Megan answers, \"But, it's obvious that you have a much deeper connection to nature than humans. You <i>are</i> part plant, after all, and most people... don't really pay much attention to nature these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't think you're an accident, Flora. We may never really know who or what may have had a hand in creating you, or why, but I think my sister's on to something.\" Sara interrupts, \"I, for one, am just glad you do exist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora is pleased to know that Audrey's sister likes her as well, as well as Megan, who nodded in agreement with the blonde's sentiment. Audrey's really the only friend she's had in her life, so she's grateful to now be making a couple more, even if they're quite... extraordinary. This belief also serves to make resting back in Megan's hand more tolerable, knowing she's not in any danger. The plant girl resolves that she will make every attempt to show she means no harm whenever she's giant, as this experience has given her valuable insight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may still be no closer to understanding the reason for her existence, but perhaps that's a mystery she can allow time to reveal the answer to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A short time later, Flora is back to facing a more normal sized Megan and Sara, which while she had gotten far more comfortable with being giant, was still a relief to her that she was taller than them once more. She could theorize all day about why she feels that way, but recognizes it wouldn't be productive, and since she now knows she can control this growth ability of hers, she wishes to get as much practice in as possible so as to be able to master it. Her mind wanders through some possibilities once she has mastered this ability, like gaining a clue to the reason of her existence, and even the question of if she can shrink back to her normal height while still exposed to sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Flora and her new friends head inside for breakfast. Megan had bought several breakfast items from McDonald's, and now they were about to enjoy the meals in Audrey's house. \"This meal's caloric content is alarmingly high, along with the sodium...\" Flora remarks, as though no one else present knew this already or cared. And in all honesty, the scent of eggs, sausage, and hash browns is making her mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this isn't the healthiest thing to put in one's body in the slightest. But it's not <i>that</i> bad as long as you don't eat the stuff like every day.\" Sara confirms, even as she wastes little time in devouring a hash brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara has a point, you know.\" Audrey says, having joined the three for breakfast. \"Besides, since my sister and her friend went out of their way to get breakfast at McDonald's for everyone here, who are we to look a gift horse in the mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make sense. There are no horses present for miles, at least as far as I am aware, let alone in front of us! And why would someone wish to look a horse in the mouth, gifted to them or otherwise?\" Flora responds, mistakenly believing Audrey is talking about real horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a figure of speech, Flora. Just enjoy it as a treat.\" Audrey sighs, proceeding to start on her meal before it gets cold and motioning Flora to do the same with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant girl complies, and takes an exploratory nibble into her food. Deciding that she enjoyed the taste, Flora proceeds to consume the rest of her meal in earnest. She hasn't tried any fast food before, for various reasons, but she can perhaps understand why humans seem to enjoy it so much now. The oil left behind on her fingers from the hash brown is decidedly... less pleasant, and she quickly wipes it off with a napkin. Another is used to clean off her naturally rose petal colored lips, a color she's decided to share with her nails lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the plan today? I still got to figure out how that note got on the inside of my shop's door despite locking up before we left yesterday, and then I should probably sweep. If you girls want, you can help with tending to the plants.\" Audrey inquires once they're all finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was considering going over to the park you showed me yesterday. Perhaps I will be able to grant it the care it's been lacking for so long, as well as practice my growth ability some more.\" Flora answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tag along with Flora to this park she's talking about.\" Megan states, \"I'm kind of curious about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you out, Audrey. After all, what are sisters for?\" Sara says. She quickly adds to Flora, \"Please don't try to answer that, my green friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the four ladies leave the house. Flora notes that Sara is not wearing the high heels she had on yesterday and this morning, but instead a pair of purple Converse tennis shoes. \"Getting tired of those heels of yours, Sara?\" Megan asks, almost jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if! I just wanted to wear something more practical for helping my sister out!\" Sara replies with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group eventually arrives at Audrey's Little Shop of Wonders, splitting up from there. Flora continues on past, heading for the park, while Megan follows behind, needing to run to keep up with the plant girl's long, excited strides. A shrill noise blares from the store well behind them, causing Flora to stumble momentarily as she practically jumps out of her own skin in frightened surprise. The store alarm got her almost every time, and she greatly disliked it, but she understood why it was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding why humans steal, however, was another matter entirely, and one she was not particularly keen on trying to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. It's just like I remember it... all run-down and wild. Feels like a Rattata could jump out at any moment!\" Megan remarks as she steps foot in the abandoned park with Flora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Flora inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Rattata. You know, from Pokemon?\" Megan answers. \"You've no idea what I'm even talking about, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. Sorry. Nor do I know what a \"we you\" is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later. Anyway, where do you want to start while we wait for your proverbial battery to charge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora thinks it over, uncertain as to the answer of the goddess' question. She hasn't really thought of how to proceed here. However, she senses something from the plant life... as though it is <i>telling</i> her what it desires. The plant girl wonders why, and the answer presents itself: the plants want to <i>help</i> her, so great is their adoration of her. \"I... I think I understand, now. Nature itself possesses a collective consciousness, and it is this which adores me... although it has yet to reveal why.\" she remarks, in awe of this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's pretty cool! So, where would it like us to begin?\" Megan replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We start with the entangled benches, though I believe I may be able to handle this myself.\" Flora informs, approaching one of the benches. The plant girl closes her lilac eyes, concentrating upon asking the plants to withdraw from the man-made object. Sensing confusion over her request, and realizing a need for clarity, she tries again with simpler, easier to understand terms. The plants begin moving of their own accord, years of growth withdrawing from the bench. Megan stands there in shock and awe, while Flora opens her eyes and smiles in admiration of her success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours of testing her newfound ability, which included crafting a giant sculpture in her relative likeness at Megan's suggestion, Flora can sense a familiar sensation within her body. Her initial fear causes her to slowly sprout taller, her leaves rustling as they expand with her body, before she is able to focus on disallowing her growth to continue, pausing at roughly 10 feet tall. She looks down towards Megan, cheeks red with embarrassment over her little accident in front of one of her new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to feel embarrassed around me, Flora.\" Megan says, trying to reassure her. \"I'm not judging you or anything. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and I'd be lying if I said I was an exception...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I experimented with Sara a bit, and wound up awakening her demigoddess self. Then there was that time I forgot to save my progress, and turned my game off...\" Megan changes the subject. \"How about for a challenge, you double your size and hold it there for a few hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora considers the suggestion, and ultimately nods in compliance. The pleasant sensation returns, but as with yesterday, the voluptuous growing plant girl keeps it in line. She does note that it feels somewhat less intense this time... Perhaps regularly practicing may help keep the sensation in check in some way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she watches her perspective slowly rise, and feels the soles of her bare feet sink in to and push through the soil. She wiggles her expanding toes a little, absentmindedly, while her bones creak and groan like trees in a strong wind as they gain and support ever more mass. Her legs are already like twin tree trunks as she continues her ascent, yet as Megan notes upon curiously touching one, still as soft as ever. Her massive breasts... speak for themselves, even though they're no larger proportionately than they were at her normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Flora halts her growth at 20 feet, her cherry blossom hair on top of her head just grazing the cusp of her sculpture counterpart's own impressive chest. With a content sigh, the giant plant girl takes a relaxing seat upon the ground. \"I believe I'm improving in my control of this ability I possess.\" she remarks. She turns to look at Megan seated next to her, who is nearly as large as her. \"However, I hope you aren't responsible for it. No offense, Megan, but I need to be able to control this on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken, Flora! I assure you, this is all your doing. No tricks on my part.\" Megan responds, smiling. \"I mean, I've always tried to let the achievements of those I care about be their own, whether it be Davis beating me in a Pokemon battle, the early humans I watched over, or anything in between!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora's smile widens upon hearing her goddess friend's response. While she relaxes, the plant girl's incredible mind begins to imagine the ways in which she can put her newly discovered ability to good use. She begins to believe that the flowers she's tended to growing especially well are because of this adoration and desire to aid her in any way she wishes. It seems plausible, and while it means she may not necessarily have to tend to them to get that effect, she by no means is going to stop doing the activity she greatly enjoys.</span></div></div>",

Well, let's give you some choices, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella - 18 years old, Bella is an anthropomorphic horse, with chestnut-brown fur and a coal-black mane. Standing at an imposing six feet and three inches, and with D cup breasts as well as an equally large behind, Bella knows what it is like to be big - but is merely being big enough for her? Most definitely not. She wants to be bigger than that. She wants to be bigger than her Master's house. She wants to be bigger than the farm her Master owns. And when her wish for growth is mysteriously granted one day, she'll be doing everything she possibly can to make herself grow even more - even bigger, even sexier, on and on and on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian - 21 years old, Vivian the anthro gryphoness dwells simultaneously within two worlds, neither instance of her aware of the other. One Vivian lives within a realm straight out of a furry Fantasy novel, in which she is the empress of the Goldpine Empire, and being of unparalleled magic power. The other Vivian lives within a world more-or-less identical to our own, with the key difference being the existence of anthropomorphic creatures. In this second world, Vivian is a nurse - and the ultra-sexy object of desire for any patient she sees. With black fur and gold plumage, standing at five feet nine inches, and with E cup breasts, Vivian is no stranger to size. But what will more size do to a gentle soul such as her? What would happen if the benevolent ruler of the world's most powerful nation suddenly started to grow? What would happen if an infamously sexy nurse also suddenly started to grow? Whatever the answer is, Vivian's going up - and up - and up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze - Breeze is an anthro horse assumed to be around the equivalent of twenty in human years - assumed, because she transformed into an anthro in a world where they otherwise do not exist. Standing at almost a massive eight feet tall, and with curves so insanely huge it's a miracle she can stand up, the pure white-furred mare would most certainly be able to bewitch any male with her appearance alone. But she wouldn't do that; she's too shy. Too innocent in regards to her body, too shy, and too scared of the world beyond her Master's farm. Gentle in every respect, Breeze would allow no harm to befall anything or anyone, were she to grow any further - that said, however, she isn't entirely knowledgeable about the purpose of her human curves - either that or she doesn't care - and so her small human Master spends plenty of time in contact with those jiggly chest-melons whenever Breeze decides it's time for another hug. And those chest-melons are only going to get bigger, as is Breeze - bigger and bigger and bigger...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rolling your shoulders, you picked up the heavy bucket of oats and began to walk, each step producing a squelching sound as the wet mud underfoot was compacted by your boots. Your other hand adjusted your overalls as you looked up to the overcast sky. Not a single scrap of blue could be found in your entire field of view, and so you turned your view downwards, towards the muddy ground of your farm once again. It didn't take long to reach the paddock where you kept your horses, it being only a short distance away from the farmhouse; and as usual, a small swarm of horses met you, each and every one of them trying to get at the oats you held in the large metal bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't quite sure at what point anthros appeared, but by the time you were born their numbers were large enough to replace some species almost entirely. Never once in your entire life had you seen a non-anthro dog, cat, horse or sheep, except for in old photos and drawings. Talking about dogs, you'd told your sheepdog to remain inside for now and rest for when you needed her. It was almost time to shear the sheep again, and she'd need all of her energy for herding them about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the paddock, you hold the bucket of oats to your chest, wading through the swarm of mares trying to pilfer the food from you. With a good two or so decades of practice, you effortlessly weave through the crowd, ducking under hugging arms, through gals in the crowd, even underneath legs if you had to. You quickly make it to the horses' trough and pour in their food, retreating some as the crowd swarms around it. You had a small herd of horses, about twelve of them in all. All were female - you didn't want them running off to another farm and impregnating every made there - and all were far taller than your height of five feet and eight inches. The shortest mare you owned was exactly six feet tall. All were also heavily muscled due to their equine bodies' development, and many sported tantalisingly large breasts and behinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany finishing off their meal within seconds, you are beset by a kissing, licking, hugging mass of horse; curves squish into you from every direction, muscled arms squeeze you tight. You lay there, dazed, head spinning as your mares finish lavishing their affections on you. But as they move back into their own groups, one remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur the colour of chestnuts, a mane black as the night sky. Grey, three-fingered hands gently grasp your sides, effortlessly lifting you up from the muddy ground, as if you were no more than a toddler. The bulky, muscular arms hold you against a torso just as muscular, before their owner moves you up beyond her breasts, allowing you to see her face. \"Hey, Bella,\" you say, swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mars smiles wide. \"Hello, Master,\" she almost shouts, muzzle immediately beginning to bore into you, her tongue lashing out at irregular intervals. \"Look, Master, I stayed behind to help you after the other horses went away! Am I a good girl? Did I please you, Master?\" There she goes again. Always wanting to please you, to seem better than the other horses. The brunt of her muzzle presses into you tenderly, and you feel a slight blush coming over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I, uh,\" you stammer as Bella big brown eyes seem to stare into your very soul. You swallow, regaining your composure - and try to ignore the mare's breasts pushing into you, her nipples already hard. \"Yes, Bella, you're a good girl.\" At your words, the mare snorts happily, tail swishing left and right as she wiggles about in joy, letting out a little squeal. Before Bella can begin to lavish her own praises on you, however, you interrupt her: \"The fields could do with some ploughing, Bella. Think you're up to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare gently places you on the ground, allowing you to look up at her body, which, compared to yours, was utterly massive. Thick, corded muscles tensed and bulged at her command, as she flexed her strong arms, the muscles seeking to swell even larger as she did so. \"Eee, more than up to it,\" the young mare squeals, her high-pitched voice at odds with her intimidating appearance. She lowers her muzzle one last time, licking the top of your head. \"Ooh, I won't disappoint you, Master, I'm such a good girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bella sprinted away, towards the shed where you kept the farming equipment, you couldn't help but feel her affections felt stronger than before. As of her entire body was stronger. Brushing it off, you go about your daily routine until it is time to plough the fields. </span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, you liked to do it. After all, your mares needed to know they were doing a good job and... 'pleasing' you, as Bella so often put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella. She was a sweet thing, and one of your favourite mares, if not <i>the</i> favourite - though you'd never tell that to any of the mares you owned. You didn't want for them to be jealous of her. Her brown-pelted body, large muscles and bulging curves, however, were rather alluring to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd lined up the ploughmares and were instructing them when you noticed something odd. You weren't sure how it had escaped your notice until now, but you stopped instructing, and started staring - and as you did, the mares started staring as well. Bella always stood tall and proud when lined up, and now was no exception - but this time, she was taller, Prouder. More so than any other mare in the line, in fact. You blinked i confusion - surely it had to be your mind playing tricks on you? But no matter how much you blinked or rubbed at your eyes, Bella remained larger than any other mare in sight, her broad shoulders threatening to bump the heads of the two mares whom she was next to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached Bella, shivering a little. \"B-Bella, sweetie,\" you began, as she smiled down at you, brown eyes seeming to sparkle. \"Are you... feeling alright?\" The mare broke out into a glorious smile, and instantly leaned down. Her brawny arms wrapped you up into a hug that pressed you into her now much larger breasts, and she easily lifted you over a foot off the ground by just standing straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, more than alright, Master,\" Bella squealed as she nuzzled into you. The other ploughmares, adorned in leather collars and straps, all shifted about nervously as they looked at her - her collar and straps were strained to the very limit, her muscular body seeming more than ready to bust them apart! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, ploughing's going to be so easy, Master! You'll see how much of a good girl I am! Go on, hook my up to the plough by myself!\"</span></div></div>",

I <i>know</i> that I can plough all by myself, I just know it!\" As Bella talks, her straps all strain with the sound of creaking, stretching lether, minute rips and tears appearing in most of them. The mare lets out a huffing breath, tongue peeking out of her mouth for a brief moment. \"Pleease, Master?\" Bella asks, eyes boring into you. \"I'm stronger than any other mare you have - probably stronger than all of them put together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld against Bella's muscular form and almost engulfed in brown fur, you sigh. \"Bella, sweetie, can you put me down?\" you ask - the mare does so immediately, and gently. \"Walk with me,\" you say, taking one of her hands into your own - or rather, allowing her to engulf one of your hands with one of hers - and begin to walk away from the small crowd of ploughmares, Bella's monstrously strong form towering over you as you walk. Once you're far enough away from the crowd that you know none of them can hear you or Bella, you begin to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bella, I know that you're big and strong, more so than any other mare on the farm,\" you begin, the mare beaming at your words. \"But,\" you continue, Bella visibly deflating at the word. \"I don't want you getting hurt. What if something went wrong while you're poughing? Not only would my strongest, biggest mare be out of action, but you could be seriously hurt!\" It takes a lot of your strength to do so, but you lift up one of Bella's grey-furred, three-fingered hands, holding it up but unable to cover it. \"I'm not letting that happen, Bella. I know you're very strong, sweetie, but if you got hurt, it'd be my fault.\" Gently kissing the fur of her hand, you're unprepared for the mare to snatch you up in a one-armed hug, licking and nuzzling all over your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Master!\" Bella squeals, the sound like quiet thunder. \"You're so sweet...

The results can often be utterly disastrous, as natural laws are overwritten, causality itself becomes a fractured mess, and the stars themselves sputter out and die. Sometime, however, these intersections can be unnoticeable, or very minor - or simply bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake Vivian Goldpine, for example. An anthropomorphic gryphoness with fluffy black fur and wonderful gold feathers, oversized breasts, and plenty of junk in the trunk, Vivian would be notable for her appearance alone were she not a direct result of several dimensional intersections. A living wound in the fabric of space-time, Vivian lives simultaneously within many different dimensions, each instance of her unaware of any other instances. Every Vivian has the same appearance and the same personality, however, yet each is in a different situation depending what world they dwell in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe particular Vivian we are going to follow for this story is a mighty empress, ruler of the most powerful nation on her planet - and a being of immense magical power. Despite her station, she is still the same happy, fluffy gryphoness she ever has been or will be, not allowing her power to affect her in any adverse ways. These magical powers, however, have been slowly snowballing, growing greater and greater, bubbling up inside Vivian and begging to be used for more and more impressive feats - and Vivian's refusal to give in to he own power will soon cause that same power to change her body drastically, both to allow her to safely contain it... and to cause her to grow ever more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian let out a satisfied sigh as she sat upon her throne, her large royal behind squeezed into the seat, and her similarly oversized mammaries resting almost in her lap as she leant upon one elbow. Today had been a good day for the avian empress - no particularly pressing matters, and only a few easily-resolved problems that had required her attention. That, and an envoy from the Terran Kingdom had arrived - it would be good to talk to a human again, they were always so cute and soft...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian blinked, a slight blush appearing on her gold-feathered cheeks. Clearing her throat, she looked towards the retainers stood on either side of her throne. Both were female anthropomorphic rabbits, naked except for the fur covering their bodies and an iron helmet each. It had been a tradition since the very founding of the Goldpine Empire that the Emperor or Empress' retainers would wear no armour save their helmet - both to distract and throw off opponents during potentially hostile negotiations, and to engender a sense of intimate familiarity between the ruler and their guards. After all, if an Empress couldn't reveal her secrets to those who ahd been trained from birth to protect her, how could they properly perform their jobs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunneis in question wore helmets with hole cut into the top, so as to allow their large ears to stand freely. Clasped in their furry hands were a long halberd each, both guards masters in their use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not as attractive as Vivian - indeed, was their ever a being more attractive than her? - their bodies were still impressive, steely muscles hidden behind white fur and accentuated by soft curves. \"Selyna,\" Vivian spoke, attracting the attention of her right-hand bunny. \"Can you please escort the envoy in? I believe he has been waiting for long enough, and I am ready to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most-unarmoured rabbit thumped a clenched fist to her chest in salute, small breasts jiggling slightly at the impact. \"Yes, o Empress,\" she spoke, and began to jump swiftly, propelling herself forward with both legs. Vivian giggled under her breath - she always found rabbits' method of locomotion rather endearing. Rather than walking or running, they jumped, and the gryphon Empress found it oddly adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian took in a breath, preparing herself for whatever would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of envoy was waiting to see her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Selyna soon came back into sight, jumping slowly through the grand arch that lead to Vivian's throne room. Beside her was a thin and very pale human male, stumbling to keep up with her unusual gait. His clothes hung awkwardly on his frame, as if they had been made for a man much larger than him, and his eyes were sunken, his face gaunt. Selyna lead him to a short distance from Vivian's throne and bowed deeply, before returning to her position beside her Empress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been many years since an envoy from the Terran Kingdom has visited the Goldpine Empire,\" Vivian remarked in a warm tone, smiling down at the human in an attempt to dispel the sense of forbidding she felt in the pit of her stomach. \"Please, envoy, tell me your name and the purpose of your visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my name is Blake, your- your Highness,\" the human mumbled, eyes cast towards the floor as if afraid of offending the ruler simply by laying his eyes on her. \"I come to- to request aid. The Kingdom is suffering under widespread famine, your Highness, and we fear that if we do not receive aid our country will fracture completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian sighed softly, the edges of her break downturned. The Terran Kingdom had to have been the most unlucky nation to have ever existed. Formed from a massive slave revolt hundreds of years ago, freeing enough oppressed humans to form a small country, the Kingdom had always either been on the defensive in some war or suffered from some other malady, as if the gods themselves were trying to force the humans back into the slavery their entire species once chafed under. Now, the Terran Kingdom was a small rump state sandwiched between the Goldpine Empire and the land belonging to the Draconic Clans, with an ailing economy and a citizenry slowly being absorbed by the dragons, many of whom, despite recognising their nation's past sins, still wanted a cute little human to either smother with affection or work to the bone - or some combination of the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We- the-the treaties our nations signed following the Second Great Famine promised aid should something like this happen again,\" Pulling a backpack off of himself - something that Vivian had not initially notice, having concentrated on his appearance and ill-fitting tunic - Blake began to frantically pull ancient scrolls out of the cloth bag, seeming to be on the edge of tears. \"P-please, Empress, I beg of you, save my people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian felt her heart go out to the envoy, and with a determined expression, she rose from her throne. Lessening the effect was the jiggling of her T&amp;A. Regardless, the Empress descended the steps of her rock throne, standing right in front of Blake as her guards tightened their grips on their halberds. Vivian idly noted that the human was a good three inches or so shorter than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your nation shall have all the food it needs and more, Blake,\" Vivian spoke softly and slowly, eyes boring into Blake's very soul. \"Our fields are eternally bountiful, and so it will be no strain on us to aid you in your time of need.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes wide open and jaw dropped slightly, the envoy absorbed the news he had been given; a tear made its way down his cheek as he began to blubber inelegantly. \"E-Empress... Oh, th-thank you, Empress!\" The man nearly collapsed to his feet but Vivian caught him, laying his head against her fluffy shoulder and crooning gently. Nuzzling down on the human with her beak, Vivian attracted the attention of her second retainer - Aelsanna - with a hand gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aelsanna, this man requires rest, as well as nourishment. Please retrieve the room to the guest room that I had set aside, and tell the kitchens to set aside some fruit for our guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her retainer saluted, bowed, and began to jump out of her throne room, Vivian wondered if it would be worth using her magic to aid the Terran Kingdom. She knew, however, that her body adapted to her use of magic - using high-level Magic caused her to grow more powerful, so as to be able to perform that magic with greater ease. But it would take time to gather the food required to aid the Kingdom, and she did not know if she had that time...</span></div></div>",

She didn't even seem to know what the fleshy spheres on her chest were for, nor why I got embarrassed whenever she moved them near me. Whatever had turned her from a regular horse into a... A furry... Clearly hasn't given here much knowledge on human erogenous zones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day she turned into a furry, I discovered the transformation in the morning, when I went to give her her food and water. It was a shock to both of us; neither of us knew what had happened, or how, and both of us were scared. It took a while for us to calm down, and, initially, I tried to keep things as normal as they could be, despite the eight-foot and ultra-busty mare requesting for me to 'ride' her every so often - I later found out that what she meant by 'ride' was 'be given a piggyback ride' rather than... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also some issues that came up soon after she transformed. Heavy rainfall severely damaged the stable she slept in, and so I had to move her into my house - she was so tall that she could just about stand up without her head hitting the ceiling. Her rack was so big that she couldn't see anything directly in front of and below her, and her muscular frame was so broad that she had trouble fitting through doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe managed to make it work - though with some difficulty. It helped that Breeze was still the same sweet-hearted mare she always was, always trying to nuzzle down on me or hug me or convince me to play some game with her - or even just to sit with her and watch TV, which she had proven to be utterly spellbound by. Usually, I only offered token resistance to Breeze's affection, as I enjoyed receiving it as much as she enjoyed giving it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was her small Master, and she was my big, fluffy horse. Not everything was as good as I told Breeze it was, though - I kept her inside whenever I could; I lived a ways away from the nearest village but I didn't want to take the risk of a driver seeing her while passing by, or some mapping satellite managing to catch a picture of her... I was scared for her safety, almost every day, but I never told her. I didn't want her to be worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, though, Breeze always managed to make me relax, made me forget about anything that worried me, simply by being herself. She really was such a sweet mare. </span></div></div>",

Breeze's rumbling breaths seemed to shake the entire room as she gently held me in place against her immense body, thick arms wrapped around my smaller form. Sat in Breeze's lap as the massive mare lavished her affections on me, I couldn't help but smile wider and wider whenever her big, grey muzzle nosed down on me. As always, Breeze herself was sat on the floor against the wall, long muscular legs stretching to the other side of the room; her butt squishing magnificently against the wall and floor, her immense breasts pushing and pressing into me with every motion she made. I'd turned the TV on for her, and her eyes fixated on the flatscreen even as her head periodically bobbed down to nose on the back of my head and gently lick me with that velvety tongue of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't really paying attention to what program was on the TV - the news, I think it was. I was much more focused on the white mare hugging me into those soft, jiggly spheres of hers, and on trying to keep from blushing too hard. Reaching up with a hand, I gently brushed Breeze's cheeks, the mare nickering in response. Effortlessly lifting me up, she rotated me so that I faced inwards, and hugged me all the tighter. It was an odd sensation, being smooshed into her body - her beachball-sized breasts pushing into almost my entire upper body with their warm, soft curves; the little bit of her smooth stomach that I could feel, muscular and solid beyond what any bodybuilder could hope to achieve, the soft, furry surface rippling slightly whenever she moved her torso; and her massive arms behind me, encircling me with their fluffy, muscled bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing Breeze\u2019s muzzle seemed to take the weight off my shoulders. It helped me relax, which was good - constantly worrying about Breeze wasn\u2019t the best thing for my mental health, but the white mare herself seemed to set me at ease simply by being near me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI motioned for Breeze to cease her affectionate nuzzlings for a brief moment, and checked the time on my watch; 1 PM - lunch time. Breeze always resisted letting go of me, as if out of fear that I would break like fine china if not in her sight, but she also always relented, and I went to the kitchen to prepare our food. For myself, I shoved a ready meal in the microwave, and for Breeze I collected several carrots. I had expected Breeze\u2019s diet to change following her transformation, but she still seemed to eat what she had as a horse, and no more of it despite her size. Popping back into the living room, I handed Breeze the carrots, which disappeared into her mouth almost instantly. I re-entered the kitchen before she could sweep me up into another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat next to her on the floor once my food was done, my plate resting on my lap. I kept glancing back between Breeze and the TV, though - I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something about her was off\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreeze,\u201d I said, getting her attention. \u201cDo you think you can stand up? I want to test something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze did, her bulk shifting as she rose to her feet...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Breeze's muscular form shifted, muscles rippling and curves jiggling wildly. I swallowed a quick bite of my food before setting the plate to one side, watching as a single, large hoof impacted the floor as Breeze maneuvered her unwiedly body about, the vibrations cascading through my body. Her hoof left a small dent in the floor - one that was hard to notice, but definitely there, and one of many. Her other hoof thumped down and Breeze lifted her bulky torso up, her entire body slowly straightening out as she stood, bit by bit. as I watched on in awe. Breeze truly was beautiful - though I doubted I'd ever tell her that. She was too innocent. She didn't need to know my thoughts on her body, or why I was worried about her going outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart skipped a beat as Breeze's head thumped against the ceiling, and she recoiled, whining, half in shock and half from the slight, unexpected pain that it caused. Breeze hunched over to fit into the room, standing up, and it only made her seem all the more huge. She turned towards me, an uneasy look on her muzzle - one that was mirrored by the expression on my face. \"Breeze,\" I began, stumbling to my feet, imlications whizzing through my mind. It was like being drunk or simply very tired, in a way - a kind of fog that clouded everything except Breeze's sheer size, which now seemed so much more intimidating than it ever had done before. \"You- you've grown.\" Mouth hanging open slightly, the white mare nodded, eyes wide. She reached up to the top of her head, rubbing the spot where her head had collided with the ceiling. \"I'd thought you'd grown, but I- I thought it was just paranoia, or something, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trailed off as I looked up at Breeze, and gulped. She was looking at me over the immense fleshy globes affixed to her over-muscled chest with an expression that I had seen on her face before - only now it was so much more intense. A mixture of worry, fear, and... protectiveness. Breeze's voice was as soft as ever as she spoke, perhaps even sfoter - as if she was deliberately speaking more quietly than normal. \"I... I have, Master,\" she said as she looked about the room, still hunched over, barely fitting into it. she raised her arms up as high as they'd go without bashing into the ceiling, and flexed both of them, powerful muscles swelling and bulging to obscene sizes at her command. Her pure white tail slowly swished left and right as she bent forward and downwards, twisting her body towards me and unintentionally giving me a glimpse of that vast, heart-shaped ass she possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I go outside, Master,\" Breeze asked, eyes seeming to bore into my very soul. \"I... I think I'm getting too big to stay inside your home.\" The words werespoken softly and quietly, as if she were speaking to a child - and compared to Breeze in terms of size, I was probably even less than that. I nodded dumbly, once, twice, opening my mouth before shutting it. Breeze, getting bigger - already too big to stay inside. It was  a notion that seemed almsot horrifying; what if someone happened t osee Breeze? What if the government tried to take her away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. They wouldn't do that, they'd have to go through me first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took in a deep breath, steadying myself against the ivory pillar of muscle and flesh that Breeze called her thigh. My hand sunk into the plush fur, and I softly rubbed the flesh underneath. \"Yeah, I... I think you are, Breeze. Maybe we should get you outside and then see what happens afterwards.\" Breeze nodded, her muzzle dipping down to rub against me, her tongue poking out to lavish a gentle lick on the top of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Master. I don't know if I'll fit through the door, but I barely fit inside the house anymore. Hopefully I won't grow anymore. I... I don't think I'd be comfortable being any larger.\"</span></div></div>",

The door to the living room was a sliding glass door that led directly outside, and as Breeze made her way out I was very, very glad that I'd had it installed - after all, neither me nor Breeze would take kindly to the notion of her having to knock a hole in the side of my house. Breeze had to twist and turn her body with every gently push, and in the end it took a good few minutes to extract her white-furred bulk from my house. The living room was a mess due to the strain her sheer size had put on it, but I brushed it all off when Breeze, teary-eyed, asked about the damage she'd inadvertently caused. I couldn't bear the thought of making her sad, much less over something she couldn't control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze adapted to living outside surprisingly quickly, considering how much she'd enjoyed living inside my house with me. At first, I was concerned that she'd freeze half to death during the night, but her body produced so much heat that she barely noticed the cold. More than once, I decided to sleep outside with Breeze, and she was so warm that I didn't even need a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I was still worried. I didn't let Breeze see it, but I was more worried than I'd ever been before in my life. She was going to be seen, and I had no choice in the matter. She was going to be seen, sooner or later, and bad things were going to happen, it was only a matter of how long it'd take for them to happen. I'd already been spending almost all of my time with Breeze, but from that moment on I became devoted to her, spending every moment with her that I could, her affections constantly lavished on me and her bulky arms surrounding me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow Breeze was eventually noticed by the public, was, of course...</span></div></div>",

All in all, Skye will be absolutely delighted with her growth, and attempt to grow as big, busty, and strong as possible - but it's likely that she won't be able to comprehend the ramifications of her growth or her own actions at such a size. </span></div></div>",

She had always been the family cow on the farm, for as long as you could remember, having practically grown up alongside her. After a bizarre 'Lunar Event', a small (but sizable) portion of animals have become tall anthropomorphic humanoids. Bessy was one such example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's quite tall, pretty muscular, and heavily endowed. Whatever caused her transformation saw fit to give her very HUMAN-like breasts on top of keeping her udder. When she's not being milked, (an event that happens every other day) Bessy is using her considerable strength and stature to work on the farm. The two of you have grown closer, working alongside each other will do that, so much so that you allow the cow to sleep in your house with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, five years after the 'Event', Bessy seems to be undergoing a new change... in height. Can you two make this constantly changing situation work? Or will your darling cow simply grow too big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sheila was once your pet ferret. She loved to explore your room, and when she could find a way out... the rest of your house. She enjoyed being with you, cuddling close to your side and sneaking into your clothes when you weren't looking. But those days ended when.... one day... you woke up to her having literally burst out of her cage... transformed into a tall, lithe, but busty anthropomorphic humanoid. She's still the same Sheila though, despite now being able to communicate with you... and sporting a smoking hot 5'9\" body with curves that could put most models to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your days are spent cuddling with an overly-affectionate mutant ferret who (in defiance of her changes) still loves to be with you... though these interactions have become much more... heated as of late. Not helped by the realization that, barely a week since her 'change', she's not done growing. What is causing this? Will she stop growing? Will she want to? And will this affect her feelings towards you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Tileeka the Orca Whale was once the star attraction at the now closed 'Seatropics' water park. You were one of the few 'handlers' that she not only seemed to tolerate, but showed affection to. Sadly, for her, when the park closed down, the animals that had been on display were ordered to be released back into the ocean wilds. Tileeka didn't seem to wanna go, in fact she seemed to want to stay close to you. Even when released into the water, Tileeka followed the ship. It was clear she had become quite smitten with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the two of you, your late cousin had a houseboat that you quickly commandeered, moving into it as quickly as you possible could. So for the last few months, you've lived as close to your whale friend as possible. But what if fate had other plans? What if Tileeka was about to get a chance to interact with you in a way never thought of before? Because one morning, when you walked out to greet your beloved friend (as you had done for months now)... what met your eyes wasn't the familiar shape of a whale... but a large anthropomorphic 'whale humanoid'. Now about 26ft in length, with thick curves that resemble a human woman's, your 'girlfriend' seems to want that (previously friendly/joking) title to become quite literal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what of the realization that she grows in length/height the more she eats?</span></div></div>",
