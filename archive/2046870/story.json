Her clothes and pertinent papers in her luggage, and her devices, chargers, and snacks in her backpack. She patted her left jean pocket and right jean pocket: Wallet in the left, Phone and Ticket on the right. As she patted her legs for these important belongings, she felt the impact on her toned, muscular legs. She sighed contently: She had the preparations done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother walked into the room. She was a softer woman: Wider around the hips and with a  larger stomach, the fruits of bearing 2 children, with brown hair with a little bit of age showing on the older hairs, even a bit of gray. \"Ready, hunny?\" Lola smiled a wide smile across her rather fluffy cheeks that her mother adored. \"Yes ma'am, though I don't know if I'm...<i>Ready</i>. Ya know?\" Her mother assumed a look of sympathetic happiness, with a hint of bitter sweetness. \"Ah, dearie, I know exactly what you mean. But I'm proud of you, already a job lined up for you?\" Lola nodded. \"Yep, A job with Shapes Incorporated.\" Her mother adjusted a few hairs that she missed on her forehead, her other hand resting on Lola's shoulder. \"Good. Now remember, Work hard, be good, and don't forget yer morals just because yer gonna be livin' in the city, and make sure to call us!\" Lola nodded and hugged her mother with her tightened, slender arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug was rather long and drawn out, mostly as Lola didn't want to leave her mother in tears. When her mother patted her on the back, she took that as the signal to let go, as did her mother. Lola's father was away on business, but she'd read his message, and she'd replied. With a last look around, she walked to the driveway, hopped into her car, and drove to the Gainesville Interplanetary Port. She'd paid a little extra for the XPress package, so she got 2nd class, a step above coach with better service, as well as pre-checking, so she wouldn't have to bother with the security. She parked her car in the Loading section, got off, ensured everything was with her that she needed: Luggage, Backpack, and her original set of keys-She had a spare given to the Dixie Space people so they could access her car and bring it into the hold. She walked into the port. By the ticket desks stood the national flag: 7 stars on a blue field in the corner, with red, white, and red occupying the rest of the flag, with a globe in the center of the white field.  The security officers had the emblem of the Confederate Transport Security Bureau on a patch upon their left arms: A white horse rearing up surrounded by 7 stars on a blue field. After doing the basic metal-detecting wand test, she was waved on to the waiting area, where she awaited for her section to be called. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">BACKSTORY: In the 21st Century, the Southern States of the USA rose in rebellion, and through guerilla warfare, won their independence. Through diplomatic trade deals, they established beneficial relations with a good amount of the nations of the world, and by the turn of the century, the nations it grew closer with began to see eye-to-eye with this New Confederacy, and by the early 22nd Century, colonies under Confederacy began to flourish, and the Confederacy extended an offer to her allies: Join in a loose confederation of Nation-States. They agreed, and a good amount of the planet came under the Confederate Banner. With the monetary power of the Confederate Dollar, all nations became either vassal-states of the Confederacy, or joined it, except, to this day, the United States, who has held out for a while, but the confederacy now turns its eye eagerly to its former comrades with intents of absorption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong her numerous colonies, the Confederate Planets has an economic bastion in New Virginia, a fertile planet that drills the vital Uranium-355, which is vital for the process of Nuclear Fusion that drives the ships. It also is a fore-runner in a trend that has taken root firmly in the planet: Obesity is prized here. This is where our protagonist comes in. They will either take root and help spread this through Confederate Society, or they will stamp it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least 2 paragraphs per entry, with proper grammar and good descriptiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can kill off the character, just so long as you:<br>\r\nA. Leave an alternate route for the story to go,<br>\r\nB. Make sure the death is reasonable (For instance, if you're using health complications from obesity, establish they're at risk for death from such.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chapters are yours and you can do what you like in them, just so long as you don't attempt to randomly change the entire setting of the universe inexplicably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions, email me. I'm free to answer them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
