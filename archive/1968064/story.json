Sure, there wasn't much pay and you had a really strong suspicion that your boss was secretly embezzling money on an offshore bank account but it was better than nothing. After your parents relocated to the weird tourist town called Gravity Falls because of their new jobs, you've been forced to spend your whole summer vacation there. Not that you didn't mind; you were an only child after all, and you usually spent your summers alone anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, as you worked your days and shifts in the tourist trap, you quickly made friends in Dipper and Mabel, who also worked alongside you and were related to your boss. Outside of work hours, the three of you hung out together, often using that time to explore the supernatural mysteries and dark secrets that enshroud the town. Some days were spent just watching Ducktective in their bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, no matter the situation, you couldn't stop staring down at Dipper's feet and his black sneakers. Even as you tried to keep your mind off his feet by focusing on literally anything else, all you could think about it was how much his sweaty feet must smell after a long day and your desire to lick them clean from the sweat that has likely been accumulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was one of the more laidback days where you hung out in the confines of the twins' bedroom. You found yourself idly lying down on the wooden floor, reading a book you brought from home when you felt something warm and soft land on your face, obstructing your sense of sight. Before you even had a chance to react, your nose picked up a strong pungent smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax and breathe in,\" he cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipper gently rubbed his socks all over your face, gripping his toes where he could and smirking as your face scrunched up. But he wasn't done yet. He playfully wiggled his toes directly on top of your nostrils, making sure you got a good sample of the sharp smell of his boyish foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a small feeling that you liked my feet,\" Dipper chuckled as he slowly teased you, subtly placing his other foot on the surface of your lips, as if he's nudging you to let his foot into your mouth...</span></div></div>",

From your view, you could see the boy more clearly, wearing a white hat covering his whole head, barring his face. On top of his hat were two small lumps that stuck on the sides of the hat. Next to the boy, was an orange dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finn, it's a human!\" the orange dog opened it's mouth, much to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" the boy who was apparently called Finn replied to the dog, before focusing his attention to you, \"Are you okay dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so?\" you respond in an unsure tone, before asking a simple question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in the Land of Ooo,\" the talking dog answers, \"Man, you must've hit your head hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn smiled, \"Don't worry, you can stay at our place.

You and Lincoln were at your house, chilling, hanging out and playing video games with each other after a long day in middle school. Since Lincoln's best friend Clyde was not present at school today, he approached you after school and asked if you were available as his back-up friend. While you would normally be mad at that remark, you decided to let it slide because of one particular reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chance to get near his bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a foot fetish and for you, it's a big secret. A few months ago, during swimming class, you sneaked out through the back door and took a sniff of his white sports shoes, which looked like it had been worn for quite some time. It smelled so heavily of boy sweat and you couldn't get enough of the scent. Eventually, you heard footsteps coming so you ran away hastily back to your class, hoping that no-one really noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you want another round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by the white-haired boy, who looked at you with confusion, \"You weren't really paying attention dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I guess I got caught up daydreaming,\" you reply, focusing back on the television screen, \"I guess we could have another round.\"</span></div></div>",

You're sitting down on the park bench, enjoying the cool, sun-dappled air and the view of the grassy plains. The ice cream you had bought five minutes ago was beginning to melt but you didn't care. You continue licking the remainder of the cold treat in your hand, trying to beat the heat of the sun robbing you of its delicious goodness. It's all perfectly natural, a harmless reaction to an otherwise glorious moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until a tug pulls at your soul and the magic vanishes. Your eyes locked onto one of Scrooge McDuck's nephews, walking towards you, with a devious grin planted on his face. Or was it a genuine warm smile? You couldn't tell from how far he is from your position but you know for sure that he was getting closer every second you wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do recall that one of them somehow found out about your foot fetish in school, which you only found out by reading some sort of blackmail letter addressed to you, that was clumsily stamped with the McDuck logo. Admittedly, your mind was boggled to how they even knew in the first place, considering they were hardly in school in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there for a while, confused and worried, not knowing what to do, staring at the blue, clear skies to distract your mind from this uncertainty.</span></div></div>",

You mentally facepalm yourself. It was Louie Duck, the green hooded triplet, with a huge smug smirk on his face. Of course it should've been obvious to you but once again, you were too distracted by your frantic panicky thoughts. You gulp as you watch the youngest nephew walk ever so nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dude, you like feet?\" Louie asks, in a not-so-subtle volume, even though his face clearly shows that he knows the answer to his question. Thankfully, there was hardly anyone around your close proximity but you still feel the pang of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Louie, dumbfounded and speechless, opening up your mouth to speak, \"I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't answer that,\" Louie immediately interrupts, letting out a light chuckle before he plumped himself on the bench next to you, \"Of course you do but don't worry! Your secret is safe with me... probably. As long as it doesn't... slip... out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouie slowly stretched out those last three words ever so slowly, a wicked smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" you stutter, sweat dripping down your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouie shrugs, before feigning tiredness in his voice, \"Not much, but my feet are really <i>really</i> sore. If only there was some<i>one</i> that can massage them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finishes saying that sentence, he shifts closer to you and lays his webbed feet on your lap. You rolled your eyes but for a brief moment, you just stare at the dirty soles of his webbed feet, mesmerised at the close-up view you got. With your mind under its trance, you slowly reach your hand closer to touch them but he slaps your hands away, and grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh, you need to pay up first,\" he teases, outstretching one of his hands, \"I think one dollar is a good starting offer but you can massage my feet with your tongue for ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was absolutely stupid. Why did he even want the money in the first place? He must be practically swimming in money. Groaning, you reach in your pocket and pull out...</span></div></div>",
