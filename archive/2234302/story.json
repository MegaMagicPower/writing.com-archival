The only thing that was keeping him going at this point were the Black Wisps he was taking care of on his own when that made an idea suddenly pop up into his head: how he converted these former wisps into what they were now in the first place. Eclipse scavenged around for a container of what he referred to as \u2018Black Alien Goo\u2019 a liquid female members of the species released from their breasts and occasionally even their mouths that was used on the wisps as well as plant life in order to convert them. Looking inside of his container he knew there wasn\u2019t nearly enough of it to convert anything bigger than a wisp but if he were to make more he would need a female member of the species...\u201dWait maybe it could work!\u201d<br>\r\nEclipse recalled the training he went through in particular learning to take on his large muscular form that was unrivaled in strength but could only be managed for a short time, in order to take on the form he needed to imagine being as strong as Black Arm giants but what if he instead of being as well endowed as a female member of his species? The darkling stood up and closed his eyes as he made his first attempt recalling how they looked like as his chest quickly had two orbs shoot out until they were quite prominent, his Adam\u2019s shrank into nothingness, and his penis also shrank into his body and reformed into a vagina making Eclipse now a her. \u201cExcellent...\u201d Eclipse opened her eyes as she looked down at her body and began to examine it with her hands. \u201cOh this feels so great!\u201d Wasting little time the alien ran around the ship collecting all sorts of different containers and filling them with her goo until after several minutes later she grew exhausted. \u201cI think that is enough...\u201d Eclipse closed her eyes again as she focused on her old form however it took her a bit to remember it and for a second she forgot she was ever even a male. The transformation was as quick as it was into a woman as Eclipse smiled looking at his work, \u201cI did good but that could\u2019ve easily gone wrong...\u201d The Black Aliens now started gathering all of his work and put the containers in different bags not noticing the sway of his hips as he moved, an effect from staying too long in the female form that he didn\u2019t realize wasn\u2019t natural for him to do. With all of this goo he could target all sorts of things like an Eggman base headed by the Eggboss obsessed with Eggman Thunderbolt or he could start his revenge on Knuckles by attacking Angel Island. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Eggman base nearby seemed easy enough for Eclipse to attack and cause chaos as many would be converted inside. \u201cBabies stay here, Daddy will be back with more family members!\u201d The darkling announced to his Black Wisp children as he grabbed a few of the bags and went out in the direction of the base. After what felt like forever given the weight of the bags but really was a couple of minutes Eclipse made it to the base as he hid in large brush waiting for one of the patrol guards to get close enough for him to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJoining the empire was a mistake...\u201d A young guardswoman muttered to herself as she was making her final round around the base to make sure no intruders were nearby when she noticed some movement in a brush and pulled out a standard pistol as she walked over hoping it was a small frog or something. \u201cIf someone is in there come out with your hands up in the name of Doctor Ivo E-\u201c Eclipse wasn\u2019t going to let her finish however as he had taken a handful of his goop as she approached and threw it at her as she spoke hitting her right in the face and even some getting into her mouth, sure she was a ferret now but that wouldn\u2019t be the case for much longer. \u201cWha-WHAT IS THIS?!\u201d She tried grabbing the liquid as started covering more and more of her face but that would only make it worse as it spread onto her hands converting everything it was covering into the body of a Black Alien slowly. With a smirk Eclipse now stood up and came out of the brush looking over at the panicked ferret who was becoming less of one by the second. \u201cYou are becoming a great Black Alien: attack your former allies and make them join our glorious race!\u201d \u201cAttack...convert...\u201d At this point she could only think about what Eclipse said to her as she tore her uniform off and ran back to the base like a wild animal, Eclipse of course would take advantage of the new commotion by trying to enter the base from the opposite side.</span></div></div>",

Eclipse smirked and grabbed pins her down. \"Oh yes. Your mine to breed\"He said as he thrusts his cock into her tight pussy making her moan. \"Aah~ Master your so big\"She moaned. Eclipse didnt waste time as he continued fucking her and was smirking. Thoughs of making her his own personal breeder came into mind. He didnt mind the idea. He started fucking her hard and her moans grew louder and louder until after a few long minutes He cummed in her. He got out of her and smirks. Thunderbolt felt honored to be used by Master. \"Thank you master. I wont let you down\"she said as she was about to walk away but was stopped by Eclipse. \"Oh no you wont. Your gonna make me some more Dark Alien goop\"Eclipse said and gave her the bags. Thunderbolt nods and goes to a corner to start filling them up.

Eclipse used the advantage to grab his leg and throw him into the ground hard, Knocking Mighty out. \"MIGHTY!\"Ray said horrified and afraid. Eclipse was panting. He didnt expect the creature to be very strong. A member like that would be useful for invasions and or defenses. Thunderbolt did you bring the goop?\"Eclipse said. Thunderbolt nods and gives a bag to Eclipse. \"Here you go Master\"She said with a smile as Eclipse used a handful of the goop to start the conversion of Mighty. \"LEAVE HIM ALONE!\"Ray said as he struggles to leave. Eclipse smirks and goes to him. \"Oh dont worry Ray. You will join him as well\"he said as he used what remained on his hand and spread it on His chest. Soon it started to spread to his body as Ray was panicking and crying. Soon they both stop resisting and become part of Dark Arms. Thunderbolt releases Ray from the prison. \"New Dark Arm members. Welcome to our family. Help us grow and defend your family from any threats and dangers\"Eclipse said. They both nodded and they followed him to the elevator and went up.

He was able to temporarily control Shadow with help Black Death but lost it once Shadow was reminded what he was fighting for but he figured if he tried it on someone weaker willed he could find success with the power. \u201cSee Ray my Black Aliens need a reliable source of food and the fruits from converted plant life can only do so much as my masters thought cultivating your planet\u2019s population could work as a great food source however I believe your people can figure a different solution right?\u201d The entranced prisoner would nod as Eclipse continued, \u201cThen you will help me figure said idea out along with your brother as honorary members of the Black Arms, besides that you will also work as undercover agents letting me know details of the plans your people have made while also trying to sabotage things for them am I understood?\u201d \u201cYes master...\u201d Eclipse smiled as he went over to the still out cold Mighty as since he was out he would have no resistance up as is against his mind control attack and while looking into one of Mighty\u2019s eyes he forced open he repeated what he said to Ray as Thunderbolt let the former prisoner now ally out of his cell.</span></div></div>",

Eclipse knew with how fast Black Aliens breed it would be much longer until the women started to lay eggs so he could check on that, he could check in with the trio on Angel Island as since Thunderbolt was a female Black Alien she could convert anyone who got in their way by simply biting them so he was eager to see if they got more subjects to serve him, and finally he knew not all of Conquering Storm\u2019s female ninjas have bred with the other aliens including Storm herself so Eclipse wanted to fix that...personally.</span></div></div>",

If we were to take it out, the energy would cease to flow through the island and it would fall into the ground\"Thunderbolt said. This troubled Eclipse.
