Especially helpful to me is learning how to distinguish descriptions from evaluations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Descriptions</b> are \u201cverbalizations linked to the directly observable aspects or features of objects or events.\u201d Example: \u201cI am feeling anxiety, and my heart is beating fast.\u201d Descriptions are the primary attributes of an object or event. They don\u2019t depend on a unique history. In other words, as Hayes, explain, they remain aspects of the event or object regardless of our interaction with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Evaluations</b>, on the other hand are secondary attributes that revolve around our interactions with objects, events, thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. They are our reactions to events or their aspects. Example: \u201cThis anxiety is unbearable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf we are feeling anxious about the uncertainty of our job, for example, we can tease apart the language of our thoughts and try to transform an evaluation, \u201cI will be destroyed if I am fired,\u201d to a description, \u201cI am feeling anxious and my job is unstable.\u201d By naming the emotion and the situation, we don\u2019t necessarily have to assign an opinion. Without the opinion, we can process the object, event, etc. without hyperventilation.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11/18/13 addition -- web site component<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfiling your concerns or Highest Good<br>\r\nWhen you create a profile, you first select four topics of interest, or \u2018concerns\u2019, that you would like to focus on.

It's always good to have introductions, and as much as you can encourage it, the freedom to speak about their experience of spirituality.

It is both a culmination of showing how different ideologies, attitudes, energies grow up side-by-side, but not necessarily to support nor antagonize against one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Citizen G'Kar of the Narn writes (in episode, The Paragon of the Animals)<br>\r\nThe Preamble of the Declaration of Principles for the Interstellar Alliance (Babylon 5)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short delivery of a \"Peace message\" at the 2016 World Peace Meditation gathering at my center in Covina, CA I prefaced my reading of G'Kar's message with a few words to put the Babylon 5 show and it's ideology in context (why it was perfect in a talk about peace). I stated that a very famous TV show called Star Trek had been created fifty years ago by a Naval and L.A.P.D. veteran, in a time when we were learning about ourselves through civil rights demonstrations, war, women's equality, and he allowed his audience to further learn about the human experience through weekly encounters with aliens, who often times were like us, but many times were truly alien yet fascinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed out that Babylon 5 came to TV in the early Nineties, twenty-five years after the first episode of Star Trek, but that it accomplished showing us how we as human really might exist off-world, and just how difficult getting along could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the text of G'Kar's declaration:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe universe speaks in many languages, but only one voice.<br>\r\nThe language is not Narn, or Human, or Centauri, or Gaim or Minbari<br>\r\nIt speaks in the language of hope<br>\r\nIt speaks in the language of trust<br>\r\nIt speaks in the language of strength and the language of compassion<br>\r\nIt is the language of the heart and the language of the soul.<br>\r\nBut always it is the same voice<br>\r\nIt is the voice of our ancestors, speaking through us,<br>\r\nAnd the voice of our inheritors, waiting to be born<br>\r\nIt is the small, still voice that says<br>\r\nWe are one<br>\r\nNo matter the blood<br>\r\nNo matter the skin<br>\r\nNo matter the world<br>\r\nNo matter the star:<br>\r\nWe are one<br>\r\nNo matter the pain<br>\r\nNo matter the darkness<br>\r\nNo matter the loss<br>\r\nNo matter the fear<br>\r\nWe are one<br>\r\nHere, gathered together in common cause, we agree to recognize this<br>\r\nsingular truth and this singular rule:<br>\r\nThat we must be kind to one another<br>\r\nBecause each voice enriches us and ennobles us and each voice lost<br>\r\ndiminishes us.<br>\r\nWe are the voice of the Universe, the soul of creation, the fire<br>\r\nthat will light the way to a better future.<br>\r\nWe are one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Declaration_of_Principles#\" target=\"_blank\">http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Declarati...</a></span></div></div>",

Eventhough I have lived in agreement with the teachings of my faith for my entire life, I still encounter modern descriptions calling Religious Science a \"cult.\" Funny thing is, it has no insistence to draw in followers like most religions I am aware of, which is a main component of the definition of cult. Here's a listing updated in 2005 that surprised me:<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\tNew Thought<br>\r\nNew Thought, a mental healing cult closely related to Christian Science, first emerged in the 1870s. Its leaders promised that thought could shape reality, and that if one meditated upon a goal, that goal\u2014be it health, spiritual enlightenment, or wealth\u2014would be reached. This doctrine appealed to a wide range of Americans, from economically precarious white-collar workers hoping to \u201cthink\u201d their way to success, to reformers who believed that elevated thoughts could save a nation mired in materialism and corruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChicago played an early and significant role in the national growth of New Thought. By the 1880s Chicago boasted several New Thought publications and metaphysical \u201ccolleges\u201d as well as dozens of New Thought teachers and healers. Between 1888 and 1895, the charismatic Emma Curtis Hopkins, perhaps the nation's most influential New Thought teacher, ran her New Thought seminary and training school at 2019 S. Indiana. Almost every major New Thought leader came to Chicago to study with Hopkins, including Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, founders of the Unity School of Christianity. Hopkins's influential weekly column of New Thought bible studies appeared in the Chicago Inter-Ocean. Hopkins was admired by many of the city's most prominent feminists, including pioneering physician and publisher Alice Bunker Stockham and journalist and suffrage activist Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, and her ideas permeated the city's vibrant late-nineteenth-century feminist community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough New Thought reached its heyday before 1920, the movement's core ideas hold an ongoing attraction for Americans. New Thought doctrines have always appealed to people who hope to improve their social standing, and late-twentieth-century alternative healers and New Age practitioners revived interest in New Thought meditation practices. In the 1990s several Chicago-area New Thought churches continued to draw devoted adherents, including Johnnie Coleman's Universal Foundation for Better Living, the Unity Church of Chicago, the First Church of Religious Science, and the Ministry of Truth, which is devoted to the teachings of Emma Curtis Hopkins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeryl Satter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBibliography<br>\r\nBraden, Charles S.

Perhaps, first, I need to clean my own thoughts of the \"less than\" views I still entertain myself -- that connect New Thought to New Age, to hippies, to tree-huggers</div></span></div></div>",
