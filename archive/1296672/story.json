The world had returned to normalcy, but the girl could observe startling differences. People seemed unchanged yet changed, particularly the Pilot Ikari. He had returned far earlier than she had, and unsurprisingly seemed different. She felt an emotion unlike others toward Ikari, a most perplexing emotion. What was this desire, this want? Was this the emotion known as love?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, judging by the body language former Pilot Ikari displayed, he did not share Rei\u2019s emotions of desire. To be exact, he possessed desire, but it was not directed at the wolfish-haired girl, but rather at the scarlet German girl, Asuka. Toward the girl, Rei felt an almost unfair emotion toward her, a resenting, foul emotion. Was this the emotion known as jealousy? Yes, perhaps it was. Whenever Rei even spoke to Shinji, even as a friend, the German had a mixture of odd emotions in her eyes. Were they jealousy, too? Part of her seemed afraid, frightened by Rei\u2019s very presence, her disposition, her sense of being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Rei would never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst!\u201d Rei turned at the sound of Asuka\u2019s condescending pet name for her. She never did like the name, though, considering she still refered to Asuka and Shinji as \u201cPilot\u201d despite the trio having not used an Eva in the past couple years following Third Impact, it was only fair she\u2019d be addressed similarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPilot Sohryu,\u201d Rei replied in regard to the German.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ve been doing some thinking lately,\u201d Asuka said, scratching the back her head, \u201cAnd I kinda realized I\u2019ve been acting really immature lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Pilot Sohryu apologizing? What a curious way she was doing it. She wasn\u2019t making eye contact, which lead Rei to one of two possible solutions. Either Asuka was lying and didn\u2019t want Rei to see her bluff, or she was so ashamed she couldn\u2019t make eye contact. Judging by the facial expression accompanying her lack of eye contact, it lead Rei to believe the latter, but why was the jealousy insideo f Rei making her believe the German girl was lying through her teeth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve been a bitch to you. I really have, and truthfully you don\u2019t really deserve it. I mean, I\u2019ve just been really jealous. Shinji is\u2026well, the idiot is\u2026ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t, but I can forgive you,\u201d Rei replied, bowing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I gotta do something for you. Can I make you dinner sometime?\u201d Rei considered Asuka\u2019s invitation before finally speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not fond of meat.\u201d</span></div></div>",

In a lot of ways Ikari was perhaps the only one who could face such a group with such a straight unmoving face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done well, Ikari. The children seem to be having no problem eliminating the angels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they should be able to do such a feat at a much faster more effective rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially the first child. She is your creation as such she should be perfect...and yet it seems at times your actual child surpasses her limitations. Do you wish for even the second to surpass her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he acknowledged them the senior Ikari said nothing in response. Soon enough the meeting was over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone housed within Dr. Ritsuko Akagi's office buzzed uncontrollably alerting the blonde woman of the incoming call. A moment later she has the receiver to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...I understand I'll run a test just to insure it's safety ('Even if it failed she could easily be brought back so why the worry?') if everything comes out as it should I'll inform you of the outcome at a later date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day after the testing the children seem to go through every other day or so, Rei is approached by Dr. Akagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei, if I could have an extra moment of your time. I'd like for you to come back with me to my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently the blue-haired girl nods, \"Understood, Doctor Akagi.\" Before long the two walk away from Shinji and Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Shinji feels the need to ask the reason behind Ritsuko's sudden request. As the raven-haired boy takes a step forward Asuka places an extended arm in his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there, Shinji. Why are you worried about Wondergirl all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's comment caused the boy blush slightly, a smirk accompanied by a bit of a snicker leaves the redhead's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ritsuko's a doctor for god's sake. It's not like she's going to hurt her. Though why she'd choose Ayanami over me is well beyond me...\" wondered the quite curious Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even know what she wants with Ayanami. Why should you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bad choice of words as the redhead's right eye twitched, \"It doesn't matter I'm the superior pilot. Obviously anything special or top secret should head my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji sighed as the enraged girl continued to rant onward, he could only hope Rei wouldn't take too long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin Akagi's office room Rei takes a seat directly across the doctor's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't take long, Rei. Simply make yourself comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently Ritsuko begins to apply a tiny portion of alcohol to Rei's slender neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor?\" \"Don't fret Rei, under the Commander's order you are to test a body enhancement serum.\" stated the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are steroids not dangerous for one's own being?\" questions Rei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this isn't like that it's our own personally-crafted formula. I assure you, this shall not bring about the ill effects commonly associated with steroids. Now hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei wasn't sure how she felt about this unknown substance entering her body but she trusted in the Commander's decision, thus allowed herself to go along with his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely the chemical entered her blood stream. Afterwards there was strange sensation coursing through her very being, as if some new force was dismantling then reconstructing the outer and inner frame of body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a strong grip upon the handles of the chair she sat in, Rei felt her world spin, her breathing quickly intensifying. Despite her best efforts the young girl couldn't seem to bring even a simple word out of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Rei it will be all over soon. Believe me when I say this will not kill you. You must simply bare with the after-affects for a little while longer.\" stated Ritsuko, a trusting look in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

While Asuka was for the most part comfortable in her sexuality she knew for sure she wasn't gay or even bi for that matter. Sure she had thought Misato was rather attractive at first glance (her lazy-ass manners were questionable however) and Hikari along with bridge member Maya were respectfully cute (she had no real opinion on Akagi) but never once had she felt an emotional attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell she saw Rei as rather simplistic, a girl-next-door if you will, so why did she feel as if she needed to feel Rei's new body shape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because the blue-haired girl had suddenly become more developed? Her legs, hips, and even breasts were thicker giving the teenage girl a more mature (despite the mass muscle) look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko couldn't help but smile at the redhead's confusion. She found Asuka's reaction most interesting and while a part of her wondered how Shinji would react at the moment she was more interested in what actions Asuka would take. Normally knowing the fiery German girl she would have pounced at the moment to become stronger then Rei but now she had just gone an entire minute without saying a word as had Rei but that was standard for the now bigger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to feel them, Rei's muscles in her hands...Asuka's self-control was nearly tearing her apart from the inside out. No it wasn't right she didn't \"think\" of Rei that way. Ayanami was a rival, someone to beat and up show not...not hug dammit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer self-control snapped like the weaken twig it was but she didn't run no darn it she was still Asuka Langley Souryu even if she was confused to hell and back. Silently Ritsuko watched Asuka walk up to Rei the redhead's vision titled slightly upward thanks to the slight height growth Rei had experienced along with the muscle growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face nearly matched her hair color as she stared a hole through Rei. The blue-haired girl's head only titled somewhat to it's side almost resting on her boarder shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I feel them?\" Asuka spat out in pure embarrassment. She grumbled to herself figuring that her face must be so red by now that it has to be steaming for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not see a problem with that request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka blinked as she heard Rei's response. She honestly laughed at Rei, only the first child would have no problem nor see anything questionable in Asuka's request. Looking away not wanting to make contact with the crimson orbs and completely forgetting that Ritsuko was even still in the room (the doctor was grinning like a Cheshire cat watching it all unfold before her) Asuka smiled quickly yet softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all the redhead said before moving in closer and placing a singular hand on Rei's midsection. Her abs were rough, tough, and very much defined. Thighs and hips thick with strength and power, Asuka's blush shot up again as she felt around Rei's hips. Instructing her just a tad she finally felt the power orbs Rei's biceps had become and the engorged state her arms had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka sighed almost overwhelmed by it all Rei was amazingly detailed in pure power now. It took nearly everything the girl had to stay on her feet and not pass out. She laughed yet again unsure if she curse Rei for doing this to her or at herself for being so weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless she had one more thought flare up in her mind.</span></div></div>",

If Wondergirl was going to be big then so would she (of course being bigger wasn\u2019t out of the question either) after all she was no one\u2019s second<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought in mind the redhead turned over toward Doctor Akagi who to her credit currently wore one hell of a poker face. As she made her way over she requested that the same procedure be done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko admittedly was pleasantly surprised to hear the redhead plead with such an honest tone there was no venom born from jealously or the need to satisfy her own ego no this was Asuka just asking, as simple as that. A welcomed surprise now that she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to her short call she had with The Commander earlier in the day.

Maybe it was a hidden inner desire...she wasn\u2019t sure all she knew was that for once she wasn\u2019t putting herself at top of a pedestal, instead she wanted Rei to stand there and grow\u2026grow until the damn thing crumbled the girl\u2019s power\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took in a breath feeling her body temperature beginning to flare up again. Damn Wondergirl for messing so deeply with her head and without even saying a word no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she turned over to the still very much observing doctor, to her credit was looking as stoic as she possibly could despite being very interested in how this would all play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko listened in as Asuka asked, in a surprisingly embarrassed fashion, if it were possible for Rei to grow even larger then she already was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have the heart to tell the redhead that her face was nearly as crimson as the plug-suit made specifically for her. The turmoil the girl must be going through she thought so in wanting to ease the swirling emotions of the redhead she stated that yes potentially it was very possible for Rei to grow larger with each dosage of the serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked why Ritsuko fought back a giggle as Asuka looked away far too quickly then expected. The blonde woman then knew exactly what was going through the confused teenager\u2019s mind. For whatever reason she may have Asuka wanted Rei to grow even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScientifically speaking though she thought over the idea of injecting Rei yet again, Commander Ikari simply wanted to see if the serum was successful in altering Rei\u2019s form with a singular dose. The man never said anything about using more then just one injection on that note how would Rei\u2019s body react to a second dosage, would she be able to handle it? Ritsuko certainly hoped so and if she did how much would it affect Rei?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral interesting questions ran through her mind before she ultimately decided to go ahead and inject the blue-haired girl once again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka watched from one side of the room with a rather pleased expression as Ritsuko began preparing Rei for a second dosage\u2026</span></div></div>",

Just when Ritsuko straightened up and went to her computer to check her calculations for any anomalies, a soft, almost silent, moan escaped Rei's lips. Asuka all but melted at the angelic sound, and then her jaw dropped as Rei began to swell in all directions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei's muscles erupted with size and power, quickly doubling in size. Ritsuko walked toward Rei to check her vitals, when suddenly Rei grew again, her muscles doubling in size once more! The bluenette began to ascend toward the ceiling as she grew taller, while her waist, bristling with dozens of anatomically impossible muscles, cinched itself smaller. Rei's breasts lunged out from her rippling pectorals, swelling so massive that it was easy to tell they were breasts and not pecs. Her breasts alone, though, were already powerful enough to crush steel just by flexing her chest. Rei's ass and hips expanded into a deliciously enormous rump, and as Rei's head hit the ceiling and began to push through the steel and into the floor above, her muscles began cramping and flexing so quickly that it looked like her muscles were crawling all over her body. Faster than anyone could track, her muscles exploded out, a full eight times larger than before her second dose of the serum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka could only stare in awe as Rei's growth stopped, her titanic form easily causing the steel ceiling to buckle just by standing there and not even exerting any conscious force on it. The German's mouth was dry, and she licked her lips to try bringing moisture back to it. She felt like she was looking at a goddess, and her first instinct was to prostrate herself before Rei's beauty and power and begin worshiping the girl.</span></div></div>",

The experiment involved a special drug which held the possibilities of increasing the syncronization rate of pilots and was testing whether or not it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe communicator earpiece Rei wore came to life, \"You're doing good Rei.

Similar to Shinji Rei also dropped the items she was carrying, yet her face was the normal stoic expression it always was, as if she didn't even care she was now eight feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it had only been a few seconds people already started to gather, sensing something was wrong. A group that began as Shinji and Rei soon turned to them and five strangers, then ten, then twenty and slowly more and more people came, circling the growing blue haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow reaching ten feet in height Rei's clothing started to tear, a couple small seams in her pants and one of two along the back of her top but nothing that would reveal too much. As the crowd formed and expanded Shinji who was now almost a nervous wreck despite it not being him who was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutilely he attempted to pull the growing giantess away, of course with his lack of muscle and Rei's growing frame it was a miracle if he moved her an inch. Giving up the pull method Shinji ran to Rei's front, pushing against her stomach in an equally futile gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt weird standing at his full height yet still only coming to Rei's navel, with a blush Shinji realized if she sprouted another foot his hands would be......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snap out of it!\" He screamed, shaking his head and trying to push yet again. Sprouting another foot Rei was now closing in on 13 feet, and even still was indifferent about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople began murmuring to one another, Rei heard words tossed like, \"Freak, weirdo, trick,\" and even \"Angel\" and slowly the entire crowd began using the negative words, any positive comments were lost in the torrent of negative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each insult Rei's lip quivered slightly, she didn't think she was being affected in any way but her body language spoke a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rei tilted her head down, her blue hair covering her eyes. \"Stop......\" Even being as tall as she was the comment was either not heard or ignored by the crowd. Stubbornly Shinji kept pushing Rei, his hands now only reaching her waist and his eyes were level with....her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei heard a cracking noise and suddenly her head felt like she'd been shot, like someone took a hammer and started hitting it repeatedly. \"Stop just stop!\" Breaking her stoic expression Rei looked genuinely sad, her red eyes looked as if they belonged to a tormented child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Pulling an arm back Rei, now 16 and a half feet tall, swung her arm against the crowd. The action acting like a weight lifter had punched each of them in the spot they were hit. One by one all in the group fell down against Rei's arm, a single loss of control stopped every single person here and her growth still continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her composure the giantess looked around to everyone, all their eyes were filled with a mixture of hatred and fear. Although their lips were still Rei kept hearing the insults they were muttering moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearing distant Rei looked down, she was now twenty feet tall and Shinji was still pathetically attempting to get Rei away from the group of people, even though he now only reached her knee cap. Turning her gaze back to the crowd Rei muttered one sentence, a sentence that showed just what kind of a giantess she would be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Please, don't make me do that again. I don't wish to cause harm to any of you.\" Rei said as she regained her composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of people around her seemed to be hesitant to trust the giant girl, but they slowly began to back off. Maybe Rei's words had convinced them that she truly didn't mean them any harm, but it was more likely that they were simply to scared of her to stick around. After seeing what Rei was capable of, they obviously didn't want to get on her bad side. Seeing the crowd around her beginning to disperse, Rei breathed a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone having left, Rei looked down and finally noticed Shinji straining himself to push against her leg. Seeing him so small compared to her, putting all of his strength into trying to move her massive body, Rei couldn't help but smile. The way that he was trying so hard in spite of being much to small and weak to ever hope to succeed was really quite cute. Rei could tell that Shinji truly wanted to get her away from the people who were ridiculing her, to protect her from their cruelty. It really was quite touching how much he seemed to care for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, Shinji.\" Rei said, her emotionless tone of voice hiding how happy she really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...\" Shinji replied, still somewhat nervous around the now-gigantic 1st child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then began to walk back to NERV headquarters, knowing that it was the only place that they could go without having to worry about Rei's new size terrifying the citizens. By this time, Rei had grown another 5 feet, reaching a stunning 25 feet tall. With how big she had become, it took Shinji a lot of effort just to keep up with Rei's massive strides. After walking for a while, Shinji began to get tired out. Seeing this, Rei reached down and scooped the small boy up in her arms to carry him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Shinji was shocked by this action and began to struggle to be put down, but then he looked up and saw Rei's tender smile beaming down at him, and he finally began to relax. In fact, as Rei continued holding the tiny boy in her arms, Shinji actually began to enjoy his situation. He could feel the gentle warmth of Rei's body heat all around him, and her heartbeat echoed in his ears as she held his head up to her chest. It almost felt as if he was a baby being cradled in the arms of his own mother once again. Eventually Rei's calming heartbeat lulled Shinji to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his sleeping form in her arms as she walked, Rei smiled sweetly as she continued to walk toward their destination. As the towering girl walked through the city, several people looked up and saw the peaceful and caring look on her face as she cradled the sleeping Shinji in her arms. Seeing her like this, she truly did look like a mother caring for her child. It was such a serene sight, and it made some of the people reconsider their original opinions about the titanic girl. They could tell that, in spite of her intimidating size, she clearly wasn't the malicious beast that they initially thought her to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Rei finally arrived at her destination. Setting Shinji back down on the ground, she gently nudged him with her index finger to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Shinji. We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly coming to his senses, Shinji looked up to see the massive Rei Ayanami staring down at him. At first he was shocked, wondering what was going on, but then he remembered what had happened earlier and calmed down a bit. It was still a bit odd to see his blue-haired teammate towering so far above him, but he knew that she would never hard him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to each other silently, the two Eva pilots walked into NERV headquarters. Much to their surprise, they were immediately greeted by a familiar face. It was their fellow pilot Asuka Langley Soryu, and...</span></div></div>",

Rei's lips parted and she began to speak, her almost goddess like voice held a cold tone as disturbing as what her eyes showed. \"That will teach all of you insignificant bugs a lesson....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd seemed to freeze up, almost by magic this girl who had now reached thirty feet in height had gone from silent to a dark coldness that approached evil. Even Shinji who finally gave up futilely pushing his friend was shocked, these people may have deserved Rei's little action earlier plus a lot more but he couldn't really picture Rei doing such a thing. Then again.....it was Rei he was thinking of, he couldn't really picture her doing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji took a look back up at Rei, blushing a bit as his eyes gazed over Rei's dark blue panties, and blushing more so when he got a good look at Rei from a couple feet away from her legs. Not even ten minutes ago Rei had on a full set of clothes with only one or two tears but now.....it was little more than shreds. Whatever shoes Rei wore were gone along with the socks, they burst into shreds and some point along the growth. Rei's pants were now more or less bloomers that were slowly ripping further and further. Her shirt had ripped along the back entirely leaving Rei's back bare save for the straps of her dark blue bra and the front of her shirt seemed to be slowly ripping and sliding its way off too. Yet Rei seemed not to care or even notice, which isn't surprising considering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy silence hung in the air, making it uncomfortable even to breathe. Here Rei and the people stood at what was basically a cross roads, during Shinji's little inspection she had gained another five feet leaving her at about 22 feet in height. Rei could literally raise her foot and stomp the people into oblivion, and she was very tempted to. It was almost like an inner being was compelling her, asking her to annihilate the people, to enslave them to her whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an appealing thought, even to Rei and with her growing frame it was well within her reach. Rei allowed her red eyes to focus on the people in the crowd, they were scared as they well should be; Shinji was at Rei's feet staring with a blush, he now only came to halfway up the lower part of her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud rip echoed out and with a soft rustle the rest of Rei's shirt fell, descending upon the frightened crowd; soon engulfing well over half of them under the soft fabric. As these people struggled out of there Rei noticed something interesting, her bra wasn't the least bit stretched. It may have been too soon to tell but it was possible Rei's underwear was growing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple perverted whistling sounds were coming from below, men whos sexually drive overcame their fear. It disgusted Rei in a way, only further supporting her urge to crush them beneath her bare sole.</span></div></div>",

Her emotional energy combined with the new chemicals they created in her body fueled a massive growth spurt.  Her body trembled slightly to adjust to her growth, which peaked currently at nearly 70 feet tall.  Her undergarments were indeed growing with her probably because they were the only clothes she now had that she had also worn in the Eva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled cruelly and started to raise her foot, when something happened.  Her stomach growled.  Apparently all the growth had depleted her energy, making her fiercely hungry.  Always a practical-minded girl, she began to consider her actions.  She wasn't having second thoughts on what to do but rather how to do it.  While crushing the gawkers beneath her foot would be pleasurable, it would serve no practical purpose.  She needed food, and people were, after all, made of meat.  Mightn't their struggles in her stomach be just as pleasurable, if not more so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just couldn't understand how her survival could move someone to tears of joy. Someone who she slapped in the face not to long ago in fact. Shouldn't he hate her for that? Then again she often struggled to understand many things about human behavior. After all she wasn't really human and The Commander made it clear that she was only allowed to interact with anyone no more then was absolutely necessary. She was a key component in his plans, but a replaceable one. A fact he had made clear to her for her entire life. So it just made no sense to her how her life could mean so much to someone who was little more the a stranger to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I don't really know what to do in situations like this.\" Rei said in her usual soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sniffle* \"Maybe you could try smiling?\" Shinji asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rare expression of surprise went across her pretty face. But then it turned into an even more rare warm smile that made her even prettier. And the soft light of the full moon in the entry plug made her pale skin glow in a way made her seem otherworldly. Like an real Angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so beautiful..\" Shinji said in awe. But when he realized what he said his face turned completely red. \"Uh..I-I didn't mean that..well I did but w-what I meant was you're smile is beautiful! N-not to say that the rest of you isn't because it totally is..No that's even worse..what I mean is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snort* *Giggle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji with awkward fumbling of his words was then graced with a sight and sound that no one, not his father had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei Ayanami laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the most amazing thing he had ever seen or heard. And it was in that moment that Shinji had found somthing truly worth piloting The Eva for. Something that he would fight any Angel for, no matter how terrifying or powerful. Something that would inspire him to become as strong as possible to protect. Something that he would give anything to see and hear again. Her smile and her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rei,whether or not she realized it, also found something in that moment. Something she never imagined was possible. She found someone that she cared for more then The Commander. The man who she owed her entire existence to. Her sole purpose was to help him achieve his ultimate desire. And yet she would one day find herself willing to live for something, someone more. It was the moment where everything changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3 weeks later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei stood in front of her mirror in her filthy apartment with a puzzled look on her face. The cause of this was a B-cup bra that was too tight on her. It seem that she had a growth spurt.</span></div></div>",

And given the grim nature of her purpose and the war she was fighting in, it was very unlikely that she would much past 16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I suppose I will have to purchase new bra's soon.] she thought to herself as she finished getting dressed for the day. She had a synch test today, Unit 00 was fully repaired and upgraded with new armor(she like the new blue color better) and The Commander wanted to see if it was all combat ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours tests and re-tests to make sure everything was operational she headed down to the swimming pools to have a little R&amp;R. On her way to the changing rooms she heard what appeared to be Misato screaming out workout instructions like a drill sergeant. And she also heard the distinct sound of Shinji's own screams of effort and pain. Curious and a little worried for her fellow pilots safety she walked into the gym to investigate. She found Misato and Shinji sparing in the middle of one the large workout mats acting as a boxing ring. Well it was less sparing and more like Shinji flaying his arms wildly trying and failing to hit Misato before having his face introduced to her fist multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON HIT ME ALREADY!! I SEEN ROADKILL PUT UP A BETTER FIGHT!!\" she bellowed at a downed and bleeding Shinji on the floor. He picked himself off the floor, wiped the sweat off his brow and charge at his guardian again. Noble effort, but then was immediately sweep kicked back to the floor. \"DON'T JUST CHARGE IN!! THINK!! ANALYZE YOUR ENEMY AND NEVER LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!! BUT MOST OF ALL-\" she pinned Shinji to the ground in an backwards arm bar and prepared to punch him in the face \"SHOW NO MERCY!!\" But just as she was about to finish it Misato noticed they had an audience. Her fierce expression quickly turned friendly as she let Shinji go and walked over to Rei. \"Hi Rei! Haven't seen you in a while! How you been?\" she said naturally like she wasn't just beating the ever loving shit out someone just a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was completely taken aback by the whole thing and responded as best she could. \"I am well Captain Katsuragi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you before call me Misato when were off duty.\" Misato pouted a little. She turned her attention back to Shinji who was picking himself back off the ground. \"Okay Shinji take five. Go get some water.\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Shinji quietly responded as he went over to the water fountains to re-hydrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei watched the Third Child with pure puzzlement. She knew from reading his psych profile that Shinji hated violence and he would only fight if there was really no other choice. Misato for the first time in a long time was able to read what Rei was thinking and decided to explian  \"Yeah it surprised me to when Shinji asked me to help him learn how to fight too.\" Rei turned to face Misato as she continued \"The battle with the 5th Angel really seemed to light a fire in him. The second he was fully recovered he wanted to get stronger. He said he found something he wanted to protect.\" An impish smile appeared on her face as she looked down at Rei \"I think that something was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made Rei..</span></div></div>",

Her cheeks felt warm and a tiny smile was on her lips for a split second, it was so small and quick that almost nobody would noticed it, even if they were looking right at her, but Misato noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow..\" Misato said in awe as she was one of the only people who would notice the rare treasure that was Rei's smile. Rei looked at her confused \"Shinji wasn't exaggerating when he said your beautiful when you smile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei's cheeks became warmer and her heart fluttered harder.[What is this?] she thought as she never felt this way before. \"He really said that?\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato's impish smile returned \"Well his exact words were\"Her smile was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and I will do everything in my power to protect her and-\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISATO!!\" Shinji shouted in embarrassment as she laughed at how red his face was. Rei meanwhile was still trying to process the feelings she was having. They were unfamiliar and a little scary but not unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rei.\" Misato said as she leaned into her ear to whisper something that made Rei's eyes widen a little and look back at her commanding officer in slight shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I say that?\" she said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me it well be worth it now go on.\" Misato said mischievously as she playfully shoved Rei over to Shinji. Rei was unsure of this but decided to follow Misato strange instructions. She looked at the Third Child and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinji if you land a solid hit on Misato I will give you a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRe wasn't really sure what had happened but when the sparing had resumed Shinji preformed much better then before and even managed to land a solid hit. Misato did not make it easy for him but was impressed her plan worked out so well. Naturally Rei was hesitant to actually kiss Shinji but after some in encouragement form Misato and Shinji telling her it could just be on the cheek was enough for him she followed through. Needless to say Shinji was a happy boy for the rest of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on the next 2 months followed a similar pattern with Rei stopping by the gym almost every day to watch Shinji train with Misato. And every time he performed admirably she would reward him with a kiss. But that was not the only ways in which the two Eva pilots grew closer, Shinji would invite Rei over to have dinner and even offer some cooking lessons, which she turned out to be a natural at. And Rei would always enjoy the welcoming atmosphere of Shinji and Misato's apartment. Even though she knew the inevitable outcome of the war she still found these moments of peace to be very enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Shinji was not the only one she bonded with over these past few months. Misato proved to be very insightful when it came to the strange emotions she was feeling towards Shinji lately.

Of course as the teenage girl got older she forgot about it, since she always wanted to look her best in front of her peers, but today surrounded with nothing but boredom to keep her company she decided to give in to it once more.

Going by European bra-sizes, the redhead assumed that she went from a size B to a C, maybe a D. Her thighs were getting close to rubbing with each other, her ass ballooned greatly and she had a soft belly. Her face remained as thin and doll-like as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji also gained quite a bit, but not as much as Rei or Asuka, making him the smallers. His face softened a bit and his belly was round and flabby(Asuka once saw Shinji bust the buttons off one of his shorts when they ate dinner a week or so ago). His legs got thicker and he had bit of growth in his chest. If the 170 pound boy get's any bigger, he will be getting manboobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Misato joined in on the gain as well, albeit indirectly. Her figure seemed to be that of a pear, with her already decent breasts recieving a little gain. In addition, her belly and rear got bigger as well and seemed to garner the eyes of more of the lechers at school.

It was always possible. He noticed how, as she tossed away her empty ice cream container, how her derriere seemed to fill her pants so tightly that it dug into her back, her love handles spilling over the side. Was it a dramatic change? No, but it was noticeable. Maybe he shouldn't make too much food so she didn't hit him later for making her fat, or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite his concerns, he ended up making slightly more than usual. And, despite Misato coming home long after dinner ended, Shinji found himself eating less food than he should've. Rather than him eat a fair share, Asuka seemed to just pluck things off of Shinji's plate, here and there, almost so quickly he didn't notice. However, he did notice. He noticed the redhead stuffing food into her mouth straight from the serving bowl when her plate had been emptied. Had Shinji mentioned this, the two of them might've found themselves in an argument. Had Shinji not been so astounded by this almost hypnotic eating, he would've made some sort of comment. However, those fingers, those soft, slightly wider fingers plucking food out of his plate, was just so hypnotic. There was an almost erotic sensation about the German eating his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have t' hand it to ya. That wasn't half bad,\" Asuka replied, \"Of course, mind you wasn't up to my standards. Better luck next time.\" With that, the scarlet red head lumbered off to her room, her hips swaying back and forth hypnotically. She probably was unaware of how her hips seemed to sway with its own mass, but Shinji saw, and he struggled to deter his eyes from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took two whole minutes before he was able to control himself completely.</span></div></div>",

She ate not only ice cream, but cookies, candies, jellies, whatever she felt like scarfing down.

All his eyes had to do was watch... and watch they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the weeks, Shinji saw Asuka's physique continue to change for the flabbier. While her arms, legs, face, and even her butt and bust filled with cellulose, it was the stomach that bore the most change. The German's growth progressed from muffin top in the first week to being a cute little potbelly by the second. At the end of the third week, it looked as though she was developing a spare tire, then became a slightly-pronounced hanging gut during the fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Asuka was completely unaware of the changes her sweet tooth had effected on her body, nor did she notice that her appetite had grown by leaps and bounds along with her stomach (although she did notice that many of her clothes no longer fit, but attributed that strange phenomenon to washer shrinkage).

Asuka watched as Pen-pen (the houses pet penguin and certified pimp) waddled to the fridge. The robotic camera on the fridge sent a red scanning laser over his body gave a ding of approval and promptly released the lock on the fridge. Pen-pen helped himself to the ice drawer on the bottom of the fridge and pulled out a moderately sized mackerel, then retreated to his humble little igloo. Asuka now had a separate fridge courtesy of N.E.R.V which contained only the healthiest in soy based snacks. Giving up on her quest for sweets but absolutely refusing to have any soy based treats, she returned in a huff to the main living room of the cramped apartment where she and Shiji had just been watching a movie.

Now crawling across the couch towards him \u201cI mean a girl my size has got to eat Shinji. You wouldn\u2019t want me to lose this figure of mine. Don\u2019t pretend like I didn\u2019t see you staring at it\u2026\u201dshe whispered as she got closer to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji had been noticing Asuka had been getting thicker all around, and he was absolutely sure that a lot of the fat had gone to \u201call the right places.\u201d Asuka was giving him a great view of her vast cleavage, and Shinji was starting to feel himself getting warm all over, as he turned helpless against the fellow EVA pilots demands. \u201cI guess N.E.R.V had been going a little hard on her\u201d he thought, and decided he could do this one little favor for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Asuka, I\u2019ll go get some.\u201d He offered as he left the couch and headed to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure it\u2019s chocolate too! I hate vanilla!\u201d she ordered sitting back down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO.K\u201d Shinji called back from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake it four scoops too, I\u2019m starving!\u201d she commanded reverting back to her usual bossy self. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Shinji answered affirming he\u2019d her large order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good\u201d she thought to herself scheming. She had him wrapped around her finger, for now. She\u2019d have to seal the deal with Shinji as soon as he came back.<br>\r\nReturning from the kitchen, he handed Asuka her bowl of ice cream and returned to the movie.

Slinking to the refrigerator, she opened it up, plucking several packages from its depths, her stomach knotting in joy with each package she loaded her arms with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, only to pump straight into the familiar purple haired major. \"Oh, uh, hi Misato,\" Asuka stammered, glancing around for an escape, or an excuse, or something to get out of the inevitable scolding she was about to receive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling you'd do something like this,\" Misato said, sighing, \"It's almost like you're a recovering crack addict or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I'm not an alcoholic,\" the redhead mumbled under her breath, but almost instantly regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato's face turned a shade of red darker than the German girl's hair as she snatched the treats right out of her slender arms. \"Alright, that was below the belt. Well, ya know what? Fine. There's more than one way to get back at you.\" Misato bit into the first paackage she had snatched from Asuka, her eyes widening in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can! I'm the adult, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean you literally can't do that. It needs to cook first, or else you'll get sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, yeah, that is a good point...\"</span></div></div>",

She smiled, her eyes glowing, as she gestured for him to sit next to her. He cautiously obeyed. The redhead stared at him, examining that stupid face of his, that way his black hair fell over his forehead in that plain, boring, kinda adorable way. God, he was such a dork!

She felt her mouth water as she found herself longing for the food. She felt a tad awkward having complimented Shinji like that before. She wanted to tell herself it wasn't all true, but she knew it was. Every word was heart felt honesty, and she wouldn't take a bit of it back, even at gun point. Still, she wondered, for a moment, if she was using him right now for his cooking ability. And, if she was, what kind of girl was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here you go,\" Shinji replied, smiling with a slight blush on his cheeks as he sat down beside the redhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey, can you feed it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how warn out my fingers are all day? I spent it all day, workin' the joints out by pushing the buttons on the remote control. Do ya know how hard that is? I probably burned, like, a million calories,\" the redhead complained, fuming slightly, though obviously for dramatic effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess nothin'. Just feed me now,\" Asuka replied, grinning as Shinji gathered meat in his chopsticks, and plopped it into Asuka's welcoming mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji hesitated as Asuka chewed, finally asking, \"Do you want more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep giving it to me until I tell you to stop. Just, ya know, gimme a chance to chew and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the process proceeded, long and slowly. Asuka, it became apparent, took awhile to chew. By the time the meal had been finished, two hours had passed. Shinji had eaten his fill, but Asuka had gone far beyond that. She took strained breaths of air as she rested her palms on her distended stomach, leaning back sighing. \"Hey, dork, I'm kinda warn out. How strong are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you could carry me to the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why can't ya just walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine, I guess so,\" Shinji mumbled, awkwardly approaching the German. She grinned. It was amusing watching him struggle like this, oh so very cute in its own sort of way. On the other hand, she felt a twinge of anger. Was she not good enough to hold or something? No, that wasn't it. She was just being unrealistic with her demands, and kinda stupid--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji heaved the redhead into his arms, struggling with her weight as she wrapped her arms around Shinji's neck, clinging to him for dear life. Eventually, they tumbled onto the sofa, Asuka's spine pressing heavily against Shinji's pelvis. After the obligatory moan of pain, Shinji cried, \"Is that good enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, this'll do.\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe it'd put Asuka in a better mood too, he'd have to make sure it was big enough. A pitcher would probably suffice, it wouldn't be humanly possible to drink any more. After ten minutes slaving away, he heard Asuka call from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinji, what's taking you so long! I thought we were going to help each other out... you need to do your part too.\" she cried, milking their new \"friendship\" for all it was worth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji hurried through, balancing a colossal milkshake on a tray, doing his very best not to spill it. He put in down on the table in from of Asuka, waiting for her verdict. She began eying the concoction, and leaned forward to drink it. He had remembered to put in a straw, which he hoped would earn him bonus points. She began drinking, not making eye contact with him at all. He only hoped that it meant she was more interested in drinking than berating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka gulped down the mixture greedily, not too fussed if it all didn't go in her mouth.

It's not bad, but I've had better... as soon as I'm finished, I'll take a look at those sums... they can't be that hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished off her drink quickly, suppressing the urge to burp - she couldn't do that in front of him.

So much so it was little wonder why she would ace any swimming competition at her, Shinji, and Rei's (along the rest of their friends/companions) school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's only real competition seem to be from Rei Ayanami, the almost constantly silent girl was a natural swimmer and the water seemed to love her just as much as it loved Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a single event where the two didn't place First and Second (coincidence you decide). In the beginning Asuka was always the first to finish but slowly Rei began to take that from her. From that point onward the two were constantly switching victory positions, something that brought on a lot of fanfare from the school-body. But then the unthinkable occurred...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka had placed fourth! It was inconceivable it was impossible it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikari could only watch with concern as Asuka stormed off back into the locker-room. She knew her close friend was disappointed and knowing the redhead the way she knew her Asuka was in no mood to talk to anyone walking the face of the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji and Rei as well watched their fellow comrade-in-arms and friend (or acquaintance to Rei) walk away no doubt disappointed with the outcome. Shinji being close to both girls wanted to go speak with Asuka until Rei stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense now would not be the proper time to speak with Souryu. Doing so will only bring harm to your physical well-being, Ikari.\" she explained rather seriously. One thing about Rei she never pulled any punches the few times she spoke and was always straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji sighed before nodding, guess it would be smart to allow Asuka some time to herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the locker room Asuka screamed in pure unadulterated frustration. Her winning record, her image, her happiness, all tainted now by this one inexcusable loss. She growled, teeth clenched tight, before slamming the door to her locker shut the ear-shattering sound blasting throughout the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this have happen, how did she let herself lose this way. The loss to Ayanami wasn't even a bother to her now, the fact that she lost to Rei along with two others was what was driving her insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing into her casual attire, Asuka slammed her right fist into the bench build beside the lockers, lucky for her no blood was drawn. While still frustrated her anger was beginning to tire her out so she moved over to the nearby sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka stood there for minutes on end, breathing in and out after she had applied some water to her flustered face. Staring upward at her reflection the redhead sighed her anger finally starting to calm down, though she was still in no mood for any sort of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if there was one thing about Asuka that was constant outside of her short-temper it was her will to win, to prove her worth to everyone in and around her. Slowly a smirk began to form across her once frustrated lips. She would bounce back from this, even if she had to take some time off any upcoming competitions, she vowed to return better, faster, stronger then ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Asuka Langley Souryu would not let this loss stop her. No the second child would return to the water and make it bow before her might. This much she was certain of.</span></div></div>",

The redhead was content with her plan of returning to competition in even greater form than how she left. Tossing her bag over her right shoulder she exits the locker room, a glimpse of happiness back in her formerly anger-filled eyes. Though she still didn't feel like speaking with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked out toward the pool area, the exit being just on the opposite side of the locker-rooms, she spotted Rei walking toward her. The two girls passed one another but surprisingly or not surprisingly (depending on how you look at it) no words were exchanged between the two. Only two somewhat nods to one another, the girls then parted ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached Shinji Asuka knew he'd be worried about her and frankly at present time didn't want to converse with the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Asuka?\" She walked by him, just like with Rei only her nod being her only form of acknowledgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where are you going, Asuka?\" he asked her curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your concern. Don't follow.\" she stated in full seriousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Asuka had completely left the event. Now away from the location of her terrible loss she took a moment to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's ego and will demanded that she return to swimming as soon as possible but to do that meant she had to not only get in top-physical shape but become so strong she would never lose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka envisioned herself with a bit of a leaner more well-tone physique, a body shape that would definitely give her an edge over the competition. She liked that idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor kicks she pictured her \"rebuild\" self growing even larger with more and more muscle mass. Bigger and bigger she swelled making her competition look like toothpicks by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream would have continued had Hikari not interrupted effectively bringing Asuka back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said are you alright, Asuka. You looked pretty angry a couple of minutes ago.\" restated Hikari, concern in her tender voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm fine. I'm just going to go walk and clear my head.\" Asuka responded even if it was bold-faced lie. Though it seem to be enough to convince Hikari and soon enough the two girls parted with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asuka wandered the streets her thoughts went back to her \"dream\" from before. Asuka knew if she was going to win again she had to get stronger and just getting a little stronger would do wonders but then she remembered when her \"dream\" self grew larger and larger. With a body that big no one would ever beat again, even Ayanami who was her greatest rival. But was it even possible to become that massive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have an answer but regardless was determined to find something that would accelerate her muscle growth in as quick a way as possible.</span></div></div>",

One) he could help her in her hour of need or two) ignore her and possibly get not only into another fight, more than likely getting kicked out of the store, and possibly fined for disturbing the peace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah at this point while he hated to admit it option A was infinitely better than option B.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I'll help you on the condition that you at least cool down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph\" Asuka turned away before cracking a bit of a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever.

So are you still up to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Untested huh, not exactly what I expected but hell if it's going to help me then so be it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, go for it.\" Asuka stated confidentially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright but as I said it's untested so any discomfort should be expected though I know for certain it shall not kill you. Just trust me on that last part.\" she added as Asuka was a second away from commenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later the serum had been injected into Asuka. For a moment the girl felt nothing in fact she felt rather normal and wondered if chemical had even done anything at all. Then another minute passed... </span></div></div>",

I--...at least, I don't think it will kill you...\" Ritsuko stammered, less certain than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's whole body then spasmed, drawing her up to stand upright, stiffly. Her eyes and hands clenched shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko watched in horror as the veins all across Asuka's body became thick, strained, and startlingly visible. She panicked even more when she saw a grim look cross Asuka's face, and her lips parted, revealing her teeth, gritted tightly shut in a horrible look of...pain? Fear? Or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahhhh...\" Asuka laughed through her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...happiness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko realized that the horrible look on Asuka's face was a strained, intense smile. Strangely, this just made Ritsuko more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just when Asuka's veins looked about ready to explode out of her skin, there was a deep, tightening, organic sound...and Asuka's body suddenly erupted with muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms swelled up immensely, gaining shocking mass, and definition. So did the rest of her body. Her legs thickened to an impressive girth, and as she lifted her shirt up to take a look, sure enough, she had an imposing pair of abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka clearly was admiring her body's developments, as she now resembled a female bodybuilder. But taking her eyes off her own form, she looked at Ritsuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet.\" she smiled \"I can feel it--OH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange muscle sound groaned again, louder, as she swelled up more...then, a third time, even louder, even longer, and finally she exhaled, apparently done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's sweaty, gleaming body was shocking. Her veiny, hard, shimmering biceps were big as basketballs. Her shoulders invited a similar comparison. Her legs were as thick as some trees. Her neck was far thicker than her head. Her pecs soared out from her chest majestically, putting any pair of conventional breasts to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka did not have a naturally large frame, and the serum did nothing to increase her height. This, paired with her tight, tight clothes all served to further impress upon one just how muscular and ripped and huge she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you okay? Ritsuko asked, when she could finally talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Asuka asked, playfully flexing her world-record-breaking body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I suppose that was a stupid question. But, I mean, you don't feel any negative side-effects of this...this growth of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None at all. My only concern is, just how many more wonderful little vials of this stuff do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko gulped. Clearly, Asuka, never one to be easily satisfied, looked at her amazing growth as merely step one, despite the fact she obviously put herself far ahead of Rei's, or anybody's, league. This...could get interesting. Should she go ahead and assist Asuka, or put her foot down before things got too out-of-hand?</span></div></div>",

Threaten me and I will find a way to either ensure you never get any more of the serum or I'll come up with an antidote and you can say goodbye to all your new strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka huffed near silently at the first condition but for the moment put it aside she knew the doctor was smart enough to come up with a backup plan if given enough time and Asuka certainly didn't want to become powerless again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two (this time two fingers raised) I want to be a part of one of if not THE greatest human achievement of our time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused Asuka raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see if if it's possible to defeat an angel without the use of an Evangelion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko smiled as she walked up to Asuka, her mental grip on the newly formed amazon was nearly complete. It just needed that one last push and the doctor knew exactly what buttons to push in order to get her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it, Asuka. You are now in a league of your own as far as your competition is concerned but what if you could ascend even further? What if you could...destroy an angel with your own bare hands? Your Evangelion wouldn't be required only your own immense strength. Then and only then would you have no equal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished Ritsuko could nearly feel the warm satisfaction beaming off of Asuka's face. The hold was now complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, Asuka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I say? I'd have to be a damn fool to turn down such an offer.\" stated Asuka in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have ultimate power\" she paused to flex to her right bicep, \"and you'll have your achievement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirked then played on Asuka's lips, \"Of course I'll have a part of the fame and glory since you obviously can't do this without me. In any case I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deal was set now the question was should Ritsuko give Asuka another shot here and now or does Asuka head off to showcase her new improved form?</span></div></div>",

This was one of those cases, Asuka now had a body shape that would put even world-class athletes to shame and the girl wanted even more! No she had to take control of the situation before something way too drastic occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Asuka but one is all you get. After all you now have what you were seeking for, a muscular build that guarantees success against any and all opponents. Do you really need anymore then you already have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko eyed the buffed up redhead, while she was older then Asuka the younger girl's new amount of muscle did worry the doctor slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkagi flinched slightly as Asuka raised a finger Ritsuko's eyes hinted at fear for a split-second before Asuka smirked at the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you heard me right, doctor. I didn't ask for you to give me another injection I asked just how many are left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's lips parted slightly to reveal her pearly white teeth as her smirk grew in size, \"You see I'll be taking all of them with me and I'll use every last one to make myself even bigger. I'll make sure that I am forever unstoppable and unbeatable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part really worried Ritsuko, if one vial made Asuka as big as she currently was she could only imagine how large the girl would become if she used them all. Instinctively she took a step back as Asuka took a step forward, the blonde woman could hear the cracking of the pavement underneath Asuka's heavy footstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to give them to me or what?\" Asuka took another step forward, and Akagi took another step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I told you that you can not have them.\" Ritsuko stated with a slight gulp as she took a hold of the small case housing what Asuka wanted and wanted badly, in retrospect Ritsuko wasn't sure if it was such a smart move considering the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's smiled faded as she surprised the doctor as well as herself with her speed as her right fist came crashing into the wall behind Akagi making quite a dent in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to push my nerves, doctor. Now give me the case. I won't ask again!\" the muscular redhead demanded with a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrighten as she was Ritsuko stood firm against Asuka's overwhelming intimidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's eyes squinted her blue eyes nearly shut as her smirked from before had completely faded away and was now replaced with an expression of rage and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting away with her iron fist at the gravel that made up the wall's surface, Asuka balled her up her left hand, the blood veins residing within pulsing outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it do you! I'm taking what's mine regardless of how you or anyone else feels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the now angered redhead stared her down, Ritsuko came to realize that Asuka's increasing anger must be a side-effect of the serum. Even though the girl was already known to have a short fuse the chemical formula had to be working in tune with her already establish anger and intensify it to even greater amounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka please you must calm yourself. The serum...I fear that it's affecting your anger and making you unstable!\" shouted Ritsuko but the warning came too little to late as Asuka swatted away the doctor, lucky for her it wasn't enough to severely injure and or kill her in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Ritsuko's dismay the case flew out of her hands and went skidding across the floor to the other side of the room. A lucky break for the doctor and another angering moment for Asuka who cursed in frustration.</span></div></div>",

Asuka, who was too busy shouting, and stamping her foot angrily for a moment (and causing alarming cracks on the floor while doing so) missed her chance, as Ristuko once again grabbed the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were getting...scary. In the interest of self-preservation, handing the case over would probably be the wisest thing. But she'd already made up her mind, and wasn't going to cave in just because Asuka was being even more of an impatient, selfish brat that usual, thought Ritsuko angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd really, the thought of Asuka taking more of the substance scared the hell out of Ritsuko. Because, well, there was no telling what would happen. Even if each vial added the same amount of burgeoning muscle to her, Asuka would still end up a hulking superwoman. And, even worse...what if the effects grew more potent with each use? It was possible, for all Ritsuko knew. And if so, by the end of it, she could be a damn mountain of rippling, unstoppable muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Ritsuko had to nip this madness in the bud. But...how? Asuka was already eying her and the case venomously, and would probably pounce soon. The way Ritsuko saw it, trying to reason with Asuka already proved pointless, so she could either try running away with the case (dangerous, considering Asuka's speed, but still...it COULD work).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...well, it was crazy, but she could try injecting herself. That would be one way of putting Asuka in her place. Sure, Asuka could make a grab for the vials while Ritsuko was incapacitated by her own growth, but it was still a maneuver worth considering. Besides, she doubted that Asuka would want to just try injecting herself again without some form of proper guidance.</span></div></div>",

Akagi figured if she could get away from Asuka long enough she could use her brains over the girl's muscle...but the hard part was getting away safe and sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath she leaped to her feet and urged her feet to use all of her natural given speed to run straight out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka gave one final stomp forward before noticing the blonde woman try to make her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" shouted the muscle bound girl giving quick chase. But once again luck would be on Akagi's side as she made it to the door before mumbling a quick apology and slamming it straight into her pursuer's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door wasn't iron-clad or anything close to the sort but the force behind it along with the sudden impact was enough to stun Asuka even if it was for less than a second tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor knew she wasn't out of the fire yet and continued running just as she heard the blasting sound of Asuka's heavy fist tearing through her office door. A moment later Asuka had effectively ripped the door off it's hinges and tossed it away as if it was a plush toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmashing her fist into the wall to the right of her, Asuka sneered in frustration as she believed Ritsuko had gotten clean away. That is until she saw a glance of the doctor's lab coat just as the woman turned the corner at the end of the long and rather lengthy hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression soften into more of a smirk and Asuka knew the hunt was back on.

So it was that a calmer, more collected Asuka resumed the chase for the Ritsuko. This simultaneously made her less likely to hurt Ritsuko, but with her mind once again running at full capacity, it also meant that she was all the more likely to get what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was that Ritsuko, who was beginning to feel relieved, thinking she now had a good chance of escaping Asuka, was crestfallen to feel a breeze as Asuka, now coming to terms with her physical capabilites already, swept past her, and skidded to a stop, causing visible scrapes across the tile floor with her now-bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ritsuko.\" Asuka began, the very picture of charm, as she stood up straight and composed herself \"We're both being silly. For my part, it was awful of me to hit you like that. I'm just glad you didn't get hurt. You ARE okay, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad! But at the same time...well, you have to understand that you can't outrun me. I promise, I'm never going to hurt you again. But it's certainly within my power to keep you restrained until you give me what I want. Visitors are none too frequent to this neck of the woods, and I'll make sure that you don't contact anyone for help. So you can either spend hours with my hand on your shoulder, before finally giving up, or you can go ahead, save us both some time and irritation, and give me what I want now...because you have to agree, ma'am, I am nowhere near big or strong enough yet! I'm a twig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flexed her enormous body, smiling ironically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before this day is over...\" she continued \"...I will be a damn goddess. Isn't that an invigorating thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko gulped. The dead end had officially been reached. Asuka was right, with the situation they were in, her only hope would be for someone to come by, and that could take hours, or even days. And even then, what IF someone came by? Asuka could probably just sweep them up in her little drama, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Asuka seemed to be telling the truth about her anger issues calming down...her swollen muscles seemed to be more relaxed, and her smile now had a menacing streak of a different sort, and not the 'I MIGHT KILL YOU' kind. An improvement, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko had tried her hardest, but it was true. Any struggle past this point would be silly and fruitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Asuka. You win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ritsuko prepared the next vial, and plunging it (now, with some difficulty) into one of Asuka's thick veins, she injected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko crossed her fingers.</span></div></div>",

She immediately was bigger than Asuka, and a second, slighter growth put her well past the redhead's league. Though impressed by her own growth, she observed and felt her knew body coldly and logically. Her calm, serene face looked severely out-of-place, framed as it was by massively swollen neck muscles that reached up to her ears. Her biceps were enormous, bloated, bigger than watermelons, laced with tense veins. Her pecs put Asuka's to absolute shame. Her legs were each thicker than Asuka's entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Asuka, for her part, was livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those muscles should be MINE!\" she roared, diving towards Rei angirly.

She was starting to sweat, and she looked down to see that her whole body was blushing red. And then...she felt it. And soon after, saw it. She was growing. But differently, this time...rather than the abrupt, painful growth of before, she could see and feel her muscles rise slowly, her whole body filling up with muscle like air being let into a balloon. A wicked smile crossed her face. She closed her eyes, tight, concentrating, trying to grab onto this development, not let it go. And YES! It was working! The pace quickened! This new growth was no doubt brought on by her emotions, but now she was carrying it on through sheer force of will. She was actually willing herself bigger, stronger, thicker! Her body reddened even more, sweat pouring across her body. And finally, the growth eased to a stop, and she let out a satisfied sigh as her blush faded. She was almost scared to open her eyes...the growth felt amazing and huge, but she was worried that she'd look to see that she still hadn't outgrown Rei. But, hah...she needn't worry after all. She opened her eyes to see Rei looking at her, intimidated in spite of her usual emotionless state of mind. And Ritsuko was hyperventilating in fear. And who could blame them? Asuka observed her body as much as she could, using the shiny, reflective tiles on the floor to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles piled up all around her head, so much so that looking left or right only greeted her eyes with sights of her own muscles. Her frame of vision was partially blocked by her gigantic pecs, which extended whole feet ahead of her. Her arms, observing them as best she could, were so laden with muscle that they blew her mind.  As she flexed, she burst out laughing as she realized the peak of each bicep extended past the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" she shouted \"LOOK AT ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her was, of course, equally amazing. Her legs were now thicker than tires. And big tires, at that. Vast mounds of swollen muscle shifted and rose across her body like tectonic plates with every move she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you two...\" Asuka said, sweetly, looking at Rei and Ritsuko from over her piles of muscle \"...I think it's safe to say I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to step towards them. Tiles crumble into dust beneath her every heavy footstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko was almost having an anxiety attack. She was desperately hoping Rei would have a similar growth-spurt, but her lack of emotions prevented the much-needed trigger. Ritsuko considered injecting Rei again, but that would only serve to raise the stake and escalate this conflict. Asuka could well have another growth spurt...it was possible her metabolism had changed enough to produce something akin to the substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, Rei was at risk now, too. And since she had quite a vested interest in Rei, for a number of reasons, she didn't want her to get hurt just because she, Ritsuko, didn't want to give in to Asuka. And it was comical how, as big as Rei was, Asuka now dwarfed her so completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Asuka. You're right. You win. But I want you to know, you're a bully, and a brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disagree. I just...like being the best. And thanks to you, I can be just that. So...hit me with the good stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko, with Rei watching her blankly, and Asuka watching her carefully and hungrily, prepared the second vial. And...</span></div></div>",

The thought of just how big she'd get now was terrifying, and her stomach felt like it was shriveled up into a ball. The only silver lining was an interesting observation: her flesh was so thick and hardened by muscle, that the needle had a hard time even piercing Asuka's skin. While this was scary on one level, it at least gave Ritsuko one small silver lining: after this, it was almost guaranteed that Asuka would become too tough to even be able to inject again. Still, small comfort. There was no telling how huge she'd get with this next hit, and knowing Asuka, she'd probably either figure out some way around that catch, or threaten Ritsuko until SHE came up with something. Ritsuko had a hard time imagining a future where Asuka didn't grow into an enormous mountain of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting.\" sang Asuka cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko sighed, and finally pushed the substance out through the needle, and into Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects were, as always, dramatic. All her huge muscles flexed to their massive full size (Ritsuko found herself wondering how they could even manage to GET any bigger), and began to strain against her skin. Her veins became further engorged, pressing out painfully in clear outlines. Then, in a strange spectacle, her muscles all seemed to shake and twitch, her whole gigantic body vibrating and spasming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a roar erupted from Asuka's lips.<br>\r\n\"YEEEESSSS! THIS IS IT~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was. Her body exploded with muscle. Huge, heaving, hulking musculature piled impossible on her small frame, she had quickly doubled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer beautiful, mad face, breathing hard and sweating, was growing obscured by her enormous pecs, and her swelling neck and shoulder muscles. It was reaching the point where her head was starting to look like it was staring out from a jungle of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm big?\" she asked, smiling viciously \"This is small! THIS IS SMALL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother expansion jolted her, blowing her muscles up to the point where she had corked the hallway, muscles bunching up against the ceiling and walls. Every surface was buckling away from her impossible body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run Ritsuko. THIS PLACE IS COMING DOWN! I'M FILLING IT ALL! GET TO SAFETY! BECAUSE, OH, I STILL NEED YOU! An ant like you couldn't imagine what this feels like...I need more! So much more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko, wasting no time, did as the growing wall of muscle asked, and began to flee, Rei following her lead. Dammit! She was expecting Asuka to get big, but this!...how far would this second dose take her? She should have injected Rei again, when she had a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, she saw that the hallway around Asuka had begun to collapse. The thought that tons of falling architecture would hurt the newly-armored-in-muscle Asuka didn't even occur to Ritsuko. The list of things which would hurt Asuka now was probably getting pretty short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane!\" whined Ritsuko to the world at large as she kept on running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was inclined to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two of them reached a vast room with a high ceiling, and a wall-spanning window overlooking the geofront. Figuring this was as good a place as any to stop, Ritsuko collapsed, panting. Rei, pumped as she was, hadn't even strained herself during the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko then considered the possibility that this could be time for a turnaround. Asuka, regardless of how ungodly her strength must be, would still need some time to reach them at this point. And Ritsuko still had some vials...could she buff Rei up enough to contend with the red head? The immediate effects of the substance seemed to be greater for Rei, but Asuka's anger and ambition seemed to fuel on a greater ultimate growth, at least so far. Or...<br>\r\nRitsuko found herself going back to her previous thought from awhile ago: inject herself. The effects seemed to vary from person to person, and maybe it could do more for her than for Rei, since emotions were a powerful ingredient, and Rei had very little on that front. Plus, she had to admit that pure self-preservation compelled her to want some extra muscle for self-defense...BUT, the risk from before was still there. She had more self-control and a better temper than Asuka, but it could still drive her half-crazy, too. Did she want to risk it?</span></div></div>",

Sweat beaded on her skin like rain as she shook. \"Aaaah, god! Here it comes!\" She shouted as loud as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a pop. One second there was a woman on her hands and knees on the floor. The next second, there was a mountain of flesh that caused even Rei's formidable body to step backwards. Deep, throaty grunts rang out from somewhere underneath the mountains of muscle that Ritsuko had become, and as convulsions ripped through her body, there was plainly still more to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, Ritsuko pushed herself back onto her knees, her blonde hair soaked with sweat leaving a sparkling trail as it flapped back. Even though she knew in her mind that this was only the beginning, her eyes couldn't help but rove over her body. Legs like trees, the sharp chords of her muscles writhing in her skin like pythons preparing to strike. Titanic pectoral muscles rested in front of her, stretching out like a shelf. And her arms, well. There weren't any words that could describe them. There was probably more muscle on one of her arms alone than both of Rei's legs put together. Even her trained, scientific mind couldn't begin to estimate how much power she was capable of exerting now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, the only sound echoing through the room was Ritsuko's deep breathing. Both her and Rei could only stand entranced, looking at Ritsuko's new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the silence broke. A chuckle was the culprit, coming from Ritsuko. \"Well, there's more where that came from.\" She stated with a confidence that made Rei take another few steps backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as per usual, the Doctor was quite right. Only seconds later, an earthshaking howl escaped Ritsuko's lips as she doubled over again. Like a flowing tide, flesh shot outwards at a rate that could only be called ridiculous. Rather than a simple pop, this time the growth was much more gradual. Muscle oozed outwards, growing thicker and thicker. But as it did, something that neither Rei nor Ritsuko expected happened. Gradually, and at a much slower rate than her muscles, the rest of her body began to expand. It was a slow process, but her feet crept across the floor, slowly growing farther and farther away from her head. At the same time, her rippling back climbed higher and higher, growing closer to the ceiling. Her arms pumped larger and larger, longer and longer. With an errant spasm, one of them shot out, the limb that was easily longer than a car and probably just as thick striking the glass and shattering it like it wasn't even there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few more moments, the expansion was over. Titanic, Humongous, Gigantic. These words and more floated through Ritsuko's mind, but none of them did her justice. If she had stayed the same height as before, her muscles would have been so thick, so huge that even her form from just a few minutes ago would have looked like a stick figure. But she hadn't stayed the same height as before. She was now easily 30 feet tall, and filled up a good half of the room even while on her hands and knees. Under her, Rei looked up at her face, which was settled in a valley of muscle, in awe. A smile swept onto Ritsuko's face. She knew that she was losing it. She knew that she was turning out just like Asuka had. But she didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not done yet!\" Ritsuko laughed, her voice booming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but neither am I!\" Another, familiar voice replied. But this voice seemed to shake the very air itself. Surprised, Ritsuko's pushed herself back onto her knees and looked out the window, moving her body to keep it from obstructing her view. What she saw shocked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all that Ritsuko could see. The entire window was full of Asuka. Dominating the center was a gigantic, red haired head, easily as tall as Ritsuko's whole body was, if not more. And other than that, literal mountains of muscle, extending as far as Ritsuko could see in all directions. If Ritsuko was indescribable, Asuka was unspeakable. Even if the two had been the same size, she still would have made Ritsuko look small in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is only the beginning, my dear Doctor. Now I'll have you come along with me. After all, I've still got plenty of uses for you.\" Asuka laughed as her gigantic head, plastered with a \"Cat that ate the canary\" smile pulled back, and in it's place a titanic arm that would make a Sequoia tree feel small thrust a giant hand through the metal and glass that made up the wall as if it wasn't even there.</span></div></div>",

So just enjoy the ride for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word Asuka paused her hand from completely closing, Ritsuko then found herself in a position very similar to the way one holds a doll/action figure and despite her best struggles she soon realized that her new strength was nothing compared to the power Asuka held in a single one of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking Asuka turned on heel and began to make her way out of the Geofront, each footstep seemingly shaking the entire place to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seem to be in the favor of the god-like redhead but she and even Ritsuko had failed to realize one thing and in turn had forgotten about a certain someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the hallway just outside the remains of the room that Ritsuko's growth had taken place in and that Asuka had single-handedly destroyed Rei found herself clutching the case that seem to have started all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring downward at the case Rei recalled the moments from a few minutes ago. As she went through her memories the floor shook and Rei knew that each tremor was because of Asuka's house-size feet making contact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing a bit of a calculation in her head Rei flipped open the case as another quake came and went. She knew what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I must stop Souryu...by any means.' she thought silently as she prepared the amount of serum she would need to get the job done.</span></div></div>",

Finally, nearly 1500 feet up, she saw blue. There, sticking out from among the bulging ridges a head sat, staring passively downwards at her. Despite appearing so small and insignificant, Asuka quickly realized that from chin to hair it spanned nearly 100 feet. The positioning clicked in her mind, although she remained rigid, unable to move. Those titanic bulges to the right and left were actually Ayanami's shoulders. The vast wall directly before her was in reality the top of Ayanami's breasts and pectorals. Rei was actually lying down, yet she still filled the entire Geofront from top to bottom. The gargantuan blue haired girl was over 2000 feet tall.... laying down. Asuka could only sputter in shock at the sight in front of her, her mind groping for what to do.

As she pulled her out of the room, and lifted her up at arm's length, Rtisuko could see even more of the red-haired giant's body. And it was absurd. From this angle, Asuka's face could barely even be seen...her muscles were so monstrously overdeveloped, that her her was almost in a cave, buried in surrounding musculature. But what could be seen of her face was...well, she was downright leering, obsessively, triumphantly. And Ritsuko realized, with anger, that Asuka was holding her up just so the good doctor COULD get a view of the young woman's ludicrous body. Even from here, she could see almost nothing but Asuka's heaving hills of strength, pulsating with power, veins straining against her thick skin like industrial power lines. She knew it already, but this just sent it home: even if their heights weren't so drastically different, Ritsuko would still look like a malnourished child next to Asuka. Ritsuko's proportions were inhuman, but Asuka's were downright demonic. You almost couldn't believe that a human frame, of any size, was located under those impossible layers and valleys and fields of muscle mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko began to hyperventilate. She didn't know if she was terrified, or furious, or just miserable, but she was absolutely overwhelmed with emotion. Even after all the growth she had gone through, Asuka was more far ahead of her than before. This young brat, this selfish girl, this THIEF was winning. Humiliating her. Using her. Treating her like some tool. Ritsuko was sick of it. She was so, so sick of it. And she was not going to take it anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka heard a scream coming from Ritsuko, echoing across the expanse of her bicep and pectorals, finally reaching her ears. What was the silly woman screaming about NOW?...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Asuka felt Ritsuko's body begin to squirm, and then almost harden, and then...swell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt. The scientist's muscles were beginning to grow, expanding like a water balloon. Asuka instinctively squeezed harder, but Ritsuko was beginning to grow to large to be held in one hand. Asuka was so bloated with musculature that it affected her ability to move, her own sheer muscle mass getting in the way, but she still managed to rearrange Ritsuko so that she was now clutched between both of her hands. Asuka was now holding her like a basketball. But the growth continued, and soon Ritsuko was more the size of a beach ball compared to Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka, getting worried about where this was heading, began to squeeze Ritsuko between her giant hands, trying to hold back her growth, But it was no use. Ritsuko was caught in an all out explosion, muscle erupting forth from more muscle, huger, and huger. Freaked out, Asuka dropped Ritsuko, and took a few vast steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up from the ground, her body bursting in every direction, monolithic slabs of flesh pouring forth, Ritsuko stood, and stared at Asuka, face-to-face. And so it was that, finally, they were on equal footing. From their towering height to their absurd physiques, they were even. Asuka, ever the bully, was now terrified by the prospect of not being obviously ahead. Enjoying the sight of Asuka looking troubled, Ritsuko smiled vengefully, and said...</span></div></div>",

It was a sight that she wasn't expecting, but one that was readily welcomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short distance, Ritsuko began running as fast as her new legs could take her with Rei following behind.  They had to find Asuka before she could follow through on her insane ambitions.  Yes, the two of them together would be more than enough to stop her psychotic ambitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until they found a small clearing by the lake and heard the sound of slurping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning forward, Ritsuko had the worst of her fears confirmed.  In the clearing was an empty freezer, a bucket, a plastic tube, not one drop of the serum, and a gigantic and still growing Asuka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you two are just in time!\"  Asuka bellowed, laughing haughtily at the two smaller women as her body continued to increase in size and sheer muscular density.  \"You're about to see what a true goddess looks like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I can help it!\" Ritsuko shouted, rushing forward and delivering a punch with enough force behind it to break an iron bar.  Unfortunately for Ritsuko, her target wasn't iron, it was the increasingly dense muscles of the laughing redhead, who merely shrugged off the blow from her smaller opponent like it was a breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't interrupt,\" Askua replied, the contempt in her voice audible as she pushed Ritsuko away with a free hand.  \"You can massage me with those weak muscles of yours AFTER I'm done growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing Ritsuko so easily dispatched, Rei could only stand and watch as Asuka's body continued to pack on size and muscle, the naked red haired pilot laughing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, what should we do?\" Rei asked.  Ritsuko could only stare slackjawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know.\"</span></div></div>",

Within a few minutes, Asuka had doubled in size and was over two stories tall and at least twice as wide.  Asuka felt the growth stop and she almost threw a tantrum as she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the growth was just getting started.   Again she felt that burning sensation across her body and more stretching and gurgling sounds were heard and her body inflated with even more muscle.  Asuka didn't care that she was becoming so bloated with muscle, after all, who could stop her?  Muscles piled everywhere filling up every available inch of space and every nook and cranny.  She retained a relatively small waist giving her a ridiculous looking hourglass figure.

Deciding to rectify that immediately, the monstrous girl began stomping her way towards the city, her powerful footsteps causing anything nearby to fly into the air.  Before she knew it, she was in the city, the roads empty save for the cars that she would occasionally crush underfoot, the steel offering no resistance to her musclebound body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's here,\" she lamented aloud, having wished for an audience to her growth now that no one could interrupt it.  Still, her ego was more interested in a building which caught her eye, with a clear glass sheen that would accurately reflect her body.  Hurriedly, she ran towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, the building soon shattered as she saw a creature hovering in the air, one that appeared alien and familiar all at once.  It stood not on legs, but on thin air, a body of pure white with eyes over two large wing like flaps.  Instead of arms, a large tail, multiple segments that attached and separated with claws on the edges, lashed out at buildings as it hovered over the city.

We have the means with which to neutralize the Angels, so if Asuka cannot defeat it, we can defeat the Angel ourselves and capture Asuka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch an idea seemed callous, yet Ritsuko nodded her head in agreement.  \"That would seem to be the wisest course of action.

That stupid little AT Field of yours won't be able to stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither made a move to attack the other as Asuka waited for her next growth spurt to kick in, the one that would allow her to battle the monster on equal, if not superior footing.</span></div></div>",

The serum was still working throughout her body and before long, Asuka could feel her muscles start inflating again.

With a single push of her super strong legs, she propelled her massive body through the street with an outstretched fist towards the Angel.  With the strength of a dozen jets, she slammed her fist into the Angel trying to pierce its powerful force field.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the Angel didn't move, but as Asuka continued to pile muscle on her body, she pushed more and more and the Angel began to move backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Asuka screamed.

It was an intense rush of pain and pleasure again and Asuka's screams could be heard across the city as she willed her body to be stronger and stronger, larger and larger.

Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled a tad when as she heard the familiar sound of older woman's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well I didn't expect you out here, Misato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah well neither did I', the woman thought before figured it wasn't the best of opening statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off I want to congratulate you on successfully defeating the angel from earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defeating? I ripped it to shreds!\" the mammoth redhead boasted with a flex of her immense bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me, Misato, I'm the most powerful being walking the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it made sense that along side her muscles Asuka's own ego had inflated to impossible portions. However the girl wasn't fool she knew that her keeper hadn't come to just celebrate her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not why you're here is it, Misato?\" She paused after having at last spotted Unit One, \"And I see you brought Shinji with you. Like what you see, Shinji?\" she asked teasing the boy with a flex of her stunning chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy refused to comment and lucky for him Misato re-averted attention back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't about Shinji, Asuka, but you're right...I'm here on direct order from The Commander to bring you back to base. Your job is done thus you're asked to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence fell upon them before the mighty redhead broke it with her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't aware I was on the clock? I wasn't aware that I have to go back now, are you really in any condition to ask that of me, Misato? I'm more powerful then you could ever imagine what if I just decided to continue on, what then, you going to stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato paused for a moment choosing her words carefully. Her orders were clear and Asuka was in a way right she was too powerful to simply let go, she had to convince her to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Geofront Commander Ikari along with the rest of the staff watched silently, Gendo putting his trust in the major otherwise he'd have to step in himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of what you've become, Asuka, you are still a part of NERV that means you must still answer to Commander Ikari. Like it or not you are still part of this organization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this size I can do whatever I please, Misato! Do you really think I should take answers from anyone other then myself now, I crushed an angel with my bare hands! I'm bigger, stronger, more powerful then any force on the planet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead boasted yet again as she flex every portion of her body three times over, her muscle structure reaching even higher mind-boggling levels. Shinji trembled slightly in his seat believing that if she kept at it Asuka was very possible of outgrowing all of Japan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered at the thought he gather himself however as he heard the voice of his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under no circumstance is the Second Child allowed to leave, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B...but I thought we were going non-violent?\" he answered with a question of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Katsuragi fails I entrust that you will use every once of Unit One's power to bring back Souryu. We will not lose her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji didn't respond and he wasn't at all surprised with his father's order. Asuka was still a weapon to him nothing more nothing less. Dammit he didn't want her leave but at the same time as usual he didn't approve of his father's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka listen to me. If you leave now you'll no doubt become an enemy of the world. Every nation with the power to do so will label you as a treat. You'll be hunted as if you were a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think I can't take care of myself? You don't get it do you I don't need your help or your protection anymore! I'm not the same little girl who moved in with you I've become a goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it Misato had failed and his father was going to order him at any moment now to subdue Asuka in whatever way he could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...you leave now, Asuka...you become no better then the very thing you just ripped apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji's dark eyes snapped open while Asuka's nearly bulged out of their sockets. Misato's words had seemingly hit her with enough force that even her impenetrable muscles couldn't protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. You make your leave and you will be no different then any angel we've ever encountered or fought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor first time in a good while the redhead was stunned silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return to NERV, Asuka, we can sustain and provide for your every need. There's no need for any of this to end so poorly. Please Asuka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uneasy silence from earlier had returned with twice the intensity. However soon enough and without a word said the titanic girl took a few earth-rattling steps forward, Shinji and Misato wondering what would be her ultimate decision?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no angel nor am I a monster...I'm just me, the best at what I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled a confident smile, it was almost clear what she had decided but the two still weren't entirely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to go back? Alright I guess I can do that, after all unlike Wondergirl or that weakling Shinji I'm going to protect everyone and end this war with the angels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupremely arrogant she may be but at last her roommates were allowed to let loose a deep sigh of relief. Asuka, in all her muscular glory, was thankfully still part of the team. Now with that settled it was time to head back to NERV HQ.</span></div></div>",

Shinji was still scared of Asuka but nonetheless felt he had to at least talk to her and clear up a few things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe met up with Rei, still pumped up and muscular from before, before heading over see Asuka.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think she wants to talk about Shinji?\" Rei asked in her usual monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, I hope its not about her boasting about how strong she is again, though....

She may even be regretting turning herself into this.. muscle monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand your point of view.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the duo walked up to Asuka's face, they were surprised to see that she didn't have her usual confident expression. Instead, she looked incredibly depressed. Feeling worried about her, Shinji walked up to Asuka and place his hand on her giant cheek to try and comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Asuka?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? Just look at me! I'm a huge freak! I was so caught up in wanting to get stronger that I completely ignored what I was doing to myself... I may be the strongest thing in the world now, but I don't even look human anymore! I'm nothing but a monster now...\" Asuka said, tears beginning to stream down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Shinji surprised both Rei and Asuka by slapping the massive girl's cheek with all of his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that, Asuka! You're not a monster! No matter what you look like on the outside, you're still you on the inside. That much will never change, no matter how big you end up getting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I... No, you're right Shinji. I am me, no matter what I look like. I just wish that there was some way to change this... A way to take back everything I did and get my old body back... I was foolish to think that I ever really wanted to turn myself into <i>this</i>.\" Asuka said, reaching up to wipe the tears away from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to her despair, her muscles were simply too big, and she was unable to reach her face with their obstruction. Now more depressed than before, Asuka punched the nearby wall to vent her frustration, leaving a gaping hole in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, who am I kidding! I can't live like this! How am I supposed to eat?! Where am I supposed to sleep?! I just can't take it anymore! I want to go back to my normal life! I want to go to school, and to find a boyfriend! Why did I ever think that it was a good idea to turn myself into this... this... this muscle monster!\" Asuka cried out, cursing herself for what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji simply reached out his arms to hug Asuka's cheek in an attempt to comfort her, and while it did make her feel a bit better, it didn't erase the fact that she was stuck like this now. After several minutes, however, Asuka began to feel something strange welling up in the pit of her stomach. Before anyone had any idea what was going on, Asuka began to shrink down. All three of them watched in surprise as all of Asuka's immense muscle mass began to recede into her body once again. Soon she had returned to her original slender feminine figure, and was beginning to shrink down to her original height as well. As she was shrinking, she grabbed on to the bridge that Shinji &amp; Rei were standing on and pulled herself up to stand beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By the time everything was over, Asuka looked almost exactly as she did before she ever had herself injected with the muscle-growth formula in the first place. The one difference was that her body now appeared to be much more toned. The only fat anywhere on her body was isolated into its ideal locations, namely her breasts and her butt. Her muscles were much more defined than they used to be, but they didn't bulge out and engulf her body like they did only moments earlier. She now had a much more athletic build, and while her muscles were still clearly defined, they no longer interfered with her slender and feminine figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what just happened to me?\" Asuka asked as she looked at her two friends, surprised to find herself the same height as them once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that your intense emotions caused a reaction in the formula that reversed its effects.\" Rei said in her usual monotone voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You mean I'm really back to normal again? But it's weird... I don't feel like I got any weaker... It feels like I still have all of that strength inside of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Rei surprised Asuka by reaching out and grabbing her by the wrist. Rei then used her own augmented muscle to lift Asuka into the air. Asuka began to struggle to break free from the much more muscular girl's grip, and much to her surprise she was able to completely overpower Rei with minimal effort. Breaking free from her grip, Asuka glared angrily at the blue-haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What gives, Wondergirl?!\" Asuka asked in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a test. You said that you felt you still had all of your strength, so I decided to test that theory. It would seem that all the strength you gained didn't just go away. Instead, it would seem that every bit of it has been compressed into a single superdense layer of muscle. Simply put, you still have all of your strength from before, but it has now been compacted to fit your original form.\" Rei stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, I haven't lost<i> any</i> of my muscle? It's all still inside of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. It would seem that you have gained the ability to control your form through sheer willpower. You can most likely also freely manipulate your size as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, let's test that theory out then, shall we?\" Asuka said, starting to get excited once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she jumped off of the bridge and began to expand once again. Within mere moments, she had grown a massive height of 100 feet tall, while still maintaining her slender feminine shape. After taking a moment to admire herself, Asuka shrank back down and rejoined Rei and Shinji on the bridge. By now, the red-headed girl had regained all of her lost confidence. She wasn't sad at all anymore. She now felt incredibly excited by her newfound powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had truly become a goddess now. She had all of this unbelievable power at her command, and she knew exactly how she was going to use it. She was going to use it to protect those who are precious to her. She had always been searching for a place where she belonged, and now she had finally found it. This was her true purpose. She used to think that being an Eva pilot was why she was put on the earth, but she now realized that she was wrong about that. Her real place in the world was something much greater. She was destined to become the goddess that would protect the world and end the war against the angels with her own two hands. This planet that she and her friends called home. It was her duty to watch over it and keep it safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this sudden realization of her true role in the world, Asuka couldn't help but smile. This was her time to shine. She would finally be able to prove her greatness to the world. It would only be a matter of time before everyone around the world knew her name. Asuka Langley Soryu, the supreme goddess and divine protector of the planet earth. Yes, she liked the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

In any case he made a mental note to still have Doctor Akagi check it later for any possible sprains. He then asked what she intended to do now that she was her average size and height?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think? I'm going to enjoy being me again. I can actually go back to touching my face and if I need to I'll grow bigger then my beloved Unit 2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment he excused himself for interrupting stating that earlier she wasn't exactly fond of her previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was before there was a way for me to alter my size. I can be my standard...if not slightly stronger-looking self, I can be a giant-sized version of myself, hell I can be a literal walking mountain if I want. Point is I'm not stuck to one size anymore. I can actually go back to living my life on my terms again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teammates nodded in approval, something much easier for Shinji then Rei. Asuka afterwards stating they should leave their current location however Shinji mentioned that Misato, Ritsuko, and the other NERV personal should be told of Asuka's new abilities. She argued against it yet in the end figured she might as well after all they were going to wonder how she regained her average size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last back home at Misato's after one hell of a day Asuka practically threw herself onto the nearby couch. A part of her had lost count on the number of tests Akagi had run on her the older blonde astound at what Asuka had accomplished perhaps a part of her wondered if she and Rei were capable of the same thing and how would Commander Ikari react to the news?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows what he would do or what he actually thought of her...admittedly she had something of an idea but she pushed it aside for now she'd simply return to crashing on the couch while Shinji mentioned he'd complete some school-work before starting on dinner. Misato at the moment having to return to NERV her work-shift extended due to today's stunning events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka didn't care either way her mind still going over the amount of power she now possessed and how she had intended to use said power, that being said a smile crept onto her lips as she finally allowed sleep to grab a hold of her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Asuka had done a few crazy things in her life, some she would later think back and regret others not so much...this was one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't really sure what had made her do it all she knew was her powerful feet had begun to move almost on their own. Was it the egotism desire to be the hero, was it because deep down she was enjoying this sudden on-the-spot partnership with Rei, or was it really just something done subconsciously without any real thought involved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have the answer but as she felt herself descend in an almost awkward slow fashion Asuka curved her lips in something of a makeshift smile. Rei's sharp red orbs looking down her, an unreadable emotion shinning within them. Almost as if she wanted to ask why but could get her vocal cords to function properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka fell with a stellar boom as she made impact with the cold titled floor below her. Cradled somewhat in Rei's immensely strong arms Asuka's smile never left not even for a moment. She still wasn't sure why she did what she did but knew enough to realize that in all likelihood her muscular dream was on the verge of ending here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision hazy she cracked a brief grin before mouthing the words, \"I'm sorry...Rei...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka slipped into a state of unconsciousness no less then a second later. The often outspoken, egotistical, vain, and arrogant redhead had taken the finishing blow meant for Rei Ayanami...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently Rei watched as Asuka's body retracted and reshaped back into it's standard size. Her partner, her musclebound comrade in arms now reduced to the average build girl she once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange and rather foreign to the blue-haired albino but as she watched Asuka shrink something insider her grew. It was some strange desire of vengeance to get back at the one who had hurt and defeated Asuka (she recalled experiencing a similar desire with Shinji...). This anger, this sudden rage it was beginning to take shape inside her beginning to boil many times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...Rei...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's sad words, ironic with the grin, rang in her ears. Just as with the angels Asuka had given up her own well-being just so Rei could continue forward. On top of that she had referred to her using a first-name basis. No nickname no offensive cuss, instead by her actual name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the now normal fallen form of Asuka in a strong hands. Rei took in a breath before staring directly at Misato, the older woman could feel even her powerful knees shake at the ice-cold stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei said nothing instead she simply let go of the pressure building inside her due to Asuka's selfless sacrifice. </span></div></div>",

Maya thanked her lucky stars she hadn't run into any of the muscle bound ladies currently running around Nerv compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless the situation was bad. Misato not only had gone off the deep end like Asuka but was the biggest and no doubt baddest and while Rei was apparently the calmest of the three she still present a major threat to anyone who opposed her or the sudden team up of the blue haired young woman and her greatest rival now turned partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya rubbed the side of her forehead temples it was almost too much to bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lieutenant's attention snapped back into focus as she heard the doctor call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko sat on a not so comfy plastic folding chair as she steadily recovered, Misato while obviously not wanting to kill her best friend had really rocked the blonde woman's world guess it was only luck that she had escape with no real injuries. Thinking back it had to be nothing short of a damn miracle that she WAS still in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thankful for that Ritsuko was also willing to bet she could acquire a gene cleaner of sorts if she poked around inside of Nerv's database. There had to be a cure somewhere she just had to find it but obviously that meant that she herself couldn't be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato didn't seem to want any more serum, thankfully, but Rei and Asuka were surely hunting her down if they hadn't already run into Misato that is. While that would buy her time she needed more just to be on the safe side, after all what if Misato decided she did need more of \"the good stuff\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pained her to do this but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, you know I trust you and consider you a close personal friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why...I need you to use the serum...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya gasped at the thought, what was her superior thinking to suggest such an idea? Hadn't she just told her that the other three women had been altered by the after effects!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Maya could object Ritsuko held out a hand in hopes the younger woman would hear her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya I need to find a cure to all of this. I'm the only one who can if I inject myself now that would be impossible. Plus in my tired state I'm not so sure my body would be able to cope with the sudden muscular growth. That's why it has to be you. I just need you to find them hold them off if you can while I repair all the damage done by this blasted chemical compound!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya stood silent for a moment taking in everything her superior had just said. It was admittedly a rather tall order and the young lieutenant wasn't sure if she be of any real use even with the serum running through her veins. That said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I lose control and attack you, Senpai! I wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing I could have the strength to kill you if I suddenly went ballistic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you I trust you, Maya.\" Ritsuko repeated with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'll do it. I'll buy you all the time you need.\" Maya exclaimed with an embarrassing tone of sudden confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

Thus Maya started to fear the worse...that is until she heard the sound of fast paced footsteps!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the corner Maya comes face to face with a near collapsed Ritsuko.

It was ironic in a cosmic sort of way, put too much faith along with chances of survival on one particular entity and in the end either it will always work out or it will backfire horribly and leave you in a state of hopelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing reminded her of when the Evangelion Units would go berserk. Using playing with things not meant for human hands and yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko slowly eyed Maya's silent form the young woman hadn't said a word yet glancing at chocolate-tinted eyes of the lieutenant she could make out a bit of unreadable emotion. Something was stirring inside Maya's head. What that was she'd soon find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai...can you find a cure if you had enough time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko was slightly surprised at the sudden and rather serious tone Maya had just adopted into her speech. It was unlike her regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can search through the numerous data records yes I'm confident I can find an antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long would you need?\" again with the total seriousness, definitely wasn't like Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...uncertain...there is a lot to go through but I should still be able to manage and make good time.\" Ritsuko stated yet she was still bothered by Maya's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya what exactly are you getting at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai...I don't like fighting. I don't like seeing others get hurt much less the ones I care for. I'm...often too weak to help much less be of any real difference...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko sat silently allowing Maya to get everything she needed to out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pacifistic by nature or maybe I'm just naturally scared whatever the case I avoid danger at any cost but this time...I can't be scared I can't avoid what has to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenpai...use the serum on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement made Ritsuko nearly leap to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to find the cure and that means I have to be the one to stop those two. I don't know how or if I can but I'm willing to try.\" Maya explained with a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very, maybe more so then I've ever been. Senpai you've always watched over me during my entire time here at Nerv let me be the one to watch over you now. Even if it's just this one time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya smiled slightly as she felt a deep blush build in and around her cheeks, her words were a lot more emotional then even she had intended them to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Ritsuko said nothing instead simply nodded in a quick fashion. Maya thanked her for understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here and roll up your sleeve so I can inject the serum into you.\" she instructed, Maya doing as told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Maya you may just have an advantage over the two of them as far as the after effects are concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterested Maya raised an eyebrow and questioned what Ritsuko had meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lack the desire to fight. You wish for peace of mind rather then corruption of soul. Those peaceful ideals of yours may just be your key to keeping your sanity in check while the serum runs through you.\" Ritsuko explained while preparing the vial into the syringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't Ayanami have that as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...while Rei is nearly emotionless she does still have small traces of emotion within her. Those samples however are not as innocent as yours are. Ayanami is duty-bound always has been always will be, give her a mission and she see it to the end same for accomplishing anything she deems is of value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now she's working off that mind-set. She sees the serum as a goal she must meet. Now do you understand how the two of you differ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nodded her right sleeve now rolled up as best she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. During and after the growth runs it's course stay true to that Maya. You are indeed the only one now that can stop Rei and Asuka.\"</span></div></div>",

Maya had to ensure that when Misato came back home from overseas travel and The Commander returning from...where ever it was he went during the highly classified meetings with SEELE that NERV was still around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandably Maya was scared but placed a brave face on as she held held her breath in the moment the needle pierced her creamy untanned flesh and made contact with a blood vein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya clenched her teeth slightly as she felt the serum run from the vial into her blood system. Nearly biting her own tongue in two as the serum caused her to feel as if her body was being set ablaze from the inside out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko shouted words of encouragement to the courageous young woman explaining that the pain would soon pass and that she simply had to stay strong until then. Easier said then done thought Maya in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yell of anguish escaped the lieutenant's lip nearly causing her to fall to a singular knee. Instead Maya began to feel it...the serum was beginning to alter her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible stretching and growing sound was heard as Maya and Ritsuko watched in amazement as Maya's once lithe body shape expanded larger, thicker, and more powerful then she had ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegs and thighs now as thick as trees, tearing away at the white tights Maya always wore to work it was quickly noted that her feet had burst clear out of her work shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms followed in equal turn, as did her shoulders, pecs/breasts, and her newly forming set of abs all tearing apart her uniform as it were made of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight stretch from her increasing growing back Maya tore out of her uniform and instead left herself with a very stretched black undershirt, afterward a second pop was heard as Maya's new chest area snapped her bra clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing a now massive arm, with an equally impressive cannonball-sized bicep, Maya reached in underneath and tossed her busted bra aside but not before gasping at how large just one of her arms had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the growth came to an end and Maya now along with her new beyond body builder size stood a few inches taller then the blonde doctor herself. Maya was naturally shorter then Ritsuko so apparently the serum had buffed up her height along with her muscles, most likely to make easier for her to move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya stood gasping and a tad bit sweaty from the mind-blowing ordeal, unknowingly she flexed causing her body to swell a good deal more, putting even more of a strain on her already by miracle super stretchy clothing. Realizing this Maya released her flex, her body shrinking back to it's already impressive shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko swayed her head side to side, she smiled as Maya suppressed enough of her new strength to allow a simple pick-me-up from the newly made amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator simply came to a stop and the twin doors opened up allowing access to the new hallway. Ritsuko stepped through afterwards she told Maya to hold the doors open. The younger woman easily did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing out a vial of the muscle growth serum Ritsuko handed it over explaining that Maya should only use it if absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventhough it appeared to the good doctor that Maya was bigger and stronger then Rei and Asuka she was still going into a dangerous two-on-one situation. The vial of serum would be her trump card in case things got too out of hand for even someone of Maya's strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya accepted the gift and promised to only use it just as she been instructed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nodded, \"Of course thank you, Senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her hand the elevator door closed in front of Maya and behind Ritsuko. Silently the blonde woman wished her junior muscle-bound co-worker the best of luck for she had a nagging feeling in the pit of her stomach that things weren't going to be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator descended and Maya, with her massive arms crossed around her equally fearsome chest, watched silently as the numbers counted downward toward the medical area....and where Rei and Asuka awaited...</span></div></div>",

The second child drank the special water that the Nerve doctors had given her and found there was a <i>tingling</i> sensation in the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...Whats going on?\"</span></div></div>",

Go away!  Get this damn pain out of my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach continued to ache as well as every other major organ inside her body.

Asuka failed to notice that her room was getting <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">smaller</font>.  But in actuality, she was growing <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">larger</font>.  The floor boards began to creak as the teenage girl grew to enormous size and she didnt even realize it being blinded with excruciating growing pains.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wh-what the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka bent over, clutching her chest in pain as it pushed out. A distinct ripping sound rang out from below, as she felt her shirt pressing in tighter and tighter against her skin. She caught a quick glimpse of the apartment room between bouts of excruciating growing pain; and, standing in the center, she spotted someone out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile hesitant at first, Shinji dragged Misato to the sound of the crashing. Examining the room, he saw imprints torn into the floor, shaped like large hands or feet; and shattered glass everywhere. Had she been kidnapped? Shinji immediately went pale. What if she'd been kidnapped, right under his nose? He'd be to blame for pissing her off- if something had happened, the weight would be entirely on his shoulders... Just like Misato hanging on his shoulders now, still unaware of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her screams again, from outside. Shinji turned his head, and nearly fainted. Asuka's visage filled the window, her blue eyes wider than saucers, peering right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hundred feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead felt her now-exposed backside bumping against the neighboring apartment. She could barely grasp the situation- not only only was excruciating pain going through her entire form, that milquetoast pilot was GAWKING at her. All her life, she'd been trained in the Eva Project, her skills honed to absolute perfection; and now, that AMATEUR was seeing her in weakness, taken by surprise, horrified and lacking control?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn blind rage and agony, she lurched backwards, her bare heel crushing a parked car like a tin can. Her backside made its way into the opposite building, tearing through glass and concrete like nothing; this only worsened her pain. One hand still pressed to her chest, the girl moved her open palm out into the  apartment, shattering the wall, as she screamed: \"DON'T LOOK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words bellowed through Shinji's ears, as he was quickly assaulted with rubble and torn fabric. Instinctively, he ducked behind Misato, who seemed to snap awake. They were both taken over by screaming, as Asuka's elongated fingers and smooth palm pressed through the wall, as if to grasp them. Long-buried memories of experiments with giant robots echoed in Shinji's mind; meanwhile, Misato recalled the horrors of the Second Impact that she barely survived. They were unable to do anything but obey the redhead's demands. Slowly, the hand began to retract, and they gaped at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hundred and fifty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Asuka covered her chest and head as she felt her shorts begin to give way. It soon became impossible for her body to stay within the streets; her toes and backside pushed against the building behind her with such great force that it started to topple over. Shutting her eyes, she mumbled to herself in German- \"Keine Angst. Keine angst.\" She bit her quivering lip, and concentrated on thoughts about her parents, her homeland, on Kaji...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople below fled from the lumbering redhead's movements, the sounds of the crumbling tower echoing through the landscape. Her ass had effortlessly sent an entire building tumbling down. Misato had rushed out to inform her superiors as soon as possible. A red alert sounded out at Nerv, and scientists rushed to collect data on their growing pilot. Citizens were ordered to evacuate, as buildings retreated into the Geofront. While staying as still as possible, Asuka's exponentially increasing growth was already making quick work of the buildings. Misato's apartment was in the older parts of Tokyo-3, so not many people lived there; unfortunately, this also meant fewer buildings had proper maintenance, and most stood perfectly still, waiting for Asuka's feet or backside to overtake them. In the distance, Kensuke wrestled with Hikari over his video camera, arguing over whether filming Asuka was a scientific exploit or voyeurism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Shinji couldn't help but glance to her- before immediately turning his head away. She was far larger than an Evangelion- but, even at her height, she looked like the same old Asuka. Shinji struggled to understand how someone could be so... Big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive hundred feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I told you not to look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice boomed out between shallow gasps for breath. It was more and more difficult to look into the apartment- she had to lie on her stomach. Asuka's breasts drew craters in the cement, as her feet spread out behind, kicking away anything unlucky enough to get in their way. The dark-haired boy answered only by bowing his head in shame, turned away. Her bare back was exposed to the air, a valley of flesh, her backside sticking out like a mountain chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm- I'm going to be fine, you loser. Don't you dare worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji kept his back turned, listening to the screams outside growing quieter as people evacuated. He felt like he had to say something, some way or another- but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you... How did you get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of her voice blew him back- but he still didn't dare turn. Looking at Asuka was difficult- but not looking at her, even with her breasts invisible, was even harder. He couldn't read her tone from the shout- was she hurt? What could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We- we should get help, Asuka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT, like Nerv can't handle this themselves? The Third Child just HAS to rush in and save the day, doesn't he? Ow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peered in closer to the minuscule boy's form, destroying more of her room as she attempted to read his emotions. The German girl wasn't ready to accept help from this squirt. She was NOT going to be a frail, helpless person, like when her mother died- no matter how much it hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I just wanted to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a hero, like always? Shinji, just leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka, this isn't just YOUR problem.\" He struggled not to turn, trying to keep his tone of voice as quiet as possible- but he couldn't help but be a little defensive. \"This could be dangerous. You need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't NEED you to tell me what to do! I'll handle this on my own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could KILL someone like this! You're turning into a monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Monster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word seemed much quieter than before- and it was followed by an eerie silence. Slowly, curiosity overtook the Third Child, as he turned his head to look to the ever-growing Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw her toes flying right towards the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven hundred and fifty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Second Child registered what she was doing, it had already happened. One foot was dug deep into the ground. The other had crashed through the apartment's walls, leaving a clear dent. It didn't even reach up to her knees. She could feel the steel against her, sharp and cold... And as she took her foot out, a sickening creak. The building started to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinji's fit of panicked screams was interrupted by the feeling of falling. His entire body, and the contents of Asuka's room, were slowly sagging towards the window. He rushed forward, grabbing onto the doorframe as he was pulled into the gap. Misato flew through the door; Shinji tried to reach out for her, but couldn't. He didn't dare watch as she fell through the window of the tilting room. Gritting his teeth, his hands felt weaker and weaker, his legs buckling as they gave way. Memories of his childhood and battles flashed through his mind, as he fell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Onto a soft, warm pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of fear, Shinji's eyes flashed open. He was next to Misato, the two of them resting on a wrinkled, peach surface. Looking around, it seemed to stretch for ages and ages. And, a short distance away, was Misato's apartment room- walls cracking, sideways, and everything overturned, but in one piece. Hesitating for a second, he climbed to the top of the apartment's walls, and glanced down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thousand feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's eyes were shut, her head tilted to the side. Every now and then, she'd turn a little, or moan, before going back to stillness. Her orange hair spread out like a blanket of ropes over the buildings. Shinji looked down upon her titanic face, looking at peace. The entire apartment room was in her hand, which lay on her bosom. He understood- she'd torn the room out and grabbed them right as they were falling. Was it to show off, or make him feel even worse? Or maybe she wasn't as bad as he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, either from emotional exhaustion, overwhelming growing pains, or under the weight of her own body, she'd fallen onto her back, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic woman lay resting on Tokyo-3's older district, buildings and cars turned to little more than rubble under her. At her full height, she'd stand nearly as high as the Tokyo Tower; even now, buildings struggled to reach the top of her toes. And with a temper like hers, the world might be doomed. But now... Her quiet, relaxed breathing seemed barely threatening at all. Almost lonely, Shinji thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody could've suspected: this was all going according to Seele's plan. Keel Lorenz and his council looked upon the scene from the safety of their room, pleased with their work; who could've known it'd have such results!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka stirred suddenly. She raised her head, eyes opening and gazing left and right with a certain tired detachment. Slowly, they fell onto Shinji, in her hands. Silently, she whispered about how sick she felt. An ironic smile crept across her lips, as she said...</span></div></div>",

She was rather shocked to say the least Misato half-expected Shinji to regain contact with her before Asuka ever did...a part of her also wondered what had ever happened with Rei?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case Misato teared opened the envelope and begins to silently read away at the contents of the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead states that while despite already having a degree of university level she continued to improve her studies and on the off-months took in the sights and sounds of her homeland. Misato smiled it sounded like Asuka was enjoying her life now that she was away from Evas, Angels, and everything in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter continues as Asuka states that this time however she wants to stop by Misato's and see her former guardian. She'd arrive in two days time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days seem like a good deal of time but to Misato it wasn't. The now 225 pound former Major had to get moving if she was going to get her place cleaned up in time for Asuka's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching on a candy bar worked on cleaning the kitchen, licking away at a Popsicle she (with help from PenPen) started cleaning the living room, several beers were consumed as the bathrooms were done, a double-pounder burger finishing Shinji's old room, three shakes finishing Asuka's, and a pizza finishing her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollasping on the couch of the now appointed day Misato burped rather unladylike (which in some ways was normal for her...) before PenPen waddled over and handed her a beer, Misato was pleased at how well she had trained the penguin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she consumed the drink a soft moan left her lips, she deserved a cold one after all that labor. Crushing the empty can on her forehead Misato slowly stood up, apparently the woman hadn't come to terms that despite the hard work she had still put on twenty five more pounds bringing to around the 250 mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer huge beer gut slapping across mid-thigh whenever she moved, her thighs themselves bigger thicker versions of her once slick-selves, her waist many inches larger then ever before same for buttcheeks (Misato wasn't too pleased when she realized she needed bigger panties unless she wanted to go through life with an eternally painful thong thanks to her enlarged butt nearly swallowing every former pair of underwear she had).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne positive was that all the excessive gaining had as expected caused her chest to blow up a cup or two larger, considering she was already quite ample before this was definitely quite the sliver lining. There was that and while she was thicker all over Misato was thankful she had somehow avoided forming a second chin, maybe the constant work out she gave her mouth with all the binge eating and drinking had prevented any noticeable weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Misato had thrown away the crushed empty can she heard a voice resound from opposite the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misato! Hey it's me! I know you're there, open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overall sound was an inch or two deeper then she remembered but the tone was unmistakeably Asuka's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato yelled out a quick response and for the redhead to wait a moment. Soon enough she found grabbed her keys and opened her door revealing a now sixteen-year-old Asuka Langley Souryu standing on the other side.</span></div></div>",

You're so fat!\" yelled Asuka studying Misato's body up and down, confirming what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its just a little fat.\" Misato nonchalantly stated pulling out a candy bar and unwrapping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka found Misato's utter lack of concern astounding. How could Misato allowed herself to fatten up so much. The purple haired woman was once a svelte beauty that managed to catch the eye of Kaji. Now Misato was a 250 pound chunker in a unbuttoned pair of snug shorts tightly hugging her thighs and a taut tank top unable to cover her huge gut as her abundant breast flesh tipped the fabric.  Asuka's eyes twitched as she spotted hints of cellulite on her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on in Asuka, I've got some refreshments at the table.\" Misato suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asuka followed Misato she noticed how wide and jiggly her ass was. Asuka helplessly stared at Misato's exposed buttocks since her puny shorts were unsuitable for the woman. Each cheek ostensibly quaked with each step as she went into the kitchen. Asuka took a seat at the table were pastries and donuts were placed, while Misato went to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting a beer you want anything Asuka?\" Misato asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\" the redhead answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato approached the table with a pack of beer and some whipcream spray. Pulling out a chair, Misato plopped her heavy self down, her sides spilling over the edge of the chair. Misato immediately cracked open a beer quickly chugging it and spraying whipcream in her mouth.  Asuka found herself glued to Misato's gluttonous display. Unable to take her eyes off her flabby upper arm as she lifted the beer up in the air to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOH YEEAAHHH! Now that's the stuff!\" Misato exclaimed. \"I tell ya there's nothing like downing some beer with good ole whipcream! Ha heh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to give an articulate response, Asuka merely grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah come to momma.\" Misato drooled grabbing a donut. \"Well go on Asuka help yourself\" Misato said as her mouth munched on a donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"thanks\" Asuka quietly replied as she picked up a pastry while Misato reached for another donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka nibbled on her pastry while Misato wolfed down the sweets. Asuka gazed upon the sight of Misato gorging with cynicism. 'What kind of a woman would let herself go like that?' she thought. Still scrutinizing Misato's weight gain, Asuka ran her eyes up and down on the feasting purple haired woman in front of her until her eyes fell on her breasts. Asuka instantly grew envious upon the sight of Misato's augmented boobs. Her boobs were big, soft, and bouncy swaying with every movement the purple haired glutton made. Asuka hoped to boast about how her breasts had grown since last they met but now Asuka felt completely overshadowed by the fat Misato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Asuka is there a problem?\" Misato asked noticing an infuriated countenance on Asuka's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka then complained about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her eyes moved down her thick arm were flab hung from her upper arm. Then she looked at her chubby smiling face. Moving hers eyes down again led her to Misato's glorious deep long cleavage. Asuka stared at Misato's envious tits. The huge globes overwhelmed her straining tank top which was unable to cover her bulging exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Asuka eat the donut and I'll order some pizzas. You want bigger boobs right?\" Misato lured as a sly smile emerged on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka...</span></div></div>",

By the end of the first one, Asuka had a somewhat thicker figure with her breast size slightly raised, her hips were wider, her thighs were thicker, as well as her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Asuka?

It was definitely more noticeable with the latter, with a slight paunch and hourglass figure.

To Misato Katsuragi, she had been certain the scarlet haired lady would be startled by the massive transformation she had undergone. Did someone warn her about her gain? Well, if they had, they had forgotten to acknowledge the fiery German\u2019s metamorphosis to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, Asuka was significantly lighter than Misato. Perhaps close to 85 pounds less, maybe even a hundred. However, even a hundred pounds less than 250 was still a significant increase. Asuka had developed an hour glass figure of sorts, with her bloated hips sticking out, her butt jiggling with each individual step of her rather porky thighs. While her stomach did roll over the lips of her jeans, her breasts were ginormous. They were still perky, thankfully, but, if Misato was not mistaken, were probably either large C-cups or small D-cups. Asuka\u2019s face had grown round, as had her arms, which rounded out into ten pudgy digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, looks like you cleaned up a lot here,\u201d Asuka observed, paying neither of their gains any mind at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, there was a lot of stuff that happened, and, uh, yeah, stuff, and\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething bothering you?\u201d Asuka asked, glancing over, confused toward her clearly flustered former major.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, not really,\u201d Misato replied, trying to sound off-handed, but coming off more as startled, unsettled, even mildly panicked, \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014 uh, heehee, how to say it? \u2013You know, you sorta, no offense or anything, but, uh\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Asuka\u2019s round face fell, eyes narrowed into mild slits as she walked away, shaking her head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s just what happens when you start to tour America for a couple months. Culture shock and all that. Ya know, I never realized how easy it was to gain weight when there was a McDonalds on every corner. Not like I like that shit anymore. I don\u2019t think I could ever go to a fast food place ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s greasy and gross, that\u2019s why,\u201d Asuka mumbled, \u201cTook awhile to realize that, but damn! After binging on all that junk, you start to get real sick of it, ya know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato actually hadn\u2019t reached that point yet, but, not to feel like a total pig of any kind, she nodded and agreed with the girl. This satisfied the German, as she then proceeded to take a seat on the nearest sofa, the furniture groaning under her weight, not so much because she was heavy so much because Misato had damaged the legs whenever she placed her own butt on the cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust out of mild curiosity how did you put on weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, boredom, lots of junk food, Kaji wanted to experiment\u2014these things just kinda happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess\u2014KAJI EXPERIMENTING!? With what, dare I ask?!\u201d Asuka stammered, her cherubic face now as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato blushed before continuing, \u201cOh, just to see if it felt better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf WHAT felt better? No, wait, don\u2019t tell me! I already know!\u201d Asuka sighed, \u201cHey, Misato, how is Kaji,m anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.

It was crazy there, but it felt more like home than her mostly empty apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what made this worse was that she wouldn't get to see senpai...Ritsuko...for who KNEW how long. And she had to admit, it hurt her that some stranger called to tell her this, rather than senpai letting her know, face-to-face. But, reflecting on Ritsuko's beauty, and wisdom, and kindness...surely, she had her reasons.

All her friends worked at NERV, and she couldn't really hang out with them at the moment. And her apartment was little more than a place to sleep in between days. It had little in the way of entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pondered, she felt a slight pang of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, that's one way to kill time.\" she figured. Time for a bite to eat.

She felt guilty about getting her to take a break in such a cowardly, impersonal manner, and because of that, she felt too awkward to contact her or apologize, which in turn, just made her feel worse. Sigh...friendships were so damn tricky. But keeping relationships strictly professional had not been one of Ritsuko's strong suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was a little nervously that she knocked on Maya's door, and waited for the door to be opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and she could hear Maya groggily say \"Wow, that was quick! I just ordered the pizza ten minutes ago-o-o-OH, GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's eyes bugged as she saw that it was no pizza delivery person at the door, but rather her light and inspiration, Ritsuko!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ritsuko's eyes bugged as she saw that in a mere two weeks Maya had gained an impossible amount of weight. If she had put on a few pounds, that would be one thing, Ritsuko wouldn't judge. But to gain as fat as Maya had in so short a time was downright inhuman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's shirt could scarcely even cover her newly massive breasts (which were clearly far too big for any of her bras), let alone her belly, which now hung over her thighs and was working on spilling down to her knees. Her arms and legs had both thickened dramatically as well, and the shorts she was wearing were suffering trying to hold her no doubt enormous rear. The only part of her that hadn't been affected was her neck and face, which were absent of double chins, and remained as thin and petite as ever. This made for a strange contrast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was attempting to cover up her bare belly with her arms, which was a ridiculous thing to even try, and looked up at Ritsuko sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya...what...WHAT HAPPENED?\" Ritsuko asked, leaning in and looking in shock at all the discarded and emptied boxes and bags of food, and cans and bottles of soda, that littered ever inch of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I guess...I dunno, I suppose I got a little carried away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, it should be impossible to eat as much as you apparently have!

She bulldozed through her monolithic stack of pizzas like a printing machine through paper, effortlessly, quickly, efficiently.

Maya never struck me as being truly passionate about anything other than science before now. The way she eats... Calling her a messy eater is akin to calling Misato on her days off punch-drunk. The word sloppy comes quickly to mind, but doesn't seem right. More like voracious, or animalistic...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Maya had eyes or the mental capacity at that moment for anything other than food, she would've shuddered slightly under the intensity of Ritsuko's gaze, and possibly had a hot flush that she was the subject of such a studious gaze from her reason for coming into the insanity that is NERV on a daily basis. However, such was not the case, so Maya kept up her indulgence without a care in the world. Ritsuko, however, wasn't quite able to do the same with her studies of Maya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know it's not right that she should be that huge after two weeks, but if she's been eating like this every day, it makes a strange kind of sense...  What isn't making sense right now is why this is so fascinating to me. Damn it, why does watching her glut herself feel so... good?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsuko squirmed slightly in her seat, trying to calm a spark and flash of heat which had started. Admittedly, it had been a while since she'd last released tension in THAT way, with or without assistance, but the merest fact she was feeling such a primal response set off a train of thought in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm aroused... How can that be? All that's in front of me is Maya, with her thin face scarfing down enough pizza to feed a city for a week. Watching her throat swallow down the morsels as splatters of sauce stain her shirt... Shirt really is doing that poor rag too much justice by this point; boob tube would be more accurate... Just sitting here watching her stuff her fat ass; again, wrong word, gargantuan or titanic is more accurate. Seeing the end results end up on those massive tree-trunk thunder thighs and that large, soft ass, her massive keg-gut, those titanic knockers that even put Misato's to shame... Oh, God! I actually like her like this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ritsuko's internal voyage of self-discovery (which, it must be admitted, went a lot longer than the short-hand form and is, in its full version, one worthy of Magellan) was in progress, Maya was busy cleaning house. Well, at least of the tower of pizza she ordered. Maya had just finished when she suddenly became aware of just how much she had eaten, and in front of her scientific idol, no less. She looked towards Ritsuko and was about to apologize when she noticed that her guest (whom, she belatedly noticed with a pang of guilt, had made herself a small cup of coffee while Maya had been demolishing the Leaning Tower of Pizza) wasn't entirely with reality at that moment, intently staring at Maya's body with a combination of that scientifically-studios look she so loved, and something a little more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Now's your chance to determine who comes onto whom...)</span></div></div>",

To make things easier, I myself will try to make the choices available to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to keep everyone in character (though toning down Shinji's angst is fine with me), there is no limit to the expansion so it's alright to go crazy with it just keep it female-only. Language is fine but keep it within the rating, romance is allowed but actual sex is not as in nothing erotic or beyond the 13 rating, seriously I can not stress this enough if you want something adult go elsewhere. Also don't kill off any of the cast (unless the story begins after a certain incident) which means no vore either, unless the eaten can somehow survive inside the eater's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and I should mention while it's very rare for me to do this if I feel an addition needs any sort of editing, be it spelling lack of detail or whatever, please do not take offense I am merely doing so to make things easier to understand/read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but certainly not least I'd like to thank each writer that at one point or another has added to this story. Nearly two hundred chapters, thank you again for supporting this interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that's about it, enjoy.</td>",
