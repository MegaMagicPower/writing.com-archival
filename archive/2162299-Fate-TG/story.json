He was closer to becoming a Hero of Justice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Rin, he ran to her to tell that Rider had been defeated. But she remained silent. \u201cRin!\u201d he called out to her. \u201cWhat happened to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped, his blood running cold at the sight before him. Cradled in Rin\u2019s lap was the lifeless body of Sakura. Her eyes were glassy like Shinji,  now a lifeless marionette. \u201cShirou ... Sakura\u2019s ... dead,\u201d she said as tears began streaming onto her dead sister\u2019s bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single sob tore through the silent school as the Holy Grail War ticked another in the deaths toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken stares at the body of his now dead granddaughter, Shinji\u2019s body already being turned into food for the worms. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just a waste of decade. Then again, if she couldn\u2019t even survive a weakened Noble Phantasm, perhaps it is better to learn now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d screamed a restrained Rider. Although barely tangible, she still existed as Crest Works continued to provide mana to sustain the weakened Servant. \u201cYou know nothing about her! She SUFFERED for you, and you would toss her aside!? All because of that waste of skin you allowed to command me!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken was about to retort on how it would not matter if either grandchild was a master, he stopped as inspiration struck. \u201cIs that so? You believe that if Sakura were your master for the war, you would succeed? Even knowing that she gave you up to Shinji without a fight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would bet my life on it,\u201d she snarled as she struggled against her bonds, the artificial Command Seals restraining her holding her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dry laugh met her claim. \u201cWell now, isn\u2019t this interesting? With a proper master you would win the Holy Grail? Then you\u2019ll have it! I\u2019ll even allow Sakura a second chance to be a proper master, since I\u2019m feeling generous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden behind her blindfold, Rider\u2019s eyes were wide with shock. \u201cBut how would you-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken held up a hand to silence the Servant, the bonds enforcing his will. \u201cI have my methods dear Rider. Your beloved master will be reunited with you in time. But first, we must address your failure.\u201d Tapping his cane, a multitude of worms began to crawl to Rider. Even as she squirmed more desperately, the worms began to comer closer. \u201cSince you were unable to be the guardian of of legend, the Matou will settle for the beast. Just still and let the worms do their work. It will only sting for awhile!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a harsh laughter, Rider began to scream as the worms burrowed into her to corrupt her further.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had all fallen apart in the span of a few days. Shirou, having managed to stop Shinji, was deeply troubled by his failure to save Sakura. Rin, dealing with the death of Sakura, had completely shut herself off. And without her help, Saber had fallen under the sway of Caster due to the use of Rule Breaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly rising from his futon, Shirou knew he had to fight. But felt a level of frustration at being unable to confront Caster. Getting dressed, he was going for a long walk to think. Going into the area he knew where Rin lived, he inadvertently passed by the Matou estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now isn\u2019t this an interesting surprise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou turned around to see an frail old man walking from the old building. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you are-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZouken Matou, my dear boy! Sakura and Shinji told me much about you Shirou Emiya! Such as shame about their ... unfortunate passing, though,\u201d he ended with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou bowed before the man, manners long since ingrained kicking in. \u201cA pleasure, Zouken-San. I\u2019m sorry about the loss of your family. If I had only been-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple tap of his cane silenced Shirou as Zouken studied the boy. \u201cIt was rather unfortunate that they both passed. But worry not, as I don\u2019t hold you responsible for Shinji\u2019s deplorable actions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou looked surprised, and slightly suspicious, of Zouken\u2019s response. \u201cI am thankful that you do not hold accountable. But ... shouldn\u2019t you have known about Shinji and his agenda. He is ... was your grandson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken gave a false interested thought, then continued. \u201cYou are correct. I did try to curb Shinji\u2019s more... disturbing habits. But there is only so much I could do. He ultimately took it upon himself to set about his own plans for the Holy Grail. And he paid for it with his life. The real tragedy was the fate of my dear granddaughter Sakura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking confused, Shirou had to ask. \u201cDid ... did Sakura know about the moonlit world?\u201d he whispered, assuming that Zouken understood what he implied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken gave a hoarse laugh. \u201cBut of course! And there lies the problem I know face. She was my designated heir for the Matou.\u201d Looking at a shocked Shirou, he continued. \u201cRegrettably, she was not ready to take on the responsibility of heading the Matou. This is why I allowed Shinji to command Rider, since it would ease her burden while giving Shinji a chance to prove himself like always wanted. But alas, with their deaths, I am left without an heir to pass on my knowledge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou was saddened by the news of the Matou\u2019s fate. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir. I know losing Sakura and Shinji must hurt very deeply. If their is anything I can do to help-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine my boy. The Matou will live on in some manner, although to what extent I know not. I\u2019m sorry for wasting your time my boy. Thank you for at least humoring old man.\u201d With that Zouken, turned to walk back to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou, filled with regret and shame, muttered under his breath. \u201cIf only I could have saved Sakura, then I would have been able to save everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the boy who had stepped into his web, Zouken gave a mock look of intrigue. \u201cSave Sakura you say? Young man, such things are normally impossible. But with the Holy Grail, the revival of life is trifle as a wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou met Zouken\u2019s gaze. \u201cI would, but my servant Saber was lost to me. An enemy servant took control of her, and I have no allies to rely on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken strokes his chin in thought, tempting him further. \u201cThat would normally be true. But with another servant, you would at least stand a chance of reclaiming your true servant. And luckily for us, I happen to know of a way to provide you with said servant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou was surprised by that remark. \u201cBut how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear boy! The Matou, formerly Makiri, helped build the system that supports the Grail. My ancestor, Zolgen Makirir, left notes and his personal journal behind. Using this, I managed to save Rider, but at great cost. With the death of Sakura, the former bonds have affected her mind greatly. She is now closer to the Gorgon than she normally would be. But, if someone close to Sakura  were to guide her, there is still a chance of her avenging my dearly departed Sakura. But alas, I\u2019m too weak in my old age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou  immediately stepped up. \u201cI can do it sir. If you allow me to use her, I can use Rider to reclaim Saber. And then, I\u2019ll use my wish to revive Sakura for you. I swear it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken looked conflicted, but was cackling on the inside. \u201cI wish I could, but the only way to bond Rider is through the Matou family crest. And only my heir can receive it.\u201d Thinking on it, Zouken drew him in further. \u201cUnless I were to pass on the crest to you. But that would be asking too much of you, my dear boy,\u201d he mused, aware that Shirou was almost caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut sir, I would be more than willing! I know that magic crests are sacred to a family lineage, but at least let me try! If nothing is done, the servant Caster will win the war! And then, she\u2019d be free to reek havoc on the world with the Grail. I\u2019ll do anything you ask of me!\u201d Bowing his head, Shirou pleaded. \u201cPlease, just give me a chance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Zouken\u2019s plan was sealed. \u201cSo you wish to atone and save my granddaughter and Fuyuki from servant Caster, eh? Very well, young Shirou! The transplant you will undergo will be harrowing, but I will try. Come along, we can begin now if you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou followed the beckoning of the old man, unaware of the hell he\u2019d agreed too.</span></div></div>",

The Worms. Even if it was necessary to carry the Matou crest, Shirou felt nothing but pity for Sakura. The worms left no part of his body alone. Continuously feasting on mana and writhing in the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even thought that Zouken had been chuckling in the background. But it didn\u2019t matter. He endured as he had in the past. In order to be a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling my boy?\u201d Zouken inquired as he walked into the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve surprised me. The training has been known to consume those of ... questionable constitution. My poor son Kariya was one such case, and was consumed during the Fourth Grail War. But you, why you\u2019ve done exceedingly well so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou blinked as he processed what Zouken was implying. \u201cSo... Sakura went through all of this? Isn\u2019t their an easier way? I mean, I definitely feel different. But the worms... they\u2019ve been changing me? I don\u2019t feel like I used to. I can barely move, and the pain makes it hard to process things,\u201d Shirou admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSadly, it is the nature of Matou magecraft that we use the crest worms. In order to use our knowledge of familiars fully, we bond ourselves to the worms in order to practice our craft. The pain and changes that follow are the body adapting to better use the crest worms,\u201d Zouken explained while studying Shirou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zouken stared at his newest \u2018project\u2019 with pride. It was truly surprising the way the boy had adapted to the training. The discovery of Avalon and that untapped Reality Marble certainly helped stabilize him during his first few dips into the pit. It was necessary to integrate the worms he harvested from Sakura. Especially with the latter stages of his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut no matter. While you have done well to adapt to the worms, we must move on.\u201d Tapping his cane, Zouken released a pulse of mana. \u201cRider! It is time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the shadows was Rider. But, far different from what Shirou remembered. Her blindflood was completely destroyed, revealing pink reptilian eyes staring him down. The dress was ripped in several places, and her hands and feet looked closer to claws. \u201cSa...ku...ra,\u201d was what she growled out, seeing Shirou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou felt unnerved looking at the way Rider studied him. \u201cUmm, is she going to attack me? She looks like she\u2019s barely restraining herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken shrugged off the question. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The artificial command seals enforce the user\u2019s will over the servant. Horrible, but necessary. Now, let me see your hand.\u201d Shirou complied with Zouken\u2019s command, and a red light flashed as Zouken transferred control to him. Immediately, a brutal flair of pain ran through Shirou as Rider\u2019s bestial mind brushed against Shirou. She crouched low, looking to rip apart Zouken as her gaze met his. \u201cShirou! Control your servant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlaring his command seals, Shirou gave the order. \u201cRider! Do not attack Zouken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRider let loose a low growl, but complied as she stood back up. Remaining still, she silently awaited orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZouken took a moment to compose himself, having remembered the difficulty of breaking the servant and subsequent binding was. \u201cVery good. With Rider now under your command, you should be able to use her speed to ambush Caster and her master. With her now at full power, she is capable of combating that teacher easily enough while you use the worms to drain the prana of Caster. Should all succeed, you can reclaim Saber and maintain both servants with the excess prana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou nodded as he spoke. \u201cYes Zouken-san. I will not fail you.\u201d Motioning towards Rider, he pulled on his usual attire from the dresser. \u201cRider! Take me to the church!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant moved in a blur, picking Shirou up and zipping out the window into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Consider the story a mix of Fate Stay Night and Unlimited Blade Works.)</span></div></div>",

Rider set Shirou down a gently as she could manage. \u201c Rider, don\u2019t move from this spot until I order you. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired servant nodded, staring ahead at the abandoned building. \u201c...yes... my master,\u201d was the meek response. Taking spirit form, the fallen beast watched her new master walk away. Briefly seeing Sakura\u2019s form overtake Shirou\u2019s, she smiled as he walked into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Shirou quickly checked for any movement to indicate life. Finding nothing, he made his way to the door in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere a loud moan echoed throughout the building. Moving quickly, Shirou made his way to the bottom of the church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the sight that met him nearly broke him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding restrained in the middle of a circle was Saber. Held captive in the air, she was panting wildly as sweat cascaded down her face. A sweet scent drifted through the air, causing the crest worms to wriggle furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly screaming in pain, Shirou clamped down as the worms began releasing pheremones. Short hair immediately grew outward to the back of his neck. The face began to mature and shift as it took on a familiar face. Hair receded as his junk shrank, a small but noticeable pair of breasts pushed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on her again after the pain receded, he noticed something different about Saber. \u201cIs ... is she younger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcid yellow eyes brightened in glee as a familiar intensity overtook her. Liquid began to drip down the wedding dress of Saber, beckoning her release. As proved too much, she feared her head back in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaaaaassstterrrrr~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then slumped down as the high wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Shirou ____?</span></div></div>",

Getting only a moan in response, he snuck closer and called again. \u201cSaber!\u201d he whispered fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis finally got the attention of the ensnared Servant.

A purple haze began envelope his body, slowly overtaking his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake some solace in the fact you\u2019ll be Saber\u2019s master again. Just let go, and it will all be over,\u201d she whispered as her body began to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMAASS-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber was cut off as a purple and black blur sped by, a chain ripping through her neck. A crimson spray drenched the nearby area as Rider drank from the open wound, lapping up the excess prana of the newly deceased servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mental scream echoed through the area as Caster\u2019s concentration shattered, having witnessed the death of her coveted pet. Right as Shirou\u2019s prana finally spurred on the worms to do their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Caster was basically prana given a vague human form trying to overtake Shirou\u2019s body. The worms immediately latched on to the foreign prana and began to greedily consume the free meal. Shirou\u2019s magic circuits surged with energy as he nearly blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsuming the last of Saber\u2019s energy, Medusa watched as Shirou\u2019s body began to morph and shape as the worms further adapted their new host. Shirou\u2019s hair immediately grew to the small of his back, shifting as his spine arched and shifted. His body began to shrink as muscles and calloused skin grew soft and pale. The excess fat was either moved or consumed by the worms into their new homes. Pheromones released by the worms stimulated the creation of estrogen, fully circulating into the soon to be female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last vestiges of his manhood shifted and shrank as they were replaced by tubes and a womb. Breasts began to grow as fat filled and stimulated their growth, filling the shirt as valley of cleavage spilled out from the top. Hips flared as his new ass popped out of the pants, an hourglass figure that women would kill formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feral Rider grinned as the former Emiya took the form of the fallen Matou. \u201cSakkurraaa...\u201d she purred out in pleasure. Picking up her barely conscious Master, Rider raced off out the decrepit remains of the church to report to Zouken<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worms congealed into the form of a laughing old man. Glee painted his features as he had the worms assimilate the remains of Saber for future use. \u201cNow this is progress! I should have done this years ago. Now, I only need to deal with those annoying Tohsaka and priest, and all go according to plan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCackling, he returned to his work form as the colony scuttled to meet with his newest project.</span></div></div>",

Slashing Ruler Breaker down on Shirou, a scream and flash occurred as Shirou lost his second servant to Caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA load roar rocked the church as Rider came roaring to attack the two enemy servants.

The old mana was familiar to the sheath, it was the energy of a former host. The activation of the circle allowed the sheath to take the mana from the circle and heal the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou shuddered as the foreign energy from a decade ago slowly entered him, causing him to let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding. As his body and thoughts slowly relaxed, his mind wandered unwillingly to the white-haired girl he met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Illya...\" He muttered as his consciousness left him. How did he know her name? More importantly, he now knew that she was Kiritsugu's Daughter. If she was his daughter, then that obviously made her his sister right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen why did that feel wrong?</span></div></div>",

Kiritsugu's Saber, Your Saber, was ultimately defeated which made Tokiomi the last Master. Tokiomi was too injured for any healing magecraft and left the grail to his daughter Rin, instead he wished for the crippling and destruction of the families that had gotten in his way for the grail, The Einzbern Master and Matou master, Kariya, were killed and Kiritsugu was crippled by the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou' s mind was in overdrive.

All that death because he was a sore loser!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wish wasn't just to kill the Masters that conspired against him, but to cripple the families, that's why the Einzbern Master is so young, why you nor Rin knew I was a Magus, and why my Grandfather isn't the participant for this war. His Magecraft and my magical potential were damaged beyond repair from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou didn't know what to think or say. Could Tohsaka be trusted? Could Shinji?

The Familiars we use eat us from the inside out, draining our prana and causing unbearable pain. Sakura was to be the Matou Master but she simply couldnt bear anymore strain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis managed to break Shirou out of his stupor, \"Sakura is a Magus too?

The Einzbern, while victims, are selfish and would leave the others to rot and your father fought against the man who did this. You always had a habit of helping others and here you would prevent any future suffering for my family, for Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Shirou was speechless, but \"Shinji\" already knew his anwser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a anwser...Emiya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou looked up with a new resolve, to stop Rin, and Save everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinji, I accept your offer.\"</span></div></div>",

They had been willing to pay him, but he declined, saying that they didn't need to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was sweeping the room something red caught his eye.

His arms soothed with the rythem of his brushes along with the growth of his almost fully yellow hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou let out a light squeak as the \"bone of his sword\" became more like the \"bone of his dagger\" while it was enveloped in his new thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou had finished brushing and begans styling his hair while his chest gained mass, causing his back to arc. The muscle turned fat pooled into his rear and chest making Shirou to let out a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hair finished, he quickly trimmed his brows and applied makeup with the skill of someone who's always done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiraka looked at his nice cut brows and beautiful styled hair and once again put her hand to his cheek and giggled, ignoring the mass of cleavage that just tore open his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh... Rin would love this look. Rider better look out, Sakura will be a stuttering mess ah I can't wait to see them!\" he(?) said as his understanding of which timeline he was in was scrambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis painted fingers had slimmed along with his arms as he massaged his navel, which quickly shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...wha\" Shasaka said as what was left of his old memories made one last push against the Mirrors influence <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not human? well I am a... a Magus...but magical abilities are a given since I'm...\" Shasaka fumbled with his thoughts as his \" dagger\" was slowly sheathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... wait a Kitsune, I can't believe I forgot who I am!\" Sasaka said with realization as her dagger disappeared in her sheath. At the same time, Her massive chest and pillow behind had settled while her shirt and pants where ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sleep wear didn't survive the night, well I was about to change anyway\" She stated as she snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrained underwear and the scraps of a defeated shirt wrapped themselves over and formed a set of lacy lingerie to cover her important bits.
