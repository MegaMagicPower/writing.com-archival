        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">your a monster guardian in-training, as monsters are nearly extinct and overhunted by mankind.you shows up at the Taino Municipal Middle School one day as a new student, but the first thing the other students notice about you is that he perfectly matches the description of a murderer in that morning's newspaper\u2014which is completely correct; you had killed an exorcist the night before in defense of a werewolf<br>\r\nyou are half vampire- and half human. He seems to live in a mountainous area of Tokyo with his father (who is apparently staying temporarily)<br>\r\n. <br>\r\nPonta: He is a talking rabbit. He was charged by your father to raise you and help you earn his temporary guardian's license by killing three hundred exorcists<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArisaka Nao <br>\r\nShe is a typical, spoiled, beautiful girl. Incredibly narcissistic, she is pined for by almost every male (teachers included) in the school, and delights in crushing their hopes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNakamura Akiko <br>\r\nShe is Nao's best friend, and apparently has powerful brainwaves that can pick up the supernatural. She seems to suffer from anemia, and faints at times of high excitement. She eventually gains a strong friendship with Miko's ceremonial spirit, and can call him to her aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenken <br>\r\nHe is the werewolf you saved. He is caught by an exorcist eating a girl he had just killed, and would have died without your help. The exorcist later comes after you and Nao as a zombie. The werewolf appears and holds him still, commanding you to run them both through with your  weapons\u2014which he does without any hesitation, to the disgust of Nao and the exorcist. The shock of the werewolf's death transferred his soul to the exorcist's body. you dubs him \"Kenken-kun\" and he begins attending middle school with Nao and you (although the exorcist's body looks to be in its twenties). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYabe <br>\r\nHe is a ghost. He first appears hostile, as he goes to extremes to keep you from Nao. He lingered on because of his unrequited love for her. She eventually grants the desire keeping him from moving on\u2014acknowledging him as an equal being by calling his name. However, instead of going to heaven, he somehow returns to his human body and begins attending school again. He seems to have trouble holding onto his body, though; he is often killed again and barely manages to return to his flesh in time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour story write it<br>\r\n <br>\r\nhave fun</td>",
