            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I don't know how long I had slept, but when I finally opened my eyes it was already dark outside the window. I was still a little dizzy, hopping that me being a woman might just have been a bad dream. It wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat on my bed and observed the little, dark and aseptic hospital room. Quiet. I breathed deeply looking into the emptiness of that room. I tried not to think in what was going on. It still felt like a nightmare, but little by little every cell of this woman body confirmed to my brain what was its new reality, my new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes, breathed deeply and sighed. I looked down and for the very first time I observed my new self. It was different from that first sight I got at the mirror. This time I wasn't just observing the reflection of a beautiful woman in what seemed like a bizarre dream. I was looking at myself. Even if you don't believe me, what I noticed first wasn't my new breast (which felt very heavy by the way), but my new hands. So small, so delicate and feminine, the completely opposite of... my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came my new breast. I bet that if you had known me, when I was still Jonathan Dover, you would have thought that I instantly began to play with them as I used to play with those of all the women I had had in my hands. I'm sorry, but you are wrong. I touched them timidly. I was scared of them. I might had had a lot of them in my hands, but having then in my chest, feeling its weight, the touch of the hospital gown and even the gently but cold caress of the autumnal wind coming in by the open window was scaring. And it was worse when I felt the pressure and warmth of my new little hands over them. I was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me and eternity, with my hand over my breast, to accept this wasn't a dream. I shrugged over myself again and began to cry. But this time I didn't felt sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time passed and I finally calmed down. I was exhausted again, but when I was going to let me vanish into the ethereal world of the night. A nurse came into my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Is good you are final awake.\" The nurse greeted me from the door turning on the light. \"My name is Brittany Geller. I'll be your night nurse for a couple of days.\" She introduce herself. \"But you must be starving by now, don't you? It have been hours since the I.V. was removed.\" She smiled me while bringing in the food tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood quite observing her while she placed the tray over a moving table and approached it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you feeling, Ms. Sullivan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Ms. Sullivan? That's who I was now?&gt;&gt; I thought, not sure how to answer that question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany did a basic check up, temperature, pressure and other things I didn't put attention to, trying to order my ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll leave you now, Ms. Sullivan,\" she sighed by my silence, \"please try to eat a little before you go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood quiet until Brittany was about to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany...\" I finally said and my new voice scared me even more, the high pitch was so feminine that I was unable to digest that was my new voice for a time. However I didn't hesitated when she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had so many questions in my head, but I got blank at that last moment. \"Might you... tell me what's going on, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled to me and came in, happy of knowing that her patient wasn't sort of a \"zombie\" moving just by inertia. She approached a chair and sat by my bed's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you, but I need you to answer a few routine questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt;Questions?! I'm the one with questions here!!&gt;&gt; I thought and it was obvious that Brittany noticed my anxiousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but you had a brain, miss.\" She began. \"So please just answer me honestly so I can began to explain what happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed resigned. \"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Brittany smiled me comforting. \"Well then, might you tell me your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Sullivan.\" I answered sarcastically tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, miss. I need honest answers so can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood quiet unsure of what to do. &lt;&lt;Might she think I'm crazy? Or maybe just confused by surgery she just mentioned?&gt;&gt; I didn't know. However I was smart enough to understand that there was no way for a man like me to play the part of a woman like the one Ms. Sullivan was. I sighed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan Dover\" I mumbled prepared for many different reactions, except that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't be more confused about the situation. &lt;&lt;I just said my name was that of a man in a highly feminine mumble and you are just going to continue? Are you kidding me?&gt;&gt; Many things passed by my head in that instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" She asked observing my shocked expression. \"Do you remember how old are you, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you my name is Jonathan Dover!\" I exploited. \"I am a man,\" I yelled pressing my chest, trying to ignored the breast my hands was pressing remembering that those were mine now, \"I am a 27 seven years old single male publicist!\" I couldn't help it and started to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hand on my shoulder and I gripped to her uniform and cried myself over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know how long it took me to calm again. But having Brittany there came to be a life saver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late when my nurse gave a little pill to help me sleep and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night passed leaving behind the darkness of my awakening, but with the light of the new day just marked the beginning of my new life.</span></div></div>",

Don't misunderstand me, I wasn't that of a lone wolf (obviously), but my new circumstances were so overwhelming that having a time alone to accept them was... divine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning I met Esther, my morning nurse. I didn't ask when I first met her, but I get to know that she came to the States from Venezuela when she was young, she has two children and her late husband died at Afghanistan... I didn't go deeper. And also a felt a little awkward by the fact that, somehow, I felt more connected to Esther because of her motherly treat than with Brittany, a young and friendly nurse in her last year of training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight I had been already getting in synchrony with my new self? I don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning passed and so the afternoon arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI met a third nurse then, Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won't deny that it was an unexpected surprise to discover that my third nurse was as young as Brittany but at the same time her complete opposite... I can't think in a better way to describe her, and maybe trying to do it would be kind of disrespect full to one of those who helped me so much at that time; she was a gothic girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days passed like that and the only thing I discovered by my conversations with the nurses, since the few doctors that came in seemed so busy to pay attention to anything else that the chart at my bed's, that I had a extremely complicated and sort of rare brain surgery; thought non of them new the complete details all of them were warned that I wouldn't act as the woman I was supposed to be, but also that they should treat me as woman I look like. That part drove me nuts... And I suspect that was the reason the doctors were ignoring me; since it wasn't until I began to react calmed, in a sort of acceptance, at my new condition, that I got finally a doctors attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the night of the third day when I met Dr. Marcus Lankaster. At first he just observed me and began a conversation in a way that he could determine if I was in my five senses. After what he explained me roughly what the experimental surgery did, and suddenly everything have sense... even though it sound as crazy as any spy fi move I have seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&lt; A brain transplant! &gt;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood quiet in shock. The doctor gave me time to process the news, but when a light of hope born inside of me, Dr Lankaster crushed it instantly with a single closing line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how we performed the miracle that save your life Ms. Sullivan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Sullivan?\" I asked confuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you are Elisabeth Sullivan, miss.\" Dr. Lankaster stated without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But I'm not Elisabeth Sullivan, I'm Jonathan Dover.\" I replied with a begging tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Marcus sighed looking for the smoothest way to tell me the true of my new reality. But there wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to tell you this: The brain transplant is still a highly complicated procedure with just a 7% of success. That's one of the main reason it is still not public that it can be done. Second, because of the secrecy of the same, there's no way we can support a real way to prove your pass identity, Ms. Sullivan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat worlds resounded at my head as a dead sentence. \"Is there nothing you can do? really?\" I said about to cry begging for a little light of hope. A grabbed by breasts and looked into the doctor's eyes. \"I can't be a woman.\" I broke. \"I'm a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" He sighed. \"I wish a could help you to return to your previous self, but the true is that even if we used the DNA of your brain to prove who you were, everything else in you says that you are a Elisabeth Sullivan, a 25 years old housewife... wife of Michael Sullivan and mother of two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it. I wasn't Jonathan Dover anymore.</span></div></div>",

The doctor told me that the reason I could control my emotions was because my male brain was being flooded by the female hormones of body and once my brain had gotten habituated I'll be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this are so...\" I said squeezing my breast feeling the ache of their sensibility. \"And this...!\" I said placing my hand in the emptiness of my crotch, feeling the subtle movement of the gown as a serious stimulation that broke me in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's normal. Your brain don't recognize your female attributes.\" He explained. \"What you are experiencing is quite similar to a normal girl's puberty. The only reason you feel it so intense is because both our brain and body are fully developed, but aren't in sync. But don't worry, you will feel better on a couple of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't instantly, but I must accept that three weeks was faster than what I had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was finally in some control and made my decision: Meet my new family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you are ready?\" Dr. McDonald asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll meet then sooner or later, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I'll prepare the meeting for tomorrow, Ms. Sullivan\" She smiled me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Sylvia McDonald was a really kind person. 53 years old and still in an enviable shape, she was my psychiatrist. It should had been expected that after such a transformation the people in charge wouldn't let me pass by this alone by myself. Dr. McDonald was and specialist in sexual psychology specialized in all sort of sexual disorders and mine was quite an interesting one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know the whole story about my transplant. As Dr. Lankaster instructed me, Sylvia had been told that I had a brain surgery which resulted in a dramatically memory distortion. It was an simple, but extremely believable lie, in comparison to the sci-fi material that was my reality now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lankaster warned me, but I still tried to make Dr. McDonald believe me. Great mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first week of therapy as a nightmare. With my emotions and body sensations reaching its peek, I was a hardcore lunatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't remember the details of that week sessions. But after that week I finally talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be a woman, even less a mom...\" I was saying, \"but somehow, I think, I'm getting used to this.\" I said caressing my arms, thighs, lips... even squeezing my breast. \"I even fell... pleasure.\" I said blushing ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Sullivan,\" Sylvia began, \"what you are experimenting now is a second Phallic stage in your psychosexual development.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phallic? But I don't have a penis now\" I said as a confused child still touching myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though it is call Phallic, it is not just about the male genitalia, but both male and female.\" She explained me. \"The Phallic Stage is the period in the development of a child when he or she,\" she pointed me, \"discovers his or hers genitals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know about genitals.\" I began still overwhelmed by the feeling of my body. \"I'm an adult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are an adult. But... how do I put it? Your brain is reseting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reseting?!\" I said scared. \"What does that mean?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you awoke you said you were a man, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...\" I assented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" She sighed. \"You also told me that your body wasn't yours, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how does it felt now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it aches.\" I began. \"But not that much than early, it's felt more...\" My eyes widely opened.\" It felt natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Dr. McDonald stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It simple, you, your brain, is recognizing your body. In other words, you have finally stopped rejecting yourself and embracing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that now, but in little time you will be as conformable in your body as any women is one hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite an ironic statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hold month passed since I woke up. Two weeks passed since my Phallic Stage Crisis. But it was time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still completely against of becoming Elisabeth Sullivan, but I was a little more open to see myself a Jonathan Dover, the woman; or more precisely, Jeanette Dover, as I began to call myself at the sessions with the psychiatrist at my third week as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night passed faster than what I would like it. I barely could sleep. I was nervous, but it was time to meet them.</span></div></div>",

He began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was serious, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I still want the opportunity to be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked in another direction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it, but I can't promise something like that.\" I said moved. \"Even if I look and maybe resemble Elisabeth in my movements and expression... I'm not Elisabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not asking you to be Elisabeth. You and the doctors were pretty clear in that subject, but I don't want you to be alone in such a transition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" I said and asked him to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what have you think?\" Dr. McDonald asked later in our weekly session \"Are you going to accept his offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I wondered if what scares me the most is if I'm becoming Elisabeth or if I'm stilling her life do to fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is compressible.\" Sylvia comforted me. \"But in a week you'll be discharged from the hospital and need a place to go.\" She pointed the reality of my situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" I repeated sighing, \"but he was right in one thing. I can't do this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is right.\" She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time paused and I gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to tell him my decision tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McDonald took my hand and put her hand over my shoulder to give me courage to do the right thing.</span></div></div>",

I remembered being run off the road I answered after that the only memory was of someone asking if I wanted live. That was me another doctor answered. \"The body you know have is that of Nichole Wilkerson. You may have heard of her family\", the doctor goes on to explain. Of course you've heard of them. They own half the town. He the say, \"Nichole was born with a heart defect and needed a new heart. Then you came along after your accident. You were a perfect match. Unfortunately when we were prepping Nichole there was a problem. She had an aneurysm which caused immediate brain death. So in addition to your heart we transplanted your brain\". I didn't even believe such things were possible, but I was proof. As the reality of happened began to sink in I yelled, \"This is insane. Put me back in my body now\"! They then looked at each othe and one of them said, \"Mr. Dover, your body did not survive the accident and even if it had and your brain was still in it you would have lost both legs and one arm. It wouldn't have mattered if you hadn't though because your spinal cord was damaged. It was a miracle you made it to the hospital. Mr. Dover for all intent is dead\".  The another doctor chimed in saying, \"Mr. Dover you've been given a second chance. You died, but we brought you back. All you have to do is live you life as Nichole. Her family doesn't know and we've told them that memory loss is to be expected. Will you play along\"? I couldn't belive what they were asking me to do, spend the rest of my life as a hot spoiled rich bitch. Of course I said.....</span></div></div>",

My real parents died when I was a baby\", I snapped back. This has always been a sore subject for me. The doctor then leaned forward and said, \"You should know then that was a lie. There is a reason you were a perfect match for Nichole. She's your sister. The genetic tests do not lie\". That news hit me like, well a truck. \"My parents are alive and they gave me up\", you mutter as your mind fills with questions? The doctor then says, \"Judging by your age and the records I've managed to access I'd say you were born when your parents were still in high school. I can only guess that to avoid scandle they gave you up. This is your chance though to find out the truth, or perhaps have the live you should have had\". I knew this doctor was attempting to manipulate me. He found my sore spot I'd hidden for years. God knoes I knew a con. I lied my way into the pants of plenty of girls.

My parents came and visited several times while I was in the hospital. I wanted to ask them so many questions each time. Why did they give me up being the main one, but I played along as the doctors had asked. I was Nichole Wilkerson now and had memory loss because of the operation. My parents helped the deception just by chance. They brought in albums of pictures trying to jar my memory. I studied and soon was able to play the part. Whenever something I didn't know came up I blame the operation.<br>\r\n  I had s mix of emotions about it. When we arrived home I couldn't help but think how different my life would have been if they hadn't given me up. As Nichole I wanted for nothing. In my old life I struggled for everthing I had.

Again I dreamed that I was back to my old self and this had all been a dream. The body that I now have is great. It's got all the right curves and I could easily make a living off of it in many different industries. Other men if in my situation would probably spend hours playing with themselves. The female body for me is not a mystery. I never had a problem picking women up if I felt the need. Only then I could leave before any of the unplesent things about the female body could arise. None of that means that at times I didn't pleasure myself. After all this body has needs as well. This was one of those mornings. I started the shower and then stripped down watching myself in the mirror as I did it. When I first started giving in to the needs of this body I imagined making love to the girl staring back to me and me playing role of the man. As the weeks passed by I have found myself imagining myself in the role of the woman. Imagining a hard cock shoved into my tight little pussy. It felt dirty at first and even gay, but the orgasms were so much more intense. I stepped into the shower and got started. As I ran my hands over my body examining every curve I imagined that it was the hands of my lover. Knowing the importance of warming up the female body I didn't rush it. The pay off is so much better. After several minutes cha-ching. It felt so good but not as good as before. What my new body really wanted was the real thing. I didn't think I was up to that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As I stepped out I decided today was the day I would confront my parents about why they gave me up. The question was how to do it. Should I tell them the truth, or continue playing Nichole and come up with a story. </span></div></div>",

I missed my old life, instead of the pizza and shakes I now got to eat vegetables. But to my surprise they didn't taste that bad, it was like being in Elly's body made my taste buds change. After that we did the dishes and watched some television. At first I was annoyed that she didn't let me watch an action movie that was playing and then the most weird thing happened. After a while my mother decided it was bed time, I was annoyed for it. First of all I didn't feel asleep and second I didn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to.\" I whined as I stood in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elly, you have been in hospital for three weeks. I'm sure you haven't been sleeping as well as usual. You need the sleep to become a big girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am a big girl.\" I whined again. And then it happened. I'm still not sure what happened but then it was like my body was taken over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just five more minutes mom.\" I asked her. I felt how I opened my eyes more to plead with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems Elly did this often and my mother told me to sit next to her again, but only for five more minutes. I automatically sat next to her, resting my head on her shoulder. I was still in shock at what happened, was there still some part of Elly inside me? Was it some kind of automatic reaction that made me do it. I wasn't sure, but I needed some time to think about it. So after five more minutes I stood up and got dressed for sleeping. I just put on the pajama top and bottoms. The training bra was still on, but I wasn't in the mood to take it off. Lying in Elly's bed I was sure it was just something Elly's brain made me do. No biggie. Tomorrow would be a whole new day. And with that I went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext morning however was something I could never imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up the next morning I felt different than usual. Not the different being a girl kind of thing, but just different. I opened my eyes and jumped out of bed. But the strange thing was that I didn't do it. I felt how my hands opened the curtains and I was jumping around, feeling happy for some reason. It was like I was locked out for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"La,la,la.\" I heard my voice singing to some catchy tune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going on? I asked myself in my mind and suddenly my body stood silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is anybody there?\" I suddenly heard myself asking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hearing me?\" I asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is there? Show yourself or I'll tell my mom.\" Elly shouted. Out of instinct I covered my mouth and to my surprise my right hand was in front of my mouth. I suddenly felt panic emanating from my body. Elly tried to shout again, but I kept her mouth from screaming. I let go when she suddenly bit me. Her own hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Mom!\" She shouted as she tried to leave the room. Not wanting to involve Elly's mom with this, I tried to take control of her legs and suddenly we were are sprawled out on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elly? Is something wrong?\" I suddenly heard Elly's mom asking through the door. I knew I needed to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing mom, just a nightmare.\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well go to sleep again.\" She told me and she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt how my body sat upright, looking around scared. I realized I needed to explain all of this to Ellie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Elly, I'm Jonathon Dover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you? Why are you hiding yourself from me?\" Elly asked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hiding from you. I am inside your body.\" I told Elly raising my right hand. I then told Elly about what happened with her and with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was finished with my story, Elly was just silent. \"So, you and me are together forever?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever and ever.\" I replied. Elly then began crying as I could feel the tears pouring down my cheeks. I couldn't help myself from crying as well. Here I was, alive but sharing a body with twelve year old girl. I didn't want any of this, if I knew about this, I would have the doctors end my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Elly cried for a while until I felt her hands rubbing away her cheeks. \"We-We shouldn't think all stupid like that, should we? I mean we need to think happy thoughts as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" I asked Ellie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're alive. I mean if your brain wasn't put inside my head, I would be dead as well.\" Elly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides you will be always with me. I'll always have a friend with me.\" Elly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend?\" I asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a friend.\" Elly said suddenly raising her hand in front of my face. \"Nice to meet you Jonathan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled as well. How fast children could adapt to such strange situations. Perhaps I could learn something from Elly's spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Elly.\" I said using the other hand to grab Elly's hand and we shook each other's hands. Which was impossible to do, so we just held each others hands.</span></div></div>",

After all we couldn't stay inside Elly's pajama's forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so we take the bottom first?\" She asked me. I confirmed with her and grabbed with Elly's right hand the waistband while she did the same with the left hand. We then both pulled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, we can do this.\" Elly said cheerful as we stepped outside of the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it seems so.\" I said still a little hesitant. We then pulled the upper part of the pajama over our head and Elly threw it to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElly was only standing in her training bra and panties; a sight I didn't want to look at. In the past I always admired women in their underwear, but that was with women well above Elly's age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was already heading towards Elly's dresser when Elly stopped. \"Wait, we have to pull off my underwear too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do we have to? I mean it's only been two days since I got it.\" I asked hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Eeuh, that's gross. We have to get changed, mommy's always telling me to do that.\" Elly complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElly was right, but still I didn't want to. I felt like I was a pervert or something like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before I could do anything, somehow Elly got control of her right arm and pulled off her training bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's much better.\" Elly said with a carefree smile. Me, on the other hand was freaking out. Trying not to look at the naked body that was underneath me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow though Elly figured something was up with me. \"Jonathan, is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in a split. What to do? Tell Elly about my problem I'm facing or just brush it off.</span></div></div>",

To your surprise however Elly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan, it's your body now too. You're weird. Here, you can feel it.\" She said suddenly putting the hand that I was controlling on top of her breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt rather awkward with Elly next to me to touch my or our breast. But since Elly didn't seem to mind I grabbed hold of it and slightly began to rub it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, how do you know this?\" Elly said after a while like she didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a lot of experience.\" I told her truthfully though this was the first time I knew for certain it felt good. \"Wait till you or us grow older.\" I told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\" She asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll tell you then.\" I decided not to give a 12 year old too much information about the pleasures the female body could give. \"Let's get dressed.\" We put on her panties and training bra and then discusses what to wear next. Elly wanted to wear a dress while I'd rather wear something more tomboyish. But after my talk with Elly about how to view her body I decided to relax more so I reluctantly agreed to wearing a dress. Elly pulled one out of her closet, one with a lot of flowers on it. We put it on and I had to admit it felt nice and comfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElly and me then went to the kitchen where Elly's mom was making breakfast. She was surprised to see us wearing the dress after yesterday but she probably thought Elly had one of those days. She then made us eat breakfast which to my surprise was all Elly's doing. I was still deep in thought and without me knowing Elly had used both arms to eat her breakfast. Only when I took control back I felt a little twitching in her right arm and could use it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fair.\" Elly said in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, relax. I'll give you back your control.\" I told her and with that she could use her whole body again. After breakfast was over, what do you think happened next?</span></div></div>",

But from now on,  you ARE 12 year old Samantha Quin.  You are in her body so now you'll have to live her life. \" <br>\r\nI looked down at my new body.  I still didn't like the fact that i'm a girl now. \" Why am i in this body? \"  i asked as i looked at the doctor.  <br>\r\n\" Samantha and you came in at the same time.  Samantha was brain dead by the time she arived at operating room,  but her body was kept alive.  Your body was a mess when you came in, 80% of your bones were broken,  your ribs had punctured your lungs,  your spinal cord was heavily damaged. You wouldn't last a day.  But luckily your brain was fully intact.  So we decided to do an experimental treatment,  brain transplantation.  And as you can see it was a succes,  this time. \"<br>\r\n\" this time? \"<br>\r\n\" yes,  we've lost patients during brain transplants,  it is a very difficult and risky treatment. For now there is a 30% chance a brain transplantation will be successful. So even if we could do another transplantation and out you in a male body,  chances you would survive that operation are low. \"<br>\r\nI look down at my body again.\" i guess i should just be lucky to be alive. \" i thought to myself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Okay doc,  i feel fine. I'll live my new life as Samantha. \" i said as i looked back up at him. <br>\r\n\" great,  you're result are good,  nothing's wrong.  So you can go to your new home tomorrow,  i'll call your parents. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the next day i met my new family.  The doctor told them that i was suffering from amnesia and might not recognize them. And that they should help me\" remembering\". But he also said there was a chance that i might never remember. <br>\r\n\"Do you know who i am? \" a woman, i thought was probably 35-40 years old, asked me. <br>\r\n\" Are you my mommy? \" i asked.<br>\r\n\"oh how terrible,  she doesn't even know her own mother.\"  she cried as she hugged me.  \"yes i am your mother.  Don't worry dear,  your whole family will help you remember.\"<br>\r\n\"i'm sorry.\"  my new mother cried as she left the room.  You see the man,  who you think is your new father,  go after her.  <br>\r\nA teenage girl,  probably 16 and a small boy,  probably 8, are left.  The teenage girl walks over to you and gives you a hug. \"i'll do anything to make you remember us,  lil sis.  Hey Tom,  come here,  why don't you say something to Sam?\"<br>\r\nThe little boy comes over to you and stands next to your new older sister. \" will you play with me like always? \"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Tom,  i don't remember how we used to play,  but sure,  i will play with you.  Even if i don't remember,  i'm sure we can still have fun,  maybe playing some video games or something.\"<br>\r\n\" ow yeah,  mom has brought you some clothes. \" your new older sister said.\" i'll get them for you. \"<br>\r\n\" Sis,  wait!\" i said as i tried to reach for her.  \"what is it,  sam?\" <br>\r\n\"what is your name? I can't keep calling you sis. And i can't remember it yet. \"<br>\r\n\" Rosemary\" she said as she grabbed a bag. <br>\r\n\"Rosemary,  huh?   i'm happy to have you as my sister\"<br>\r\n\"thanks sis,  here are your clothes. \" she said as she gave me the bag and hugged me. \" come on Tom,  let's give her some privacy. \"<br>\r\nI took the clothes out of the bag and took a look.  I found a small pink A cup bra,  matching panties,  pink top,  white skirt,  knee length socks and pink all stars.  I didn't want to wear a skirt,  but there was nothing else in the bag and i guess i have to learn to wear one some day,  might as well wear one my first day out of the hospital.  <br>\r\nI got out of bed and got dressed.  It felt weird to wear a skirt,  but not really unpleasant.  As i sat down on the bed,  my new family and the doctor came in.  \"oh i see you're already changed,  good. Well i wish you all the best,\"  the doctor said as he gave everyone a hand.  I followed my new family to the car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got home,  my parents showed me my room.  And to my surprise and joy,  it wasn't a girly girl's room.  On the wall were posters of anime and games. On the desk was a laptop and figures from anime,  movies and games.  And there were two big closets,  one filled with normal clothes and one almost empty except for 4 cosplay costumes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI locked my door and sat down behind my desk and booted up my laptop.  I found a lot of games and anime on it and also a lot of pictures of Samantha before i got her body. I opened up her web browser and saw she hadn't cleared her history.  I took a look at her history and to my amazement i found some pornsites in her history.  But i was probably the same age when i started looking at pornsites.  I clicked on one of the links and saw it was gay porn.  I thought i would be disgusted by it,  but i actually got turned on by it.  I could feel myself getting wet between my legs.  I put my hands between my legs and started rubbing my new pussy through my wet panties.  I pulled my panties to the side and put 2 fingers in my pussy as i began to finger myself.  I never felt anything like that before.  I never thought it'd feel that good.  <br>\r\nAfter i got my first female orgasm i closed the pornsite and cleared the history.  </span></div></div>",
