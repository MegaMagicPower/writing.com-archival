Rubbing your eyes to try and see again, you look around and realise you have shrunk! You were just about two to three inches tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for you to start panicking, between being tiny and your mother nowhere in sight. You looked around for her but instead you saw a big sky scaper building a block ahead with three bright letters on it, a L, a U and a X. Curious and hoping maybe they could help, you make your way towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, you almost regretted it, people were everywhere, dancing away to some music, bright lights flashed around and you were almost stepped on numerous times! How were you going to get help in here? </span></div></div>",

Thanks to the park's anti-squishing technology, the giant hosts are incapable of causing harm to the small, wealthy guests who want an adventure of a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the miniaturization process, your adventure begins on a platform outside of the Mariposa Saloon. You look up in awe as the giants cross down the road, oblivious to the loading zone where you can get off to enter the humongous building. Their huge boots crash onto the dirt, sending clouds of dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God for that anti-squishing fail safe! you think to yourself. Now, how about some well earned fun? You have a map of the whole park as well as the names of certain hosts (characters) highlighted to activate their quests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive silhouette is above the loading platform, you recognize her instantly. This could be a great first quest to get accustomed to the park...</span></div></div>",
