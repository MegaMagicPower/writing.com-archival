Will you find help...or be the pokemons helpless toy/plaything..or get crushed trying to find help? Find out in this awesome new interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill give GP's for every chapter someones writes, really need people making chapters with me, it takes so long to write chapters now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: no 1 line chapters unless it's for choice making at the beginning.<br>\r\n            Try to make it at least readable, i know i'm not best with grammar but it'll help out the readers knowing what's going on when it's more readable to them, then by seeing \"i luv yu pl b ther3 for 3\".<br>\r\nTry not to kill of the character quick, he or she is extremely tolerant to pain and mostly likely cannot die, but if you wish to have a death scene..then build it up first before killing the pathway :}.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther then that, have fun and write any kinks you want in this chapter, go all out! I have no limits.<br>\r\n</td>",
