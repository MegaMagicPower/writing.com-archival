As he placed his hand on the doorknob, he called out, \"I'm sorry, but office hours don't begin for another while.  Unless it is an emergency, please come back later.\"  There was a muffled reply from the other side of the door, but Dave couldn't make it out.  He stood there a while longer with his hand on the knob, listening.  A shuffling sound came from the other side of the door, followed by a sudden thunk, startling Dave.  He stepped backward and glanced behind him at the phone.  The night security would still be in, but how much help truly is a man with a flashlight when you're in danger?  Another sharp rap at the door caused him to jump.  \"As I said before, business hours haven't started y....\"<br>\r\n  \"Dude!\" The surfer term split the air and Dave suddenly felt the overwhelming urge to laugh. \"Dude! I'm just hear to drop off a package and they wouldn't take it at the desk downstairs, so they directed me here.\"  Giving into the urge, Dave chuckled as he made his way to the door and opened it to a skinny young man dressed in a brown shirt and shorts.  In front of him lay a large package. Dave laughed once more.<br>\r\n  \"Sorry 'bout that.  I'm not usually at work at this time, so....\" With a disgruntled look, the young man shoved a clipboard and pen into Dave's hands.<br>\r\n  \"It's cool, man.  Just sign, I gotta get back to work myself.\"  Dave did as he was told and returned to clipboard; and with a wave, the delivery boy disappeared off down the hall, leaving Dave to ponder the large package he had left behind.</span></div></div>",

Dave notices the package is addressed for Jack. The package is odd, even for Jack. Dave is accustomed to the odd packages that enter and exit his college. This being the College of Technology he is used to extremely strange deliveries, but this one gives Dave pause and he stares at the package for a few moments drawn into a hazy daydream state before snapping back to reality and returning to his chair to face the computer screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave scrolls though his email looking for any work requests he may have missed or newsletter subscriptions that might catch his interest, anything to break up the boredom and monotony the next eight and half hours will bring. Just as Dave opens a newsletter he hears voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be after 9:00 am. People are showing up, \" Dave mutters to himself as he glances at the clock. The clock reads 8:50 am. The voices stop. Dave gets up, opens his door to look down the hallways, and sees no one. Just as he turns to enter his office he hears the voices again. Dave wheels around to scan the hallways once more. No one. \"The ghosts of angry students I guess, \" Dave says as he closes to door and returns to his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shivering chill shakes Dave's nerves as he sits in his chair. He quickly looks at the odd package in the corner. He feels a warmth radiating from the package and the voices return. As Dave stares at the package. His vision of the package blurs. He looks at the picture on the wall above the package to test his vision. The picture is perfectly clear, but as he glances down the package remains blurry. The voices are louder now, Dave can hear them a little more clearly now, but cannot make out the words to the pleasing and melodic sound. The voices are singing and chanting repeating the same sequence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave has lost himself in staring at this odd package. He is aware how chillingly cold his body feels and the feeling of warmth radiating from the package falling over his face as he stares at the package. He is drawn to the package, and he is afraid of it at the same time. He ...</span></div></div>",
