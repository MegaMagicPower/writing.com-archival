            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning came. Simon honestly wished it hadn't. His head ached from the booze and the length of the night before. Henry always had known how to party, and his years at college had not put a damper on that. Loud music, alcohol, attractive woman... not a terrible way to end the summer. But, no matter how Simon looked at it, it read the same to him. Summer was over. He was a college student now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the sleep from his eyes and got out of Henry's sofa. Stepping around empty beer bottles and bodily fluids scattered on the floor, he makes his way to the bathroom, and undoing his pants, relieves himself from the water forcefully drained from his body. Getting ready to shower, he pulls back the curtain, only to find Henry passed out in the tub. Simon sighs, and turns on the water. Miraculously, it still takes Henry a while to get up. \"Wha'dda you...\" he mumbles, seemingly still a little drunk from the night before. Noticing he's getting wet, he quickly gets up and out of the shower, nearly tripping over the curtain as he does so. \"Whad da fuck man.\" he belts at you, obviously irritated. \"You stink and needed it.\" Simon replies emotionlessly, still trying to shake the grogginess off of him. \"Now get out, I got a shower to take.\" Henry stares at Simon for a second, processing what he had said in his foggy mental state, before complying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his shower, Simon felt a lot better, his thoughts; clear, his mind; alert, his body; ready. Dressing, he comes out to the kitchen, where he finds Henry still wearing his wet clothes from before, gripping a newly opened beer in his hand. \"You do know classes start today, right?\" Simon asks Henry quizzically. \"You do know nothing is ever covered in the first day of class anyways?\" Henry replies, mocking his tone. \"But hey,\" he continues, \"If you want to waste your time, go right ahead. What class is mister Bachelor of science up for anyways?\" Simon thinks for a second, and for some ungodly reason, it will not come to him, as if the party from the night before erased all information about school from his mind. He pulls out his schedule...</span></div></div>",

I'll never understand what you see in those numbers and junk.\" \"It's not that I really enjoy it.\" Simon responds, almost defensively, \"It's just required for my major is all.\" \"Yeah, yeah, I get it. What I don't get is why you had to schedule it so early.\" Henry's speech is slightly slurred. \"I told you to avoid classes before ten.\" \"Only way it would fit in my schedule.\" Simon replies. \"Nothing I could do.\" \"Well mister 'number muncher',\" Henry smirks at his own joke. \"If you're gonna go to class, you're gonna want to be leaving now. Living off campus has it's perks - but short commute times ain't one of them.\" Simon looks at his campus map, and realizes Henry is right. He quickly gets outside, and begins his 15 minute walk to campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting lost for about 5 minutes, Simon realizes there's no way he's going to get to class on time. By the time he finds the room, he's already 10 minutes late. It's a large lecture hall, so the teacher doesn't seem to mind. What Simon is surprised about however, is just how full the lecture is. There's only one seat left. Simon quickly takes it, and begins to try to pay attention to class... however, Simon quickly realizes Henry was right. The teacher is talking about the required books and grading scale, all information that is available online. Simon decides that now is a good a time as any to try to strike up some conversation - lest he go out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting to the left of him is a fairly tall and athletic looking girl of African descent, with short black hair and grayish eyes on her stunning face. She doesn't have much as far as breasts go, but Simon notices that the ass she's sitting on elevates her way up on her seat. And while her bright pink tank top didn't reveal much, her pink booty shorts clearly show her long, dark legs, and her pink flip flops show off her long toes painted a bright and neon pink. She doesn't seem to be paying Simon any mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting to his right, is a very short Asian girl. She had black hair down to her shoulders and brown eyes. as well as a slight acne problem, which was unsurprising, but what did surprise Simon was her very large breasts, concealed under a sweat shirt much too warm for the current weather. Her small legs were covered in loose jeans, and her equally small feet were covered in skateboard shoes. She, unlike the other girl, had definitely noticed Simon, and had scooted as far away from him as she could go, nearly sitting out in the aisle. She nervously glanced at Simon every few minutes.</span></div></div>",

He decides to go with the obvious. \"Hey. bet you ten bucks if I can guess you're favorite color.\" The girl looks over at him and forces a little smile. \"Ten bucks says you'd guess wrong.\" Simon smiles back, \"Oh, so it's not pink then? Could have fooled me.\" \"Yeah, it's for volleyball.\" she explains. \"New members on the team are put through all kinds of shit, this is just one of the more silly ones... though they are really strict about it.\" \"How can you be strict about wearing pink?\" Simon asks. The girl just rolls her eyes. \"They check everything. and I mean that.\" Examining her more closely, Simon notices that even the earrings she has in are inset with a cheap looking pink gem, and the bra slightly sticking out of her tank top was also a shade of pink. \"Oh. wow. What happens if you forget something?\" Simon wonders out loud. The girl gives another forced little smile. \"Trust me, you don't want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon decides to change the subject. \"So... volleyball you said?\" \"Yeah, I've played since I was young.\" the woman explains, \"Team here  is actually pretty good, so I'm really excited to get on it, yanno? Can't wait for practice after this class.\" Simon scratches his brain for a second, trying to remember things about the volleyball team. Eventually it comes to him. \"Oh yeah, they won some college championship last year, right?\" he asks. She shakes her head. \"Second, actually, but now that they got me on the team, winning this year should be fairly simple.\" Simon gives off a slight light laugh. \"Right. Now that they have you... what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" She says, \"I'm Candice. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talk for a while longer, about various things. Simon learns that Candice is an education major, going into mathematics, has a chihuahua named Skipper, but most of all, he learns how much she loves playing volleyball. No matter what they talked about, the subject continued coming back around time and time again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Simon.\" Candice eventually says. \"Thanks for making this class less of a drag. I thought I was going to die.\" Shortly after she finishes, students start to get up from their chairs. \"Looks like the teacher's letting us out early today. Thank god.\" Candice smiles. \"You seem... well, decent at least. Come watch us practice sometime, maybe try to scare away some of the pervs that always seem to show up to open practices.\" both of them get up from their seats. Simon notes that she's almost exactly the same height as he is. \"I'll consider it.\" Simon says. \"See you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looks at his schedule and finds that he has about an hour to kill before his next class.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nWell, Candice did seem like a nice enough girl to him, and frankly, Simon didn't have anything else better to do. So he decided that he'd stop by and check out what the girl seemed to enjoy so much. Not knowing the campus well, it took Simon some time before he found his way to the gym that Candice was talking about, and it seemed that practice was underway. There was about thirty girls, most of them rather tall. there were two nets set up next to each other, spanning the gym longways, and from what Simon could gather, there were two scrimmage games going on. The first seemed pretty standard, both teams were fairly even in score, but the other one was a bit different. First of all, all six girls on one side of the next were all in bright pink clothes. Secondly, the score was incredibly imbalanced, reading 12-3, favoring the non-matching other side. He picked Candice out of the six playing in pink, and thought about waving, but decided against it, and went over to the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had sat down, the non-pinks had scored again, making the score 13-3. He examined both teams. The hot pink side had a wide range of heighted girls, One was a few inches taller than Candice, and from her there was a girl with a height two inches smaller than the last down to around 5'4\". The other side, the heights were less of a spread. 4 out of the 6 girls were at least a few inches taller than Candice, Simon estimated the tallest was around 6'7\". Out of the other two, one of the girls was about two inches shorter than Candice, the other, surprisingly, was only about 5'0\" even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next serve started from the non-pink side, and the pinks managed to bump and set the ball fairly easily, leaving Candice to spike it over the net. She hits it clean, but the two tallest girls on the other side of the next seemingly effortlessly jump up and return the ball back to her side, bouncing off of her arm and out of bounds, bring the score to 14-3. Non-pink gets the ball and serves it again for the game point. The pinks, once again, bump and set the serve for the girl slightly taller than Candice to serve, but she fakes the  hit, and instead the ball goes flying past her to Candice, who spikes it over the net. The two taller girls who blocked the ball last time were out of position, guarding the other girl. Simon thought for sure that Candice would score, but, he was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very short girl on the non-pink side slides on her knees across the gym floor, gets under the ball, and perfectly passes it to another member of her team for a set up to spike it, which, they do. One of Candice's teammates manage to get under their spike, but their recovery is sloppy, and the ball goes out of bounds. Candice falls on her knees and buries her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the other game had ended, all of the girls gathered around the short girl whose team Candice had lost against moments before. It hit Simon then that she was their team captain. \"Alright girls, most of you did pretty well today.\" the small girl begins \"Some of you however,\" she says looking over to the girls in pink, \"Could likely use some improvement. But yanno, through are hard work, I think these girls might learn how to play this sport yet.\" this gets a giggle out of some of the girls that aren't wearing \"Now then...\" she continues \"I think it's time for uniform check. Noobies! line up!\" The six girls in pink form a straight line, with Candice at one end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short girl goes through each of the girls outfits. And when Candice said that they checked everything, she wasn't kidding. She looked up girls shirts and down their pants, making some girls wearing shorter socks take off their shoes 'just to be extra careful'. Finally, she makes it to Candice. She looks up at her face and her pink hairband, then walks around behind her and pulls back the fabric of her pants. She releases them, causing them to snap back on Candice, and then knees her in the ass. Surprised, Candice falls forward onto her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red panties, really?\" the short girl asks \"What the fuck were you thinking?\" \"I'm sorry Alice.\" Candice says to the short girl. \"I...I tried to fade them the best I could. I couldn't find any pink ones that fit.\" Alice scoffs. \"Sounds like a personal problem, fat ass. Now then. Rules are rules. Get ready for your punishment.\" and with that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice gives off a laugh, and kicks Candice again. She didn't look anywhere near as menacing as most the girls were treating her. She was small, had long blonde hair, big brown eyes, wide curves, fairly large breasts - not exactly what you'd expect from a serious volleyball player, yet the way she moved around on the court said otherwise. Not to mention all of the girls around seemed to look up to her - at least figuratively - and seemed to honestly be a little afraid of being around her. \"Are you ready to hear my 'terms', she asks, a tinge of wickedness in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon couldn't just sit there and watch this, whatever this was going to be. \"Now, come on girls, let's be reasonable...\" he began. Alice cut him off, \"And who the hell do you think you are to tell me how to run my team exactly?\" Simon is at a loss for words. It becomes very obvious to him now that he didn't think this one through very far. \"Well... I dunno, you just don't have to be such a bitch about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, wrong choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Wow. I know you didn't just call me a bitch.\" Alice says, angrily. \"Am I wrong? Did he not call me a bitch?\" she looks around the gym, as if she expects an answer to her rhetorical question. \"Because, you know, I've got this strange inkling that he called be a bitch.\" she glared at Simon, looking right into his eyes, with a impossibly strong determination behind it. Simon stood a full foot taller than her, but he'd never felt more looked down upon in his life. \"I- Well-\" he stammered, trying to find a way out of the hole he threw himself into. He found none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news fatass.\" Alice sneers at Candice, who's still on her knees. \"It looks like 'lover boy' here just volunteered to take your punishment for you, and honestly, I have to say, that's just adorable. If he wasn't so misogynistic, he might have been a real keeper. It's a shame really.\" And with that, Alice snaps her fingers. Simon suddenly gets a terrible headache, he mashes his eyes closed and presses his hands against his head, trying to dull the pain. Eventually, it goes away. Opening his eyes, he finds himself staring at Alice- face to face. \"Wiccan bloodlines, got to love it.\" Alice comments. Simon can't really understand what's going on. \"I... buah... how...\" is all he can really manage to get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice laughs. \"Well, well, how the mighty has fallen. You're obviously having a hard time understanding, so I'm going to explain it to you. This is my way of teaching you a lesson, and frankly, I find it much more effective than any lecture hall has ever been. One of my favorites really. The way I see it, you, like so many other guys around you, think you're so much superior to woman. It's sick really. Saying and doing what you please to them, talking down to them... I'm talking in circles. What I'm trying to get to is this. You have 24 hours. Anytime you say or do anything that is demeaning to a woman, and trust me, the magic knows, you'll lose a bit of your height. You go too far, and hey, someone might just step on you. The end of the 24 hours - 11am almost exactly, if you survive and I can find you, I'll return you to your original height.\" Simon opens his mouth, likely to protest, but Alice just continues right over him. \"Oh. And don't even think about trying to explain it to anyone outside this gym; it honestly won't work, you literally can't talk about it.... and that counts for after this is all said and done with as well. No one must ever know - for your sake. Now. Being the kind, benevolent person I am, I'll give you a guardian to watch over you for the day. I want you to learn your lesson, and if you die, I can't guarantee that you do... So...</span></div></div>",

It's not-\" he saw Alice creep slightly taller than him. Alice grins. \"Oh, I don't think you have the right to tell me what to do, little man. Who gave you that power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's mind is racing fast. <i>\"There's no way. I just told her that I didn't want to do something, and that counts as demeaning to her? It's impossible. Anything that I say, she's just going to contort. How am I going to...\"</i> Alice pats him on the head. \"Oh, look at you. Trying to find a way out. Adorable. But trust me. You're better off being with me. It'll be... fun.\" \"What about my classes? What about...\" Alice once again cuts Simon off. \"It's the first day. I don't think you're going to miss much. Now let's go get food. I'm hungry.\" she grabs Simon by the wrist, and starts dragging him along like a child. Walking past the rest of the team, he sees some faces looking with excitement, some with horror. Candice especially. Simon saw her mouth sorry as they walked out of the gym. </span></div></div>",

Simon figured it would be for the best to just leave her be, and starts a conversation with the girl on his right. \"Most boring class ever, am I right?\" Simon whispers to her under her breath. She looks at him and blushes heavily, as if Simon had just asked something extremely personal. After a few moments of silence, she finally responds, by nodding her head. \"Are... are you feeling okay?\" Simon asks, legitimately starting to wonder about this girl's sanity. Her eyes widen as she sits in silence for a few more seconds, before nodding again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm Simon, what's your name?\" Simon asks. The girl continues blushing heavily, it looked as though she could explode at any second. She lightly mumbles something under her breath. \"What?\" Simon whispers \"I can't hear you.\" she blushes even harder, if that was possible, and clenches her fist \"Mi-cha.\" she again replies, much too loud this time, and attracting the attention of the class. She sits and hangs her head in shame. Simon thinks it might be time to call this conversation quits. \"Well... nice to meet you Micha.\" he says, before going back to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes pass, and Micha finally does look up, but is still blushing heavily. \"I am sorry. I am from Korea, and my English isn't... isn't... it is poor. I do not like to speak without... without... knowing how to say things.\" Simon thinks for a second, trying to understand the situation from her point of view. Would not knowing a language well and trying to speak be embarrassing? Most likely. Simon still thought she was blowing it way overboard. Suddenly, he had an idea. Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a friend that wants to be an English teacher. She's been looking for ways to practice, and I think that'd she'd love to help you learn English better. Interested?\" Micha thinks about what Simon said for a few seconds, and then nods. \"Do you have a cell?\" he asks. Micha stares at him blankly, and starts blushing heavily again. It's obvious to Simon that she doesn't understand his question. \"Umm.. A phone. Do you have a phone? So I can call you?\" Her eyes light up. \"Oh. Yes.\" she says, as she pulls out a small pink flip-phone. They exchange numbers. \"Well, Micha. I'll call you when... when I see if my friend will help you.\" she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't have much more of a conversation after that. Micha asks Simon a few questions about what the teacher is saying, and he explains it to her the best that he can, trying his best to use small, common words. Eventually class ends and they go their separate ways. After stopping for a snack, Simon...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a matter of seconds the foot had nearly doubled in size, and the leg that was attached to it was following behind, pushing it farther and farther into the lecture hall. Most of the students started to run to the emergency exits near the front of the class. A few stood in awe of what was going on, one of these such people, including Simon, was the teacher. It wasn't long at all before the massive foot had made it to the front of the class, and as fate would have it, collided with him, pushing him firmly against the wall. By this point, the girl's leg filled the entirety of the double doors into the class, and her foot was easily five times Simon's height. Luckily for his professor, the growth appeared to stopped here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his teacher's muffled cries for help, Simon climbed his way over the massive leg, and went out the other back door, towards where the giant girl would be located. Simon wasn't exactly sure why he was doing this himself- but something inside of him wanted to get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting outside of the classroom, Simon was greeted with another giant leg, nearly blocking the other door he had just left the classroom through. He directed his attention upwards- way upwards, and was greeted with a massive pair of breasts high overhead- completely blocking out the girl's face. He did, however, hear the girl. It sounded like she was...</span></div></div>",

What I don't get is why you had to schedule it so early.\" Henry's speech is slightly slurred. \"I told you to avoid classes before ten.\" \"Only way it would fit in my schedule.\" Simon replies. \"Nothing I could do.\" \"Well mister 'potions master',\" Henry smirks at his own joke. \"If you're gonna go to class, you're gonna want to be leaving now. Living off campus has it's perks - but short commute times ain't one of them.\" Simon looks at his campus map, and realizes Henry is right. He quickly gets outside, and begins his 15 minute walk to campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon finds his way to class fairly easy, and actually arrives almost fifteen minutes early. \"Have to leave now my ass.\" Simon said to himself as he gets into the room. Surprisingly, the room is fairly empty. The only people in the room are his teacher, and 3 other classmates, all of them are surprisingly girls. \"Thought science was supposed to be a male dominated field.\" he whispers to himself as he reads the whiteboard. Apparently, chemistry worked with lab partners often, which were already determined by the professor. Simon, early and in no rush, looked around the room at the girls that were there behind separate lab tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was an average height redhead. She wore thick framed glasses over her green eyes and a pair of safety goggles over those. Freckles littered her plaster white face, and much of her arms that you could see from her plain t-shirt, which, Simon noted, was as flat against her chest as his shirt was against his. She was already mixing some chemicals in a flask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was a short brunette, about 5'1\". She had brown eyes and a healthy glow to her skin, as well as a very red lipstick on her thick lips. Her breasts under a white tank top were larger than the redheads, but not anything above average. She was writing something on the lab table, which was much to high for her to work on comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third was a Blonde, and she was taller than Simon was by a few inches. She had big blue eyes, that had almost a surreal depth to their color. She had a lanky build, and under her blouse had breasts somewhere between the brunettes and the redheads. She was staring out the window of the lab, day dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon decides to check the board for his name to see where his table would be.

Simon had mixed feelings about this - the redhead wasn't really the cutest girl, but at least she seemed diligent. Maybe he'd try to get her on his good side and see how much work he could get away with not doing. He walked over to the lab table and put his backpack on the floor, but she didn't stop mixing her chemicals. He clears his throat, and she doesn't even flinch. Finally, he tries speaking. \"Excuse me? Samantha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Excuse you.\" Samantha says, jotting a few numbers down in her notebook. \"I'm sorry... what?\" was all Simon could manage to say. \"I said 'Excuse you.'\" she replied, not even looking up. \"as in 'you are excused' for bothering me while I'm working.\" Simon just blinks, utterly stunned by the nerve of the redhead in front of him. <i>\"quite the fiery one, isn't she?\"</i> he thought to himself, while saying. \"I was just trying to introduce myself, geez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha lets out a loud exasperated sigh and finally stops what she was doing, staring directly at Simon through her two pairs of lenses. \"I'd assume that you're Simon, by how you're hovering around me instead of the two other girls in the room, or you could just be a pervert that gets sexual satisfaction out of annoying gingers, maybe both.\" Simon at this point, can't help but get a little worked up himself, but for the sake of not making the scene anymore out of hand than it was (people were walking in at this point, most of them staring at Simon and Samantha), he tried his best to hide his annoyance. \"No, no. Just Simon. I just was trying to introduce myself.\" Samantha goes back to working. \"Oh. Was that all? Well, I think you've done a good enough job of that, now haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sits in silence for a few seconds, before his curiosity finally got the better of him. \"What the heck is so important that you're working on anyways?\" Samantha continues working on her chemicals. \"You really don't know when you're not wanted, do you?\" she snaps back. \"Just stop bugging me, stop trying to look at my ass, and don't touch anything.\" Simon hadn't even tried looking at her ass, when he glanced at it when she told him not to, he didn't really find anything about it attractive either. Simon had had about enough of the girl. \"Don't touch anything, eh?\" he said sarcastically. \"Not even this?\" Simon picks up a flask and begins to swirl the liquids around on the inside. \"No! Do-\" was all Samantha was able to say before suddenly - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><i>pooosh!</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chemicals in the flask quickly evaporated into a puff of smoke, surprised, Simon knocked into Samantha, who dropped her flask, which...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Simon is rather confused, and only is able to let out an \"Uhh... Hey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Simon finishes his statement, The girl wrapped her arms tightly around Simon's, and pulled it tightly against her chest. \"I'm Jenny.

Now, Simon was greatly enjoying the feeling against his arm, but at the same time, couldn't help but feel there was something wrong.

The brain is strange like that.\" Finally she turns around. She gives Simon a very careful looking over, starting at his feet and going up.

The two of them are together in silence again for a few seconds, eventually Emily starts talking again. \"Thinking about it, it's odd. You had the exact opposite experience I had. You likely saw me from across the room long before you read my name. I'm curious. Did your mind formulate a name for me before you saw it's truth? What did you think was a good thing to all me?\" Simon let the silence seep in for a moment, thinking to himself, before replying \"Well...

What I don't get is why you had to schedule it so early.\" Henry's speech is slightly slurred. \"I told you to avoid classes before ten.\" \"Only way it would fit in my schedule.\" Simon replies. \"Nothing I could do.\" \"Well mister 'beast tamer',\" Henry smirks at his own joke. \"If you're gonna go to class, you're gonna want to be leaving now. Living off campus has it's perks - but short commute times ain't one of them.\" Simon looks at his campus map, and realizes Henry is right. He quickly gets outside, and begins his 15 minute walk to campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon arrives without a moment to spare. As he walks in, the biology professor is asking the students to take a seat. Simon finds one on the end near the front, and takes that one, noticing a number of instruments on the professor's desk, he assumes she's going to open the class with a demo. \"and just think.\" he said to himself. \"I might have missed the only interesting thing in this class if I'd listened to Henry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up close, Simon is surprised at how pretty his professor actually is. He expects some old hag, but she couldn't have been over thirty. She had short blonde hair that gleamed in the classroom's lights and brown eyes that nicely contrasted the shine in their flatness. She was slightly chubby, but a good deal of the fat seemed to go to her breasts, which were around a C. She wore a white lab coat and jeans, with high black heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright class.\" she spoke, \"As some of you were undoubtedly told, most teachers like to start the first day of class with the syllabubs and ground-rules.\" she smiled. \"I am not one of those professors. Unlike them, I, Professor Gray, like to start my classes with a bang.\" She goes over to a fridge near the side of her desk, and opens it, pulling out a petri dish. \"On this petri dish, I've grown a bacteria colony - don't worry, it's not a bacteria that affects humans. I've spliced a certain genetic code into the bacteria, so that, when I add some sodium, they should combust... So, without further to do. I've got some sodium here,\" she holds up a beaker full of white powder. \"And if I don't care about murdering a few thousand germs, which I don't.\" she pours the sodium onto the petri dish, which... </span></div></div>",

Quickly she runs over to the emergency shower, and pulls the handle, releasing a torrent of water. The flames are put out in merely a second. However, it's still too late for her labcoat, which now is not only badly burned, but dripping wet. She lets off a sigh, and signals for the class to settle down, which was in an obvious uproar. \"Well, that apparently worked a little more effectively than I anticipated...\" she says, as she removes her mess of a labcoat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath she's wearing a thin white tank top, and unfortunately for her, no bra. The water had seeped through her coat into the top, which was now anything but opaque, showing off much more of her 'assets' than she had most likely intended. \"I know it's a bit of a mess up here right now, but I don't think it should be a problem if we just continue class. Everybody all right with that?\" Prof. Gray listens for a second, but doesn't get an answer to her question. Simon is far too busy looking stunned at his teacher's tits to even be paying attention. \"I asked, is that okay with everybody?\" she asks again, giving a little bounce for emphasis, causing some jiggle, and as a result, some giggles from the girls in the crowd. Professor Gray looks down, and suddenly notices her mistake. She turns a bright shade of red, and quickly turns her back to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... The rest of class is canceled.\" She said, her voice sounding a bit broken. \"The room needs to be cleaned, and I need to get out of these wet clothes.\" \"Someone needs to stay behind to clean... how about... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Simon looks up at her... realizing how tall she was. She easily stood a full head above him. Simon just nods. \"I'm Eve in case the thought crossed your mind.\" she responds, almost jokingly. \"I'm gonna get mopping up this water. I'll leave buffing out the scorch marks on the desk to you.\" Simon nods again, grabbing some sand paper and going to work.

Grew up in a colony, got fed up with it by the time I turned 15, moved in with my aunt, and few years later... now I'm here. The whole 'dressing' thing was a bit of an adjustment- As was all the technology; colony I lived in was fairly rural. I've gotten used to everything... except for the shoes. I don't know what it is about them, but I just don't find them comfortable. Most people don't even notice.\" Eve pauses, and gives a light laugh. \"I don't even know why I'm telling you all of this... makes the job go faster if nothing else. Just don't go spreading any stories about the crazy nudist student, kay?\" Simon nods his head in compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon really has no idea what he's doing, he'd never sanded down a desk before, and despite his effort, he hadn't really made any progress by the time Eve finished mopping. She comes over to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really have no idea what you're doing here, do you?\" Eve says, grabbing a different sand paper. \"Here. Use this. And put some force into it.\" Simon thanks Eve and uses the other sandpaper, however, he still doesn't make much progress. He hears Eve sigh. \"I said put force into it... give it to me.\" Simon hands over the sandpaper, and Eve goes to work, The burns come off fairly quickly. She then takes wood varnish, and starts buffing it into the table. Simon asks if he could help, but is just kind of denied. \"No. It's fine. I got it. Wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.\" she smiles, and Simon frowns. He's never felt so unmanly- especially compared to a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some working, The lab is back in a presentable condition. Eve stretches her arms above her head, reminding Simon of the height she had on him. \"So... Gray isn't back yet. I say we do some snooping. Only fair, right?\" Simon nods, hesitantly. He doesn't totally agree with Eve, but she does seem to be the one in control of the situation. She finds her way back to the chemical cabinet and starts going through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Standard stuff.\" she say, digging through the contents, \"Nothing really... oh, what's this? Unlabeled bottle?\" she pulls it out of the cabinet and undoes the cap. She gives it a sniff, and looks at the bottle quizzically. Then, taking her finger, gets some of the liquid out of the bottle, and tastes it. \"Hmm... almost like koolaid, but better... wanna try it?\" she holds the bottle out to Simon, who adamantly denies trying it. Eve shrugs. \"Whatever. You're missing out.\" she says, taking a small sip out of the bottle. \"Oh wow. That is good.\" When putting the rest of the chemicals back into the cabinet, Simon sees her shove the bottle into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright quiet one... nice meeting you and all.\" Eve begins, Simon cuts her off with, \"Oh. Right. I'm Simon. Sorry.\" Eve smiles. \"Alright. Simon. Nice meeting you, but I'm going to get going back to... ummm... hey, Simon. How well do you know campus?\" Simon shrugs, \"As well as most people, why?\" \"I kinda... forgot where my dorm was. Go ahead. Laugh.\" Simon doesn't, and instead simply asks. \"What dorm?\" Eve responds, \"Jefferson.\" Simon's eyes light up. Maybe he can do something useful today after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe explains to Eve how to get to her dorm from the building, but she doesn't seem to be able to understand. Eventually Simon gives up and tells her. \"Yanno what? I'll walk you back. I got time before my next class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon leaves the building with the tall girl, and starts heading back to her dorm with her, and they begin chatting.

Simon looks up from the floor to see Gloria scrubbing away at the desk.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><i>jiggle</i></font><br>\r\nHer breasts swayed back and forth feverishly as she stroked the table, back and forth, almost like a pendulum.

Looking into his eyes with her own small green ones. \"No.\" Simon finally says, defeated. \"I'd imagine not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" she says, her wings changing back to swirling rainbows. \"Now, as I was saying, before you started being a total ass.

We're all adults here.\" \"Right, right.\" Simon says, laughing along nervously as he shuts his bedroom door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he gets into his room, Rose busts out of the bag. \"Gah!\" she exclams, \"glad that's over and I can finally bre - ukk. Smells like fucking dragon breath in here.\" \"Yeah. Someone pissed in the next room over last night.\" Simon explains. \"Is... is that common?\" Rose asks. \"No. No! God no!\" Simon exclaims. \"We have proper removal systems for that... sorta thing.

What?\" \"Oh.\" Simon says, understanding the question. \"Well, actually, I'm right on the average.\" \"Oh, alright.\" Rose replies, looking up at the ceiling. \"That makes it fairly easy then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Rose starts to creep upward in height, and fast. Her head reaches up to Simon's knees, then the middle of his thighs, then... she stops growing, puts her hands on her own thighs, and starts gasping for breath. \"Wow.\" she says between two heavy breaths. \"This growing thing... It's... A lot more tiring... than you'd think... Okay... just give me a sec.\" she starts growing again, reaches up to about Simon's waist, and then gives of an exasperated moan. \"FUCK. IT... GOD.\" she screams. \"Wow, this SUCKS!\" she falls to the ground in a heap of exhaustion. \"You got any food? anything at all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... yeah. Hold on.\" Simon says, and goes digging through his backpack. He pulls out a pack of pretzels that we saving for a snack later, and throws it at the now 3 foot fairy. \"Here.\" The fairies eyes light up in excitement. \"Wow... do people really eat like this?\" she asks, prying open the bag with her teeth and grabbing a handful of pretzels. \"Yeah... uh.. why?\" Simon asks. \"W'll far'es d'n't n'ed to eat u'l'ss t'ey n'ed to rec'ar'e their m'gic.\" she explains through a mouthfull of pretzels. She swallows and grabs some more. \"We mainly get our food from minotaurs, which is rationed to us pretty sparingly... With all of this... yeah, human size should be no problem at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon took this time to examine Rose more carefully, now that she wasn't the size of a Barbie doll. She had a beautiful face. Her bright green hair was layered nicely, very short for a girl, but still managed to keep her feminity, maybe in part to her incredibly beautiful face. Her breasts were even bigger than he thought they were, weather that was because of the disparity in size between the two of them, he couldn't be sure. Unfortunately, they were still covered by her dress, which she had been growing along with her. She had a fairly wide waist, which was also high due to her long legs, which connected to her dainty bare feet. He noticed that her toes and finger nails were both lime green. If that was natural or not for the blue fairy, he had no idea. The biggest surprise to him was the wings though. The intricate designs on them were increased tenfold with the increase in her height. If she'd arrived this size instead of ten inches tall, Simon would have likely confused her for an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of a few minutes, she managed to down the entire bag of pretzels. breathing deeply she spreads out her arms, and starts to grow again, only quite a bit slower than she was before, about an inch every 2 seconds. \"I just figured, it's not every day I have this much magical energy at my disposal.\" she smiled as she inched upwards. \"Here. Give me your hand.\" the growing blue winged girl placed her growing hand against Simons. hand was much smaller than his, but Simon could feel the sliding of the expanding flesh against his own. \"Oh wow, everything looks so different from up here.\" she said, reaching around 4'6\". Those turny things on the door, it makes perfect sense.\" She continued to grow and grow. Her bare feet making a sliding sound against Simon's floor carpet as they expanded. Finally, she reached Simon's chest. Then she was level with his shoulders. His chin. His eyes. Simon felt her fingers become longer than his, and still keep expanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Rose?\" Simon said. \"Shush Shush.\" Rose said, Simon's head now level with her chin, she rested it on top of his head. \"You're ruining the moment.\" \"No, you don't understand, you need to stop.\" Simon tried explaining, Rose standing up straight again, and greeting Simons face with a view full of boobs. \"I don't get why you're freaking out so much.\" Rose said, confused. \"Just... just stop!\" Simon yelled. Around the same time, Rose hit her head against the ceiling. \"Ow!\" she exclaimed, the surprise stopping her growth. She looked down at Simon, now standing a full two feet taller than him. She wiggled her much larger fingers against Simon's and laughed. \"Eh, a little on the short side, but it'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon can't really understand what she's saying. \"What do you mean, a little on the short side?\" he asks, dumbfounded. \"Well, you said you were average for a guy, right?\" she explains, \"Well, if that's true, I should be about...\" She holds her hands about a foot apart from each other \"this much taller, right?\" \"No. Not right.\" Simon exclaims. \"Not even close! Where are you getting these ideas?\" Rose laughs. \"Well, pixies are naturally quite a bit shorter than fairies are, and far less powerful. In some regions, they're still treated as pets actually...\" she stops laughing for a second. \"Wait, it isn't the same for humans?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No actually.\" Simon says. \"Not at all, woman and men are pretty even in height, in fact, girls are actually a bit shorter.\" \"Oh. are they?\" Rose says, perplexed. \"Wow that's... that's odd. Humans are so friggin weird.\" \"Well,\" Simon shrugs, \"Welcome to freaky deaky humansville.\" Rose blushes slightly. \"I must look pretty silly to you then, huh?\" \"Little bit.\" Simon admits, \"Kind of cute, but, I'm going to need to have me not eye level with your chest to avoid suspicion. So if you could shrink back down to be a bit shorter than I am... I'd probably be for the best. Rose looks down at Simon, and gives a little laugh. \"Yeah I'd most likely be better for not drawing out your crazy ass human armies...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The process is much faster than she took to grow, and, from the smile that was on her face when she was growing compared to the faint frown on her face now, he found it fairly obvious that she much more enjoyed the former. In a matter of seconds, she was the same height as Simon. Rose stopped at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Rose said. Putting out a finger. \"You're average height for a guy, right? And girls are only a bit shorter?\" Simon shrugs. \"That's what I said, wasn't it?\" Rose pokes Simon in the forehead. \"I was just clarifying. No need to get smart. ass. Anyways\" she continues, \"If you're average, that means there are probably some girls that are taller than you, right?\" \"uhh, yeah. Some.\" Simon says, completely missing the point. Rose grows herself back a few inches. \"How tall... do you think... I could get away with?\" she asks, growing herself slightly between breaks in her speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sighs. \"Can't you just be average? It'd attract less attention.\" Rose smiles. \"But silly, I'm nowhere near average. I'm one of the tallest fairies back home. Looking up to males is going to be weird enough, I'd like to minimize the weirdness for me if you could stop being selfish - So.\" she grows another inch. \"How tall?\" Simon looks up at her. He'd guess she's about 6'5\". \"I'd say about there.\" Simon says \"You're already going to attract some stares... especially with the wings and the blue.\" Rose looks behind her at her big, shining wings. \"Oh right. Totally forgot.\" She closed her eyes and breathed out, as she did, her wings began shrinking, they wrapped around her neck, and eventually turned into a butterfly necklace around her neck. \"Saw you wearing a band on your throat... would assume this would be good?\" Simon nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... now the skin...\" Rose says, Immediately her entire complexion changed, going from light blue to a light peach in a blink of an eye. \"This good?\" Simon once again nods. Rose strikes a pose, leaning back and putting her arms behind her back. \"Am I smexy?' she asks. Simon nods again. \"Seriously?\" she laughs, \"I'm not even the same species as you, what the fuck is your problem, sicko?\" Simon doesn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Anything else I need to change?\" she asks. \"Well, your hair.\" Simon says, looking up at her bright green mop. \"Alright.\" Rose closes her eyes. \"I can do red, blue, pink, and white. Which one works?\" Simon shakes his head. \"none of those... you seriously can't do anything else?\" she puts her hands on her hips. \"I mean, come on now. I'm not a miracle worker. Color changing is difficult fucking shit. you're just lucky that your silly human skin color was close to one of the colors I can do.\" Simon sighs and gives it some thought... \"Well... I guess it'll be okay. Some girls dye their hair weird colors.\" Simon sees the butterfly charm on Rose's necklace flashes red. \"You calling me weird, Shorty?\" she says, standing up as tall as she could, Simon could swear she had grown herself more just to yell at him. \"Because I know that you wouldn't dream of doing something like that. You were just calling the humans that use dyes on their hair weird, right? Because I know you wouldn't dream of saying something like that to someone as wonderful as me.\" Simon just nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I thought so.\" Rose says. \"Anything else I need to change?\" Simon thinks about it for a second. \"Well...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Simon rolls his eyes. \"I've known you for all of - what now, half an hour? And if I can tell one thing, it's that there's no way that you like formal.\" Rose is quiet for a second, sitting on Simon's bed before finally responding. \"Okay, yeah. Fucking hate it.

You can't even shop without them?\" she scratched her head. \"Okay, let's say, that you didn't have a pair of shoes, but you needed to go to the store to buy a pair of shoes... how the hell do you get the shoes in the first place if they don't let you in the store?\" Simon thought about it for a second, and just shrugged. \"I have no idea.\" He goes into his closet and pulls out a pair of flip flops. \"Put these on.\" she slips them on, only for Simon to tell her that she put them on the opposite feet, she fixes her mistake and sighs, standing up. \"They're not even connected at the back heel like yours.\" she complains. \"How the fuck am I supposed to walk in these?\" \"You'll get used to it.\" Simon assures \"besides, the flip flops are only until we can get you some shoes of your own... just be glad that they fit decently well.\" she nods in agreement. \"Alright.\" Simon says, opening the door, \"Let's get go-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon suddenly realizes he completely forgot about Henry.

She was constantly adjusting the passenger seat from the second Simon explained to her how to do so after she tried to sit with her legs on top of the dashboard because 'lack of considerate legroom'. It honestly was starting to get on his nerves, but decided against saying so, to avoid another tongue lashing. Eventually, they arrived at the mall. \"Alright.\" Simon explained, \"We've only got an hour before my first class, so we're going to have to be fairly fast about this.\" Simon gets out of the car, and after watching Rose struggle with the door for a few seconds, opens it for her. She struggles to get out, fixes her dress, and sighs, \"Is everything that you stupid humans make so friggin weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything humans make this fucking awesome?\" she asked, staring aimlessly at the fountain inside the mall. Simon drags her along the best he can, \"It's just a fountain. Nothing to lose your head over.\" Rose tugs back on Simon's grip defiantly. \"No. You don't understand.\" she shines, \"It's a geyser. Only tiny. And in a building. And - what the fuck is that?\" she points at a mother and child walking by, the kid with a ice cream cone in hand. the mother looks at Rose pointing, and traces over her to her green hair.

And why the sugar?\" Simon shakes his head, and explains milk and milk products as calmly and quickly as he can. \"So... you put milk... but not from woman but cows... milk from a cow's tit... in almost everything you eat?\" Simon nods. \"I was right before.

What can I interest you in?\" Rose leans down and whispers in his ear, \"Who the fuck's the weirdo?\" \"He's the guy who's gonna help you find a pair of shoes,\" Simon whispers back. \"Umm, yeah.\" he says in a normal speaking voice to the sales rep, \"We're looking for a pair of street shoes for her over here.\" \"Right. What size do you wear miss?\" the rep asks. Rose just shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's foreign.\" Simon explains, thinking fast. \"She's not used to the sizing here.\" The sales rep nods. \"Fair enough. We can measure then.\" The sales rep leads them down one of the aisles, and directs Rose to sit, to which she reluctantly agrees. He then proceeds to take off one of her flip flops, which she strongly disagrees with. She likely would have punched him if Simon didn't hold her back. He puts her foot on the scale and gives it a quick adjustment. \"Oh.\" Simon hears him say. \"Oh what?\" Rose says, starting to get annoyed. \"According to the scale, you wear a woman's 15. We... don't carry woman's shoes in that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not?\" Rose states, \"Shouldn't you have shoes for everyone?\" the sales rep starts to look a bit worried. \"Well... it's just that most woman don't have...\" \"Don't have what?\" Rose glares, her charm shimmering red. \"Don't have shoes that fit them? Do you want me to parade through your store shoeless? Don't you have damn rules against that?\" The rep starts to look flustered \"Well, yes... but we just..\" \"Then get something on my damn foot. It's your fuckin' job, so do it!\" \"I-I could get you some corresponding male shoes...\" the sales rep begins, but Rose is having none of it. \"Does it look like I have a dick, sir?\" \"Well... no... but...\" he begins, only increasing Rose's anger. \"Damn right I don't! Now you better come back with shoes suitable for my beautiful feet, and fast, or one of them is going straight up your ass. Got it?\" The sales rep gets to his feet faster than Simon would have thought possible. \"Yes ma'am.\" is all he says, before bolting to the back of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sits on the bench next to her. \"Worthless.\" Rose says to herself, outloud. \"Why do you humans have to be so worthless?\" \"He's just doing his job.\" Simon says, trying to calm her. \"And to be fair, I did warn you that you were rather tall for a girl.\" Rose just glares. \"Whatever. He just better find me something more comfortable than those\" she says, pointing at the flip flops<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, the clerk comes back with a large box in his hands. \"Well.\" he says, still running on adrenaline from his encounter with Rose. \"I went through the back, and managed to find one pair that's in your size. I'm not sure they're to you're liking, but...\" \"Show me.\" was all Rose said. Opening the box, Simon saw that inside was a pair of long black leather boots, with straps going up the sides. They looked rather goth, and on top of it all, they had extremely tall sole, Simon guessed it was nearly a half a foot in the front, and they were raised even higher in the heel. He could already see the attention Rose would get walking around in these, looming over seven feet tall. But looking over, Simon could see her eyes light up. \"Well,\" Simon says, \"Maybe you should try some guy's shoes...\"</span></div></div>",

Until some trouble with girls arise that makes him feel quite small and childish. Simon, stuck in the middle of this mess, finds himself in a dire situation. Will he be able to return everything to normal? Will he even be able to survive? - that's your choice to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">Main Characters:</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon: Simon is generally an average 18 year old male. 6 foot even, average intelligence, buzzed brown hair, brown eyes... average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula: Paula is one of Simon's friends from high school attending the same college. She's 19, 5'9\", fairly thin with wide hips and smallish B cup breasts. Her hair is long, blonde, and curly, and eyes are blue. Simon sees her more as a sister than anything else. If you asked Simon about her, he'd say that though she's very smart and gives excellent advice, she's timid around people that she doesn't know, and hates being the center of attention. She has larger than normal feet (Size 13s) and she does her best to hide them. She also has a weird habit of calling him 'big boy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry: One of Simon's other friends from his neighborhood . He's 21, 5'10\", and a bit on the heavy side, with fairly long red hair and green eyes. Though older, he often seems more childish than Simon, and has nearly failed out of university on numerous occasions. Though he's prone to getting into trouble, Simon enjoys hanging around him because there's always fun to be had. For not being the most attractive man, his sheer confidence makes him fairly popular with woman. Anything that can be taken as innuendo, he will go for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Groundrules:</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Stay away from 'toilet' stuff, there's other stories for those fetishes.<br>\r\n-Girls should primarily grow, If a girl must shrink, have her shrink with a guy. Guys should not grow, except for going back to original size.<br>\r\n-Try to keep choices open to various paths, and avoid writing extremely short chapters, and poor spelling and grammar. <br>\r\n-Other than that, have fun, and if you see a path you like, add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\"> Don't be afraid to add.
