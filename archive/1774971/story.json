Receiving a potion that he was requested to get by random town's folk.<br>\r\n(going into Link's perspective now)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out from the faerie's cave and looked at the potion. I had to figure a way to keep from mixing it up with one of my own potions... it had the same color to it as my own health potions. I decided to stick a piece of paper on it with a big \"T\" on it to keep it apart from the rest. With that out of the way, it was a long walk back to the townsfolk who wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the travel back it started to get late, not many monsters seemed to be out so it seemed like the best time to set up a small camp. Gathering wood for a fire, and making a soft spot with leaves and such for a bed. The sun had set and the fire was roaring. No telling what time it may have been, but it was time to rest for the trek back to town tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

But he immediately went into the motions of trying to catch this fish\u2026He really hoped it was a big one! He stood up and just violently pulled back on the rod, reeling it as fast and hard as he could. The fish for it\u2019s part was also putting up quite the struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the hero of time was stronger then any normal fish and eventually he pulled roughly and the fish just shot out of the lake and flopped about lazily on the cold wet bank of the pond, link grinned as he gazed down at his prize. It was a bass, not a especially large one, but easily nine or so pounds and that would definitely help his situation with the hunger.

He had cut the slim tidbits of meat he had gotten from the fish into filets and was now waiting for the water he had gotten from the pond to boil. The small iron pot creaked slightly at the heat and \u201cPregnant\u201d Male winced at the sound. But it at least meant the water was near boiling temp, he had hoped this would be slightly quicker and easier as it seemed his hunger grew every couple of minutes and his hunger pangs were beginning to be quite painful. Finally the water began to boil and he just gently placed the two filets into the water, he hoped the fish would be cooked relatively soon as his stomach was just killing him now. He watched the pot closely, just licking his lips and absently rubbing at his enlarged stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nothing truly large yet but it looked out of place on the relatively trim and in shape hero of time. He just sat there fidgeting occasionally and waiting for the fish to be cooked enough to be ready to consume. He may have used spits or maybe even fry it, that would certainly tasted better but boiling it was the fastest way to eat it and he decided upon that because he was just so hungry. Finally after a few more minutes passed the smell of cooking fish just swarmed through the blonde\u2019s nostrils and he just sighed contently as he watched the pale meat, brown and then golden before he pulled the pot off the fire and dug out a few utensils and a plate. He then jabbed  a large fork into the still steaming water and pulled out both pieces of fish with it, the fish was cooked decently and well done and he hoped it would be tasty but that really did not bother him all that much as he slowly begin to dig into the fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next ten minutes were a graphic scene of him just eating every inch of the filets, he hacked into them and bit them and torn them apart in a show not fit for others being around him. But he was finally filling that empty feeling within him so he was content.  He finally let out a content burp and just fell back, he had ate like a glutton but did it not bother him for the first time in about two days he felt full and happy. His stomach let out a groan of contentment as well and he just slowly put the pots and plates back into his back and just fell back on it, using it as a makeshift pillow. He figured he could just camp here before returning to town, or even the castle so he could continue on with his adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drifted off into a content sleep and just groaned happily as he dreamt\u2026.when he awoke<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It almost like he was carrying something in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shook his head, he'd rather not think about it and just continue on his journey. He didn't feel sick, so there wasn't anything deathly wrong with him, right? He could just buy a health potion next time he's in a town and that would be the end of it.
