I want to play a game. You are, by far, the most ticklish of all Digimon. Instead of the blessing which that is, you see only a curse. The machine your feet are in will tickle you, very gently, for the next nine hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words, he flinches and begins to squirm. A single, poofy feather has begun to swipe at his sole. Guilmon struggles, ever so cutely, to hold in his giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you use the control panel at your side to speed up the process, although the intensity will increase as well. The choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon has begun to whine at the gentle, maniacal feather crawling along his thick feet. </span></div></div>",

Several crawl into his armpits, making him squeeze them away futilely while others claw away at his soft belly. Two pairs pull his toes apart so the menacing feather can brush the smooth skin between them.

Black bars of marble or onyx break up the steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly in front of you stands a heavy metal door. A little over your head's height sits a simple icon. You instantly recognize it as one of your group.</span></div></div>",

Your hatred of being tickled has gotten you into trouble before. A quick tickle to the ribs is all it took to make you shock your brother dead.\" The Raichu visably tenses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make sure you never hurt anyone with that again. Execpt perhaps yourself. Before you is a tank. I suggest you step inside if you want to survive. Then, I would like it if you were to sit down.\" Raichu does not hesitate. He slides the door open, which slams shut behin d him. Moments after sitting down in the chair, his stubby arms and ancles are planted to the chair with sturdy metal. His arms are slowly raised up and feet raised until you can see his soles perfectly. They strain to appear relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are about to be tickled for a while, but I am not going to tell you for how long. I expect for you to discharge a bit of electricity during this time. However much you discharge, however, will be returned to you by the end of our little session. Hopefully you can survive taking it all back at once. Oh and by the way, you should take a look up.\" All the eyes in the room look to the ceiling. A small box is affixed within the tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should have checked that box for the key before you sat down. Its unlocked. But its a little late for that now.\" Raichu is furious now; he struggles with the restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tv flashes off and several tiny yet sinister-looking pikachus enter through a door near the rear of the tank. Each is blacker than midnight with flashes in their eyes. Raichu swivels his head to watch. One immediately grabs for his ribs and starts kneading furiously. It starts going so fast that it looks more like it's digging through the Raichu's side than tickling it. The raichu uses every iota of strength to suck his body away from the ticklish assult. His strength gives out and a thin stream of electricity stems from his cheecks to collect at metal orbs on the sides of the tank.</span></div></div>",

This way you at least have a chance.\" The Veemon whines and the birds haul the door open for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cushy seat stands in front of you. A high pair of stocks stand at the foot of the chair and the majority of  an upright metal tube stands behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down and strap in,\" drones the voice. Several flatscreens flash to life. Reluctantly, the Veemon sits down and puts his feet in the stocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you don't lock it in,\" the creature meekly suggests. The birds shrug in agreement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, strap in.\" The voice has become audibly angry.  So, the birds clamp the stocks shut. \"put the rings on his middle toes.\" The Birds take a pair of rings, which are attached with tough cords to the stocks, and place them as instructed. They step back with forced optimism. The chair slides back into the tube and the stocks seal with it. His head is clearly visable above the tube and his feet jut out of the side a little below eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be good!\" Shouts the meowth. Raichu's cheeks begin to spark, but his attention is grabbed by the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veemon, you are far too skittish for your own good. I am going to teach you to hold still. Above you is a weighted column.\" Sure enough, a solid column of steel sits above the poor creature. \"You are about to be feathered for a scant five minutes. I suggest you hold your feet still.\" At this, a lone feather on a robotic tentacle emerges from the stocks. It waves slightly, yet menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should you move about too much, that column will come crashing down and your challenge will be completed. Likewise, if any of you were to attempt to help our friend by holding his feet still or grabbing the feather, the result will be no different. But don't worry- I'll be gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sandy sound alerts you all to the turning of an hourglass on the wall. Supressed laughter turns you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feather arches back and touches its tip to the heel of one foot. Torturously, it begins to slide upwards. A high pitched whine and a slight twitch escape the victim. \"Watch it, Vee\" warns the Biyomon. The feather reaches the top and touches to the ball of his other foot before slithering down to the heel. Without any warning, it darts to his arches and begins to spin wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHH!!\" A high-pitched squeak escapes Veemon, who bites his knucle to supress the laughter; his eyes are rolled back into his head. The feather migrates back up and brushes gently between two toes. They flex involuntarily and the weight twitches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme your hand\" demands the Biyomon. She kneels down and cleches his hand to help brace his nerves. The Hawkmon mirrors her actions with his other hand. About that time, the feather moves to the tops of his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see him get crushed, myself\" mumbles the meowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass, and the poor creature holds up- albeit barely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden</span></div></div>",

The Biyomon looks confused, but the Hawkmon looks interested. Carefully, he reaches down to Veemon's side and begins poking around. Veemon does not even flinch. Biyomon reaches down as well; soon, several of them are on him. They poke, caress, twiddle, and brush every inch of skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue slides out of your mouth and laps up his soles. A screaming laugh shoots through the room; the Veemon has sprung to life! For good measure, you give the wrinkly soles a few more loving licks.

A quick laugh cuts the momentary tension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks everyone. I couldn't have done it without you.\" Between his smiles to the birds is a slick glance to you.

Everyone quickly turns around to see who had made the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bashful looking Patamon.  It was obviously a younger girl, because the voice was to high pitched even for a little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with her.\" You agree.  In light of your interjection, everyone starts to agree.

She blushed as she said this, and everyone fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you say, splitting the silence, \"Then sit on that chair, and we'll tickle you.\" Biyomon nodded in understanding and walked to the couch.  Youset down Gatomon, who reluctantly allows this.  Biyomon sat down on the couch and waited.  You, along with the Veemon, and Hawkmon walked to her.  Gatomon clung to the Raichu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you want to do this?\" Hawkmon asked the volunteer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I've gotta do it sometime.\" She repied smiling at him, \"Go ahead, let's get it over with.\"  With that, you take your place at her feet, and Hawkmon sits on her lap.  Veemon stands behind the couch, holding her arms above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three...  Two...  One...  GO!\" You say as you begin tickling.  Her feet are very soft, not scaley at all.  Her pink nails and soft soles were a dead giveaway that she kept very good care of her feet.  Her ribs and stomach were under a fercious attack from Hawkmon, and she already was reduced to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  STOP STOP STOP STAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAP!\" Biyomon pleaded.  Her pleas fell deaf as you continued to tickle her feet with your nimble claws.  You eventually get up enough nerve to give her feet a quick lick.  She scrunches her toes and shrieks in protest, but you give her another one anyway.  She screeches again and Hawkmon begins to double his tickle techniques.  He would scamper his left hand up her ribs and slowly knead her sides with his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet eventually go limp and relax.  She was exhausted, and couldn't beg anymore.  She had given in to the tickling.  You cease your tickling immediatly, and allow her to catch her breath. She was very tired after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't continue.\" The voice cracked over the speaker, \"You will cease, and you will proceed.\"  You glance at the still panting Biyomon, and the worried Hawkmon.  Veemon had long since allowed her arms to fall to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-th-thanks.\" She panted, giving a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\" You say helping her to her feet.  The party begins to move to another hallway, just as dark as the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for awhile, you see another door.  This one's different.  It showed one sign, and it was a sign no one seemed to recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room is for anyone to use.\" The voice crackled over a speaker above them, \"When you think about it, there is always that one member of your group that you would love to get rid of.\" Everyones eyes turned to the Meowth who stood nervously, looking at the door, \"You may force one person into this room, and they will undergo tickling on a daily basis for three years.  They will be released aftr that, but they won't be the same.  You could get rid of that smart-mouthed one person who seems to always bring the group down, but could you live with yourselves knowing that you damned someone to tickling for three years?

They learn that an occasional tickle to his neck makes him fight all the harder. He cries for help to Biyomon in between gasps and screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon runs out, nearly in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each is thick at the ankle and tapers off quickly towards plump toes. Although the balls and heels are not very pronounced, the arches are quite deep. Each pink nail has a rounded point and a wonderful shine. In short, they are stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers find their way to the sides and brush their way down. She whimpers sweetly and her soles curl inwards. A single finger finds its way between them and drags its way down. Her already panting breath quickens and she braces for the worst kind of torture. Gentle fingers skittle down the smooth soles and she begins to chirp again. The cuteness is killing you. Your fingers dart all over the soles and, when they curl up too much, over the tops of her feet as well. They are weak, however, and vainly attempt to brush your hands away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BZZT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before he is sent into laughter, you could swear you saw a smile of absolute love on Hawkmon's face. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When your eyes adjust, the horror of the situation presents itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you sits a chair with a low pair of footstocks. This pair, however, has a large guillotine built into it.

Contrary to what it may look like, it is utterly painless. It is also the coward's way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group begins to curiously examine the menacing structure. A renamon nearly reaches for the blade to test it, but recoils at the last minute due to her better sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone that wants a key out of here need only sit down, strap in, and throw the little switch on the structure. Your feet will fall off quickly, painlessly, and bloodlessly. You can still feel them; you can still move them.

They will move, they will feel, but they will not be ticklish. Along with them will be a key, just for you. After you leave this place, I will keep your feet for a year. During that time, days may go by where you are not tickled at all. Others may go by in which you are tickled all day. After that year, you will likely hate me more than anyone else here, and rightfully so. But mostly, you will hate yourself. I will eventually mail your feet back to you, and you may even keep the other pair as souvenirs.

But only one thing you know exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked toward the device and the being in the Screen smiles, laughs. \"Oh....that fast? I thought it will take longer until someone want to leave this house this cowardly, weakly and spineless....\" \"I'm not doing it....\" This words seems to shock the being a bit and it stopped laughing. Your voice rose and you grabbed the wooden holding of the guillotine. Your strong Arms and sharp teeth digs in the wood and the thin, only for holding and lead the blade constructed wood, crackles and breaks and with a loud screams of the other wooden bar, falls now the guillotine down and slams on the ground, shatters. You stand during this on the stock and stare in the now more feared faces of the group. \"PEOPLE!\" you shout loudly. \"Nobody of us wants to be here and we are not spineless like this crazy guy thinks! We have our powers, our hands and will never break away away....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly started the group to smile and the Gatomon, you had hold in your arms before starts to yell, but powers yous leading, powerful speech, looking like a revolutionist, foot on the broken device and the light shines from over you, gave you a look like a hero and this feeling, to be not helpless, not be in the hands of a crazy guy, waved over and more and more of the group shouted at your speech, yelling to never give up and never will give in this torturous offer which isn't worth to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being was speechless and listen, was totally confused but in a way feeling proud that they not give up, not kneel to his rules because that made his teaching even more interesting. Now he had to break a will, the fighting will so the effect of his teaching will be greater as he had planned before. You, the Gabumon, turns around and stares now in the face of the mysterious being, in the cam which he used to watch. \"WE all will stay together! No one of us will ever pass and will be cowardly. You maybe teach us how ticklish we are, but we will show you, you have a fuck of a idea how bigger our courage is, how hard it will be to break down the will of fighting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this words, the being spoke evilly and laughing. \"Very well. A big speech but it will be useless. Then go on and take the challenges which waits at you all. We will see, how long your will will stay that good....\" With this words, the screen got out and the the door opens again and you goes out, proudly. \"Come on people! Let us kick him in his crazy, naughty ass!\" All shouted loudly \"YES! LET US DO IT!\" before they followed you along the corridor into a big hall, looking like a gym but around the gym are many restrains, chairs, stocks and pillories in many weird combinations. The voice joins again. \"Welcome in the running gym. Rules are easy: You all know the game of musical chairs. This is a slight different version of it.

Not too hard to find; you carry her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise! A tiny seat with a tiny pair of footstocks and a pair of clamps attached to the head. \"You know the drill,\" says the voice with a hint of a laugh. So, you set her on the stool, clamp her dainty little feet in, and cuff her wrists to the head. Her expression turns grim as she tugs at the restraints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gatomon, you have nothing to worry about. Your room has no way to kill you, and you will get a key by the time you are done here.\" She immediately perks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she smiles to the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. I am here to help you, after all. You have turned a cold shoulder to anyone who has tried to tickle you. Your friends, your family, and beyond. Didn't you even leave a pet on the street because he woke you up with a tickle one time?\" She hangs her head in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to tickle you for a while. It might take a long while, but I'll go easy. It will stop as soon as I am convinced that you love being tickled. There is no way to opt out at this point, but you won't need one. Plus, I want to see you tickled more. It's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last comment caught you off guard, but was oddly calming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little metal claw comes out from under the seat on a robotic tentacle. Gatomon eyes it until it crawls into her pit. Her curious eyes become pinpricks and her laugh is caught in her throat. It releases in a fit of giggles and she squirms around on her seat. The laughing lets up as the claw switches sides and starts digging into her other armpit. After a bit, the claw retracts and a single curious feather emerges. It lifts up to her face, wiggles playfully, and brushes along the inside of her ear. She meows agitatedly as it drags down the side of her face. The minutes tick by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mechanical hum startles you. Behind you, what resembles a metal easy chair slides out of the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're planning on staying this whole time, you might as well relax. You still have your own torment to look forward too, you know.\" You chuckle dryly and are mildly alarmed to find your captor to be laughing the same way. So, you sit. And the minutes keep ticking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth is parched now although you've only been in this room for a little under an hour. Wow, that long already? Your arm jerks back instinctually as a tiny hatch on the chair's arm opens. Much to your surprise and delight, a tall glass of orange juice emerges. You raise your glass with a chuckle to the camera in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, tiny feathers spin on Gatomon's heels. Her feet kick around wildly. \"Ooooo... THISISSOMUCHFUN!!\" You have a hard time believing her, naturally. Instead of sarcasm, you suspect a downright lie. Her kicking feet are hypnotic, and her laugh is contageous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Live or Die Laughing, Make your choice\". The Tape stops and the timer starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMMMM\" The bunny moans behind her gag and squirms. She then gets up and sees a hook on the chain with a clip so once she hooks the ring to it she can't pull it out she then leans back to pull on the chain she leans all the way back so she is lying again and the timer stops. As she is fully laid down the feather wheel activates and starts brushing the feathers across her soles. \"MMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMM\" she starts laughing behind the gag and sits back up which stops the machine she then looks worried as the 10 minute timer starts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What will she do?)</span></div></div>",
