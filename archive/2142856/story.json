First a guy dressed in a ninja costume breaks into Hanks house and swipes some tech from Pym, then Scott had to track him to Hells kitchen in New York where  he finds a lot more ninjas! Steal the tech back while avoiding katanas and shurikens, then watch when the devil of hells kitchen takes out every single ninja chasing him single handedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was astounded. He had heard of the guy just like most people, but seeing him in action had Scott wondering why he isnt a part of the Avengers! Scott shrank Pyms tech and stored it in his belt, then waljed towards Daredevil who was just finishing off the final ninja with a kick in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... hey! Thanks man uh thanks. You... you're Daredevil right?\", Scott asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaredevil looked up at Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont call the police. You'll just put them in danger. Scott Lang right?

And aside from having to pay for the repairs for his ex-wife's house, his life has been going pretty smoothly. Visits his daughter almost every day every week. Got a gig as a bodyguard to keep him fed and sheltered. And even has a little something going on with his mentor's daughter, Hope Pym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. Things were really turning around for Scott. And sitting there in a flower pot, on the ledge of a balcony on a high rise apartment, watching the sun go down, he was relaxed enough to take a little nap. Scott shuffled his butt across the dirt and sat up against the flower stem. He then removed his helmet, and began to doze off with a little smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BANG......BANG..BANG</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott jerked awake so fast he almost choked on his drool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell was that?\" he asked no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott placed his helmet back on and leaped off the plant onto the edge of the balcony. He peeked down to the street below, and managed to see two men running out of a alleyway, one armed with an M-16 assault rifle, and the other carrying a duffel bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. No rest for the wicked.\" said Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stepped off the edge and began to fall down to the pavement below. He was about 5 feet from the ground when he was caught by one of his winged ant friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice catch Antonio! Now, lets mess these guys up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robbers enter their car and drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA HA HA HA!!! WOOOOOO BABY!!! You see that bitch`s face back there?\" exclaimed the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before or after you blew it off? HA HA HA!!!\" replied his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I`m telling you man! I aint ever had a better job in my whole life. And once we get this cash to our guy, we`ll be able to buy our way in and live like kings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dont get cocky bud. Still gotta get from here to New York.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Have you no faith? We left no survivors and we left Smitty there. The cops`ll pin it on him. We`re solid! HA HAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is in New York fella's? Care to explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unfamiliar voice startled the criminals so bad, the driver almost steered off the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... Who`s there? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a hitchhiker pal, relax. Wanna be friendly and answer my question?.....now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey screw you asshole! Show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver pulls into an alleyway and they both step out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen prick! You better come out before I get really angry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! We dont want that now do we? Alright, I'm coming out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robbers stand in the alleyway, one primed with his rifle and the other holding a crowbar. Suddenly, the crowbar was ripped from his hand and slammed across his temple, instantly knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA!! What the hell are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man starts to open fire at nothing in particular, when feels a heavy, painful impact slam against his cheek, launching him against the wall. He drops his gun on the ground, and watches as it is dismantled into bits and pieces by nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who`s in New York? Why are you going there?\" the disembodied voice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ou.....ou.....our conterct.\" the punch against is face left his face numb and knocked a few teeth loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who`s this contact?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...dernt... I dernt know. He onry garve meh dith gard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber reaches his shaking arm into his pocket and pulls out a black card with a number on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1098? What does this mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pwease... I... I dent know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sighs, then he picks up the dismantled butt of the rifle and chucks it at the mans head. Scott grows back to normal and picks up the card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1....0...9....8. Not a very good clue. This looks like a job for a detective. First things first. Gotta get to New York.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott hails a cab and rides down to the San Francisco airport. Scott waits there to book a flight for almost two hours when he ultimately decides that being a hero should come with free flights, especially if this hero was on a business trip. He walks behind a hidden corner and shrinks down to half an inch. He then notices a group of stewardess walking by, so he walks in front of one of them, then hops onto her foot, climbs up her leg, leaps from her knee to her skirt, climbs up from there to her torso,where he settles inside her vest pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is taken aboard the plane by the unaware stewardess. Scott peeks his head out of her pocket and takes a look around. Did he really want to spend a 4 hour flight in this woman's pocket?</span></div></div>",

He couldn't help but feel she looked familiar, but he couldn't put his finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://unaffiliatedcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Trish-Walker-Rachael-Taylor-in-AKA-Ladies-Night.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://unaffiliatedcritic.com/wp-conten...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/bIBLgcQ47JkSk/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\">https://media.giphy.com/media/bIBLgcQ47J...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Trish Walker? Patsy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was ecstatic. He was a huge fan of her show 'It's Patsy' growing up. Which was probably why other guys liked to kick his ass. Her radio show was pretty good too... what was it called again.... Trish Talk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lady was Scott's childhood crush (when they were both young) and she had grown into a damn sexy lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Scott hitch a ride with her? </span></div></div>",

Trish's arm took up most the space so he had to side step a bit to get past her wrist. The ginormous silver wrist watch she wore ticked every second, emitting a booming echo after each one. Thankfully though, one of the features of Scott`s helmet was noise reduction. So the ticks sounded the same, but at a volume you would hear on a mediocre surround sound system cranked to half blast in your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott climbs up onto her arm and from there, he looks around for a good spot to spend the flight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scott scanned Trish's body for a (ahem)...hiding spot. And by some freak accident, his gaze meets Trish's chest area. But from Scott's position on her arm, he could only see underneath her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. I should probably get up high to... ummm...establish an uhhhh... overwatch position... and see what I see.... or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott wastes no time in running up Trish's arm to her shoulder, as she flips to the next page of her book. Scott walks over to her neck, pushing aside the cascade of blonde, silky hair in his way, until he, trips over something and bumped into her neck. Scott shakes his head and looks behind him, noticing a part of Trish's black cord necklace and her chain necklace in front of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking ahead, Scott can see Trish's book open before him. Scott looked at the words on the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This aint half bad. Its been awhile since I read a good book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott couldnt see the book too clearly through the rogue strands of hair in front of him, so he decides to slide down Trish's necklace down to the pendent. He should get a perfect view from there. But hopefully he can keep up with her when he gets to reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott crouches down and grabs onto the cord necklace, then begins to rappel down Trish's chest. He pushes off her skin with each jump, and each jump, his feet sink slightly into her flesh. Scott finally reaches the pendant that rested just above Trish's cleavage, and sat down. He starts to read with her, but he couldn't get that thought out of his head. The thought that he was literally an inch away from this gorgeous woman's tits, and he could dive right in without her ever knowing. No sexual harassment lawsuits, no bad press, just the pleasant memory that most men could only dream of.</span></div></div>",

Saving kittens, shaking Caps hand, playing superhero with Cassie. You`re her father man. You can`t be the kind of guy who does this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott takes a deep breath, then leans up against Trish's skin, and reads with her. He somehow was barely managing to keep up with Mrs.Speed Reader, as she flipped from page to page. By now, two hours had passed of straight reading, and it was then that Trish decided a nap was due as she closed her book, nestled herself in her seat and dozed off, resting her head on her shoulder. Scott however... was way ahead of her, as he had dozed off half an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some miracle, Trish squirming didn't cause Scott to fall into the abyss that was her cleavage, but he is now slumped over the pendent like if you were to slump a dead guy over a horse, still passed out. Eventually though, as Trish's chest expanded and contracted with her breath, Scott's limp body began to slip off the necklace. Little by little, with each rise and fall, he slipped farther and farther until he was dangling by a leg due to his foot getting snagged between the pendant and the cord of the necklace. Scott slowly regains consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Yaaaaaaawwwwnnn) That was a damn good nap.... there is something different going on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looks up at his snagged foot just as it pops loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott enters into a free fall towards Trishs left boob. He collides against it, sending ripples through her flesh and causing him to bounce off like a trampoline and enter into another free fall down towards her lap. Scott lands on her black jean clad legs (specifically her thigh) and he rolls a little bit before coming to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-Lee-Heeeeeelllll!\" Scott grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggles to his feet and stretches his battered (and still sleepy) limbs. After hes done popping and cracking his bones. He looks back up at Trish's face far above him. She was definitely still asleep, but for how much longer? We had to be arriving soon. Scott remembers Trish was wearing a watch on her left wrist, so he looks around and spots it on her knee on the leg next to him. Scott walks to the edge of her thigh and jumps the gap to her other one. He then walks down her thigh to her knee, where he clambers up to her resting hand and stands on a knuckle. From here, Scott grows to one inch to be able to read the time.</span></div></div>",

He looks up at her ear, slighlty concealed behind her hair. Because Trish had rested her head on the opposite shoulder Scott was on, Scott just simply walked up the side of her neck until he stood on her earlobe. Scott shrunk back down to an eighth of an inch then dived inside her ear canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott fell deep into Trish's head until he landed on her ear drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Trish yelps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was jolted awake from a sudden pain in her ear. Trish then stuck her finger in her ear and started rubbing to sooth the pain. As she is rubbing, Trish spots a couple of people on the seats opposite to her just staring at her.

I stopped some killer robbers and one of them gave me a black business card with the numbers, 10, 9 and 8 on it. Nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott feels Trishs neck straighten up, like what you do when you figure out an answer on a tough math question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know those cards. I friend of mine took one of a serial killer a few weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. I serial killer? Who's your friend?\" Scott asked, now laying in her ear like a hammock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want. I can take you to meet her myself. Sounds like you guys are chasing the same crook.\"</span></div></div>",

As long as you and your friend can handle yourselves in the criminal underworld.\" Scott joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Don't worry about us. We've had some experiences in that environment... and worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was a little off put by that last part. He wondered what she meant, but thought it best if he didnt ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that settles it. Scott \"the ant man\" Lang and Trish \"Patsy\" Walker, crime fighting duo. Oh, and your friend of course.\"said Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast little guy. My friend isnt a \"working with others\" type. This could take some convincing.\" Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she wants to get these guys before even more people die, I'm sure she'll accept some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the plane had landed and everyone was starting to depart. Trish stood up and opened the overhead bin, then took out her black traveling bag. Scott watched from inside her ear, as the couple who gave her weird looks earlier were now staring at her as she walked down the aisle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both black. The man was wearing a black new york islanders ball cap,brown leather jacket, black undershirt and dark blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was in more summer atire. Wearing sunglasses, a sleevless grey shirt, beige short shorts and sandals. She also had a pattern tattooed on the top of her forearm to her bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with those people?\", Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\", Trish replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The couple who were in the seat next to you. They wont stop looking at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh them! Yeah that would be your fault. You made me yelp when you smacked my ear drum. What was that for anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasnt on purpose.\", Scott was now leaning outside Trish's ear, trying to keep his eyes on those people but her hair was blocking his view. So he grabbed onto some of her lucious locks and started climbing to the top of her head. When he made it, he found that he was to small to see above the hair, so he grew to a half an inch tall, so he could at least peek his eyes over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish didn't feel Scott when he left her ear, but she did feel him on her scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. ...Scott? What you doing up there?\", Trish asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im keeping an eye on those people, they are still staring at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Trish was starting to feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they following me?\", she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far... yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish was walking to the airport entarnce where she had a car waiting for her, and the couple were still tailing her. She starts to pick up the pace a bit. And they match her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Im positive they are following you now. They just started speed walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Enough.\", Trish says angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she turns sharply to into the entrance to the staircase, and goes up to the very top where a door to the roof is located. Trish grabs the handle and tries to turn it, but its locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ant man. Little help?\", Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott leaps off her head and lands on her thumb which was on the handle. He then goes into the lock and busts it open. Allowing Trish to open the door. As Trish walks outside, Scott jumps onto her lower back as she walks by, and climbs up to her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\", Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We beat the crap out of them until they tell me why they are following me.\", Trish snaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if their just fans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They arent.\", Trish says dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly busts open and the couple walk out holding hand guns. Scott acts fast by leaping off Trishs shoulder right at their weapons. He lands on the womans pistol and runs along it until he leaps off the hammer and onto her arm. Scott lands on the womans threaded bracelet, then runs up her tattooed arm until he reaches her shoulder. Scott was so fast that she only now realized he was even there, as she turned her head to look down at him. A big mistake, as Scott now had a clear shot at her nose. Scott lands a direct hit and the impact sent her colliding into her partner, knocking him to the ground but not disarming him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man starts to get up, but Trish kicks him in the jaw, knocking him out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The night sky filled with stars, and the streets below illuminated by the city lights, Scott wanted to this to last forever. That is until a bat swoops in from above almost taking his head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!! Big bat! Big bat! Antoinette! Evasive maneuvers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant dove down to the streets below at alarming speeds. If it wasn't for Scott's helmet, his face would probably be blown of his skull. Okay, maybe that's exaggerating a bit... but it still wouldn't be a pretty sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ant flew down past buildings and swerved under street lights, behind trashcans, under peoples legs and in front of moving cars... but this bat was one determined and skilled hunter. It remained on their ass through it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. That's one badass bat! Alright Antoinette. Take us high. I got an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flew back up into the open air space above the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in to position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott then leaps off his ant at the bat, he then grows to normal size, grabs the bat, and chucks it away, scaring it off into the night sky. Scott then shrinks back down and lands back on the back of his ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good catch! We make quite the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott scratches the back of Antoinettes neck then brings her back down to street level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think its time for a rest Antoinette. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responds with a soft purr, then flies over to a payphone booth and lands ontop of it. Scott gets off her back, then grabs the bag he attached to her thorax. He reaches in ten pulls out a shrunken loaf of bread for Antoinette, and a turkey sub for himself. They sit on the phone booth and eat their meals when....</span></div></div>",

Then he turns around and picks up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen buddy! You just cost me a turkey sub! Why the hell would you call here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get a hold of you Mr.Lang.

Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the doors to the booth shut, and a steel shield rises from the ground, encasing Scott inside. The phone booth then falls through a trap door and starts sliding down a chute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was starting to get motion sick, but before he could spew, the booth suddenly comes to a stop, and the doors and steel open up, revealing ceiling lights shining down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott slowly sits and peaks out from the horizontal booth he was currently in and scans the room. It was a mostly empty room, with a few crates and tables scattered around. He also saw a elevator door at the end. Scott looks back at the chute and see`s that it has been sealed, so that was not an option of escape. He saw no air vents, sinks, nothing... just the door at the end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott steps out of the booth and shrinks down, then starts running across the floor to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr.Lang? Please stop what you are doing. We only need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn intercom? Where? Scott couldn't see anything yet he heard the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said before. Just your help. My name is Agent Phil Coulson.

Please, just revert back to normal and let me explain. I'm coming in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens, revealing Agent Coulson with his hands up. He steps out, looking straight down at Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm unarmed. I just want to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looks up at the giant man. Though they did have a certain reputation, Scott couldn't ignore all the good they have done also. And besides, he saw no other way out and he wasn't going to attack an unarmed man. Scott grows to normal size and stares at Coulson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil lowers his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. One of our... agents..., Daisy Johnson.

Don`t know how many are inside but we can assume there are just as many until we get eyes inside. Fisk isn't known for his trust and humility. If he heard the about the amount of goons A.I.M was sending, you can bet he would match it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing Kingpin is known for nowadays is his world record for most chins on one person. Am I right? Eh Khanie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a giggle from anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat jokes? Really Nova? It`s 2017. Get with the times boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy?! We're like the same age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viv's right. Settle down. We happen to be on a mission right now. A STEALTH mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova turns to the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not exactly the ninja type big guy. Green doesn't blend too well in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you! You wanna switch off those glowing circles on your shirt Nova?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting to that! Zip that lip Nadia, we happen to be on a stealth mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" A sharp, commanding stage whisper is heard in front of the arguing group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stops and looks at Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all asked for me to be here so I could try to teach you how to be effective in stealth. Rule number one? Shut your fucking mouths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all stare at her in shock. She had quite the reputation for being fearsome in combat and not being the kindest of people. But no one told them how scary she was when she was annoyed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From here on out, you will atleast pretend to know what you're doing, and you will listen to every word I say. You want to do this right and not get killed? You better stop acting like children. Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continue to stare at her, wide eyed and speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura steps forward and grab a fistful of the young boy's Spiderman outfit. Throwing the tiny girl on his shoulder forward onto her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I repeat myself?\" Laura growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...no...no ma`am. I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Miles.... And the rest of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am yes Ma'am!\" They say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura lets go of Mile's shirt, while Nadia balances precariously with one foot on her index finger and the other on her middle finger. Laura looks down at the shrunken rookie on her hand and raises her eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nadia? You mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yes!...sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia leaps off Laura`s fingers and hovers in the air next to the five other's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese young heroes were known as The Champions.

But I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Lets move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone jumps off the roof and heads towards their positions. Leaving Sam to be pissed alone. Then he slowly flies high up above the warehouse, and hovers there with a pouty look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Nadia grabs onto Viv and Amadeus and shrinks them down to an eighth of an inch along with her. Viv grabs onto Amadeus and flies alongside Nadia towards the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to be universal law that all Wolverines must have a stick in their butt.\" Nadia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Nadia. Laura's a hero. And considering her past, we're lucky she is'nt still an assassin.\" Said Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. Both Logan and Laura have had tragic pasts. And now that Logan is gone.

Lets just get this done.\" Nadia scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio flew into the warehouse and searched for their objective. The warehouse was filled with A.I.M soldiers and the Kingpins men. Each on opposite sides of the warehouse, and each side armed to the teeth. There was walkways high above them, with even more soldiers stationed there for an extra advantage if things got ugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the room... they saw a crate. And two people standing on either side of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio flew down to the crate and landed on the middle of  it,  continuing to stare at the two intimidating individual's. A woman stood on one side of the crate with Fisks men. And a man wearing spooky white armour stood with the A.I.M soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh guys? I think thats Elektra Natchios.\" Said Nadia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thats.... oh crap.... thats Ghost! These guys are hardcore killers.\" Said Amadeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well i dont think you get to be a superhero without beating a few killers. Just hope Daredevils okay with us kicking Elektras ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is supposed to be a stealth mission. There will be no ass kicking by us here.

So Nadia follows her team mates into the crate, immediatly being engulfed in pitch darkness. She see's a green light moving around further down in the darkness. Nadia activates her headlamp on her helmet and point it towards the light. Noticing it was coming from behind a smaller steel crate.<br>\r\n\"A steel crate inside a crate? What is this?\" Nadia thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viv? Amadeus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nadia! Get down here. I think we found what we're after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia flew down towards the light, landing on the edge of the steel, she looks down and see's Viv's head poking out of a hole she recently made in the crate, with green light shining out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats in there Viv?\" Nadia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may want to see for yourself.\" Vivs head dissapeared back into the hole, and Nadia nervously followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jesus. Are these what I think they are?\" Nadia shudders after seeing trays full of test tubes with slick black ooze. Black ooze that was moving on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Symbiotes. Looks like hundreds of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cant let A.I.M get their hands on these. It would be a full on apocalypse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Whats the big deal? I mean... I heard one of these turned Spidey into a world class douchebag. But aside from old Venom and Carnage. They have'nt been a big threat. Fire and sonics is their weakness right?\" Amadeus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its hard to take them out when you dont even know they are there. And A.I.M will probably modify them. You've heard about Anti-Venom right? He cant be stopped by that stuff.\" Nadia states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless. We are getting these out of here.\" Viv cuts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nadia. If you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia knods, then motions for everyone to get out through the hole. She follows, then turns around and places her hands on the steel crate and shrinks it down to pocket size (atleast for her pocket).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Lets bail before they open this up. Viv grabs Amadeus and flies out of the crate with Nadia through  the crack on the top they entered in.  They exit through the crack, just as Elektra was taking a crowbar to it. They had to fly under her armpit to avoid getting hit in mid air, but they were soon on their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe A.I.M soldiers had closed the main doors while they were in the crate, so the trio decides to fly out through the back door. But they would have to navigate through a few hall ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they near the first hallway, they hear fighting and gunfire erupt from behind them. Looks like A.I.M wasnt to happy about Fisk wasting their time. At least thats what they would think happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez. That didnt take long for them to start shooting at eachother.\" Amadeus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enter into the hallway and start turning corner after corner. After they turn another corner, they collide into a yellow material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" \"Ow!\" \"Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nadia? Did you get the objective?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio hear Laura's voice and cone to the conclusion that they were on Laura's mask, on her forehead. They peel themselves off and hover infront of her face. They notice Miles and Kamala standing next to her aswell. Nadia moves closer to Laura's eyes and takes the symbiote crate out if her belt, showing it to Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we got it. Did you know what it was?\" Nadia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did.\" She doesnt hesitate to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are serious business. Why didnt you tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a danger to society. Thats all you needed to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura snags it from Nadias grip between her index and thumb and places it in her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets move. We dont want to risk getting caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura taps her shoulder as an invitation for the three tiny heroes to get on. Viv and Amadeus accept, but Nadia coldly ignores her, choosing instead to go to Miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia sits on Miles shoulder and crosses her arms. While everyone else looks at Laura. Laura notices, scoffs, then continues forward.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its just a feeling I have okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Laura had stealthily led the group out of the warehouse amidst all the chaos of the firefight. They were now back in the streets and had run to an alleyway. Where Laura stopped them, reached under a trashbag, and pulled out a burner phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back her mask and turned to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all did very well tonight. Now go home and get some rest. You've earned it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles and Kamala smile and wish Laura a goodnight as they start to climb to the rooftops.

So Laura motions with her eyes to the two tiny heroes still on her shoulder. Nafia spots them waving up at her. She gasps , flies down and lands on the shoulder, grows to an inch tall, picks up Viv and Amadeus in each hand, then takes off, while still ignoring Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good night Laura!\" \"Yeah, thanks for your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiles and lightly  waves at her two ex-passengers. Then starts to dial a number in the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia reaches the rooftop, where Mikes and Kamala were waiting for them. Nadia sets Viv and Amadeus down and grows them back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? You guys wanna hit a burger joint? Its 3 AM so im not going to sleep tonight.\" Miles says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you kidding? We're gonna follow her and see where those symbiotes are going!\" Nadia snaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Laura's taking care of it Nadia. Just relax. She's not as bad as you think. She was just mean so she could teach us discipline or something.\" Kamala says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So none of you find it weird that she not only told us what we were after, but that she pulled a burner phone out from under a trash bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We asked for her help! She didnt come to us!\" Miles says angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But she chose the mission! Look... all im saying is that we stick with her until we see where shes taking the symbiotes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick with her? You mean ON her? Thats totally invasive Nadia?\" Kamala says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On her? Well... uh... actually... i think Nadia may have a point guys.\" Miles says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your only saying that because you have a crush on her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looks up to see Nova hovering above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Raise your hand if you want to see what shes up to.\" Says Nadia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerself, Nova, and a hesitant Spider man raise their  hand.

We just got to be patient and keep an eye on those symbiotes.\" Nadia answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura then walks over to a wall and uses her claws to climb up to the roof. She flips onto the roof, when she suddenly hears voices. Laura turns around to see Ms.Marvel, Hulk and Viv standing on the roof opposite to her, talking amongst themselves and unaware of Laura`s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... hey guys.\" Laura says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stop mid speach and turn to her. Straightening up and smiling awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Laura!\" They say in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.... what are you three still doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uhhhh...

They were all on her left shoulder. Trying to hold in their laughter it looked like.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... we should have told her they were there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well if you want to catch up to her go ahead. Good luck tracking the Wolverine.\" Ms.Marvel says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three leap off the roof and head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the shrunken three were still on Wolverines shoulder, gripping onto the fabric of her outfit to keep them from flying off due to her acrobatics as she traversed the rooftops. Finally, she lands on a fire escape outside an apartment window. She crouches down, knocks on it, and about three seconds later, a little girl opens it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You`re late.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get food for Jonathan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get food for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lucky Jonathan and I went to the supermarket today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that I have you to take care of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ruffles her hair then steps inside and closes the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" Nova asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's her little sister Gabby. Well, shes technically a clone, but she came from Laura`s DNA so... lets just stick with sister.\" Miles replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n\"You sleepy?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Macbeth time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Go get it. I'm going to take this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby skips away to the bookshelf while Laura walks into her room. She removes her gloves and boots, tossing them onto the floor next to her closet. Then she starts to remove her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n\"Oh crap. Everyone off.\" Nadia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Nova hover off of the shirt, while Spider man jumps onto her neck. Laura pulls the shirt off over her head, revealing a yellow t-shirt underneath. They all meet up back on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is she wearing a shirt under her outfit?\" Miles asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone does. Its for if you have to take it off and want to blend in during a mission or if its freezing.... you mean your naked under that spandex?\" Nadia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Laura tossed her shirt in the pile with her boots and gloves, then removes her pants, takes out the shrunken symbiote crate, and adds it with the other clothing. She then puts the symbiotes in the pocket of the pants she wore underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura! Hurry up in there!\" Gabby yells from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss!\" Laura replies sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walks out and see's Gabby sitting on the couch holding a book. Laura walks over to her lifts her up, lies down on the couch, then sets her down on her. Gabby then hands Laura the book and snuggles up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\nLaura was lying down now, so the group had to get up and walk down to Laura's collar bone to avoid getting smushed against the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\nEventually, after reading a few chapters, Laura and Gabby fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11116/111167641/6097610-anw_laura-gabby.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n\"Well Nadia?

Yeah, it'd be gross but they'd have to traverse through that at some point in case there were symbiotes in Laura's bowels or belly. No need to let those alien pricks give Laura stomach pains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, they could always start somewhere else like Laura's mouth, nose, or ear.

Electra clutched her ear with her hand and groaned at the imense pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Electra. Would you mind not telling DareDevil about this? I promise not to tell anyone how dirty the inside of your head is!\" A voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get.... out.... of my....head.\" Elektra struggled to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElektra then felt a small sensation on the tip of her nose.

Let us pass please.\", Viv said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElektra, after a brief hesitation, ultimately agreed by nodding. Amadeus exited her ear canal and leaped onto Laura's waiting open hand, and Viv hovered up to join him. Elektra slowly rose to her feet and stood in front of the young heroes. Suddenly, in an instant, Elektra threw a pin-like object at Laura. It pierced through het suit and into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AGH!

Nadia flew over to Amadeus and Viv who were still in Laura's shoulder, picked them up and grew them back to their normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find somewhere to settle down and take a look at her. Any ideas?\", Miles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a hospital?\", Kamala asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was met with a few snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kamala. Get serious.\", Nadia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a spot in Brooklyn. Have it to myself right now. We could go there.\", Miles added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to get there quick! Me and Viv can do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team looked up and saw Nova flying down to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Can we get going now?\", Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia shrunk down Miles, Amadeus, Kamala and her self. Nova and Viv scooped up two each and placed them on their shoulders, while Viv grabbed Laura under her arms and flew off to where Miles told them to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it to Brooklyn shortly and went inside Miles safehouse. A small well kept apartement. Nadia regrew everyone and they sat Laura on the couch for Nadia to run a scan on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay uhhhh... not good.\" Nadia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Laura asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like...\"</span></div></div>",

I have added these characters with the same power to open up new narrative`s that would make more sense in the actual Marvel and Dc comic universe. For instance;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Nadia Pym originates from the all new all different era of marvel comics, it would make sense for her to interact with the new generation characters, like Laura Kinney (Wolverine) and the new Ms.Marvel. Same for Ryan Choi as the Atom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott Lang and Ray Palmer are free to interact with any character. You may even have them join together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric O`Grady can be used for the more devious shit in the marvel universe, like stalking and pussy diving and all that dirty jazz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank Pym as the Wasp can be used for the more street level heroes, like Jessica Jones, Trish Walker and Luke Cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame can be said for Bumblebee in the Dc universe. Such as the Teen Titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet Van Dyne is also permitted to interact with any charcacter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach character in their respective universe are free to interact with eachother. (Nadia Pym meets Scott Lang)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may also have characters cross over to each others universe, but make it make sense atleast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale giants are permitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to refrain from adding the same thing over and over. Dont make everything about nipple sucking and if you do, try to add an option that allows readers to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats about it. Please please please add and rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
